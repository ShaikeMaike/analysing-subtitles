WHEN THE SUN
BURNS OFF THE CLOUD LAYER,
THE TEMPERATURE
WILL GO UP SOME.
NOT ALL THE WAY UP TO FREEZING,
BUT WARMER THAN IT IS NOW.
LOOKS LIKE WINTER WHEAT WILL BE
A LITTLE HIGHER THAN LAST YEAR
AND HOG FUTURES
ARE ON THE RISE.
MORE THINGS TO HOPE FOR
AS WE WATCH THE SUN
CLEAR AWAY THE CLOUDS:
THERE WAS A REPORT IN
"THE VILLAGE GAZETTE" TODAY
THAT THE MAN KILLED
IN THE DOUBLE SHOOTING
AT WITHERSPOON MALL,
WAS A DEA AGENT.
BUT NOT TOO MUCH
IS BEING MADE OF THAT,
AS THERE HAVE BEEN RUMORS
THAT HE WAS EVERYTHING
FROM AN ALIEN TO A CUBAN SPY.
AND HERE'S ONE OF THOSE
ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIMES:
MARYBELL BLACK WON ALL
THREE SPECIAL CARD EVENTS

FEELING UNCOMFORTABLE
SHOPPING HERE.

Thank you.
What's wrong nothing.
I was just worried about quinn, that's all.
Quinn, would you please stop kicking the table
What happened on your last trip nothing.
Who's harry caine my sister just called, she said some guy named harry caine is looking for me.
He's got a picture of me and quinn.
WELL, DO YOU KNOW HIM no.
I thought maybe you might.
How would I know him
MAYBE YOU KNOW HIS WIFE.
Oh, my god.
KATE, HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT
HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK IT what am I supposed to think what, some complete stranger is just wandering around with a...
Family photo ever since you got back...
Something's going on.
I promise you, kate, nothing's going on.
I LOVE YOU.
I'm not afraid of the truth.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Who was that
WHO WAS ON THE PHONE
I have to go back to the station for a couple of hours.
I thought you wanted to stay home tonight.
Hey, buddy. You wanna go visit aunt gayle it's tuesday.
She'll be home by now.
What about dinner
I'll only be a couple of hours.
Quinn, honey, if you're done why don't you go wash up, okay what's going on
I can't help it, kate.
Something has come up.
Something's what why do you suddenly want us out of the house there's something
I have to deal with.
That you have to deal with have you done something you know there are things about work that I'm just not allowed to share with you.
I do know a harry caine.
Then why didn't you say something before should I be worried
I mean, who is he
I think he's part of an unfinished case.
Why is he looking for me
I DON'T KNOW IF HE IS.
Are we in danger
I would sooner die than to ever let anything happen to you.
Hi.
HI.
Are you alone excuse me
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME COMPANY
I'm married.
So, is your wife here
No.
Can I use your phone
Hi. It's me.
Yeah.
SURE.
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE NOT ALONE
I'm sorry.
Hello, peter.
Is there something wrong these kinds of meetings are dangerous.
I know, but this is important.
THERE'S A MAN BY THE NAME
OF HARRY CAINE HERE.
What's the problem he's asking about kate.
YOUR WIFE
DOES SHE KNOW HIM
NO.
But I think he's from wisconsin.
HAVE YOU HAD
ANY CONTACT WITH HIM
I wanted to talk about it with you first.
Do you think he's looking for you or is he looking for us no, that doesn't make any sense.
You see, if he knew of us why would he just come here and openly make inquiries like this
It was a woman.
HER NAME WAS CAINE.
Why did she have to be there right at that time it was just a shadow.
I didn't know.
You can't blame yourself, peter.
You only saw the threat to your life.
You knew.
We all knew and accepted the possibility of this event happening,
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING.
INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE HURT
AND KILLED EVERY DAY.
THAT'S THE WAY THE WORLD IS.
Yes.
Yes, we've talked about that.
But all that talk never prepared me for the reality.
I killed an innocent woman.
We have to keep our focus on our goals, our ideals.
Corrupt law enforcement is a cancer.
It eats at the heart and moral fabric of society.
Without law there is no order.
What you did was right, peter.
He was a corrupt cop and he's gone.
BUT THERE ARE OTHERS.
WE MUST KEEP OUR FOCUS.
So, where does that leave us
HE MAY BE ALONE, or they may be others.
FIND OUT WHAT HE KNOWS.
Peter...
I know how difficult this is for you.
BUT WE HAVE NO CHOICE.
I know.
I'll do whatever's necessary.
Would you prefer one of us taking care of this matter no.
Thank you...
But I created this situation.
Lounge.
Hold on.
Are you a mr. Caine yes.
THERE'S
A PHONE CALL FOR YOU.
Thank you.
Hello
MR. CAINE yes
MY NAME'S PETER.
Do I know you
NO, WE'VE NEVER MET.
I'M A FRIEND OF THE WOMAN
YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.
Oh.
SHE'S ASKED ME TO COME
AND MEET WITH YOU.
OF COURSE,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO MEET ME
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.
BUT SHE IS HOME
AND IF YOU WANNA SEE HER...
Yes, I'd like to meet her tonight.
GOOD.
I'M IN ROOM 503,
WHY DON'T WE MEET UP HERE why
WELL, A STRANGER COMES TO TOWN
LOOKING FOR MY FRIEND
AND NO ONE KNOWS WHO HE IS.
I'M SURE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
HER CONCERN.
I'm not looking to hurt anyone.
I just wanna talk to her.
GOOD.
I'M IN 503.
Pleasure to meet you, mr. Caine.
Please, come in.
SIT DOWN.
MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE.
May I see the photograph, please
I thought you were gonna take me to see your friend.
SHE'S EXPECTING US, BUT...
THERE ARE A FEW THINGS
WE NEED TO CLEAR UP.
Who gave you this photograph no one.
I found it.
IN KENWOOD PLAINS
HOW DID YOU KNOW I...
Who else has seen this picture no one.
Where's your friend why are you so anxious to see her
I need to talk to her.
WHY
I believe she can help me find someone I'm looking for.
Who is that someone who can explain why my wife was murdered.
What makes you think that
I'VE GOTTEN
THE INFORMATION.
Then you've had help from others no, not really.
I need to know why my wife was killed.
Is that all you need
And you really don't wanna kill this man
I'm not a murderer.
HOW DO YOU KNOW
Is it worth your life
I'm not living anyway.
Then let's go see my friend.
We'll take my car.
Did you know my wife
No.
You.
Why
Why
For god's sake...
Why
Oh...
I'm sorry!
No!
Why did you go after him
He murdered my wife.
I see.
He murdered your wife, so you went after him and killed him.
I never wanted to hurt him.
WHO IS "HE," MR. CAINE the name of the man you killed what's his name
I don't know.
Can I speak to you a minute, ed
We did an extensive search of the hotel.
AND THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE
OF ANY CRIME.
NO CRIME.
THERE WAS NO BODY,
MR. CAINE.
Not even the surveillance tapes show anything.
We know what happened to you.
YOU CAN'T CHANGE WHAT WAS.
WHAT USED TO BE.

You're late!
Can't get her to go to college with you, but you have to pack her shit.
That’s just pathetic.
He's a big dinosaur now, mom.
Pathetic is that you're not even going out with her anymore... and you still have to pack her shit.
You'll always have a room here.
- Bye, honey.
- Bye!
Don't get too busy to give us a call once in a while.
Bye!
That’s why you're not dating her anymore.
I forgot something.
- Bye.
- Love you.
Shut up!
- Hello? Where do I sit?
- Right here, babe.
- So where's the party tonight?
- Genius!
- I'm the one going to Harvard.
- So did the Unabomber.
Oh, my God!
We should at least try to meet people.
Why?
Good question.
She thinks she's hot.
She's not so hot.
She really isn't.
Thanks.
This is our last night together. Do you think we can do something else?
- I could probably think of something.
- Yeah?
I am definitely not cut out for the Greek life.
You'll be all right.
You'll join the swim team, you'll meet people.
Plus you've got Annie, your best friend, right here with you.
My best friend will be 2 thousand miles away, in California.
What are you thinking?
I'm picking it up.
Wait! I got it. You're thinking...
I'm thinking... I'm thinking...
I'm thinking my ass is getting wet!
I knew it was something about your ass.
I'm going to miss you.
I love being with you.
I miss you already.
Close your eyes.
If you ever want me... just come to this spot... and I'll be here.
One last kiss before they say good-bye.
- I think I'll puke.
- After that, can we go somewhere?
- I want to have some real fun!
- I'm ready for that.
- Let’s go to the club I heard about.
- What club?
I don't know. It’s out of town.
It’s kind of a moving party.
But I can't move.
Try not to act like a college boy because they're not allowed.
Come on, you guys, let’s do this thing. Come on!
Isn't this great?
I just can't control her anymore.
Look out!
Come on, let’s dance!
I want that blonde tonight.
Look at those ravers.
Come on, let’s go!
Come on, it’s time.
We're doing it!
Get off!
Annie, come on!
There is no light
- This is a church.
- One more minute...
All of a sudden, I feel that we are making a mistake saying good-bye.
Cassie, you know how I feel.
I don't care how young we are.
You're the one I want to be with, that’s it.
I feel that way too.
So we're lucky.
Most people never find that.
We have our whole lives ahead of us.
Right?
I can wait.
I know what I want.
I love you, Cass.
You've never said that to me before.
No one's ever said that to me before.
That makes two of us.
How do you feel?
You know.
Is there some reason you can't say it?
Like what?
Like maybe you're still thinking about Matt?
No.
No, it’s just...
I don't want to say it and then... have you leave me tomorrow.
- Okay.
- But I feel it.
Maybe tonight you should tell me how you feel.
I...
- What are you doing out here, man?
- Drinking.
I was going to go get Annabel, but now I think I'm going to...
Right.
All right. I'll get her.
It’s freezing out here.
Can you unlock it?
Here. Warm it up.
You're driving.
The darkness is here!
Harvard laid our serious financial aid for the brain cells you're trashing.
They're still my brain cells.
They don't know me yet.
Besides, I lied.
I'm not really drunk.
I'll miss you.
Sorry.
It’s not very fair, is it?
You know, Matt...
...I care for you, but then...
- Please.
Not the "I care for you, but..." speech.
I got that last summer, remember?
Yeah.
- I guess I'm just a bad loser.
- It’s not a competition.
Right.
Right.
Well, I'll settle for nothing less than friends for life.
- Deal.
- And one last kiss.
I'm sorry. I won't end the most meaningful relationship of my life... with a lousy handshake.
I'm not a business man.
All right, forget it.
I'm sorry I asked.
You know, sometimes you can be a real shit.
2O years from now, when you and Sean are married... and you're a mom with your rug rat children in your suburban home... do you think it will really matter whether we shook hands or kissed... the night we said good-bye?
One last good-bye forever, my former love.
A kiss.
And it 's in the past...
What a cold rain!
Sean!
- Where did you guys go?
- Nowhere.
- Sean, it 's not what you're thinking.
- Really? What am I thinking?
Matt just...
We were just talking, and he...
- Did you have fun?
- Oh, yeah. You?
Sean, don't walk away from me, please!
Sean?
Look, it was nothing!
I'm sorry!
If it was nothing, why are you sorry?
Sean, please, talk to me.
Hello? What 's the drama?
Yeah, Cass, tell Annabel what the drama is.
Come on, it 's freezing back here.
Come on.
Let’s go! It 's freezing!
I know what it looked like, but believe me, it 's not what you think!
Cassie, watch the road.
Will you talk to me?
Oh, my God! Cassie!
Cassie, break!
Can you hear me? Hello?
Anybody in there, can you hear me?
How much did you have to drink tonight?
Watch it now.
The loss of a young life is a most terrible thing.
...our beloved Sean will...
...for we have loved...
Matt 's taking me back to school.
Why don't you come with us?
I'm not sure I'm going back.
All right, class, remember.
This coming midterm, we'll...
Are you still thinking about Matt?
Maybe tonight you should tell me how you feel.
Cassandra?
Cassandra?
This test is critical.
Hey, excuse me.
I wasn't here last week.
Do you have a study guide?
Sorry.
How much did you have to drink tonight?
If you ever want me, just come right here to this spot...
Just come to this spot, and I'll be here.
Hello.
Maybe tonight you should tell me how you feel.
I love you, Cassie.
Cassie!
I've been out there pounding!
It took me 5 minutes to try the door.
Hello?
You look like shit.
- What have they got you on?
- It 's for headaches.
Zombie food!
Lovely, lovely.
You're not going like that, are you?
Going where?
To the club! Don't you remember?
God, Cass! We've got to get you ready, girl!
I have to study.
I have a midterm.
Everybody has a midterm.
Cass...
You remember when my mom died?
And went into, like... this black hole and...
If it wasn't for you...
You've got to get out of here, girl!
Join the living!
This is my friend, Raven.
Hello.
- Hi.
- I've got to pee.
Who's this?
He was my boyfriend.
He died three weeks ago.
He's here now... Sean.
Inside you and Matt... in the car that night...
He's afraid.
You're in trouble!
So, are you coming?
- No.
- Cass?
- Just go, okay?
- You wanted to meet people!
I'll call you later.
Don't run, baby!
You're mine, baby!
Cassie!
Hold on, Cassie!
Cassie!
Hey.
Welcome back to the world.
What happened?
You fainted.
Some priest brought you here.
He was walking around outside like somebody died. Scared me.
I'm supposed to keep an eye on you. It sucks, but... somebody's got to do it.
Not me.
What about Harvard?
It will be there when I get back.
The doctor said you can go... but they want you to come back to do some tests... to make sure it has nothing to do with your injury from the accident.
- Is there something wrong?
- They're just covering their asses.
You know doctors.
They love tests.
Well, I hate tests.
I borrowed your keys and I did a little shopping.
That 's incredible!
You're so sweet.
- And there.
- Thank you so much.
I talked to Annie.
She said you're not doing so well.
- Do you want to talk about it?
- He shouldn't have died that night.
It 's not your fault.
Yeah... I think that it was our fault.
Because if it wasn't for us then
Sean and I wouldn't have fought... and I wouldn't have lost control of the car!
Those guys we hit were trashed.
They did a18O right in front of us.
There's no way you could've stopped.
There's no way anyone could've stopped.
Matt, it 's not that I miss him.
I saw him!
You saw him?
- Tell me exactly what happened.
- I was running... and someone put their hand on my shoulder... and they turned me around, they said my name...
- It was him.
- Why were you running?
Do you remember that guy from the club that night?
The one that grabbed me when me and Annie were dancing?
- Yeah, you shoved him.
- He's here, he's on campus!
No, he's not, Cassie.
Sean isn't either.
You know that, don't you?
You could've died that night too!
- But I didn't, did I?
- No, and you feel guilty about that.
- What about school?
- I'm not going anywhere.
But Harvard is, like, your life, you know... that 's all that matters to you, it always has been.
You're all that matters now.
Shit!
Hello? What's the drama?
Cassie, watch the road.
- It's included.
- What's the cranial pulse?
Well, Cassandra... the tests indicate you have a hemorrhage.
We're going to relieve the pressure on the right part of your brain.
I want you to breathe normally... and count back from 1OO.
Feeling better?
You're the one that saved me.
You're the priest?
I try not to wear my collar when I'm around here.
I do volunteer counseling once a week.
My name is Jude.
- Cassie.
- Hi.
I've got a minute before my next appointment. You want to sit down?
Sure.
So...
Do I call you "father"?
I'm sort of a lapsed Catholic.
I think all Catholics lapse once in a while.
Probably especially during midterms.
Yeah...
I've sort of been having a rough time, actually.
I lost my boyfriend recently.
Can I ask what happened?
Car accident.
I was driving.
It was really sudden, and there was something that I wanted to tell him.
But I never got the chance.
It 's... difficult to be a survivor.
But you've got to remember... that it 's up to God who lives and who dies.
I know it sounds crazy, but... sometimes I feel like he's still here with me.
I mean, really here.
Like he's not gone yet.
Maybe he is still with you.
Oh, that 's my friend.
I've got to go.
Well, feel free to come by anytime.
You're going to be okay.
- All right.
- Bye!
Hey!
- Didn't mean to interrupt confession.
- You didn't.
Come here,
I want to show you something.
Come on, come on.
Alright. You can kick all their asses at the free style.
Matt...
I just want to see you in a bathing suit again.
Come on, I've got another idea.
It was about time!
We saved you a roller.
I'm a brush chick.
Here.
There's more paint on my shirt than you have on your walls!
Here.
Oh, my gosh.
- So how's Raven?
- Interesting.
- Talks about you a lot.
- He does?
Raven thinks you're not really here with us.
He says you're still kind of with Sean.
Maybe I am a little.
Do you feel that way too?
You know how I feel more than anything?
That I'm finally free. We're on our own for the first time, Cass.
We can do anything, no boundaries.
Don't you feel that way?
I wish I did.
Don't worry.
We'll get you there, Cass.
Cassie?
Cassie, what is it?
Cassie, it 's okay!
What happened?
It 's okay!
It 's nothing, sweetie.
Hey.
- What are you doing?
- We're going out, right?
Because I feel like dancing.
- We said we'd stay in tonight.
- Yeah, well, now...
I want to go out.
Fine. I'll see you guys later.
Matt, let her go.
I want to sleep.
Why are you doing this?
Is everything okay?
Hey, there.
I miss you. I'm sorry.
- It 's okay. Just hang in there.
- I want you.
Make love to me!
Matt?
Hey.
What 's wrong? You don't look so good. I'm going to get your pills.
- We didn't... Tell me we didn't...
- What?
Tell me we didn't sleep together last night.
You don't remember?
No.
- What happened?
- You said you missed me, that you...
What?
Annie?
Hi.
- Okay, I get it.
- No, Annie, it 's not what you think!
Stop it, Cass!
I'm quicker than that.
Not as quick as you, though.
- Annie, let me just...
- Let me talk to her.
Sudden, don't you think?
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- It 's not what you think...
I can't even believe you.
Get away from me.
Hi.
Cassie?
Listen to me. I can't talk to you if you're afraid.
If you want me to leave you alone,
I will. I'm not going to haunt you.
This can't be happening!
You came here... because I said that I would be here.
So here I am.
It 's okay.
It 's really you.
I miss you.
It 's okay.
Come on.
I must really be crazy.
You're not crazy.
I'm here.
Don't let go, don't let go.
Come with me.
Where?
Away from here.
The guys are going to keep tracing you.
Cassie?
I want you with me!
Do you love me?
I don't want to die!
If you stay here, you're going to die.
Cassie.
Cassie!
I've been looking all over for you.
Cassie, let me explain.
Look, you called out, you said you missed me... and that you wanted me to be there.
You said, "Make love to me".
I thought you had feelings for me again.
I'm so sorry, Cassie.
I was wrong.
Tell me how I can make it up for you. I'll do anything.
I just need to be alone for a while.
Cassie?
I just need some time.
Annie!
- What 's wrong?
- This guy was...
This guy was chasing me.
He was trying to...
- Who was chasing you?
- I don't know.
I think it was one of those weird guys from the club.
He had a scar on his face, and he had long hair...
- Oh, God, I was so scared.
- All right, you're in a safe place.
You don't believe me!
I'm worried about you, Cassie.
I think you should talk to someone.
You think I'm crazy?
I am not crazy! Everyone else is!
Nobody is chasing you, Cass.
I saw what I saw.
Why don't you believe me?
I believe you believe it.
But I also think you haven't accepted what 's happened yet.
So it 's like it 's still happening to you in your head.
I want to help.
I love you.
- Matt, I don't...
- No, it 's okay.
You don't have to love me back.
Just let me take care of you.
I'm going to go get your medicine.
Hi, mom, it 's me. Can you call me as soon as you can? I need to talk.
How did you get in here?
I copied your key while you were in the hospital. Here.
You need to get some rest.
There were two girls in the locker room. They didn't see anybody.
Do you always get here before everyone else?
No, I'm trying to get my time down.
I have first meets Thursday.
You had a pretty serious head injury in that car accident, didn't you?
Dr. Haverston?
Excuse me.
Hi. Why wasn't my grade posted with the others?
There is no grade for this kind of test.
- Wait!
- Cassie.
Cassie?
Cassie?
Come in, come in.
Sit down.
Let 's see now...
What 's wrong?
Everything.
Everything's wrong.
I don't know what 's happening to me.
You feel alone in a world that you don't understand.
You don't know who to trust.
But you're trying very hard, I know that.
How do you know?
Because you're not the first person to be here.
And I promise you, that whatever happens, you'll find your way.
You just have to be strong.
I don't want to be strong.
I'm so tired.
Lie back, Cassie.
Try and rest.
I want you to have something.
This is Saint Jude... one of those guys that they made you learn about in Sunday school.
He looked after people that were lost... and that 's who my father named me after.
I'm so tired.
Rest.
Thank you.
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm looking for Jude.
- Who?
- A priest.
I don't know his full name. Jude?
- Father Jude?
- Yeah, do you know where he is?
Sit down.
- I really can't stay.
- Are you a member of the church?
No, I met Jude when
I started school this fall.
Is there something wrong?
I can't stay.
I really need to find him.
- What 's your name?
- Cassie.
Well, Cassie, perhaps there's been some confusion, but...
Father Jude was head of the church here until he passed away in 1981.
I don't understand.
Well, I don't either.
It must be a different priest.
I need to find him. I'm in trouble.
Maybe there's something I can help you with, Cassie. But first...
I really need to know if you're a member.
What the hell are you doing?
Go, Cassie! Let 's do it!
Hang in there, Cass!
You're going to make it!
All right, Cassie!
Incredible!
You looked like you were in trouble, but you pulled it on. Nicely done.
Yeah! What got into you?
I saw Sean.
And that guy with the mask from the club.
- What guy?
- And the one with a scarred face.
I saw you talking with him.
He went back there.
What do you guys do there?
- What 's going on?
- Nothing's going on. Take it easy.
I did go back. I went back to tell those guys to leave you alone.
Yeah, but I saw him at school with you.
You're paranoid.
You're hallucinating.
And I saw you with Raven that day at school and...
That 's it, okay?
We've got to get you out of here.
We'll hop in the car, drive you to your folks. We'll drive all night.
No.
Come on! We'll make a little road trip out of it. It will be fun.
I'm not going anywhere with you.
This whole thing with Sean is screwed up. You're screwed up.
Let us help you, Cass.
Just come with us.
No.
Sean's not coming back! You want to be with us or with him somewhere?
- Take it easy.
- I'm sick of waiting for you to decide.
You're with us or you're not!
- What is that supposed to mean?
- It doesn't mean anything.
You want to stay here, don't you?
That way you get it all, I mean... you get Sean, Matt and you get everything, and we don't get shit!
That 's enough!
- Raven was so right about you.
- Stop it!
Look, I know you're angry at me about Matt and about Sean...
- Please...
- People from the club are dangerous.
- Those people?
- One of them tried to kill me!
Isn't that ironic?
What?
You're the murderer.
Cassie!
- Annie! Oh, God, I'm so sorry!
- You're going to die.
Annabel! Let 's go!
Trick or treat!
Let 's go.
I need to go back and get my stuff, and then I'm going home.
Okay, I'll drive you to your parents.
- I'll be right out.
- I won't let anybody in.
Matt?
Matt?
Hello?
Got you!
Wait. Come back!
Cassie, are you okay?
Wait, it 's me. It 's me.
It 's okay!
He tried to kill me.
He's back there and he's dead.
- What is it?
- I killed him. He's in the water.
What are you talking about?
I was just up there.
There's nobody up there.
I promise.
I promise, there's nobody up there.
Come on.
There's nobody up there.
Come on!
There's no one out here.
He was here.
He was right there!
Take me home.
Take me home to my mom.
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.
What are we doing here?
You said you'd take me home!
I am, take it easy. I'm just going to go get Annabel. Then we can go.
I'm not leaving her here.
- I'm not going in there.
- Fine. Stay in the car.
Wait!
Matt!
Welcome to the party, Cass.
We're getting out of here!
I'm not going anywhere.
I like it here.
- Annie?
- Let her go.
- She belongs here now.
- Go back to the Addams family!
Your friends are not your friends anymore, Cass.
You belong to Sean.
Go now, while there's still time.
- Jeez! What are you doing?
- When you kissed me that night... it wasn't just good-bye.
You liked it.
What are you talking about?
Let 's get out of here!
How do you think I feel when
I gave up my first semester... to take care of you, and you haven't even said thank you?
What? Let 's just get out...
- How did you hurt your hand?
- How do you think I feel... when I'm here for you, and you're still hung up on a dead guy?
Let me go!
You kill me, Cassie.
One last good-bye forever kiss is all I want.
Get off me now!
When are you going to wake up?
Why do you think Annabel hates you?
Sean is the only one who didn't betray you, and you killed him!
Sorry...
God.
Annabel?
It 's her.
Miss?
I... I killed them.
I killed them.
Cassie, hold on.
Hold on.
I killed them.
No, you didn't.
- Don't leave me.
- I won't leave your side.
Stay with me, Cass.
I'm here. I'm right here.
Stay with me.
Look at me.
Look at me. I'm right here.
Stay with me, Cass, stay with me!
Your tests indicate you have a hemorrhage... as a result of your accident.
Why wasn't my grade posted with the others?
There is no grade for this kind of test.
Mom!
Mom!
Miss?
Try to take it easy!
Don't be afraid.
You have to fight.
Eternal father, I offer you the precious blood... of your divine son, Jesus.
Eternal rest grant onto them.
And let perpetual life wash over them.
May they rest in peace.
I'm dying.
Fighting!
You're very strong, Cassie.
But all this time...
It 's been another kind of time.
It 's like a dream that your mind is creating... to keep you from waking up to what you're not ready to accept.
- You're fighting.
- They said that you were dead.
I fought my own fight years ago.
And I know that even a dream of life is better than facing death.
But what about Annabel, and Matt, and the others?
They're lost.
- Sean?
- He survived.
I loved him very much.
- I don't want to die.
- Lf you were to die... so that he'd live, would you feel absolved?
I would.
I would die for him.
Do you love him enough to live for him?
I don't want to die!
Sean...
Sean!
Sean?
Sean, I'm sorry.
It 's okay, it 's not your fault.
I never told you.
- What? Tell me now.
- I...
Love...
I love you.
I love you too, baby.
You made it, honey.
You made it!
We told you to hang on, and you did!
We told you not to leave us!
How long have I been here?
It 's been two days.
Sean kept talking to you all the time saying...
"Don't give up.
Keep fighting."
I know. I heard him.
I heard all of you.
I heard all of you.
Oh, thank you.
Pretty peaches.
-How you been?
-l`m pretty good, l reckon.
You had any health problems since l saw you last?
-Ma`am?
-Have you been sick?
-Back`s been hurting a little.
-No, it`s not your back.
Have you been bleeding somewhere?
Yes, ma`am, a little. Yeah.
Have you been to a doctor? l don`t much like going to no doctors.
Well, l think, maybe you should go.
No, it`s not a venereal disease. lt`s some kind of kidney or some...
...bladder infection. But it`s been around for a while.
Could lead to some more serious problems.
Do you want me to call a doctor for you?
-All right.
-Okay.
You kids get on to bed now. lt`s nearly 9:00.
Ah, mama, can l stay up just a little bit?
No, you heard me, mister.
Mama? What does
``fuck`` mean? lt`s a bad word, hon, for something nice.
But what does it mean?
Well, it means making love. lt`s how your daddy and me...
...made your brothers and you.
Take his turtles off, hon.
-Mike, did you hear me?
-What? l said get to bed.
Oh, Mike, your lip`s dragging the floor.
-You act like l`m a kid.
-You are a kid, honey.
Valerie, you may as well take your glasses off...
...l know he`s been hitting you again.
-l see your lip.
-l know. lt just embarrasses me. lt`s okay.
Take them off.
He got worse. l went to the store yesterday,
`cause he`s out of some things...
...and he got home from work early, before l could get back.
He was waiting with a razor strap.
My legs are all cut up and l got...
...welts the size of footballs on my back and my legs. l feel guilty, you payin` me money to tell you...
...to get away from him.
You got to get help!
Legal help.
You don`t know Donnie
Barksdale, Annie.
He`ll kill me if l leave him.
He`ll find me.
He said he would.
No, he`s not crazy enough...
...to kill anybody.
He`s just an insecure redneck.
What? l think he`s got a woman on the side.
Yeah, he`s been laying out at night.
Excuse me, but the school`s on the phone.
They say Mike`s in some kind of problem.
Mrs. Wilson. Hi.
Come on in.
Have a seat.
-Where... where`s Mike?
-He`s in the infirmary.
Now, it`s nothing to get worked up about. He`s fine.
He`s got a few, um... sit down.
He`s got a few nicks and bruises. l think he might have a pretty good black eye by tomorrow.
-He was in another fight?
-Yes, he was.
His grades are getting worse too.
How`s he doing at home?
Um, not much better.
He`s real distant.
Mrs. Wilson, l don`t pretend to be a psychologist...
...but it`s obvious to me that your boy`s got...
...a lot of anger in him.
Well, it`s about this time last year...
...his daddy passed away, he`s still real messed up over it. l never knew your husband. l understand he was a fine man.
Yes, he was.
Well, l don`t know how you feel about therapy, but...
Mike don`t need a... lf you think Mike needs somebody to talk to, l know...
Mike doesn`t need a therapist.
He can talk to me.
Well, Mrs. Wilson... do you think he will, though? l`m sorry, Wayne. l didn`t know you had anybody in here.
-Hi. Ruby wasn`t at her desk.
-Yeah, she`s out sick today.
Uh, Mrs. Wilson, this is
Jessica King, my fiancee.
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.
We`re just going to be a couple of minutes.
Uh, l gotta go anyway. l got people waiting.
Thanks a lot, Mr. Collins...
...l`m really sorry about all this. lt`s my job. He`s just a boy, that`s all.
You`re not that Wilson that`s a fortune-teller, are you?
-l don`t call myself that.
-Would you read my fortune? l`m pretty booked up.
Do you think we`ll live happily ever after?
What`s the matter?
You see something bad?
Of course not.
No, l`m sure you`ll be...
...real happy together.
Hey, Mrs. Wilson. How you gettin` along today? l`m fine, Buddy.
Except the fact...
...l just can`t keep my car door...
...from just flying right open. Can you fix it? l can get to it... about an hour or two.
Uh, you wanna wait?
Uh, no. l got to get home. l got people coming.
You just wanna leave it here and l`ll carry you on home? l can have it to you probably by
6:00. That gonna be all right?
-Yeah, yeah, that`s fine.
-All right.
-Buddy?
-Yeah? l`m a little low on money this week... l was just...
-Oh, don`t you worry about...
-No, really. l feel bad.
For all that you`ve done for me...
...l just think the world of you.
You`re about the only one l call a friend to me.
Thank you. l`ll get the truck.
Take your time.
How you been, Buddy? l`ve been having some, uh... bad thoughts lately.
But l, you know... yesterday l was feeling so happy.
-On top of the world.
-Good on you. l didn`t even feel like l needed my medicine. l took it anyway. l`m getting hooked on that stuff.
Well, l think you`re gonna have a lot of happy days, Buddy.
Yeah, you`re gonna get better and better. l believe you when you say so.
Buddy? Honey?
Honey, what`s wrong?
You have to tell me now. l`ll tell you, hon. lf l look into a blue diamond...
...and l think a negative thought...
...am l gonna die?
No...
...you`re not gonna die.
You`re not gonna die, Buddy.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Well, thank you, `cause if you had said ``yes``...
...l would have to kill myself before the sun goes down.
Oh, Buddy... oh, honey....
You don`t have to kill yourself, honey.
You know l`ll always tell you, Buddy. l`ll always tell you, Buddy.
You`re fine. You can always talk to me, Buddy.
-Don`t use that, honey.
-l feel embarrassed.
-l want you to have it.
-l can`t soil that.
-Buddy, l want you to have it.
-This one`s Ben`s..
He`d want you to have it.
-You all right?
-l`m all right. l can walk home. You don`t have to drive me.
No, l`m good... l`m good.
-You sure scared me, hon.
-No, l`m all right.
You just take it nice and slow.
Nice and slow.
Could l help you?
Yes, ma`am. l`m
Donnie Barksdale. l`m sorry to bother you so late...
...but l believe you know my wife Valerie.
Yes, l do. l know who you are.
Can l come in and talk to you? lt`s about my wife, something`s happened to her.
What`s happened?
-She okay?
-Well, no, she`s not, ma`am.
Ma`am, l promise. l`ll just take a minute.
All right.
What`s happened to her is she`s getting her head...
...filled full of shit...
...by a goddamn
Satan worshipper...
...or a damn good con artist. l know she`s been...
...coming over to see you and your damn voodoo.
You tell her bad things about me, don`t you?
You ain`t no better than a jew or nigger!
Do you know what this is? lt`s a voodoo doll. l`m gonna use this voodoo doll on you.
Some of your own medicine...
...if you don`t stop seeing my wife. l`m stickin` me a pin in this thing every night.
Go back to bed.
Everything`s fine. l bet you love those little children, don`t you? l bet they need their mama, don`t they?
What`s your name?
Get your ass out of my house!
Don`t you threaten me or my kids!
Now, what l do here is my business! lf your wife has any sense, she`ll leave you so far behind.
Now you get out of here before l have you thrown in jail.
Messing with the devil is gonna get you burned.
Everybody knows that. l`ll see you soon, boys.
Go back to bed.
Come on.
Something smells like cat pee. lt`s perfume, Ben and you`re not supposed...
...to cuss in front of appointments.
-Sometihng smells like cat pee!
-Be quiet!
He`s got a great sense of humor.
He loves you...
Valerie... no honey, you know, you shouldn`t be here. l`m sorry about the other night.
That`s okay, l can take of myself. l hate coming over here, but...
...really need to talk to you.
Maybe you could read for me...
...under a bridge or something all right? l`ll read for you, but you got to start listening to me. l can`t leave him.
Don`t you understand?
He`s gonna keep hurting you till...
...he puts you in the hospital. l don`t have anything to look forward to.
Maybe...
...you can give me some hope. l don`t know how to make myself any clearer.
-Annie, it`s him!
-No... calm down.
-l`call the law.
-You`re my friend, you won`t. l`ll deal with you later, you goddamn bitch!
You witch!
Get your ass in the truck!
That ain`t fast enough! l told you not to come here!
Get in.
Mike, you stay there!
What did l fucking tell you!
Mike, y`all bring miss
Francis her clothes!
Thanks, hon.
-Granny!
-Hey, Anabelle!
Granny, what are you doing here? l brought you some persimmons, hon.
Remember how you like persimmons when you`s little?
You`re not supposed to be here.
How`d you get here? lt ain`t far to walk.
That boy`s got your granddaddy`s eyes.
Well, hon, l better get back.
Looks like there`s a storm coming.
No, granny... it`s clear.
Annie, always use your instinct, honey.
Now you tell miss Francis l`ll be home by 9:30, okay.
-l love you too, mama.
-l love you too, hon.
-Be good!
-Bye, mama.
You ready? l don`t know why l let you talk me into this.
`Cause it`s time you quit living like a nun, that`s why.
You`ll be the prettiest girl here, next to me.
You still a married man? l don`t know about that.
-Oh, thank you.
-Thank you very much.
-Do we pay him now or...?
-l sign for it later. ls it good?
Annie, there he is.
Who?
That guy l was telling you about.
He`s right over there by the bar.
Don`t he just look like Antonio Banderas?
My God, he saw me!
Shit!
He saw me staring at him.
Get your cards out, quick.
Tell me if he`s gonna come over here. l don`t have my cards with me. l`m off duty.
-Hello, Mrs. Wilson.
-lt`s Annie.
Wayne, sit down. You`re blocking my view.
Sorry. You remember Jessica? l didn`t know you were a member of the Country Club. l`m not. l kind of tagged along with Linda.
-How nice. lt`s a great outfit.
-Thank you.
What`s Mike up to night?
He`s moping around his baby-sitter`s.
He`s a great kid. l was actually thinking...
...you should have him come down to school and...
Let`s not talk shop tonight, all right?
Let`s just have fun, okay?
-Hi there, fun-seekers.
-Hey, there.
-A dance with daddy?
-Of course l will, handsome. l don`t know if you know, uh Annie Wilson?
Yeah. l think l`ve seen you at church.
That is quite a dress, Miss Linda. l`m glad somebody noticed.
You want to give it a try?
No, l don`t think so.
No, thank you. l asked you to dance, not walk on hot coals.
When was the last time you danced? l think it`s so long, l`ve forgotten how to do it. l`ll make you look good then,
`cause l`m a terrible dancer.
Wayne? l`ll dance.
Good luck!
Missed your big chance.
Somebody might come in here. l guess you better fuck me fast.
You having a good time?
Me neither.
You seen Jessica around?
She up and disappeared on me again.
What do you think of Jessica?
She`s very beautiful.
About her, she`s just...
...so full of life.
We`re a little different in that respect. l`m used to tennis shoes.
This kind of reminds me when l was a kid. l`d have some many thoughts, just couldn`t count`em.
How`d you wind up in Brixton?
My husband. He got a job here at the cable plant.
What?
Did you know something was going to happen to him? ln an E.S.P. kind of way?
-Well, l don`t know...
-You don`t believe in it. l don`t know, l guess l just...
...l don`t believe there are any great mysteries in life. l kind of figure what you see is what you get. l didn`t know that there was going to be an explosion but...
...the night before, l had this real bad dream, you know. l dreamt that l was all by myself. That Ben...
Tried to stop him going to work the next day, but...
You can`t keep a good man from work, right?
You kind of remind me of him.
Wayne? l`ve been looking for you everywhere. l`ve been right here. l see...
Let`s go talk to daddy, he`s feeling real depressed tonight...
...that big deal he`s working on went bad.
We got a major crisis here Annie. Excuse us?
-See you later, alligator.
-Good night, boys.
-What`s that, hon?
-Blueberry muffins.
Whatcha doin` with muffins in your pockets?
Miss Francis cooked them.
But what are they doing in your pockets? l put them there when she wasn`t looking...
...l didn`t have to eat them.
Her blueberry muffins is terrible, mama.
Uh, y`all wait there a minute, take Ben, hon.
Mama, is everything okay?
-Yeah, everything`s fine.
-You sure?
Yeah, time for you to go to Bed. Come on.
He`s a buddy of mine. l don`t think that Donnie... l`m telling you it was him!
What makes you think he`d want to bust into your house?
Well, his wife, she`s a client of mine...
...and he thinks l`m trying to break up their marriage.
Are you? Listen, um,
Donnie`s high-strung.
You know, ain`t no doubt about that.
But l don`t think he`s the one that busted into your house.
Listen, l appreciate the coffee and everything. Take care. l just can`t get through a wall of some kind in my head.
Or my soul. l don`t even know the difference between my head or my soul. l think everybody has that trouble, Buddy.
Your daddy...
...when you were a little boy.
Do you understand that?
He seen me playing around with something like a toy...
...or something he`d just take it away from me.
Did he take other things away from you?
Why you hate him so much?
My daddy`s a good man. l don`t hate my dad.
He`s good to mama and me.
Every kid needs a hit with a belt sometime.
You got to try to get past this wall that you`re talking about.
You need to talk about your daddy!
Why l hate him?
You`re the goddamn psychic!
You`re the goddamn psychic! l think l better go. l have to go home, right now. l`m sorry l yelled at you. lt`s all right. l just need your help. l just keep thinking about that blue diamond.
You think about these things in your childhood, hon...
...and you face up to them, then l`ll be able to help you. l think you got to do some thinking on your own.
-l`ll help you there.
-Okay, you put it up there.
Hello...
You got a lot of pretty things.
You ever seen anybody skin a squirrel?
Yoi stick a knife in its belly and zip.
That`s what l`m going to do you and your children...
...you ever call the police again.
Mama?
-You`re not asleep?
-l don`t know.
What`s that bat for?
Don`t worry, honey. l`m just working on my swing.
How come we never go to the cementery and see daddy?
Well, we went out there, just last month on his birthday.
Honey, l`m real busy, you know that.
Well, it seems like you have time for a lot of strangers.
They`re my appointments, they`re not strangers.
They`re the ones that put food on our table.
But how come we don`t even talk about daddy?
Mike, l`m trying to read.
-Annie!
-Hey. l know why Kenneth King wasn`t in church today.
-Why?
-His daughter disappeared.
Jessica? What do you mean she disappeared?
Kenneth woke up this morning and Jessica wasn`t there...
...and her bed hadn`t even been slept in.
You think she ran off? l know her and Wayne were supposed to be married in June.
-She got cold feet.
-Maybe.
Maybe this will clear the way for you and Wayne.
What are you talking about?
Come on. l saw the way y`all were looking...
...at each other
Friday night!
-You had stars in your eyes.
-Oh, Linda, that`s nuts!
-Annie, love is nuts.
-Come on. Go home. l want you get some rest.
You look terrible, okay?
Bye, boys.
-l got to go.
-Bye, Miss Linda.
Missing girl...
...in Brixton since 4 days ago.
Ben, get your hand out of there!
That`s for y`all`s cake tonight.
What am l gonna ice the cake with?
-l like icin` Mama.
-l can see that, punkin.
Miller!
Would you go ask Miss Francis...
...she`s got another can of icing, please?
Where you going, son?
You wanna ride in the truck?
You know my wife Valerie?
She been around to see your mama lately?
Hey, boy. l asked you a question.
Get my hat.
You know, l feel sorry for you and your brothers. l mean, your mama being a witch and all.
She don`t stop her evil ways.
Some day somebody`s gonna burn her up.
And then you boys are gonna be without a daddy or a mama.
You all right?
He said mama`s a witch and they`re gonna burn her up!
Oh, he did?
Buddy, you better mind your own business. l intend to, Donnie.
Motherfucker!
Goddamn it! Fuck!
Look, fucker!
Shoot me! Shoot me!
Shoot me, you motherfucker!
Shoot me! Shoot me!
You all right?
Tuscan rouge!
What was l thinking? l want icin`, mama.
Hon, you`ve had icing enough to put you in a coma. l want to know where you all are every minute of the day.
Mike, l`m gonna start driving you and Miller to school. l wish daddy was here.
Well, he`s not, hon.
But mama is. Okay?
Eat your cake.
Hello.
-Uh, this is Kenneth King.
-Mr. King! lmagine you, uh...
...you heard about my daughter`s disappearance?
Well, Mrs. Wilson, l don`t believe in what you do...
...l`ll just be straight with you not only that...
...l don`t like it but we`ve got to the end of the road...
...and our investigation... looked under every rock...
...there is to look under and we`d like you to tell...
...what you can to help us.
Now, no hocus-pocus and chanting and carrying on.
But we know you talk to a lot of folks hereabouts...
...know a lot of folks business.
You might have heard something or something.
One of sheriff Johnson`s men found my daughter`s car...
...sitting out on the parking lot...
...of that Honky-Tonk called at Jay`s...
...but nobody that was there on Saturday night...
...admits to having seen her...
...l`m afraid she might have been kidnapped or something.
Oh, Mr. King. l`m sorry. l don`t know anything about your daughter`s disappearance. l think we were just hoping... ls there anything you can tell us? l could read for you.
That`s about all l could do. l need you to cut the cards for me.
Thank you.
All right.
You ready?
When were you getting married again, Wayne?
-June 20...
-We`re supposed...
-...to ask the questions.
-Shut up! Goddamn it!
Look, l have a hard time concentrating with more...
...than one person in the room. l`m staying right here. l`m the law and...
...l need to hear this.
Please, ma`am, just try to tell us what you see. l`m trying. All right. l`m picking up. lt`s like a...
...it`s a fence... like a split rail fence.
Do you know how many fences there are in this county?
...and some pillars, like with an opening going through.
And there`s lots of white flowers...
Yes, and, uh, is that where Jessie is? l`m seeing.
This is just mishmash. l told you this...
...wouldn`t lead to nothing. lt won`t. l can`t concentrate. l`m sorry, Mr. King. l really do hope you find your daughter...
...l`m just not the person to help you with this.
Hey, Butch...
And it was horrible...
...but that same chain that was wrapped around...
...her when she was floatin`...
...in my tree, it was the same chain that...
...l had in my dream. l don`t know... l just thought...
Dave?
Yes, sir? l could have sworn there was an eclair in there. l didn`t get it.
Tim was in a little earlier.
You saw all this in a dream? lt wasn`t just a dream. l don`t investigate somebody`s dream. l think she`s dead, sheriff.
And l think she`s in a pond.
What do you know about this you ain`t telling me?
You know, you can get in seerious trouble...
...with holding information.
-Sounds like a place you know?
-A bunch of places l know.
Split rail fence, a pond, a stretch of woods...
...every rawbone ol` boy in the county got that.
What about the fiddler?
Tommy Lee ballard plays a fiddle...
...but he wouldn`t kill no body.
-l`ve know him since he`s a kid.
-No, it`s not the fiddler.
Who are his neighbors?
Well, his closest neighbor would be...
...well, let me see here. l guess...
...well, his property borders, Donnie Barksdale.
Do you know Donnie Barksdale?
Tim! On the gate!
Did you get a search warrant? l want everything to be legal.
Didn`t have to. Got permission from the owner.
-Donnie Barksdale gave you...?
-His wife did. l told her it was routine.
Donnie`s gone fishing today.
Excuse me. Sheriff Johnson?
How much longer y`all gonna be?
Long as it takes.
You just said you`re gonna be a few minutes.
We`re going on two hours.
Pearl, l think l got something!
False alarm, it`s just an old bicycle.
None of y`all brought a thermos of coffee out here?
That day at school...
...you looked kind of strange at me and Jessica.
Did you think something bad then?
-Donnie called. l told him...
-Pearl! Shut your mouth!
Goddamn it, Pearl, what are you doing on my property? l`m on Sheriff`s business, l got permission from your wife.
You think l let that little ninny talk for me?
How`d your arm get all scratched up?
Stray cat. She didn`t like it when l killed her.
-Now what brought you here?
-Just routine investigation.
We`re checking all the ponds in the county.
-l knew it was you!
-No! l`m on county business, Donnie.
Don`t fool with me.
-Pearl!
-What?
You need to take a look at this, watch him!
Haul it up, boys! lt`s her!
Donnie?
Get those hooks out of my baby!
Get her off them hooks!
Cuff him!
Get an ambulance. l think he`s having a heart attack!
-l didn`t do this!
-Get him out of here!
This ain`t right! Pearl!
Bitch! Bitch!
Come in!
Somebody might come in here. l guess you better fuck me fast.
You want some coffee?
Mrs. Wilson?
-You want some coffee?
-No, thank you.
Have a seat.
Why have you called me here?
Mrs. Wilson, tomorrow Donnie goes on trial for murder. l feel that we have a powerful case. ln fact, today the coroner verified Donnie`s tissue...
...under the victim`s fingernails.
Now, l only have one weak link l got to worry about.
-What?
-You?
You see, you`re how...
...we found out where the victim`s body was.
That might open up a real can of worms for us.
Psychic phenomena, E.S.P., dreams, visions...
...the defense could go to town on you.
And if that`s not bad enough, l understand that...
...there was bad blood between you and Donnie.
-He threatened my kids.
-That`s what l heard. l also heard that you threatened him right back.
Told his wife to leave him.
Donnie`s quite a ladies`man.
Were you involved with him?
What? l can deal with any revelation...
But at the trial there can`t be any surprises. ls there anything l need to know about you or Donnie...
...or Donnie`s wife or the victim?
No. Will that be all?
Yes, ma`am.
You know, Mr. Duncan...
...the victim had a name. lt was Jessica King.
Mr. Hawkings, how long have you worked out at Jay`s?
About ten years.
Now, were you working at Jay`s on Saturday night, April 8?
Yes, sir.
Did you see Donnie
Barksdale that night?
Yes, sir.
Could you describe the circumstances?
The circumstances were...
...l come outside to throw out some trash.
-What time it was?
-About midnight, l reckon. l see Donnie out there by his truck...
...havin` an argument with this white lady.
She scratched his arm and he slapped the tar out of her.
About that time, l go back inside.
-ls this the woman you saw?
-Yes, sir.
Your honor, let the record show that l`ve just shown...
...Mr. Hawkings a photograph of Jessica King.
Your attention was drawn to the defendant`s pond.
Drawn in what way?
Me, Wayne Collins and Kenneth
King went to see Annie Wilson.
What made you think she would be able to help you?
Well... word around town was... that she was a...
-l don`t know the right word.
-lsn`t it fortune-teller? l guess so. What did this fortune-teller see?
When she looked into her little crystal ball.
Well, she didn`t have no ball.
She had these special cards.
She didn`t actually see nothing then?
But next day, she come to see me and...
-She had this dream.
-She had a dream?
Yes, sir. She`d seen this pond and it looked a...
...lot like Donnie
Barksdale`s and...
...then she woke up from her dream and she went outside...
...and looked up in this tree. l`m all ears.
She`s seen Jessica King... floatin` in the tree...
...half-naked, with a chain wrapped around her.
-Floatin` around a tree?
-Yes, sir.
Floatin` in a tree... half-naked...
...with a chain wrapped around her.
Thank you, sheriff.
That little squirrel, Weems, is just mean and skinny.
Never have known a
Weems worth a damn.
Well, he was just doing his job.
Uh. Mrs. Wilson, can l talk to you for a minute?
-Just call me later on, okay?
-Oh, okay. Okay, bye.
Buddy, l got a lot on my mind. lt`s not a good time, okay?
You did tell me to do some thinkin` and talkin`.
-And l`ve been thinking.
-What? What?
Can you tell me why l do things to myself...
...when l think about my daddy?
Bud, you call me later, hon, and we`ll talk, all right? l need to talk to you. l`ve been thinking about my daddy...
...and l`ve been touching myself.
-Touching yourself? How?
-Why do l do that?
-Buddy, honey...
-Why do l do that?
-lt`s not unusual.
-Something`s wrong with me.
And l keep thinking about that blue diamond.
You look into the blue diamond...
...you won`t think a negative thought. l promise. Now, hon, l`m going through a hard time myself. l just... l can`t talk to you now, okay?
You`re gonna burn in hell, Annie Wilson!
Now, Mike, l know you skipped school and went to that trial.
-How`d you know?
-A little bird told me. lt`s about time you started making things easier on me. l`m very disappointed in you.
The phone`s ringing, mama. l`m gonna have to testify at that trial tomorrow.
-The phone`s ringing, mama!
-l`m not deaf, Miller!
Let the machine get it.
Barksdale`s side they`re gonna try and give me hard time. l just want y`all to be prepared...
...f you hear any bad stuff about me, all right?
We`re all gonna have to be sticking together on this one.
Annie Wilson, it`s Buddy`s mother. Buddy`s gone crazy.
He`s threatening to kill his daddy!
He`s got Dell tied up, accusing him of horrible things.
-Have you called the police?
-He said if l did that...
...he`d kill Dell, he wants you.
Put that strap down and tell me!
What he`s done to you? l`m here, Buddy... like you said you can talk to me, honey. lt`s too late for that! lt`s too goddamn late!
This here is a criminal!
And he`s gonna be punished!
You shut up! You shut up!
Get away!
Where were you? l`m sorry, Buddy, l`m sorry.
You knew everything and you did nothing!
You ruined me!
You ruined me! l was just a little boy, daddy! lt got so l was embarrassed to go to school, daddy!
How could you do that to your little boy!
No, Buddy!
You put that down!
No, Buddy...
You put that down, Buddy,
You put that down!
-You listen to me!
-You get away! You get away!
All right, Buddy, All right.
Why didn`t you help me, Annie?
-What?
-Why didn`t you help me? l had you for a friend and then... l am your friend, Buddy.
Now! Now l have nobody! l`m gonna kill this thing.
Help me! Help me!
Look at that goddamn thing...
...and you tell me what kind of thoughts you have?
You look! You look!
Mrs. Wilson? Mrs. Wilson?
Your husband,
Ben Wilson senior...
...was one of the men killed last year in the explosion...
...rout at the reinhold cable plant.
Yes, that`s right.
You were left with three small children to raise on your own.
Yes, sir.
How do you provide for you and your sons? l get a little bit of money...
...from social security.
-From my husband`s death.
-Psychic readings?
Yes, sir.
What does being psychic enables you to do? l see things... and l, you know... l sense...
...well, they hadn`t happened yet...
...or they were happening someplace else.
My granny told me that l had a gift that...
...runs in my family...
...l shouldn`t be afraid of it. l should just always use my instinct and l`d be all right.
You`re swearing, before this court that you didn`t get...
...your information about this tragedy from any...
-...other means?
-Yes, sir.
Thank you, Mrs. l have no further questions.
Mr. Weems.
How many fingers am l holding up behind my back?
Objection, your honor!
My client is in this courtroom on trial for his life...
...partly because of powers that this woman claims to have. l believe l should be given the opportunity to test...
...the alleged powers instead of taking her word for it.
You have a good point.
Objection overruled.
Can every one see how many fingers l`m showing?
How many fingers,
Mrs. Wilson? l don`t know.
You don`t know?
-Seven! Seven fingers!
-That doesn`t prove anything.
Your honor, l can`t do this...
...you know, at the drop of hat.
Then, ma`am, how about doing it at the drop of a dolar bill?
What are you trying to say? l`m trying to say maybe this special gift of yours doesn`t...
``No money, no honey.``
No, that`s not true.
Are you aware that in hatcher county it`s against the law...
...for a phychic to set up a shop and charge people money? l don`t charge money.
You just testified that you do charge money. l accept donations.
People give me gifts.
A distinction worthy of a lawyer.
Wilson, you a rich woman?
-No.
-Why not? lf l had psychic powers like yours...
...l`d be filthy rich. l`d be playing the stock market, betting on the dogs. l`d certainly warn my husband...
...not to go to work on the day...
...l know the reinhold plant`s gonna blow up...
...leaving 3 little children to be raised in a carnival.
Well, it doesn`t work that way, sir...
...l can`t use my gift for personal gain.
Except for those... what you call `em... donations?
Have you had some personal trouble with Donnie?
Yes, l have.
You told him, l believe the exact words was...
...you was gonna have his ass thrown in jail.
But he was threatening my kids.
That a few weeks ago in one of those readings of yours...
...when you were doing your
ESP you told Donnie`s wife...
...that Donnie was just an insecure redneck...
...and that he wasn`t really crazy enough to kill anybody?
Yes, l did say that.
Then why today are you saying he did kill somebody?
Wait a second. l`ve never said that.
You might as well have, ma`am.
You wanted his ass in jail...
...and he`s on trial for his life. l just told the sheriff what l saw.
And how could any of us ever forget that?
Jessica King just floatin` up in that tree...
...naked, with a chain wrapped around her. lt must be so much fun for you.
You must be having the time of your life...
...entertaining yourself with your dreams and your visions.
You think it`s fun seeing...
...decomposed bodies in my tree, do you sir?
Do you think it`s fun that l have...
...people trying to strangle me in my sleep?
Now l`m blaming myself
`cause some poor crazy man...
...just tried to burn his daddy half to death.
And you think l`m sitting here having fun? l`m sorry, sir. You`re crazy if you think that.
No more questions, your honor.
You`re dismissed.
Let`s just cut to the chase.
Did you or did you not kill Jessica King? l did not.
Did you or did you not see Jessica King...
...on the night she was killed?
Yeah, l seen her.
Would you describe the circumstances, please?
Well, l`d been seeing her for quite a while.
Would you clarify what you mean by ``seeing``. l mean, her and me had been having sex.
Okay, go ahead.
Well, she called me about 1 1 :00. l told her l`d meet her out at Jay`s.
And l told my wife l was going out for a beer.
-What happened after that?
-Well, we got in an argument.
-She didn`t want to see me.
-Did she tell you why?
She was getting married in a couple of months and wanted...
...to stop playing around at least `till after the wedding.
And during the course of this argument with with Miss King...
...did you at any moment strike her?
Yes, sir.
What happened after you struck her?
She banged her head pretty hard when she went down...
...l decided to take her to the hospital.
-Did you reach the hospital?
-No, sir.
Are you feeling okay? l`m fine... l wanna go back. l don`t wanna go to the hospital.
Someone might see me.
Then she said she was feeling better anyhow...
...l took her back to Jay`s. l dropped her off, then l went on back home.
And that was the last time you saw Jessica King alive?
Yes, sir.
Are you guilty of the charge against you? l`m guilty of cheatin on my wife of being a bad husband...
...a bad christian, but l ain`t guilty of killing Jesse. l swear to God.
No more questions, your honor.
Mr. Duncan.
You`re a wife-beater, aren`t you? l`ve swore to tell the truth here today.
Yeah, l`ve hit
Valerie before... l guess it ain`t no secret.
You admit to having a history of violence against women...
...and also to having beaten up the victim...
...on the night that she was murdered. l wouldn`t exactly say that l beat her up.
You`re the expert.
You tell me.
Just how badly do you have to beat a woman...
...before it fits your definition of ``beating up``?
Now, your story is that you`ve been having an affair...
...with the victim.
But tell us why a beautiful young woman like Jessica King...
...from one of the finest families in Brixton...
...just about to be married to a good...
...decent professional man with a bright future...
...why would a woman like that get involved with you? l asked her that myself on time.
She said l was the only man...
...in town who knew how to fuck.
You`re really disgusting.
You know that?
-Objection, your honor!
-Objection sustained.
You will refrain from making those personal comments. l apologize, your honor.
Let`s get this straight.
Let`s clarify this.
You`re saying it was just a coincidence...
...that on the very same night you physicall assaulted her...
...someone else put her body in your pond? l`m not saying it was a coincidence. l`m saying l got framed!
What an original defense.
Did you think of Jessica
King as a stray cat?
Did you tell sheriff Johnson a stray cat clawed your arm?
Did`t you just tell the court
Jessica scratched your arm?
Didn`t you tell him you got scratched by the stray cat...
...because she didn`t like it when you killed her?
-But l was lying.
-Maybe you`re lying now. l`m not, goddamn it. lt`s her, goddamn it!
-Be seated, Mr Barksdale!
-She`s the reason l`m up here!
She`s a goddamn witch!
Witch! Witch! ln Brixton today, a sensational murder trial was concluded.
Donald Barksdale was found guilty...
...in the sex and strangulation killing...
...of Jessica King...
...daughter of the Brixton businessman, Kenneth King. ls everything gonna be all right now, mama?
Yeah, hon.
We can get on with our lives now. l guess l`m the last person...
...you wanna see.
How you been?
Terrible.
Annie, if you tell me to get going, l will...
...l wouldn`t blame you...
...but l need you to read for me.
Give me a hand. l feel like l can`t hold on any longer.
You know Donnie`s mean and everything, but...
...l feel real lost without him.
You know, l ain`t never been on my own before. l`m scared, Annie.
You don`t need to be scared, hon. You`ll be fine.
You see that in the cards?
Right through here.
But can you see what l`m thinking?
What do you mean? l`ve been thinking some real bad, bad thoughts...
-...un-Christian thoughts.
-Like what? l`m glad that girl`s dead, Jessica.
She was messin` around and she deserved what she got.
No one deserves that.
Like l said, l know it`s un-Christian.
What? What, are you seeing something bad? l don`t know. lt`s not clear.
Fuck you!
Wayne?
Wayne? lt`s not normally like this.
You need to lie down. l`m really not sleepy. l think if you sleep, you`ll feel better.
Thank you, Annie.
Wayne, l don`t think this is a good idea.
No. lt`s not. l just thought we could forget...
...all this for a while.
You want to, don`t you? l know there`s something between us. l can`t. l guess l still feel married.
You`re not, though.
-He`s gone.
-l know.
You gotta learn to deal with that.
Like l gotta deal with the fact that Jessica`s gone.
She`s dead.
Oh, Wayne, l`m so sorry.
-lt`s okay.
-No, it`s not okay. l don`t think Donnie
Barksdale killed her.
-No, no, Annie...
-l`m really sorry. l can`t. l can`t do this. lt`s finished. l know. l wanna let that bastard rot in jail.
But he`s guilty.
No, Wayne, l see it. l see he didn`t do it.
Do you see who did?
Uh, l`m trying but l, l... don`t know yet.
What are we gonna do?
Well, if l had a piece of clothing...
...or maybe l could go out to the pond or see if l... lt`s not over.
Jesus.
Come in.
What brings you out here?
Well, l`ll just come straight out and say it. l don`t think Donnie Barksdale killed Jessica King.
Well, sure he did. lt was an open-and-shut case. l`m telling you, he didn`t.
The person that killed Jessica is still out there someplace.
What`s the deal? The Barksdales been threatening you?
No. l`ll talk to Pearl Johnson.
This has nothing to do with the Barksdales. l know that Donnie didn`t kill Jessica the same way...
...that l knew that her body was in his pond.
And do you know who did kill her?
No.
So, what do you care?
The son of a bitch is in jail. l think somebody`s gonna try and kill me.
-What do you want me to do?
-Re-open the case and...
-...find out who really did it.
-l can`t. He`s been convicted.
-You can talk to somebody.
-l`ve got no basis to open it.
-l`d look like a fool.
-l don`t give a damn.
Now, you listen to me. l know you had an affair with Jessica.
So, how do you think you`re gonna look if people find out...
...you had sex with the victim...
...the night before she was killed?
Do you want money? l want you to re-open the case.
There`s a saying about letting sleeping dogs lie.
You think you`re in danger now?
Look at it logically.
The real danger begin if this case gets re-opened...
...and someone starts worrying that you`re gonna have...
...another one of your damn dreams.
All l know is the wrong man`s in jail. l don`t care how awful he is.
And l helped put him there. l can`t live with that.
So you find a way to re-open this case, sir or l will.
Buddy, l`m here if you...
-Hello, l`m back.
-How are the boys?
They`re fine.
They went to sleep.
You want me to bring `em over?
No, no, listen. Could we stay over your house tonight?
-Sure you can. You all right?
-Oh yeah, l`m fine.
Come on over. l`ll make a bed for you. l`m just gonna lock up.
-Okay, thank you.
-Bye-bye.
Buddy!
Oh! Did you see Buddy Cole?
Buddy? No. l thought he was at the hospital over in Benton.
Oh, maybe l imagined it.
Are you okay? l don`t know. What l`m gonna do. Ever since you told me...
...what you told me today...
...l feel like l`m going crazy.
Annie, l can`t stand another night of this. l need you to read for me. lt`s no good.
Try it again. l can`t make it happen.
How about what you said today?
-What?
-The pond.
What if we did go back out there?
You think it might help you? l... l don`t know.
Yeah. Uh, maybe.
Yeah, okay. Well, it`s worth a try, right?
You mean tonight? No Wayne. l can`t do that. l got my kids.
You know, it`s a police matter now.
How long do you think that`s gonna take, Anne? lt`s gonna sit on somebody`s desk for three or four months...
...and nothing`s gonna happen. lt`s over for them. They`ve got their man. lt`s up to us. l know that. But l`m telling you l don`t see anything. l can`t keep running from things.
Maybe if you just sort of walk around.
All right.
Jeez, you all right?
You okay?
Yeah, yeah.
What are you doing here?
You seeing something? l`ve been thinking some real bad, bad thoughts.
Annie? l`m glad that girl is dead. Jessica.
She was messin` around with my husband...
...and she deserved what she got. l couldn`t sleep.
Met the girls for a drink.
Take off your clothes.
Aren`t you taking yours off too?
There`s a saying about letting sleeping dogs lie.
You just fucked him, didn`t you?
Donnie Barksdale?
So?
Why would you do this to me? l love you.
Maybe l wanted to be with a man for a change.
-Watch your mouth!
-You watch your mouth.
Fuck you! We`re through. l don`t like being spied on.
The only reason l`m with you is...
...`cause my daddy likes you.
You horrible little bitch! l`ll show you a bitch if you don`t let go of me. Let go!
-l think we better go back.
-Nothing`s coming to you?
No... nothing.
You know. l knew if l got you close enough to it you`d see it.
-Wayne, l told you.
-No, no, it`s okay. l swear to God,
Annie, it`s okay. l wanted you to see it so bad. l mean, that`s why we`re here. l`m not some killer,
Annie. l`m not.
You don`t... l mean, do you know what it was like with her?
She was so fucking hurtful and spiteful and all of it...
Wayne, l`m not gonna...
But all of it just happened in this flash of a moment.
Wayne, l.... listen to me. l`m a good man.
All right? lf it had been you with me...
...instead of her, none of this would have happened.
Wayne... l won`t... l won`t tell... l won`t... l won`t tell anybody.
No, Annie...
You all right,
Mrs. Wilson? l thought you were supposed to be in the hospital. l escaped, Mrs. Wilson. l`m free.
Buddy, l`m so sorry l wasn`t there for you.
-l should`ve.
-Now, don`t say another word.
You was the only one that was a friend to me.
And l love you.
You`re the soul of this town, Mrs. Wilson.
And just need to keep doing what you`re doing. l washed it.
Will you come back into town with me?
Yeah.
You know you`re gonna have to go back.
Yes, ma`am, l know.
Can l have your key`s, ma`am?
Well, l just talked to Wayne...
...he pretty much admitted to everything. l`ve known that boy half my life. lt just goes to show...
...you can know somebody and...
...not know `em.
How`s his head?
Well, you put a pretty good dent in it.
No, sheriff...
...l told the deputy it wasn`t me... who did that.
-Buddy Cole saved me.
-No, it weren`t Buddy. l mean, why don`t you just ask Wayne? l did.
He don`t remember what happened.
Head injuries is funny.
Sheriff, l`m telling you it was Buddy Cole. What l`m... lt couldn`t have been Buddy. l just called up at the state hospital...
He told me he escaped. Ma`am.
Buddy Cole is dead.
He hanged himself in the shower room...
...6:00 this evening.

VlDEO OMEGA, S.A. DE C.V.
5 years ago we started valet parking in Tuen Mun
We were full of ambition
But 2 weeks had hardly gone by and the cops started busting us every day
Within one year
6 of our brothers died
Thanks to the Buddha, my life was spared
What thousands must die so that Caesar may become great
But I don't believe in destiny
The rule of this game is to take fate in our own hands
You are the newest in my gang
Your records are the cleanest
You can choose your own future
OK
I wish you guys every success in the police force
Bottoms up, officers
27149, you were here 10 minutes ago
How many files were on my desk?
Six, sir. Four beige ones on the left one red and one white on the right
What do you think of me?
Sorry, I'm not sure, sir
But I know you're in a hurry today
'coz your socks don't match
27149, you can go now
Yes, sir
You owe me $500
OK, but wait till pay day next month
I told you he would make the best undercover cop
Now that you're in the cadet school you should follow the rules
Those who break the rules will be like him
They will be expelled
Who wants to trade place with him?
I do
Your records in the cadet school will be erased
Only Superintendent Wong and
I know of your identity
This mission is highly dangerous is that clear?
Yes, sir
Sir, I can't stand it any longer
I'm either harassed by cops or beaten up by gangsters
4927, you are still a rookie
Give me a good reason why I should promote you
Hang on?
Why don't you go hang yourself instead?
I won the Silver Whistle Award at the cadet and have received numerous kudos as an officer
I am confident I can lead the police force sir
Boss
OK, I got it
Move forward
Hurry up
Please go over there to take your mugshot
Excuse me
Can I try this stereo?
What speakers are you using?
Nothing special, any recommendations?
Try this tube amplifier made in Hong Kong, 10,000 only
And use this cable, also locally made about 1000
The sound is as good as expensive
European amps
Sweet high notes, crisp middle strong bass
In a word, transparent
Come and listen
Human voices are drifting towards you
See that?
Voices are indeed drifting towards you
Try this one
This is ideal for listening to oldies
What do you think?
Much better indeed
Any discount if I buy the whole set?
Buy the tube amp here but not the speakers
Go to Cheung Wai; it's cheaper there
Whom should I ask for?
Just tell them Yan sent you
Which one is mine?
The one in the middle
Okay, thanks
You're welcome
Is Cheung Wai open yet?
Sure
You bastard
I told you to watch the store not to send my customers away
But your speakers are over-priced
If I don't sell them at this price how can I afford to pay "protection money"?
You can try not paying for a change
Hey, the cable
I'll return it in a few days
$4,000 for a few days?
Where are you rushing to?
A funeral
Tell me
How many times have you been busted for assault?
I am trying to convince the Department of Justice that you need to see a shrink
But you keep on beating people up
Are you really going nuts?
Have you forgotten you're a cop?
You told me it's only for 3 years
But after 3 years come another 3 years and another
It's almost 10 years already, boss
Can't you be a bit more courteous to me?
I'm the only one in Hong Kong who knows your real identity now
Maybe I'll just erase your file so you can stick with the Triads for good
What do you want me to do?
Remind myself I'm a cop every day?
Shouting "Drop your gun, I'm a cop" even in my dreams?
When will Sam place his order?
No idea
Sometime this week
What?
Sometime this week
The Thais are here
Once the goods arrive
Sam will resell them
Where is the warehouse?
How the hell do I know?
I started working for him only 3 years ago
OK, I'll let you retire after this
Bullshit
I heard this a zillion times already
Shit. These mikes again?
The Police is loaded with cash
Tell them to get more advanced models
How about implanting it into your body?
Into which part of my body?
A pinhole camera?
Where's the lens?
Your birthday is on the 25th, right?
I never wear watches
If we got nothing for the lnterpol by 5pm the counterfeit passport case is off
3:15. Tea time
What would you like, boss?
Tea with milk, please
They won't talk without their attorney
Has paged their lawyers but he hasn't called back yet
I won't talk without my attorney
I am Mr. Lau, your attorney
Did you call home?
Why should I call home?
It's good then
Where were you last friday from 3:45 to 5:00 pm?
Brother Mo told me to ask you if your family needs any help
No need to look around
They won't record anything when a lawyer is present
It's not admissible in court anyway
Brother Mo sent you?
Those 2 kids next door have squealed on the workshop already
Cops are heading there now
Brother Mo told you not to say anything
If your brother is there tell him to leave right away
Here
What?
Scram
I ask you to scram, do you hear?
Scram right away
All right. I'll leave you
If you don't trust me, so be it
Take care
Remember don't talk without your attorney
I don't need you to tell me that
Fanny
Yes?
Take this
Check this number
Sure
Send this message for me
Cheung Fai lndustrial Building, 2nd Floor
Cheung Fai lndustrial Building, 2nd Floor
OK
Boss
All set
A Triad member
Where's my tea?
Here
Thanks
You're great
How did you know it's Mo's hideout?
Thanks
Hello, yes
No problem. OK
Sorry guys, over time tonight
Our target tonight is a drug trafficking cartel
In an hour's time they will be trading with a Thai seller
Cash will be handed over in the building across the street in a unit on the 3rd floor
Where the goods will be delivered is still unknown
CIB shall tag the target and tap the phone lines
Our unit will not take action till our mole has pinned down the delivery location
Let's take a look at our principal stars
Here are our principal stars tonight:
Hon Sam, Chen Wing-yan, Del Piero
We've been watching them for a long time
We'd better nail them tonight
OK? No more questions?
Let's get to work
Sorry for paging you so urgently
But our mission is kept confidential till the last moment
No problem
Do you have confidence?
Yes, it should be OK
Hello, Dad
Pass the phone to Dad
I can't come home for dinner
Too bad
Dinner has been prepared already
Call me when you're back
I'll heat it up for you
You look so relaxed
It's only work
We can always work on it next time
Sorry
All cell phone signals in this area are under surveillance
SP Wong
SP Wong, which channel?
Channel 454870
Channel 454870
Attention. Our prey is in sight
Big Brother
Boss
Take out all your cell phones
You two, go get the car
Wait
Yan escort the Thais here
You two, follow me
Lau
Yes
Did Sam and his gang make any calls?
No. They probably changed their phones
Let's search randomly for calls made from this area
Searching
Some 6,500 cell phones are being connected in this area right now
267 cell phones are making calls on this street alone
Give me 10 minutes
Good
Thank you
Did they spot us?
Are those two over there watching us?
Which two?
Those two
No one is watching you
Those two making out over there
They are just making out
Why would they be watching you?
You think you're a movie star?
Our prey is back
Yip, watch our prey closely
Boss. The Thais are here
Hey man
What's up?
How are you?
Cigar?
Is that any good?
Excellent
Is it cold in Hong Kong?
Very cold
You even know how to speak Cantonese
How fantastic
Marvelous indeed
AA+
Deal
Automobile license plate number HN397 is taking off
Repeat, Helen, Nelson
HN397 is taking off
Attention. HN397 is taking off
Repeat, Helen, Nelson, 397
Should we send a car to tail them?
Elephant
Kwai Chung Container Terminus
Roger
Piero. You're being tailed
Lead them in circles
They know which channel we are on
Switch to channel 456855
Boss, where are those two going?
Don't worry, take it easy
Take care of the Thais for me
Sorry, sir
Hello?
Why don't you use the walkie talkie?
We've switched channels?
Are you done yet?
Beat it
Piero, are you being tailed?
Keep driving around
Cheung
Use the current channel to tell Elephant that action has been cancelled
Yes, sir
Elephant, no hunting tonight
Come back to the station
It's done
What the hell is going on?
Our guys are freezing to death out there
What's so funny?
I speak Thai. I know what they're saying
Really?
Yes. They are bitching at the boss
What are they bitching about?
Those Thais at Lung Koo Bay are freezing to death
You know they can't stand the cold
That's right
You're sharp
Cheung, call Elephant
Goods to be delivered at Lung Koo Bay
Boss, I found it
Tell Keung to check the goods
And make sure no one is around
Not a soul
A boat is approaching
Probably for checking the goods
The cocaine is all here
Keung, are you an idiot or what?
Boss
I heard it
Tell Keung to shout a loud that the cocaine is his
Keung, the Boss asks you to shout aloud that the cocaine is yours
The cocaine is yours
Take delivery
They are taking delivery
Get ready for action
Thanks. Thanks
Thank you
Double Eight
As soon as the Thais step out, arrest them
There's a stooge. Stop the deal
There's a stooge. Stop the deal
Wait
There's a stooge. Stop the deal
Hello?
Cast all the goods into the sea. Now
Keung. Cast all the goods into the sea
Police. Freeze
We got the men but lost the goods
They have cast everything into the sea
Double Eight, hold it
All of you, follow me
What are you looking at?
Boss. Let's...
Police, don't move
Sam
Your food looks good
Not bad
We've straightened it out
Your boys are only strolling on the beach
So they can go now?
Sure, any time
We don't want to waste any more of your precious time
We've known each other for so long
Don't give me that
I haven't had my dinner here for quite a while
If you like it, you're always welcome here
How about tomorrow?
I'll take a rain check
I feel bad coming here empty-handed
Don't stand on ceremonies
I' should feel bad for making you drop several grand tonight
You think planting a mole in us will do us in?
Same here
I remember a story
Two fools are waiting for their kidney transplants but only one kidney is available
The two guys thus play a game
They each put a playing card into the other's pocket
Whoever guesses the card in his own pocket wins
You know I can see your card
I think so too
I will beat you
Let's see
We should be more careful
I will
By the way whoever loses the game will die
Let's see when you're gonna die
Ever seen someone shakes a corpse's hand?
Let's go
Put it next to the couch
OK
Thanks
Mary
What's interior designer's number?
The interior designer... 90255047
How many boxes have I counted?
24? Are you sure?
Positive
Pass me the phone
Coming
Hello?
Hold on please
Who is it?
I don't know
Hello
It's me
Yes, I'm moving in
Don't eavesdrop. It's confidential
I lost all of my goods
There's a mole
Dig him out for me
Hold on, too many people around here
Hold on
I have no access to those undercover files
I can't dig him out
I don't care how difficult it is
I only know he uses Morse codes
Give me all the information on the people around you last night
Their real names, ID card no. account no., etc
See you tonight, at the cinema
OK
What's the matter?
I'm talking about my novel
I know what I'm going to write about
Come here
I can write about a man with 28 different personalities
Are you talking about me?
Be more serious
Think about it
A man with 28 personalities
That means he starts role playing the minute he wakes up
He is no longer certain which personality is the real him
Isn't it scary?
Very much
Good?
Yeah. Will be a bestseller for sure
Wait...
What is it?
Why is the ottoman so big?
Which one?
I must have gotten the measurements wrong
Take it easy
You women...
Let me see. Get up slowly
Don't be mad
Meet up?
You want me dead?
There's a mole in the police station
Dig him out first
So who is he?
I can't talk anymore
What?
Just now?
I was at a Chinese chiropractor
I'm seeing the shrink now
I'm going psycho. That's it
This chair is really... incredible
You should get one for yourself?
So you don't need to come here and sleep every time
It's more comfortable here
Don't be so peevish
During these 4 months, if it weren't for me you wouldn't have the time to play
It's 5 months computer games
In one more month your mandatory therapy will be over
You can sleep peacefully at home then
So soon?
I don't seem to have improved at all
Why don't you just prolong my treatment
Besides, my head is splitting these days
Could it be schizophrenia?
This is called "headache"
I'll prescribe some Panadol for you
Actually there's something I want to ask you but... it's kind of embarrassing
What do you think of me?
Do you think I'm a good guy or a bad guy?
I hardly know who you are
Tell you a secret, but don't tell anyone
I'm actually a cop
So am I
Let's continue next week
Try to remember your dreams
Of course
I will dream about you
See you next week
Just Panadol?
Bye
Your promotion should be OK
You will be transferred to lnternal Affairs but you will work at OCTB
I don't understand
I suspect Sam has a mole in the department
I want you to investigate
Why me?
We have scrutinized all possible candidates
You have an immaculate record
You have solved many cases in CIB
Working in IA, you will get in touch with senior officials
That's a good opportunity
I've arranged for you to appear on TV
Remember to spruce up a bit
When will I meet the Board?
You just did
Come, take a stab
Thanks
By the way how's the wedding?
Everything's on schedule
That's good
You'll be more stable after marriage
Your image will improve too
You have chance of further promotion
Yes, broaden your horizon
Fill in your real name
This is my real name
You don't know Del Piero is my real name?
Is that so?
Yes
What are you guys writing?
The Boss told us to fill in these forms
Must be setting up mandatory provident funds for us
You know, MPF
Are you serious?
You don't know to spell BODYGUARD?
Isn't it supposed to look like this?
Of course not
Should be B-O-D-Y-G-A-R-D
That's it
A shipment will come in next week
They are watching closely
You do what you need to do
I'll handle the rest
The file is open. I'm afraid I can't handle it
So you're not worried about me
You are worried about yourself lnspector Lau
Those girls are so ugly
I'll take care of it as soon as I can
Hello?
I'm on my way back
Yan
How long have you worked for me?
3 or 4 years already
That long?
Doesn't seem that long to me
I have another shipment next week
But this time
I'm using some tough, new faces
So you guys can rest
Even Keung and the others?
Keung?
Don't you know he's nuts?
There's a mole within us. You know that?
What do you think we should do?
I'll take care of it
How?
I'll find out who he is in a couple of days
Get ready for action
Yan
Of all the brothers, I trust you the most
Lau
No, thanks
These folks
You know most of them no need for introduction, right?
No, but... they are so...
Who doesn't know you're sent here to find the mole?
What do you want them to do?
Pour you a cup of coffee?
Only an idiot will not be envied, right?
They all want to know who the mole is
Just tell me whom you want to investigate
OK
Any clues?
Two days ago, my informer nearly found out who he was
Too bad he lost him
But if Sam is getting a new shipment he must contact the mole again
Just follow Sam and we'll get what we want
That's right. I've much to learn from you
Don't say that
Our seniors sent you here because they think you can do it
Not everyone can handle IA tasks
It's stuffy here
Let's get out of here
The coffee here is the best in the headquarters
I'll pour you a cup
My informer nearly found out who the mole was
But if Sam is getting a new shipment he must contact the mole again
Yes?
Hey
The bed has arrived
Is that so? Comfortable?
You want to try it?
Don't be silly. I have work to do
Think about it
No, I can't
Come on
Saturday
I'll be free next Saturday
We can try it then
OK
OK, next Saturday then
Bye
Bye
Up already?
Yes
We just tested the bed and you are working again?
I'm very hardworking
What are you writing now?
Here
The more I think of it, the more pathetic the main character appears
Pathetic indeed
Perhaps I should make him a happier guy
Good
Should I turn him into a good guy?
Even though he is good he has done bad things
So how should it end?
That's a good question
I'll leave this to you writers
You're not going to sleep?
Help me, please
Help me, please?
I can't
Go to sleep. You are tired
From now on follow SP Wong around the clock
Piero, I know how to spot a plainclothes
How?
If he seems to be doing something but is paying attention to us instead then he is a cop
Is that so?
Then the whole place is filled with cops
They're everywhere
Yan
Boss
Watching something?
You are a cop
We are guessing who a cop is
How trivial
I'm going for a massage, wanna come?
I hate it
Don't tell
Tell on him
I won't
What a coincidence
Yes, I was shopping in the hood
Haven't seen you for ages
6 or 7 years already
How are you?
I'm married. How about you?
Still working in...?
Mommy
Your daughter?
Yes
How old is she?
5 years old
I'm waiting for my husband's car, so...
I'm also in a hurry
Bye
Bye
Mommy, I'm 6 already
Sorry, I always get it wrong
Where are you now?
On my way
Hello?
Boss, he is taking the subway
Keep following him
Boss, he has gone to the 24th floor
Stay put. Don't do anything rash
Boss, we've got him
I don't know yet
But I know where he is now
Keep watch over here
So? Any good news?
A shipment will come in next week
Time and location yet to be confirmed
I still don't know who Sam's mole is but he seems confident he can blow my cover
In that case we'd better stop it
We're gonna lose for sure
You are kidding, right?
What else can we do? It's deadly business
Hello?
Boss said he had found the mole
He told us to take care of him
I'll be right there
Hello?
Keep an eye on SP Wong
You two, take the stairs
Keung, take the elevator
Anyone knows you're seeing me today?
No
They are downstairs now
What are you doing?
Put it away
Take the window-washing scaffolding
How about you?
I'll take the elevator
Be careful
Nothing
Darling, the apartment is superb
A 180-degree window facing the golf course plus club membership costs less than a million
Superintendent Wong?
Turn around to the main entrance
What do you think of me?
Your birthday is on the 25th, right?
Let's go
Police. Let's go
Bad news, Boss
Something happened to SP Wong
There's a gunfight in Sheung Wan this afternoon
Three suspects were dead; several suspects and pedestrians were injured
The police confirmed that one of the victims was superintendent in OCTB
Mr. Wong Chi-shing
The motive is unknown
Possibility of gang feud is not ruled out
They are now after several triad members active in the Southern Kowloon area
The Police Commissioner expressed condolence and pledged to solve the case as soon as possible
It was a close shave
10 minutes after you went to your massage
Boss told us to get ready
I was scared stiff
You know
I hide under the car in every fight
And there were guns up there
I wanted to sneak out of there
Two days ago
Boss told me to go to his room
He asked me how long I'd worked for him
How the hell could I remember?
He then said: Keung it's been 5 years already
You've performed well all these years
I have a question for you
If one of your brothers is a mole will you dare to take him out?
Of course I said yes to his face
You think I'm an idiot?
What's the result?
Of course they couldn't find the mole
The cop was tough
They dragged him upstairs and beat him up for a good 10 minutes
10 minutes...
10 minutes...
He didn't say a word
Keung
Boss said... the cop was hot on his trail
Who didn't show up today is the mole
I didn't... tell him you went for a massage
If Boss knew, you're dead meat
Yan, I want to ask you something
How was the masseuse today?
Because... if she's ugly, it's not worth it
Leave right away
There will be lots of cops after a car crash
Anyway, remember this: if you see someone doing something but at the same time watching you... then he is a cop
According to the closed-circuit TV
SP Wong entered that building at 4:15 pm
The suspects entered 20 minutes later
At 4:38 pm we received lnspector Lau's report
8 minutes before we arrived someone fell off the building
That was SP Wong
All the suspects killed or injured belong to Sam's gang
Many suspects escaped
The actual numbers are unknown
Do you know why SP Wong went to that building?
It was me
I told CIB to follow him
Why was CIB following him?
That's IA's business
Now that SP Wong is dead it is OCTB's business
What kind of attitude is that?
SP Wong was dedicated to the police force and you investigated him?
What kind of attitude is that?
So we senior officers have to ask for your approval, huh?
Your people have made a mistake now
Or SP Wong wouldn't have died
I am talking business here
I am talking personal matters
Nobody wanted this, OK?
Sorry, sir
It's my negligence
I will give everybody an answer
Sorry
SP Wong has a file with information on our undercover in Sam's gang
It is locked by a password
The technical staff can't decipher it
Inspector Lau
Yes
Work with CIB to unlock it
Find our man and get him out of there
By the way
SP Wong was a good cop
We should give him a grand funeral
Okay?
Yes, sir
Hello?
Boss. Why made such a scene?
He was following me all the time
One of us would have to die
I'm now in charge of everything here
If you're having any transactions just let me know
It's done
We got the goods when they killed the cop today
I won't bother you now
What did you call me for?
So you're the one?
Who are you?
Inspector Lau of OCTB
SP Wong is gone. We're all upset
I still have unfinished business
SP Wong wouldn't want you to take law in your own hands
What do you want?
Co-operation
The police has discovered the body of a fugitive suspect
He was involved in the Sheung Wan shooting earlier today
The police has confirmed the body to be an undercover cop
Tsui Wai-keung
The police has expressed their condolence and promised a thorough investigation
Boss, Yan is back
Three vehicles collided in Yuen Long today
The driver of the private car was trapped until firefighters came and rescued him
Boss
What is it, Yan?
I have taken care of Keung already
Did you ever send him to the warehouse?
It will be disastrous if he knows where it is
Boss. It's me
You don't have to go yourself
I don't want anyone to know the password
I understand
I'll send everyone away
Inspector Cheung
Tell those boys to stop following
Sam's gang
I got information that Sam is heading towards the warehouse
He won't go if he's being tailed
Just call them back
Let's do something for SP Wong
Please help me, OK?
Say something
This is not my case
Officer Chan told me not to get involved
If they're willing to stop then it's up to them
I know I'm responsible for
SP Wong's death
I am also a cop, like you
I want to solve the case too
I thought you only want promotion
It's SP Wong's mole who tipped me off
Do you believe it or not?
This is our last chance
Are you ready to take the risk?
Attention: Target vehicle on Highway no.3
U-turn at Pier 3 to Lung Cheung Road
They have been here for 20 minutes they are going to the 4th floor of the car park
Officer Chan won't let me touch this case
If anything goes wrong you'll take the blame
They are loading the goods at 4P
Elephant, stand by at the exit at 3P
Double Eight, watch the entrance at 2P
Fishball and Cheung, stand by here
All of you, wait for my signal
Oh, I forgot Boss told me to stay behind
Drop me off here
Run him over
My Master always said that about my life:
What thousands must die so that
Caesar may become great
You choose your own future
That's what you have chosen
Coffee for you
He's waited a long time for you
So it's you?
Was the stereo OK?
Pretty good
Those tube amps have to be warmed up
Wait 10 minutes and it sounds great
Should I salute you?
Not, don't
How long have you been an undercover?
I've followed Sam for 3 years
I had several other bosses before
All together it's been 10 years
10 years?
I should salute you instead
I just want an identity
I want to be a normal man
Getting tired?
You've never been a mole you won't understand
Too bad I still can't find the stooge
I'll take him down if I find him
Don't worry
Let me give you back your identity
I'll open your file but...
I don't have the password
What's the Morse code for
"undercover"?
That's it?
Are you serious?
You don't even know to spell BODYGUARD?
Isn't it supposed to look like this?
Of course not
Dr. Lee
I thought you wouldn't come
You're wanted by the police
Can I sleep in your chair again?
Let's talk upstairs
Last time you said you're a cop
Is it true?
It was true
But I'm not so sure now
So what's your plan?
I don't know. Still thinking
There's one thing I've been trying to tell you for a while
But it's too embarrassing
I told you I dreamt about you all the time
It's true
Me too
Remember my secret. Goodbye
Mary
What is it? Has it broken down?
This morning the guys from the stereo shop came
They have tuned it up already
They also left a CD sampler for you
I've listened to it
Have you had breakfast yet?
I'll get you some
Iced tea?
Chinese buns?
Sure
I can't finish my novel
I don't know whether he's good or bad
I think only he knows
A shipment will come in next week
They are watching closely
You do what you need to do
I will handle the rest
The file is open. I can't handle it
So you're not worried about me
You are worried about yourself lnspector Lau
Are the voices crisp enough?
The precious recording was taken from Sam's office
It's not your lucky day
Don't threaten me. What do you want?
I want my identity back
3 pm, Central Ferry Pier
Keep your cell on
The number you have dialed cannot be connected
Please leave a message after the beep
Mary, I'm sorry
I've chosen to be the good guy
I'm going to meet Yan now
No matter what
I'll give him back his identity
The file is in my computer
The password is your birthday
You sure know what you're doing
I also went to the cadet school
Do all undercover cops like rooftops?
Unlike you, I'm not afraid of light
So where's the stuff I want?
I don't think you've brought what I want either
So what does this mean?
We came up here to sunbathe?
Give me a chance
How?
I have no choice before but now I want to turn over a new leaf
Good
Try telling that to the judge
See what he has to say
You want me dead?
Sorry, I'm a cop
Who knows that?
Don't move. Police
Drop your weapon and let lnspector Lau go first
Your boss is Sam's mole
I got evidence
Let's clear this up at the station
Drop your weapon now
I've called the police
Why should I trust you?
You don't have to
You'd better watch out
Look who's talking
I wish you every success in the police force
Bottoms up, officers
No sweat. We are brothers
Sam is dead now
You have to look after me
I joined the cadet school in 1994
But my career never really takes off
Sam looked down on me
I've taken care of Sam's tape
Don't worry. I'll follow you from now on
Our folks will be here any minute
Let's give them a good show
I'm actually quite smart
Too bad Sam never knew that
I'm a cop
Six months later, Dr. Lee Sum Yee was looking through the personal properties left by Officer Yip
Headmaster of the Cadet
She found Chen Wing-yan's file that proved his police identity
Chen Wing-yan is now buried next to SP Wong Chi-shing
How are you, Mr. Policeman?
Those who break the rules will be like him
They will be expelled
Anybody wants to trade place with him?
I do
Says the Buddha:
"He who is in Continuous Hell never dies
Longevity is a big hardship in Continuous Hell"
Oh, Harper. Left behind again.
Last time i wait around for anybody.
Okay.
Let's see if i made good on my promise here.
Huh, what do you know?
It worked.
Hey!
Don't suppose you're the welcoming committee.
Is that working?
Of course it is.
What do you think i am?
Look at it.
Look at it.
Wonderful.
Kill him!
This is the thanks i get for fixing the door?
Your days are over.
We've got to find the rock
Burma and his goons scrambled under.
Well, he can't have gone far.
Tarn vedra was his only option.
Tarn vedra has a lot of rocks,
And it's getting more crowded by the minute.
Blending in won't be hard.
Even with a hostage.
Even with a harper.
Almost makes you feel sorry for burma.
Seefra-2's evacuation's almost complete.
However, seefra-4 is officially burning.
We saved as many as we could, captain.
However,
The hydrogen ramscoop was successful.
Well, it's something we can be thankful for,
For the tarn vedran sun.
Oh, reposition us towards seefra-2
In case they need us there for final evacuations.
Repositioning. Repositioning.
Sorry, new habits die hard.
Why don't you go find harper now, okay?
Planet after planet,
It's the same thing over and over again.
The fighting, the whining, the questions... we've got a bigger problem.
Trance.
You got it.
She's working against us.
If it's the real trance.
Well, no matter who or what she is,
She's still an avatar,
And she'll be two steps ahead of us.
Captain, i have burma on comm.
This guy.
Put him through.
Dylan Hunt.
Just when you thought you'd won... oh, burma.
It isn't over until it's over.
Oh, it is over... for your scientist, seamus harper.
We've learned his value to you.
We have him, and we're going to kill him... unless... general burma, what's your price?
Price?
Everything we valued is gone,
Thanks to you
And what your technology has done to the seefra system.
Save a few million lives.
You're welcome.
All i know is you arrived in your big ship,
And the suffering started.
Right.
Everything was going so well before we got here.
I want you to experience
The same pain you inflicted on me
And my people- And the loss.
By killing harper?
He's important to you, i know.
A friend and a valuable resource.
I'm going to enjoy this.
Yeah, well,
Enjoy whatever sadistic pleasure it brings you, burma,
Because i don't have time to care.
Hunt out.
We're bluffing, right?
Yeah, we're bluffing.
I wonder if harper knows we're bluffing.
One problem at a time, rhade.
We have to find trance.
Do you have a plan?
Call it a hunch.
When we came back from fixing methus-2,
That's when trance started to seem different,
So i'm wondering
If the trance we went down with got left behind somehow.
Two trances.
Two trances.
She could be the same trance,
But changing,
As her sun gets closer.
There's only one way to find out.
Go back to methus-2.
You can't be serious.
In a matter of hours,
The tarn vedran sun will consume it,
Same as it did methus-1.
Well, then, we'd better hurry.
Great.
The universe is a dangerous place,
But in our future,
My crew and i fight to make it safe.
I am Dylan Hunt,
Captain of the Andromeda ascendant,
And these are our adventures.
While her whatchdogs follow a scent to methus-2
Poor lonely ship at sea.
They'll never find us.
Idiots.
And now for all you other lonely ships at sea,
More melodies to evacuate by... bring the scientist.
Now.
What's left of him.
So, you and rhade are going back into methus-2.
What's this?
High risk, high reward?
Something like that. Yes.
Dylan, you won't find her.
Thank you for your support.
Just so you know,
The trance we have onboard
Is heading toward command.
Dylan, you know,
You don't have a monopoly on caring for trance.
I've been with her for longer than you have.
Yeah, Dylan,
You should take beka with you.
I've already been there and done that.
Rhade.
Hmm?
As an android,
I can adjust my internal cooling systems,
Making me the best candidate.
Not the only android.
And her.
Fine.
Then we'll all go.
Forget about harper, forget about burma,
Forget about the refugees.
We'll all just go down to a live sun and have a picnic.
No need to be touchy.
We don't have time for this.
Two hours and counting.
I'm going with Dylan.
Thank you, rhade.
Beka, please.
You're in charge of Andromeda.
And find harper, okay?
Sounds good.
You and rhade go track down your friend.
Just be quick, please.
It's still my ship.
Trance, how you feeling?
Better, now that we're getting closer
To the tarn vedran sun.
Excellent.
You can help
With the evacuations and relocations.
I need all of you
To work together.
We're running out of time.
Yeah.
Change of plans.
There's a plan?
And i thought you were just the slash-And-Burn,
Evil dictator type.
I could've sworn you'd be dead by now.
Or is that giving you some kind of strength?
You're a real genius, huh?
It's a data port, for knowledge-
Something you're obviously lacking.
Now, what'd you have to go
And interrupt my torture session for?
I was just finally starting to go numb.
The point went out of it when i realized
Your captain doesn't care what happens to you.
Right.
Apparently,
He has more important things to deal with.
More like he realized i can take care of myself.
Obviously.
Too bad for you, huh?
Not when there's a better way to make him feel the pain.
Hurry up
And lick your wounds.
No, thanks.
You can lick 'em for me.
You're going to help get me onto
Andromeda while he's away.
Me?
Help you get onto the Andromeda?
Don't make me laugh.
Careful.
We need him functional.
No, go ahead.
Keep it up.
Ah! Yeah, that's it.
Because i ain't helping you.
Nobody gets onto the Andromeda
Without an all-Access pass
And the boss's approval,
And you're not getting either.
That's not the other choice, scientist.
The other choice is,
I fire a missile
Into the center of the seefra-1 landing port,
Full of incoming refugees.
He may not care about you,
But he'll care about the thousands of them.
Either way, Dylan Hunt will feel what it's like
To have things taken away from him,
Like he's taken from me.
So it doesn't matter what you choose, scientist.
Freaking psycho.
Methus-2, here we come.
Out of the frying pan and into the fire.
Rommie's shut it down.
We'll have time.
You know what's strange?
What's that?
The way you keep talking me into risking my life
On these long shots.
So it's strange because it keeps paying off?
The odds say one day, it won't.
Yeah, well, rhade, there are bigger risks in store
If we don't get to the bottom of a certain transformation.
Transformation- Humor to die by.
Yeah, well, i love to keep you laughing.
It's so horrible.
One by one, they go.
And now seefra-3.
You keep thinking it'll get easier,
But it never does.
In a few hours,
We can add seefra-2 and methus-2
To the list.
Yes, well, it may all be part of some grand design,
But it's still bloody tragic.
They did the job.
And they say inorganics lack emotion.
Speak for yourself.
I wasn't.
All right.
Obviously, standing here watching this disaster
Has become unproductive.
Agreed.
Dylan said there's much work to do.
The most important thing
Is to keep searching for harper.
Beka,
I have two seefra-1 landholders on comm
Asking for Dylan to resolve a dispute.
They seem to be fighting over
Who gets the better-Looking transport.
I'll handle that.
Why you?
Personally, i have the greater intuition.
No, no, and... definitely no.
Okay, i'm in charge here,
Which means i get the pleasure of dealing
With these bozos.
Rommie, you know
Andromeda's deep scan capabilities.
Doyle, you know seefra-1 inside and out.
Each of you stick to what each of you does best
And, hopefully, when burma comes out of hiding,
One of you will be there to nail him.
And me?
Stay close to me.
All right, andromeda.
Let's get this party started.
Put them on.
Lights out. It's party time.
We're going to go on the north side.
That mantle protected us from a flare the last time.
From your lips to tarn vedran sun's ear.
All right.
Preparing to initiate mantle breach on my mark.
Mark.
You got us on board
Without anyone knowing.
So far, i'm impressed.
I think a toaster would impress you.
Ouch!
You know, i can barely feel it now.
Finish the job,
Or i finish seefra's landing port.
Scanning sector five-Eight-One... scanning sector five-Eight-Two... this is hopeless.
Harper, please come in.
Increasing the carrier output
Won't get harper back on comm.
Clearly, burma took it away.
Harper is resourceful.
He may have made one
Out of broken glass by now,
For all we know.
And i hate
That you know my every move
On this ship.
Get used to it.
I don't need a lecture
About getting used to things.
Trust me.
I was merely suggesting a coping strategy.
I will cope when i find harper.
About that... if you were planning on going down to seefra-1,
Forget about it.
I have a drop pod waiting to take me.
Oh, no, that's the pod i ordered!
Like i said, get used to it.
I know seefra better than anyone.
I should be the one that looks for harper.
Ah, but it makes more sense
For the person who knows harper best
To be the one to go and look for him.
No, it doesn't. Yes, it does.
No, it doesn't.
Careful, don't blow a gasket.
Oh, isn't that the bot calling the metal black.
That would be harper's vain attempt
At giving you a sense of humor.
Is humor something
You're qualified to recognize?
I am the nebula.
The nebula is me.
Voila.
Ca fait complet.
The ship's sensors will no longer detect you.
Liar.
Is it that obvious?
Don't even bother trying to crack my code.
There's no way.
Your code versus the darkness.
How the hell did you do that?
Oh, no.
Dispose of him.
Hey!
Begin!
For a dark sun, it's hot.
Oh, come on, rhade,
You're a big, tough nietzschean.
You're just jealous.
What?
I'm sorry,
But boneblades never did it for me.
Don't knock it if you haven't tried it.
But i was talking about your age.
Oh, i see.
I'm jealous because you're younger than me?
That's right, hunt, by over 300 years.
Very funny.
For a minute there, i thought you were serious.
Let's just find the chamber and get out of here.
Let's get out of here.
Yeah.
Why do you keep putting us
In these situations?
Just luck, i guess.
Luck?
Luck has nothing to do with it.
You have a death wish.
No, no, no.
I'm just old, remember?
I'm senile.
I keep forgetting
That this kind of stuff can kill you.
Oh, yeah. That would have killed us.
So, what do you think?
This way.
I think it's this way.
No, no, no.
We are listening to me for a change.
This way.
Not a word.
I wasn't going to say anything.
You have the ship to take care of.
Unlike you,
I can be in two places at once.
Oh, wait a minute.
Make that three.
Some would call that a personality disorder.
I prefer to think of it
As a multi-Faceted personality.
Uh-Oh.
We are not the droids you're looking for.
What is that?
I don't know, but it didn't work.
Rommie, down.
What's with this guy?
I don't know.
Too bad you didn't show up
A minute sooner.
Oh, that's right. You did.
You were both doing very well, i thought,
Considering.
Yeah, well,
I want to know who they are
And how they got on board
Without me knowing.
They're burma's men.
Sometimes i get impressions.
What the hell's going on?
We've been invaded.
How many are there?
Well, there would be no way of knowing,
Because my onboard sensors
Have been disabled.
Again.
By these guys?
They brought Harper.
He must be on board somewhere.
There's no going right,
There's no going left,
And there's certainly no going back.
That leaves either up... or down.
Whatever.
That's the spirit, Rhade.
Fusion chamber's this way.
How do you know?
Because i'm a paradine. Really?
Nah, i just saw a sign that said
"Fusion chamber."
Oh.
I'm bred for survival-
So right now you'll have to excuse me,
Because every fiber of my being
Is screaming to get out of here.
That's why i appreciate
You helping me to find trance.
You're a good sport, rhade.
Well, it's better than being with the ladies.
Harper?
Well, this is where he'd come to hide.
If he could.
Look, we all know the logical conclusion,
But let's not go there unless we have to.
No messages, either.
I can't believe harper would let those men on board
Without leaving some kind of something.
What code word are you trying?
Rom-Doll.
That would be the one.
Try "dreamdoyle."
What?
I didn't invent me.
Okay.
No. No go on either of them.
Hmm.
Okay, so we don't know where harper is.
We're just going to have to assume he's okay.
Meanwhile, we have an invasion on our hands.
First thing we're going to have to figure out is,
What do they want?
Oh, good.
We can ask them.
Not again. I'm barely recharged.
That was my guy.
Not anymore!
Sometimes you got to make do.
How you doing?
Good. You?
Good.
Beka?
I got it.
Hiiyee! Giddyap!
This is it.
This is it!
If we don't get out of here soon.
The fusion container, it's still in one piece.
Dylan.
Trance's cloak.
The vapor's too thick to see if there's anything inside.
There's got to be a way to empty it.
Got it.
Let him go.
You're exhausted.
Well, at least we got most of them.
They're kind of tough.
Really?
It's not just me?
No, they're something else.
Maybe some kind of... alien.
Where did he go?
Okay.
So they don't stay down
And they disappear.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Oh, please don't lock me up!
Who are you?
I'm an evacuee from seefra-4.
You mean you're not
One of Dylan Hunt's people?
Not even close.
Oh, good. Then you can help me.
They promised me safety,
And now i don't know what's going on.
This ship is so big,
And there's so much fighting
And it's cold-
You shouldn't have accepted their help.
They're liars.
Liars?
No. No!
I gave up everything for them.
I have no one to protect me.
I have nowhere to go. Don't say that.
Calm down.
It's okay.
You can come with us.
Do you mean that?
I'm sure i can, uh... convince my leader.
I would really like to show you my... appreciation.
Explosives.
So now we know what burma's up to.
Revenge on Dylan
By blowing up the Andromeda.
It gets worse.
They're not human.
I've detected radical isotopes.
What?
What? What are those?
Apparently harper didn't program you
With knowledge of the abyss.
Who knew he'd need to?
I've got something here
That's going to hurt a lot worse
If you don't tell me
What the hell you did with harper.
Harper!
He's... he's dead.
I'm feeling emotions i never thought i'd have.
I know what you mean.
All those times i teased him.
Abused him.
Stole his share of a salvage without telling him.
What?
Very good. Very good.
Almost had you fooled, though, right?
It's an old meditation trick
I learned from rev bem.
Can you blame me for taking the opportunity
To hear what my three favorite ladies
Would say at my funeral?
You suck at playing dead.
Well, you suck at playing sad.
Some performances were better than others, though.
Yeah, that was almost as shameless
As that act you pulled with the guard.
Thank you.
What guard?
What guard?
What did i miss?
A lot.
But first, you've got to get control of the ship
Back from burma.
While we have some housekeeping to attend to.
And i have a date
With a friend i'd hoped never to see again.
Where might i find him?
I think he was saving the biggest bomb for command.
Right.
Ladies... she is not in here.
Trance!
Trance!
It's over!
It's not over, rhade.
She's here. I can feel it.
You can feel it?
Sorry.
Sorry.
What the hell you doing?
Trance.
Dylan... i knew you'd come.
Right there, burma.
Beka valentine.
We meet again.
We were quite... intimate once.
You remember the abyss,
Don't you?
Trance?
She's in bad shape.
Trance,
Methus-2 is disintegrating from the inside out.
It's my sun's fault.
Listen to me.
You can use it. Pull energy from it.
You've done it before.
For Andromeda, remember?
It's your sun.
You can get strength from it.
My life force.
That's right.
Take what you need.
Come on, trance.
Is there a way out?
I'd hoped we'd meet again.
That makes one of us.
You can't defeat the abyss.
I don't remember you being this much of a fighter.
I wasn't.
Someone else had to do it for me.
Not this time.
This time i'll win,
And you'll be mine forever.
I had a less depressing destiny in mind.
You know who burma is, beka.
Thanks for the input, trance, but i'm a little busy right now.
Beka.
On command.
All right, andromeda,
This should get you back on-Line.
Andromeda,come in.
Come on.
What the hell did he do, anyway?
Andromeda,report.
All right.
I think i got it.
Yes!
Captain, your arrival is timely.
We're on time.
Split up. Find burma.
Find him?
I'm going to kill him.
You can't kill the abyss, beka.
What are you, one of them?
Because you sure as hell aren't trance.
Mortals are such strange creatures.
They are trapped by fear,
The fear of death,
Yet death would set them free.
A new kind of freedom.
Who are you?
We're with her.
Hmm.
It's time for you to choose.
I'm going to have one of you.
Which of you will it be?
Burma,
You are such a drama queen.
Dylan Hunt.
Perfect.
I came to bring you pain.
Pick which of your friends
Will die.
I think i'd rather have you die.
If you shoot, i shoot.
Pick!
Now.
That felt good.
Yes, it did.
You're not-
I am.
You were supposed to be
Consumed by the sun.
Why was i left there?
You are not of the same mind as we are.
And what mind is that, sister?
I'm begging you to tell me.
This isn't over, trance gemini.
I guess that's what they call a black hole.
Beka, are you all right?
I'm all right now.
Dylan, i was afraid.
We should all be afraid.
It's not over yet.
This is it.
Methus-2 is officially gone.
Come on, vedran braking system.
I fear i am definitely out of possible futures.
This will work.
I feel it.
I know it.
Solar impact
With seefra-1 in 58 seconds.
Impact in 46 seconds.
Well, when used appropriately,
Vedran technology can be very reliable.
At least that's what i'm holding onto.
Yeah, plus, how many times
Has trance been wrong?
In this case, she only has to be wrong once.
I'm with harper on this one.
Dylan,
We better get ready to get the heck out of here.
It's too late.
It's stopping?
I think it's stopping.
It's stopping, right? Tell me it's stopping, rommie.
Incorrect.
What?
Ithasstopped.
Well done... everyone.
Mr. Harper,
Let's talk about burma.
What's to talk about?
He's a dangerous, misguided creep
With lots of unfocused anger.
How did he get on the ship, harper?
That's a great question.
Maybe i better check the ship for glitches.
See what burma and his boys did, huh?
Harper, how did he get on board?
Harper!
Harper had no choice, dylan.
You can blame his supposed superior intellect
Or his confirmed physical weakness.
The choice is yours.
Well, he did save me from having to save his life.
Actually, when you let burma think
You didn't care if he killed harper,
And you knew it wouldn't end there,
You did save his life.
And when you were on methus-2,
You knew we could take care of burma.
I didn't know that.
Well, now you do.
And now that you know that we've succeeded as a team-
Now that, i already knew.
Yes, but now you can take a vacation.
Or a nap.
A nap?
You know what?
Maybe i should take a nap,
And let you guys do all my work.
A long nap.
Welcome back.
Things will never be the way they were.
There will be repercussions.
There always are, trance, but today is a good day.
You know,
We did kick butt rather spectacularly.
We flattened those abyssholes.
It was rather enjoyable.
Speak for yourself.
You only had one guy.
Yeah, the abyss.
At one time,
I was fighting off 10 men.
I? We.
We, we.
Ladies, ladies, ladies.
Trance?
You coming?
Oh, so i finally figured out
Harper's password-
Valentine.
Are you sure you spelled "dreamdoyle" right?
A nap.
Someday.
[Scooby chomps and giggles]
[Rock version of Scooby Doo theme song]
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Ghost cackles]
DAPHNE: Shaggy!
DAPHNE: Now I really have a wedgie.
Fred! Velma!
Can you guys hurry it up?
This ghost keeps grabbing...
[Daphne screams]
DAPHNE: Please!
Jinkies!
Fred.
VELMA: Come in, Fred. 
VELMA: Fred. Can you hear me? 
FRED: Fredster here, Velms.
VELMA: Shockingly, Daphne's
been captured again. That's okay. 
When the Luna Ghost rounds the corner with Daphne...
... Shaggy and Scooby
will pop out of the barrel... 
And you'll activate the conveyor belt, spilling the vat of oil onto the floor.
VELMA: Just remember my plan. 
SHAGGY: Like, chill out, Scooby Doo.
Stop shaking.
SCOOBY: Hey! That's you.
SHAGGY: Right. It's me. Sorry!
Boo!
[Scooby screams]
[Whispers] Scooby Doo.
What are you doing, man?
SHAGGY: Like, this is no time...
Oh, boy. Like, there's a ghost right behind me, isn't there?
[Scooby grunts assent]
Run!
SCOOBY: Run! Go!
SHAGGY: I'm trying, buddy!
[Scooby screams]
[Yells] Fred, now!
FRED: I got him.
SCOOBY: Look out!
FRED: Sorry, Velma.
VELMA: I know, Fred.
SHAGGY: Where's the ghost?
He's right behind us! Skateboard!
[Shaggy yells]
[Ghost cackles]
Is he still after us, Scoob?
Banzai!
Zoinks!
SHAGGY: Grab the hook!
SCOOBY: Hold on, Shaggy!
VELMA: Daphne? Are you okay?
I'm so over this
''damsel in distress'' nonsense.
Where's Shagster?
- Like, I'm right here, man.
- Me, too.
Scoob, that was fun. Let's grab another skateboard and, like, do it again.
[Scooby giggles]
[Fred gasps]
[Tires screech]
[Rock 'n' roll music]
[Fans scream]
FRED: There you go.
And one for you.
Good-looking guy.
FRED: All right, nice to see you.
Thank you so much for saving the factory.
REPORTER: Any comments?
FRED: It's my job.
This is a victory for any celebrity who wants...
...to make a quality, ecologically-friendly action figure.
Fred, what's the secret of your success?
Teamwork.
I do a tremendous amount of teamwork...
...and I always have a plan. Come on.
Yeah, my plan.
FRED: I knew there never was a phantom.
The Luna Ghost is, in fact...
ALL: Old Man Smithers?
The creepy janitor?
He wanted revenge after you refused to go out with him.
How could you, Pamela?
I am a lover boy of George Clooneyan proportions.
REPORTER: Fred, how was the ghost able to fly?
VELMA: I can answer that.
VELMA: Watch.
These balloons fill with a highly potent helium synthesis...
...giving the Luna Ghost...
...his weightless appearance.
I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling kids...
...and your dumb dog!
I'll get you for this!
[Howls] Scooby Dooby Doo!
[lndistinct chatter]
VELMA: I can't believe you took credit for my plan again.
DAPHNE: Some plan.
That ghost pawed me for an hour and a half.
FRED: Daph, it's not our fault you always get kidnapped.
I do not always get kidnapped.
I can't believe you'd say that to me.
Please.
You come with your own ransom note. 
- My glasses!
- Who's helpless now?
I'm going to kill you, Daphne!
[Fred yelps]
Watch the ascot!
SHAGGY: You guys, look.
I know I'm just the dude that carries the bags...
...but it seems to me we all play an important part in this group.
I mean, we're just like a big, delicious banana split.
Fred, you're the big banana.
Daph, you're the pastrami and bubble gum flavored ice cream, and Velma...
...you're the sweet and sour mustard sauce that goes on top.
That sounds pretty good, doesn't it?
You know what, Shaggy?
You've really put it into perspective for me.
Thanks.
I quit.
No.
No way.
You can't quit. 
I was going to quit in, like, two seconds.
Now everyone is going to totally think
I copied off the smart girl.
Now, wait a minute!
Maybe I quit.
I do.
Yeah, I quit!
I'm outta here.
Good riddance.
Don't... No! Don't go!
SHAGGY: Come on, you guys, don't do this!
Please, don't go.
Do I quit?
No, Scoob...
...friends don't quit.
SHAGGY: Well, it looks like it's just you
and me for a while, buddy, old pal. 
SCOOBY: What now, Shaggy? 
SHAGGY: I guess we'll all just do
what we do best, Scoob. 
[Lively reggae music]
SHAGGY: This is primo.
Oh, man. 
Talk about toasted. 
The only thing I like better than an eggplant burger...
...is a chocolate-covered eggplant burger.
With hot sauce.
Yeah. Just another beautiful day in paradise.
ISLAND EMISSARY: I'm looking for a
Mr. Rogers and a Mr. Doo, the detectives?
Like, it's probably somebody else looking for us to solve some terrifying mystery.
Nobody home.
Quick, Scoob-o.
Grab the food-o, let's scram-o.
ISLAND EMISSARY: I'm looking for a Mr.
Rogers and Mr. Doo.
SHAGGY: Let's go.
I'm sorry, dude.
Look, I'd love to help you out.
You look like a really nice guy.
It's just we're not detectives anymore.
I've been sent by my employer,
Mr. Emile Mondavarious, to invite you...
...to his world-famous amusement park,
Spooky Island.
We don't go near any place with spooky, haunted, forbidden, or creepy in the name.
Or hydrocolonic.
Right, or hydrocolonic, but that's for a whole different reason.
Mr. Mondavarious would like you to solve a mystery.
He'll pay you a fee of $10,000.
It's just, materialism's not really our bag, man.
- He can provide free airfare.
- No, thanks.
- Room and board.
- No, thanks.
And all you can eat.
SCOOBY: ''All you can eat? ''
- Fred?
- Velma?
Are you going this way?
How have you...
Been?
Yeah.
Great! Great. I'm on the lecture circuit with my new book.
''Fred on Fred: The Many Faces of Me. ''
Jinkies, that's impressive.
And yourself?
I've been working at NASA, developing hydro-powered missile defense systems.
But, more importantly,
I'm on a journey of self-discovery.
NASA, huh?
ANNOUNCER: Charter service to Spooky
Island will begin boarding momentarily. 
DAPHNE: What do you mean,
I can't have seven carry-on bags?
DAPHNE: That is so economy.
VELMA: Crap.
Oh, no.
I'm not talking to you guys.
What are you doing here?
VELMA: Isn't it obvious?
We all received the same letter from one Emile Mondavarious...
...the reclusive owner of Spooky Island.
Unfair! I was going to solve the mystery all by myself, for the first time ever.
How are you going to save yourself when you get caught?
DAPHNE: I'm a black belt.
I've transformed my body into a dangerous weapon.
It's true.
Far out. I guess we're, like, all going to Spooky Island, man.
Hey, where's Scooby?
[Funky rap music]
[Whistles and catcalls]
Hello.
They don't allow big dogs on the plane.
You've got to be kidding.
No one is stupid enough to believe that.
Who's the ugly old broad?
Say hello to Grandma.
ANNOUNCER:
Flight 3774 to Spooky Island, now boarding. 
Listen, I wouldn't have agreed to come if I knew...
Wait, just think about it for one minute.
Mystery Inc reunites.
We'll be a team again. 
Just like the old days. 
So, come on, gang. 
Let's do that thing where we put our hands in, lift them up, and we go...
[Shaggy cheers]
Only if Fred and Velma do it.
People are watching, Shag.
[Soft piano music plays]
[Scooby cheers]
Yeah, Scoob! Whoo-hoo!
Come on, buddy.
[Loud rock 'n' roll music]
Now, that is a beautiful work of art, Scoob.
[Soft dreamlike music]
Would you mind me taking a seat there next to...
To my Grandma? That's my grandma.
Hi, Grandma. Like, no.
- Let me just...
- Thanks.
You're welcome.
Bless you.
I'm sorry. My allergies are...
Well, it's usually only dogs that do it.
Maybe I'd better move.
No. Wait.
It's probably just my grandma's perfume.
Yeah, even I sometimes get a little allergic, you know. Jeez. Look.
I'm pretty sure Grandma wants to go back and visit with her old pal, Velma.
Right, Grandma?
Okay.
Boy, oh, boy, those sure do look like Scooby Snacks.
I know they're for dogs...
...but they're 100 percent vegetarian and I love them.
Me, too!
Far out. I have never met another person who loves Scooby Snacks.
Me neither.
I'm Mary Jane.
SHAGGY: That is my favorite name.
MARY JANE: Really?
- Yeah.
- No way.
Hello.
[Scooby barks loudly]
Grandma?
Velma, it's simple behavior modification.
To cause a dog to discontinue any action, simply flick it on the nose. Observe.
See?
SHAGGY: Sit, Grandma! Bad Grandma! 
Don't eat the kitty! 
[Tribal instrumental music]
EMILE: Welcome to Spooky Island... 
... the frightfully popular spring break spot
for college students! 
Catch our Electrical Torture Parade... 
... lt's a Dead World After All... 
... and the world-famous Splatter Horn. 
Scooby Doo and the rest of Mystery Inc! 
It's marvelous to see you. 
I'm so sorry. 
Thank goodness.
Sorry. It's a new toy.
I'm just sort of getting up to speed with it.
EMILE: Welcome.
DAPHNE: Thank goodness.
I was afraid
I'd have to lug those up to the hotel.
But that's what Spooky Island's all about, realizing your worst fears.
EMILE: I'm Emile Mondavarious...
...the owner of this amusement park.
VELMA: You seem less...
- Spooky!
- Then we'd have guessed.
I can be pretty spooky when called upon.
EMILE: Oh, I can go...
[Emile snarls]
And claws and everything.
You wouldn't want to run into me in a dark alley.
So you're the one who brought us here?
No.
No, what brought you here was your insatiable appetite for a juicy mystery.
The truth is, Mr. Mondavarious,
Mystery Inc is broken up.
That's the beauty of something broken.
It can be fixed, and therein lies its potential.
And I need you to fix Spooky Island.
VELMA: What's the problem?
EMILE: I believe somebody is casting a spell on the students.
EMILE: Now listen and look around.
Can you notice any difference between
those arriving and those departing? 
DAPHNE: They look like sober, well-behaved college kids.
EMILE: Precisely. And they didn't before they came.
They've changed.
In other words, a magic spell.
BRAD: Carol! How was the Island?
Are you tricking on me?
It's me, Brad. We've known each other since we were, like, three.
CAROL: Back off my grille!
BRAD: What are you doing?
I'm terrified.
The young people
that come off that barge... 
...the people I love the most, they're in danger.
I will solve this one first.
FRED: Not before I solve it first.
EMILE: Well done.
You guys are going to look like total idiots when you're captured and I save you.
Thank you. Marvelous.
EMILE: Maybe we can celebrate later by having a little Spookapalooza.
Spookapalooza?
[Ominous tribal drums]
So, you haven't noticed anything unusual since you've started working here?
Any weirdoes running around? 
SKELETON: No.
[Ominous tribal chanting]
N'GOO: Welcome, dear victims!
My name is N'Goo Tauna...
...and this is my evil best pal, Zarkos.
You may recognize him from Telemundo as the famous, masked wrestler...
... Zarkos. 
This enchanted island... 
... is a thoroughfare
to the supernatural realm. 
For centuries it was home to creatures... 
... who lived on the island, undisturbed. 
But then... 
...10 years ago...
... Emile Mondavarious... 
... antagonized these ancient beings
by building a theme park here. 
The creatures are furious, my friends...
...and I assure you...
...while you party...
...they plot their...
...revenge!
N'GOO: Do my friends frighten you?
They would if it weren't for the holographic projectors...
...there, and there, and there.
What a smart little one.
[Spooky rap music]
Hello. Dead Mike's.
BARTENDER: We got a Mr. Doo here?
I got a call for a Mr. Doo. 
Melvin Doo?
No, Scooby.
Hello.
MAN: Got a bag of hamburgers here... 
... for you. 
Just walk into the dark, 
shadowy part of the forest... 
... where no one can see you. 
Okay.
SHAGGY: Want a stuffed thingy?
MARY JANE: Nobody can win at those.
SHAGGY: Fred says it's a worthless talent.
That I should've learned French instead.
But, I say you don't need to know what
''Voulez-vous coucher avec moi'' means...
SHAGGY: to love that song.
I think being good at crane machine is way cooler than French.
Voilà.
Nobody's ever given me a stuffed, dismembered head before.
[Shouting and chanting]
[Chanting and grunting]
Excuse me.
What are you doing?
Now I have to start my voodoo ritual all over again!
- Voodoo ritual?
- Yes. I was about to sacrifice this chicken.
DAPHNE: But that chicken's not alive.
VOODOO MAN: I know that, smart girl.
You figured it out when you saw it didn't have a head?
What do you want? 
Why are you all up in my voodoo ritual space?
I'm looking for clues as to who's behind the strange behavior of the students.
Well, here's a clue. Purple is a fall color.
It's the middle of May!
Pardon?
Do yourself a favor and get off this island.
Go home.
Go home before evil befalls your little, skinny, aerobicized booty.
VOODOO MAN: And whatever you do...
...do not, I repeat...
... do not go into that Spooky Island castle. 
- You want me to go up to that castle.
- Didn't you just hear what I said?
But you're scary and you knew
I'd do the opposite of what you said.
So you told me not to go, so I'd go up to that castle...
...where you've set a trap to capture me.
Unless...
...you knew I'd figure it out, so you told me not to go up to the castle...
...so I'd think you wanted me to go, so I wouldn't go, like you didn't want me to.
DAPHNE: I'll find out what you're hiding in that castle. You watch.
What in the world?
Hamburgers...
... oh, where are you? 
SCOOBY: Hamburgers.
Thank you.
[Ghoul murmurs]
[Ghoul shrieks]
Shaggy, help me!
This has been really nice.
SCOOBY: [Yells] Help!
Monster!
A monster?
Scooby Doo!
Like, quit goofing around, man.
MARY JANE: I guess I should go.
'Bye, Scooby.
Bless you.
Shaggy, Scooby.
[Mysterious howling]
No way.
Shaggy.
SHAGGY: Scoob and me don't do castles.
DAPHNE: Why not?
Paintings with eyes watching you, suits of armor you think is a statue...
...but there's a guy inside who follows you every time you turn around.
DAPHNE: How many times has it happened?
SHAGGY: Twelve.
SHAGGY: We're not gonna do it.
SCOOBY: That's right.
Scooby?
DAPHNE: Did you hurt your paw?
- Would you do it for a Scooby Snack?
- Oh, boy!
You'll be fearless?
Fearless?
Hong Kong Fuey, watch the fists of fury, would you, buddy!
Here you go.
Thank you.
There's plenty more where that came from.
Let's go before someone sees.
SCOOBY: Okay.
You are not going to stay out here alone, are you?
No, thank you.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
SHAGGY: This place is like, über creepy.
SCOOBY: Yeah, über creepy.
DAPHNE: The only thing missing is a mindless zombie.
[Door bursts open]
DAPHNE: Fred, get back.
I found this place. I call dibs on its clues.
I've already found some clues.
What?
I followed some weird footprints up here and it might be dangerous for you.
If anyone messes with me...
...l'll just open a can of 2000-year-old
Chinese whup-ass on them.
Velma!
What are you doing here?
VELMA: This ride was closed due to dangerous construction.
The most likely place to hatch an insidious plan...
...and I wanted to scare the patootie out of Daphne.
Well, since we're all together, let's split up and look for more clues.
- Daphne, you and I...
- Typical.
What?
Oh, nothing.
I was always picked last for the teams.
FRED: Okay.
Daphne, exit through the entrance.
Velma and I will enter here through the exit there.
And Shaggy and Scooby...
...do whatever you guys do.
[Door creaking open]
[Distant cackling]
[Mystical instrumental music]
Look at this, Scoob.
SHAGGY: It's like a medieval Sizzler.
Pinch me, I'm in... It's an expression, Scoob.
Sorry.
[Daphne grunts]
FRED: Hey, Velma, I never meant to, well, you know...
...pick you last.
Don't worry about it, Fred. I know you.
All you care about are swimsuit models.
No! Look, I'm a man of substance.
Dorky chicks like you turn me on, too.
That's a compliment.
Yes!
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Uh-huh!
PHANTOM: And now for our dinner show! 
[Evil cackling and laughing]
VELMA: Watch out!
SHAGGY: I got a bad feeling about this.
SCOOBY: Me, too.
PHANTOM: And now for the main course: 
You! 
Feast on this! 
VELMA: Jinkies!
VELMA: They're moving toward us.
FRED: We're trapped!
VELMA: Try the bookcase.
What?
One of these has got to open a secret passageway!
Velma, this is a ride!
VELMA: You got a better plan, Fred?
SCOOBY: What do we do?
Do what we do best, Scoob! Eat!
It's plastic!
What do you care?
You drink out of a toilet!
So do you!
DAPHNE: I'm not helpless. I'm not helpless.
I am helpless. I'm going to die!
We made it, Scoob! We're alive!
SHAGGY: That was weird.
Fred?
Freddy? 
Are you all right?
VELMA: The last book.
I don't feel so good.
Reminds me of the time when we tried to eat that guy in the hot dog costume.
FRED: Looks like some kind of school.
VELMA: In a spooky castle ride? Fishy.
[Eerie instrumental music]
INSTRUCTOR: Welcome to America. 
I am using the language English. 
SCOOBY: Shaggy, look.
SHAGGY: Let's check it out.
Oh, boy. Lights, camera, action!
Huh, Scoob?
INSTRUCTOR:
Now that you're a young adult... 
... you'll need to learn societal do's... 
... and don'ts. 
Interaction between young people
is polite and casual. 
Sorry, bro. 
I will crush your bones into dust. 
Let's see how the situation
should be handled. 
Remember, today's young people
have a language all their own. 
Sorry, bro. 
No big whoop, dog. 
Yo, did you catch that new vid on the box? 
True dat. 
I'm up to snizzuff on all popular trends. 
Word. 
It seems to be a brainwashing facility of some type.
VELMA: Wherever there's a brainwashing cult...
...there's always a power-hungry leader behind it all. The Papa Smurf figure.
Mondavarious.
Then why would he have invited us here?
[Ominous music]
[Mysterious whispered chanting]
[Daphne screams]
[Triumphant music]
Jellybeans.
[Scooby burps]
I'll have whatever he's having.
Are you challenging me?
[Gunslinging duel music]
Maybe.
[Scooby burps challengingly]
Pull my finger. Too late!
SHAGGY: You're in trouble.
SCOOBY: Oh, boy!
[Shaggy farts powerfully]
I'm not stopping until your fur is singed off.
We're here to solve a mystery.
Yes, Scoob.
[Alarm sounds]
Let's get out of here.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
I found a neat and scary clue.
Us, too. We think this is a brainwashing facility for an evil cult.
Well, maybe this is the sacred relic thingy they worship.
SHAGGY: We're all gonna be relics if we don't get out of here, man.
FRED: I got a plan.
ZARKOS: What's this smell?
HENCHMAN: Sir, they found the Daemon Ritus.
ZARKOS: For your sake, they better not have gone far.
It is time to summon the big muchachos.
SHAGGY: Oh, no!
[Shaggy farts loudly]
[Lively music]
Mystery Inc. You all seem rather cheery.
Good news, I hope?
- Mr. Mononucleosis.
- Yes?
We have hit a clue smorgasbord.
We have three suspects as to who's behind this evil hoody.
N'Goo Tauna.
VELMA: He believes your theme park's
been built on enchanted ground. 
DAPHNE: The Voodoo Man, who shrewdly
tricked me into going to the castle. 
- And you.
- Me?
FRED: Gang, let's split up.
We'll meet back here in a half hour.
I'll interview employees, see if they've noticed anything odd.
I'm gonna get to work translating these inscriptions that Daphne found.
I'll go research cults on the Net.
I'm a suspect?
Don't take it personally.
It's mostly just because you creep me out.
Oh, I see.
Fine.
VELMA: Jinkies.
[Eerie instrumental music]
Hey. Your friends ditch you?
No, I always do the brain work.
What's this?
I believe it's called the Daemon Ritus.
BOY: Daemon Ritus? What's it for?
VELMA: I think this describes a very old race of creatures.
These inscriptions are reminiscent
of ancient Pandamenous texts... 
... so I can make some of it out. 
It looks like instructions to some sort of secret ritual.
VELMA: It is fascinating.
BARTENDER: On the house.
Nice sweater. 
You really dig doing this, huh?
Like, clues and stuff. 
Certainly. Really focusing on a mystery reminds me of the old days.
VELMA: We were quite a crew back then. 
That was the best time of my life. 
Shaggy and Scooby. What goofballs! 
Kind of like they are today. 
And Daphne was so beautiful. 
She was the coolest girl at Coolsville High. 
Fred. He was so handsome. 
And he really knew how to accessorize. 
BOY: Sounds perfect. 
VELMA: Yeah, but every family has one nut. 
Scrappy-dappy-doo!
Ghosts don't stand a chance with me!
Let me at them! I'll rack them!
I'll sock them!
Scrappy, for the 1000th time, there's no such thing as ghosts.
Sure there are.
And when I find them,
I'll give them a good dose of puppy power!
Oh, God. He's peeing on me!
VELMA: That little egomaniac
had flipped his lid. 
Scrappy, I told you.
No urinating on Daphne!
- It was an accident.
- You were marking your territory!
You don't have the scrote for this job, pally.
Listen up, losers. The time has come that you appoint me your unquestioned leader.
Either that or I'm outta here!
What's the idea? You can't do this to me!
People adore me!
I'm as cute as a Powerpuff Girl!
I'll get my own TV show!
Puppy power, huh?
VELMA: And he wasn't even a puppy.
He had a gland disorder.
[Laughing]
[Whistling]
[Screams] Yikes!
SHAGGY: [Screams] Help me! Help me!
Monsters!
Scooby, this is the most embarrassing thing you've done...
...since you decided to clean your beans at Don Knotts' Christmas party.
How many times do I have to tell you?
There are no such things as ghouls, ghosts, goblins, or monsters.
Now listen up. There is absolutely...
...absolutely no such thing as...
[Yells] Monster!
Fred!
FRED: Scooby!
Save Daphne!
My glasses.
I can't find my glasses. 
[Glass breaking]
VELMA: I can't find my glasses.
DEMON: Here we are.
Thank you.
Nice mask. Bad breath.
Jinkies.
Velma!
BOY: Velma!
This is, like, the opposite of what I wanted to do today.
[Chaotic instrumental music]
[Beasts roaring]
Stand back, sir! I'll protect you.
Mr. Mondavarious!
SHAGGY: Daphne, go!
[Yells] Scooby Doo, where are you?
[Loud funky music]
SCOOBY:
Grammy's suitcase. Grammy's suitcase.
Thank you.
DAPHNE: Where's Scooby?
SHAGGY: I don't know. I hope he's okay.
Right here. Scooby Dooby Doo!
[Yell] Scooby!
I have a sinking feeling these dudes aren't brainwashed cult members.
Then what are they? And what do they want with the college students?
We need to follow them.
Say what?
So we can defeat the creatures and save Fred and Velma!
Well, that's sort of like my plan.
Which is: Get the heck out of here.
Let the creatures eat Fred and Velma!
No way! Fred and Velma always figured out everything.
Now it's our turn, Shaggy.
For the first time, they're the damsels in distress.
Not me.
DAPHNE: Help?
SHAGGY: Timber.
- Okay, I'm calling for help.
- No.
No, I got this. I got this.
I don't got this.
Coast Guard, Fitzgibbon.
Hello, sir. We're on Spooky Island.
Our friends were...
...kidnapped.
MARY JANE: We need someone here
right away! 
Well, we do have a unit in the vicinity.
Can you meet them at the pier?
They'll be right there.
''Our friends have been kidnapped. ''
[Laughing evilly]
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
DAPHNE: Something messed up is happening.
Is the Coast Guard here?
SHAGGY: What happened to the shattered windows and the busted walls?
Yo, Red. The ball.
DAPHNE: Let's go.
[Lively rock 'n' roll music]
SHAGGY: Does anyone else think this is strange?
DAPHNE: Okay. We need to split up.
SHAGGY: Why?
We still need to find Fred and Velma.
- I'll go this way.
- And we'll go with you.
Come on, Scoob.
Fred?
Yo, yo! The bee-atch was like, ''What? ''
And I was like, ''Later on! ''
What up, dog?
And dog.
Keepin' it real.
What happened last night?
We got beats like it was the lizz nizz on earth.
FRED: Know what I'm saying, G?
SHAGGY: No.
Do you hear that?
Get the dog!
ZARKOS: Damsel in distress.
DAPHNE: Let go of me!
Help!
SHAGGY: Hurry, get the door!
SCOOBY: Why is Fred in a bad mood?
SHAGGY: He is not in a bad mood, Scoob!
He is a monster!
Shaggy, bikes!
SHAGGY: I know, yikes!
SCOOBY: No, bikes!
[Revving bike engines]
[Cheering and whooping]
SCOOBY: Look out!
[Gasps] I saw my friend.
There's something wrong with her eyes.
Hop on!
SHAGGY: What a drag!
SHAGGY: Duck!
[Ominous music]
[Dramatic tribal beat]
[Tires screeching]
MARY JANE: That was great!
SHAGGY: Man, oh man, are you all right?
SHAGGY: You were great.
MARY JANE: You, too.
[Barking]
What are you doing, man?
Mary Jane is a man in a mask!
- ''Mary Jane is a man in a mask? ''
- Scooby!
SHAGGY: Dude, what are you doing, man?
Step off, Scoob.
Shaggy, you're whipped!
I'm whipped? Yeah?
Well, why don't you say that to my face?
Okay, I will. Your mommy eats cat poop!
No, Scooby Doo, your mom eats cat poop!
You want some?
You want a little piece of the Shagster?
Feel the pain, Scoob!
SHAGGY: Come on! Two shots!
Me and you, me and you again. 
SHAGGY: I'll give you something.
[Shouts] Scoob!
Scooby's been eaten. I gotta save him.
You stay here. I'll be right back.
[Ghoul voice] No, Shaggy.
I mean, it's too dangerous.
I've got to. He's, like, my best pal.
Friends don't quit.
[Yelling]
[Whispers] Scoob?
SHAGGY: Scooby Doo.
Where are you?
Scoob!
[Eerie instrumental music]
VELMA: Shaggy! Shaggy!
VELMA: Shaggy!
Velma?
SHAGGY: I'll save you.
VELMA: Thanks, Shaggy.
Boy, am I glad to see you.
Let me go so I can return to my body, and then get out of here...
...before they find you and steal your protoplasm, too.
VELMA:
I always knew you were a hero, Shaggy.
VELMA: [Yells] Jinkies!
[Ghoul screaming]
[Screaming]
SHAGGY: Hey, buddy.
FRED: Shaggy. Listen, man.
Someone must have spiked my root beer last night. Talk me down, man!
Talk me down!
Fred, you're a frigging protoplasmic head.
I know.
But I'm still the best-looking protoplasmic head here.
FRED: How do you drive this thing?
FAKE FRED: The Darkopolypse is upon us.
Gather what you need for the ceremony.
FRED: On your right. The left.
FRED: I'm coming, good-looking!
Thank you so much! You've saved me!
Thank you!
Sorry, I'm looking for my friends.
Put me back, Shaggy.
I'll figure a way out myself.
- Like, how?
- I don't know.
I'll use my tongue as an oar and swim to the edge.
Sorry.
[Eerie instrumental music]
VELMA: Yo, yo, you, yo.
You could use a little sunlight.
VELMA: That's one part of the mystery solved.
The creatures must need our bodies to survive in sunlight.
Like a human suit.
SPF 1,000,000.
But what are they doing here in the first place?
Daphne, you okay?
FRED'S SOUL: Yeah.
FRED'S SOUL: But I'm not Daphne!
Fred?
FRED'S SOUL: I couldn't get to my body.
I didn't know where else to go. I panicked!
FRED'S SOUL: It's not easy to steer when you're pure spirit.
FRED'S SOUL: I can look at myself naked.
Oh, brother.
DAPHNE'S SOUL: Get your hands off me.
VELMA: Daphne?
DAPHNE'S SOUL: He planned this somehow. Didn't he?
FRED'S SOUL: Hey, good-looking.
DAPHNE'S SOUL: Fred! You egocentric...
SHAGGY: Tell me you guys are you.
DAPHNE'S SOUL: Fred keeps touching me.
VELMA: Kind of makes you nostalgic for the homicidal creatures, doesn't it?
SHAGGY: I stole this. I hope it helps.
VELMA: The Daemon Ritus.
DAPHNE: I'm me again.
VELMA'S SOUL: Yippee for you.
SHAGGY'S SOUL: Man, like, why am I wearing a dress?
FRED'S SOUL: Everyone remain calm.
Velma, what the heck's going on?
VELMA'S SOUL: If my calculations are correct...
... due to the unstable nature of protoplasm
in proximity of the Daemon Ritus... 
VELMA'S SOUL: we're simply going to continue randomly changing bodies until...
VELMA'S SOUL: Until the protoplasm realigns with the appropriate body.
DAPHNE'S SOUL: I'm Fred again!
SHAGGY'S SOUL: Daph, what's wrong with you? Don't you ever eat?
FRED: I'm me!
DAPHNE: I'm back!
SHAGGY: Like, me too!
VELMA: Told you so!
DAPHNE: Oh, no!
VELMA: Let's go.
Something tells me that was the wrong ingredient.
Wait!
I know how to handle this guy.
Hey, you!
What are you doing?
Yes. That is masterful.
I'm trying to do a voodoo ritual.
It's important to get the right ingredients.
The only way I can protect myself is by blessing this dead Arnouki beast.
I'll tell you something. 
I got a feeling they're about to perform their evil Darkopolypse ritual.
VELMA: Darkopolypse ritual?
VOODOO MAN: That's right.
That's what the ancient text describes.
Hold it! Don't open it!
VELMA: They use the protoplasm in the vat as an energy source.
And the leader needs to absorb a purely good soul to complete the ritual.
Legend has it, once the Darkopolypse ritual is performed...
...the creatures will rule all Earth for 10,000 years.
So I'm bringing this Arnouki beast up in my house to protect myself.
Do you have another one of those?
DAPHNE: Those creatures are taking over the world? That is so mean!
Now, they can't do the ritual without a pure human soul.
Where will they get one of those?
I didn't say human.
Oh, boy.
[Whimpering]
Hello, puppy.
So, if the person behind all this needs
Scooby Doo...
Then that person is the one who brought Scooby here.
Scoobert!
How are you, my friend? Sit down. Please.
Okay.
EMILE: Scooby Snack?
Maybe one.
We'll need some more of those.
That's me!
It certainly is. And that's because, why?
We love you, Scooby Doo.
Unlike that alleged friend of yours, Shaggy.
He wouldn't believe you... 
...about that nasty girl Mary Jane, would he?
No.
But I believe you, my friend.
And that's why
I've got a very important job for you.
What's that?
That's a cat with a bobbing head.
Please don't touch it.
Scooby...
...I would like you...
...to be a sacrifice.
A sacrifice?
If Mondorajagaga wanted Scooby, why'd he invite the rest of us?
It doesn't matter.
We gotta, like, go save Scoob.
Shag, our area of expertise is nut jobs in Halloween costumes.
We're supposed to be heroes, man.
So I'm going to do what I always do.
I'm going to eat myself a Scooby Snack and I'm going to save my best pal.
FRED: Velmster?
You think I'm going to fall for that?
Giving me my own nickname?
Trying to make me feel like...
...part of the gang?
We could make a plan.
What can I do? The only thing I'm good for is getting caught.
But you never let that stop you before.
And if that's not a true hero, then I don't know what is.
Let's get jinky with it.
[Funky rock 'n' roll music]
Okay, so, we use the pulleys to tip over the vat.
VELMA: Daphne, open the air vents from the outside and release the disco skull.
The light will refract off the skull...
The creatures will explode, I'll find Scoob and we will have saved the world.
FRED: Oh, no. The ritual's beginning.
DAPHNE: Quick!
VELMA: Shaggy, attach this to the vat!
We're here to save you!
VELMA: Shaggy, faster!
All systems go!
Wait, no!
Mystery Inc rides again.
[Beating of drums]
VELMA: Quick! Hide the Daemon Ritus!
WOMAN:
Would you like another Scooby Snack?
Okay.
Scooby Doo!
[Chanting to tribal music]
[Whimpering]
[Fred mumbles]
Yo, yo, yo.
FRED: Yo, homedogs!
Y'all forgot the next part of the dance... 
...where we do the electric slide, where, you know...
It's electric.
[Fred cheers]
FRED: And back it on up and drive the bus...
...and stop.
And back it up. 
And back it on up. Hurry up, Velma. 
EMILE: Fred! Velma!
Welcome to my little
''End of the World'' party.
I've waited a long time for this moment. 
Thank you for returning
the ultimate party favor... 
...the Daemon Ritus.
EMILE: And now, behold the sacrifice.
Thank you. Thank you.
Hello, thank you.
Thank you. Shaggy?
Let's run for it.
We, like, gotta get out of here.
I'm a sacrifice, you know.
A sacrifice? That's not a good thing, Scoob.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I'm really sorry I haven't been a very good friend since we got here.
But listen to me, bro, you gotta trust me now.
- You don't trust me!
- I do trust you, Scoob.
Now, look. Who's your best buddy?
SCOOBY: Shaggy.
SHAGGY: That's right.
- Who's my best buddy in the whole world?
- Scooby Doo?
SHAGGY: That's right.
You are. And we're, like, two trippy peas in a far-out pod, man!
And best buddies, they trust each other. 
So let's do what we do best. 
Let's run out of here, screaming in fear like a couple of lunatics, okay?
Okay.
On the count of... Let's make it five. One...
...two...
Scooby Doo!
SCOOBY'S SOUL: Hey, look at me!
EMILE: The moment is at hand.
Through the Daemon Ritus, 
I shall absorb the energy source. 
And now... 
...to complete the transformation...
...I shall absorb the Pure One!
Scoob!
Ultimate power shall be mine!
Nobody absorbs my pal!
SCOOBY: Quick!
I'm free!
Look at me!
Come on, let's get the Daemon Ritus!
ZARKOS: Get off my swingset!
Cowabunga!
Look, Velms.
A man in a mask.
We love you, Scooby Doo. We love you...
That alleged friend of yours, Shaggy.
I shall absorb...
Puppy power! I've outsmarted...
VELMA: Scrappy Doo.
SCRAPPY: Correction.
The new, improved Scrappy.
Because I, Scrappy Dappy Doo, have absorbed enough energy to...
To rule the world with my all-powerful army!
And I've brought you here, puny, pathetic Mystery Inc...
...to witness my moment of triumph.
All I need to complete my transformation is Scooby Doo.
Don't you mean Melvin Doo?
Seize them!
Like, let's get out of here!
SCRAPPY: Take that, pretty boy!
SHAGGY: This is totally ungroovy, Scoob!
Scooby Doo, where are you?
Señorita.
[Loud rock music]
SCRAPPY: Yield to my puppy power!
VELMA: We have to tip over the protoplasm vat.
FRED: How?
VELMA: The pincer! Come on!
[Rock version of Scooby Doo theme song]
You all need to step back, because Fredster's got his groove on.
[Daphne grunts]
[Zarkos whines]
Gotcha! You look so much bigger on TV!
SCRAPPY: Come back here, you lazy beatnik!
Oh, crud!
Told you so!
Like, wow!
Give me the dog!
SCOOBY: Scrappy!
Down! Sit! Bad Scrappy!
Let's finish this puppy! Now!
Oh, no! Not again!
Captured again, señorita?
Not this time!
Now who's the damsel in distress?
- Me?
- Straight up.
SCRAPPY: Mystery Inc, this ain't over!
Not by a long shot! 
I'll rock you and sock you... 
...and crush you like...
Like, dude.
SCRAPPY: What?
SHAGGY: You're a bad puppy!
I can still take you!
Put them up, you mangy mutt!
Is that all you got?
[Cheering]
FRED: Hey, Daph!
- We did it!
- Yes, we did.
Oh, Fred!
Cut it out!
Mr. Mondavarious, is that you?
Yes.
Thank goodness!
Thank you! Thank you!
BOY: Thank you!
You're fogging up my glasses.
Two years ago, that little pest...
...turns up at a casting session for our evil elves.
Next, I'm stuck in a hole... 
...and he's cavorting about in a mechanical version of me.
But look, thank you so much! 
What a delight! Fantastic!
Fantastic! 
Shaggy!
Scooby Doo!
[Laughing]
- I love you, Shaggy.
- I love you, too, Scoob.
Now, get off me, buddy.
Thanks.
You saved my life.
No problem.
And thank you, Scooby Doo.
MARY JANE: My little schmookem wookem.
Shucks!
[Screaming and cheering]
Fred, can you tell us how you solved the case?
FRED: Yes.
It all started when I was giving a speech on my new book and...
I really think the Velmster should take it from here.
[Whispers] Go.
Through the combined intuitive powers of Mystery Inc...
... we've discovered
the real villain behind this mystery... 
...is, in fact, Scrappy Cornelius Doo...
... who, sadly, was corrupted
by the power of the Daemon Ritus. 
SCRAPPY: Get over it!
So, I got a little cranky!
Scrap, it's no reason to freak out like a jerk and try to kill all of humanity.
I would've gotten away with it, too, if not for you meddling sons of...
Now that Mystery Inc is back together...
...do you have any comment on the
Mud Bog Ghoul terrorizing London?
Whatever the case...
...Mystery Inc will be there.
- Solving mysteries, man.
DAPHNE: Righting wrongs.
VELMA: Looking for clues and kicking butt.
[Rap music plays]
SHAGGY: How groovy is this, man? 
Spooky Island finally came through with its all-you-can-eat deal.
And there's nobody I'd rather gorge myself with than you, Scooby Doo.
My best friend.
You're my best friend, buddy.
You're beautiful like a beautiful piece of pizza!
Zoinks!
Them peppers is, like, hot!
- Wimp!
- Wimp? You think you can handle it?
Why don't you put your mouth where your mouth is!
Okay!
[Panting]
SHAGGY: Scooby Doo.
Are you feeling okay? 
[Yells] Oh no!
Here you go, Scoob!
- How did that taste, man?
- Delicious!
Well, garçon, let's get two more!
On the count of three.
One!
Two!
Three!

With what ice pulls off that well again.
Knocked down by a spirit?
What have been taken place, rate?
- Something has or someone struck me.
Really not ordinary cases?
What is it last what you have seen?
- Stars.
She is again the old man.
And before?
- When I have seen someone.
From this world,
Or from the next?
Why did not close you the school?
The half of the parents intends that also,
The remainder wants that their offspring succeeds.
The school management intends probably be that
That footballers the case not bottles.
Abel Frye has been the only exiled.
- De Jongs that hung up.
I accept that everybody at school
This picture has seen well once.
Abel Frye is rather
A school legend be.
... There is something wrong goes without food.
- Completely not.
You have such tin of on-school-sits
A-boy-that-I-find-nice.
Nonsense. We be now undercover,
So I must stay well in my role.
Everybody has fallen
For my role as popular maid.
I not. I am older then you.
- 2 minutes.
But this is something otherwise.
I know jou.
Can you keep a secret?
- Yes, that I vow.
It is something between jou and me
And everybody that I call later tell.
Goh what funny, Elijah.
If I would find someone there nice
And I do not say that that so is ...
Maarstel, what can go wrong there then?
We move frequenter then gypsies.
I am pleased quite with this life ...
But sometimes I wonder well once
How mean other life.
With boys exit,
Madman do and house arrest get.
- Hey, Bish.
- Morning, Jamie.
Have you heard from Jared?
How's he doing?
His new companion's kind of weird.
But they got a couple baptisms.
Well, good for him.
Hey, Wes.
Hey, April.
How's little Mac?
- Hey, Bishop.
- How's the bun?
- The bun's fine, thanks.
- It's the oven we're worried about.
The oven is fine, too.
Wes,
Sister Perkins is inside.
I don't know what she wants.
She won't talk to me.
All right.
- Your check's the receipt.
- Thanks, Peg.
- Morning, Bishop.
- Morning, Barbara.
Well, look who finally decided to drag his butt out of bed.
Don't know why everybody calls you Bishop.
Maybe that's because he's the bishop.
He's a bishop.
There's 1 7 bishops in this town but there's only one sheriff.
- Anything important in here?
- Is there ever?
Besides, bishops aren't supposed to have mustaches.
Just trying to be more like Jesus.
They're also not supposed to be smart-alecks.
Judy Perkins.
- What am l, invisible here?
- I already told you... you've been dead for six weeks.
You just don't know it.
- Good morning, Stu.
- Morning, Sheriff.
I'll be dead someday, you know.
And I'm sure you'll still be hanging around my office.
*^ You're gonna miss me when I'm gone... *^
Don't you start singing that country music.
*^ You're gonna miss me when I'm gone *^
*^ You're gonna miss me... *^
*^ Do you ever want to kiss me...? *^
Um...
I need to talk to you about a problem I'm having.
Is this temporal or spiritual?
Pardon?
Are you here to talk with your sheriff, or your bishop?
Oh... my bishop.
In that case, could this wait until Sunday?
I generally don't like to do church business while I'm on the county clock.
I'm sorry.
Normally,
I wouldn't, but...
I really need to get this off my chest.
All right.
Um...
Would you mind...
I've never had to confess my sins to a man wearing a gun before.
Oh.
Sorry.
Thanks, Judy.
Peg: Just got a call from the development.
A couple of boys are mixing it up.
- I'll go.
- No, you won't.
You're not an officer anymore.
Yeah, well, I could be if you'd deputize me.
- I'm not going to do it.
- What am I supposed to do, just take out the trash and sweep the floor?
Just be retired, for crying out loud.
Peg: Why don't you go home and do some crossword puzzles?
Maybe you should take up golf.
I hear old people enjoy that.
Maybe you should all go straight to hell.
I got 1 5, maybe 20 good years left.
I'll outlive all of you birds, anyway.
That may be, but you're still not going out.
I can out-ride you.
I can out-shoot you.
We don't ride anymore, Stu, we drive.
Wes, your gun.
Oh.
That's all right, I'll just stay here with old Peg, then.
Old Peg?
Prettier than either one of you.
Why don't you just take him with you?
Peg's practically married, Stu, and don't you forget it.
That's right.
Maggie's looking down on you.
Maggie's probably got better things to do than look down on me.
*^ You're gonna miss me when I'm gone... *^
Oh, good heavens.
- (news radio playing)
- Terry, I don't want... to listen to the news.
That's the real world going on out there. The outside world.
What makes you think I don't know what's going on out there?
I'm sick of it.
Murderers, rapists, robbers... kids with guns... it's the same story over and over again.
I'm tired of it.
You will be, too, by the time you're my age.
Your age?
You talk like you're older than Stu.
You just can't pretend it all doesn't happen.
- That's all I'm saying.
- It doesn't happen.
Not here.
Here's all I care about.
There's something worth listening to.
Country music... now that's a crime.
That's scary stuff, Wes.
You're an old man, you know that?
You're the youngest old man
I've ever known.
*^ So I tell you how I yearn for you... *^
- Wes: We got a call about a fight.
- Man: Oh, yeah.
That didn't amount to much, just guys blowing off some steam.
Which ones?
Come on, Wes. A few punches being thrown, a few names being called.
I stepped in and it was over before it even got started.
What were they fighting about?
A woman. And one guy called another guy a spic, and before you know it, the fists are flying.
It's all patched up then?
Yeah, no trouble at all.
Just like I said, it was over before it even got started.
Will you look at this?!
I could see a church right there, two more off that way, and another one going up over there!
I've never seen so many churches in all my life, man.
- Is that one of them?
- That's one of them.
I love this town!
Where I come from, we got taverns on every corner, and whorehouses in-between, man!
I'm glad you like it.
Now get to work.
All right,
I think I will.
If you ever finish that house
I just may let you buy it.
Worker:
I might do that, I just might.
Sure is an extroverted type.
You don't want to arrest a potential citizen?
We don't want to discourage growth, now do we, Sheriff?
I wouldn't mind slowing it down a bit.
You trying to put me out of business?
I'm just trying to keep things reined in.
All the construction on the roads, all your out-of-towners coming in for work.
Everything's torn up from here to Salt Lake.
Tell me, Bishop, how many men in your ward are out of work?
Only the ones that want to be.
That's right.
Prosperity.
And it ain't going to be this way forever.
1 0 years ago, I was living in a trailer park.
Let's enjoy this while we got it.
Growing pains, that's all.
That's right.
Can't stay young forever.
Terry: How much money do you think Ralph makes?
What, in a year?
I don't know, a couple hundred thousand.
Terry: We're cops.
What are we doing being cops?
I got everything I need.
Real estate keeps going up.
I don't know if I'll ever be able to buy anything.
Terry, I'm paying you as much as I can.
I know that, Wes.
Just... sometimes I think I ought to go back to work for Ralph again, you know, learn how he does it.
I got to start putting money away for my kids, for their missions, college.
Sure do miss her.
She was the only one who'd listen to my missionary stories.
You want a minute?
Yeah.
All right.
Thanks.
Terry:
What's up?
Just some car.
I want to check this out.
Whoa.
Now that's a car.
Pop that glove box... see if you can find my ticket book.
- (phone ringing)
- Sheriff's office.
- I need you to do something.
- Shoot.
Get Ryan Parker on the phone.
Have him meet me at the Evans homestead.
Tell him to come right away.
We got a signal seven.
- Okay. Will do.
- Give me the number...
- For the FBI office in Salt Lake.
- Roger.
Thanks.
What's a signal seven?
What the heck is a signal seven?
That's a dead body.
I need you to go into town and get Ed Gray.
We're going to need his tow truck.
Look what they did to her.
They didn't have to leave her like that.
- Are you Wes Clayton?
- Sheriff Clayton, yes.
- Are you the one who found the body?
- Yes, I did.
Agent #2: Have you identified the victim?
No, that's an out-of-state car.
That's why I called you in.
- Okay, great. Thanks.
- Agent #2: Don't go away.
- Sheriff?
- Hey, chief.
I never expected to make a business trip to Brigham.
Oh, I know it.
We can'tjust let these guys in here.
We got to finish our investigation.
We don't have an investigation.
- Is that all right?
- That's great. Thanks.
That lady died in our town.
We got to take care of this.
We don't have to take care of anything.
This doesn't have anything to do with our town.
- What's going on?
- There's been a killing.
- It's California plates.
- Terry: Wes...
That's an out-of-state vehicle.
We were just another exit ramp.
It could have happened anywhere.
This is right in our own back yard.
People don't even lock their doors in our town.
I don't want them to start.
This doesn't have anything to do with anybody in our town except you and me.
That's where I want it to stop.
Do you understand me?
Do you understand me?!
Yeah.
- Ed, do you understand?
- Yeah.
Terry, you're not even going to talk to your wife about this.
If anybody asks us anything, we're going to keep our mouths shut.
- Peg knows, right?
- She knows.
I didn't sign up just to walk kids across the street.
You signed up to serve these people and to protect these people.
And this kind of thing... they don't want to know about it.
Sheriff, has there ever been a murder in this town?
Never.
We'll do the autopsy in Provo.
She'll be there a few more days, if you want another look at her.
Great.
Thanks, Ryan.
We're not stepping on any toes, are we?
Apparently, I'm taking orders from those two today.
It's all right.
It's fine.
Just take her.
Get her out of here.
All right then.
Hey, Ryan.
I'd appreciate it if the reporters didn't get a hold of this.
- I'm not going to make
- If anybody calls...
If anybody calls,
I'll refer them to you.
Thanks.
Don't let those Feds bully you around, Wes.
If I were you,
I'd keep my nose in this one.
I think we have everything we need here.
Do you guys mind waiting for the tow truck to finish?
I'll stay.
Give us a call if there's anything else we need to know.
Don't be surprised if you see us around town the next few days.
Listen, I'd rather you left that part to me.
Don't worry, Sheriff.
We'll keep a low profile.
All right.
You want me to bring some food?
Hot chocolate or something?
I'm just going to wait for Ed.
He can give me a ride home in the tow truck.
All right.
Something finally happens around here... you just pretend it never did.
It'll all be over, as soon as that car leaves town.
So it is with great honor, we have gathered here today to celebrate one more year, and to wish our beautiful little city
Happy Birthday, on this, the 1 38th anniversary of its founding.
We love you,
Little Brigham!
Just be careful.
Watch where you're going.
Okay, go, go.
Guys...!
Kilo Two, this is Dispatch.
Could you make sure you look where you're going?
Peg on radio:
Terry, are you there?
Terry!
This is Kilo Two, go ahead.
I'm getting calls about an overflowing irrigation ditch on 600 North.
What do you want me to do about it? I'm busy.
I told them we'd get somebody over there.
- Why can't they do it themselves?
- Because they're helpless.
I can't do it.
Where's Stu?
Hey, boss.
You keeping this riot under control?
We're trying.
Have there been any developments on that...
No.
You're coming to my baptism aren't you?
I wouldn't miss it.
You know that.
Excuse me.
Steve, I need you to do me a favor.
Sure, anything you need.
Are you still developing your own film?
Mm-hmm.
I need you to develop these for me.
Take that to one of those quickie stops.
- They can open it right up.
- No, I can't take it anywhere.
I need you to develop these, then I need you to bring the prints back to me... directly to me.
You're not to talk about what you see in here.
All right.
Excuse me.
You think you two could be any more conspicuous?
Sheriff.
You're sticking out like a couple of sore thumbs.
Oh, that's much better.
Thanks.
We've gotten a call on that, but we're pretty busy with the parade.
I understand that.
Yes, definitely.
I'm sure you will.
Okay. All right.
Let's go get some cotton candy.
Excuse me.
Goodbye to you, too.
- You're missing all the fun.
- You want to answer the phone?
- No.
- (phone rings)
I didn't think so.
Sheriff's office, this is Peg.
Yes.
Yes, ma'am, we've already gotten a call on that.
It was the head trauma that killed her.
I'm sure you picked up on that.
It was kind of hard to miss.
We pulled debris samples from underneath her fingernails.
- Maybe she scratched them.
- We pulled debris and fibers from her clothes, from the car, we got hair, blood samples.
Hopefully the mess wasn't all hers.
- Was she raped?
- No.
And it doesn't look like a robbery.
We are checking the interstate records to find anything that looks familiar to anybody, but so far, no luck.
But it is the weekend.
Listen,
I've got a deputy... who's eager to help out on this one.
I could lend him to you, if it would help speed things up.
- No. Thanks.
- Agent #2: Relax, Sheriff.
This woman's only been dead for a day and a half.
It's not like her blood's crying out for vengeance just yet.
Are you Mormon?
Sure.
- Jack Mormon.
- So I'm taking a little sabbatical.
"Protect and serve," my eye.
Why don't you help me shovel some of this crap?
Did you say something to me?
This hearing aid's giving me a piece of hell tonight.
Hey!
You want to watch where you're flinging that stuff?
All is well.
Yes, yes it is.
All is well.
*^ Shout praises *^
*^ To our God and King *^
*^ Above the rest *^
*^ His words will tell *^
*^ All is well *^
*^ All is well. *^
Woman:
Heavenly Father, we thank Thee for this beautiful Sabbath morning.
And we ask for Thy spirit to be with the speakers today that they will be able to communicate Thy word and Thy will to us.
And we ask that Thou will continue to watch over us and to bless us and to care for us.
In the name of the Savior,
Jesus Christ, amen.
All: Amen.
We have some ward business to take care of at this time.
I'm sad to report that the Markham family will be moving...
- Three blocks east.
- (laughing)
So they'll still be in our ward. and they would appreciate it if as many of us, as can, would help them move into their new place Friday.
So, let's all try to get out and help them.
Also...
Sister Judy Perkins, will you please stand?
At this time, we'd like to release Sister Perkins from her calling as a teacher in the Relief Society.
All of those who, along with me, would like to express their gratitude for the many hours of service, please make it manifest with the uplifted hand.
Thanks, Judy.
And now we will prepare to partake of the sacrament by signing hymn number 193,
"I Stand All Amazed," following which the sacrament will be blessed and passed by the Aaronic Priesthood.
All:
*^ I stand all amazed *^
*^ At the love
Jesus offers me... *^
That they may witness unto Thee,
O God, the Eternal Father, that they do always remember Him; that they may have
His spirit to be with them.
- Amen.
- All: Amen.
- Hey, Steve.
- Bishop.
Okay, there you go.
Thanks.
I'd say you're welcome, but it's really something
I'd rather not do again.
I'm sorry you had to see this.
I don't suppose you can say anything about that?
You've kept my secrets.
I'll keep yours.
You're a good man.
Don't let it get out.
It'll ruin my reputation.
Christ says we should be, and I love how He puts this,
"as wise as serpents, yet as harmless as doves."
What do you think
He means by that?
Let's go to another Scripture.
Ah, Brother Hanks.
I think He was saying...
It's like if you have to go to a used car lot... you got to know all the different ways that the guy can rip you off.
No offense, John.
I mean, you can't be gullible.
You have to know all the different ways you can get hurt.
But how does that fit in with something else that Jesus said?
We're supposed to be like little children, right?
Christ says, unless we're like little children, we will not enter the Kingdom of God.
And children are totally innocent.
They're gullible.
Do we have to lose our innocence to gain wisdom?
Christ was wise, but He was sinless.
True, but what about
Adam and Eve?
They were sinless... well, for awhile.
But were they wise?
Let's go to another Scripture.
Book of Mormon, second Nephi,
Chapter Il,
Verses 22 to 25.
Do I have a volunteer?
I'm sorry, sister,
I don't know your name.
Meredith... Cole.
Sister Cole, would you like to read that for us?
I'm sorry.
I'm not a Mormon.
I'm just observing.
Oh, good.
Welcome.
Thank you.
You can read, can't you?
Yes, I can.
Would you mind reading that for us?
Sure.
"If Adam had not transgressed, he would not have fallen."
What are you after?
Go on, get out of here!
Get!
Get out of here!
Get out of here!
Get!
- Is the sheriff in there?
- I think he's at a meeting.
Sheriff!
Sheriff?
Hey, Bishop!
What brings you our way?
Hi, Evelyn.
Do you mind if I come in?
Mind? We've been inviting you over for six months.
- Come on in.
- Thanks.
Can I talk you into staying for dinner?
- No, no, I can't.
- Oh. Ernie?
Come on in.
Carolyn will be home any minute.
She was off and gone before we even got up this morning.
- Hey there, Bishop.
- Hey, Ernie.
- You staying for dinner?
- No, I can't.
Sit down, sit down.
Sit down.
Evelyn:
So, what's on your mind?
What can we do for you, Wes?
It's about Carolyn.
- Excuse me.
- Ernie, no!
I'll just be a minute.
Hello?
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Yeah, this is Ernie.
Hey, Linda.
Yeah, no... the Sheriff, he's right here.
Wes is here right now.
Bishop? Can I get you a cold drink or something?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh... are you sure?
Are you sure it's her?
Ernie: No... no.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Ernie, no. No!
My baby. Wes...
- That's my baby!
- (phone rings)
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
- (ringing continues)
- This is Sherry Cornell... reporting to you live from Brigham, Utah, a once sleepy town, put on the map tonight as the scene of a grisly murder...
Congratulations,
Sheriff.
You've got a serial killer in town.
Stuart Udall, do you swear to uphold the constitution of the State of Utah, the laws of Kirtland County and the cities therein?
Yes, sir, I do.
Then I hereby deputize you.
You now serve at the pleasure of the sheriff.
Excuse me.
Is Wes Clayton here?
- No.
- If you don't tell Wes I'm out here,
I'm going to walk into his office right now!
- I wouldn't recommend it.
- Peg...
I need to see you for five minutes.
I know that.
Give me a couple minutes.
I need a couple thousand of these.
Shrink them and put two on a page.
- All right.
- Can we have a word?
No. Then get a hold of all the Aaronic Priesthood boys in town.
All of them. I want a copy of that on every doorstep before dark.
- Got it.
- Terry!
- Wesley!
- Mayor!
You're gonna have to hold on a few minutes!
- Are you the mayor?
- Yes I am. Who are you?
My name is Jack.
Mind if I ask you a few questions?
I guess that would be fine.
It'll be all right.
It'll be fine.
Wes: I need you and Terry to knock on every door within two blocks of the square.
Let's notjust talk to whoever answers the door.
Talk to everybody who lives there, anybody that was visiting yesterday,
- Anybody who could've seen anything.
- Got it.
- Let's get it done.
- Yes, sir.
Sheriff.
- You got a minute?
- No, I don't.
I need your permission to look at the files for anything that might help the investigation.
You can look at anything you want to, just don't remove anything, and let me know what you're making copies of.
- Deal.
- You won't find anything.
Everybody here dies of natural causes.
What about
Tamra Hillam?
Tammy Hillam?
I've heard her name three times today.
Well, for one thing, she isn't dead.
She took off during her senior year of high school,
A couple of years ago.
Big fight with her parents.
She went off to be a movie star.
That's the last anybody heard of her.
No postcards, no e-mails?
Nothing, not even to her friends?
Sheriff... no postcards or anything?
Look, it's in her file.
Tell Peg to give you access.
Thank you.
Reporter: ... a resident of Brigham,
Utah, who knew the second victim.
- Is that true?
- Man: Yeah, that's true.
I took her to the junior prom last year.
We were... you know, we were very close.
Everybody says she was murdered.
Yeah, there's no doubt about it.
Was she... was she violated?
Yeah.
Do you have any men working for you that might be capable of something like that?
No, I don't.
Most of your men are outsiders.
- They're migratory.
- Yes, they are.
Maybe you don't know them as well as you think you do.
I know enough that I don't have any of that kind working for me.
How do you know that?
The way I figure it is, a guy who does something like this, kind of has to work himself up to it.
He has a record of some kind... a rape, or assault, or some kind of violence.
Hey, do you remember that kid... that kid who broke into my office several years ago?
- Yeah, we got him.
- Yeah we did.
I also found out that kid had a history of that kind of thing.
It's my own fault.
I never did any kind of background check.
I took his application and I took his word.
I deserved to get robbed.
And from then on, anybody that works for my crew
I know who they are and where they come from.
And I don't hire no man with a shady history.
Now that may not be very Christ-like, but that's the way
I run my business, and that's how I know.
No one really knows what happened.
It's just one of those things.
Freak accident, you know?
Wes can't remember any of it.
The best anyone can figure, a truck, or somebody, took a wide turn, he swerved and went off the road... it was up in the canyon, so if you go off the road,
- You're in trouble.
- Nobody stopped?
Nobody reported it?
Half the town was out looking for him.
He was supposed to perform a wedding that night.
Terry was the one that finally found them.
Reporter: Did she have any trouble with drugs or alcohol?
Mr. Merrill:
Absolutely not.
Do you know anybody who could have done something like this?
No, we don't know anybody that could have done something so... horrendous as this.
Reporter: What's the last thing your daughter said to you?
She must have said something.
Richie died instantly.
Sarah, too, probably.
Her neck was broken.
And Wes...
Wes was in a coma for eight days.
He told me once that that was the worst part of it... that he couldn't remember.
He doesn't know if it was his fault or not.
He still wears his wedding ring.
They were a beautiful family.
And that boy... that boy.
That boy followed him around like a shadow.
The weird thing was... they held the funeral without him.
Nobody thought he was going to make it.
Yeah, that's where they found her.
- Right under there.
- I know where they found her.
Ivan Jensen... he was the one who found her.
- I was asking...
- He told me that himself.
- Boy: Are we all getting out?
- Mother: Yeah.
- Sheriff.
- Mr. McKay.
What can I do for you?
Beer?
I need to ask you to do me a favor.
I didn't think we had that kind of relationship.
It's got something to do with those murders in town?
I think it would be good for the... for the long-term health of your little establishment if you helped me out on this one.
What's the magic word, Sheriff?
Probation.
- Girl: I want to be 20.
- Why do you want to be 20?
'Cause then
I could drive.
You can drive when you're 1 6, sweetie.
- I know.
- You can also date when you're 1 6.
Do you want this over here?
Fingers out of the food, please.
Shall we pray?
Very good. Okay.
Dad...?
Just a second, sweetie.
Good night,
Brother Jensen.
Good night, boys.
You picked a heck of a day to move.
- Thanks for coming by.
- My pleasure.
You didn't have to bring all this.
You've got enough to worry about.
If we left it to the men,
- We'd be eating cold pizza and donuts.
- That's about right.
Hey, thank you.
Of course.
Anytime.
Sometimes I look at them and I can't believe they all came out of my body.
Don't even talk like that.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I keep forgetting.
I'm trying to pretend
I have easy deliveries.
Hi! What are you doing here?
- Hey, Terry.
- I had to see how my baby's doing.
We're good.
- (crying)
- It's okay!
Terry: Hey!
Coming back for seconds, eh, Bishop?
Yeah, you caught me.
I'm just teasing you.
Tickle here.
Did Terry tell you we finally chose a name for the baby?
- No, he didn't say anything.
- It was his choice this time.
I tried to talk him out of it... but I suppose we're going to be calling the baby Wes.
That's a good name.
Yeah, I thought you'd like it.
All right.
Go for it.
You're not big on hunting, are you, Wes?
Nope.
It might improve your marksmanship.
No offense.
I went on a deer hunt once with my brother, Alan, and a couple of his friends.
They were big hunters.
I've already told you this story.
No, you haven't.
Anyway, we went out all day and didn't get anything.
I must have been, oh, 1 2...
1 3 maybe.
I didn't even see a deer. I started shooting at anything that moved, and I scared up this little jack rabbit and he took off.
I raised my rifle.
I fired and he went down.
We all ran over there and he was still alive.
He was still kicking.
Alan said,
"You better put him out of his misery."
So I put the end of my rifle up... up to his head and I pulled the trigger.
You know,
I had this strange feeling.
I mean I liked it.
You know?
There was some part of me that really liked killing that animal.
I was like some part of me coming up that I didn't like, so I went home and I put the gun away and I never went hunting again.
You know, I hadn't thought about it but...
I haven't fired a weapon at any living creature since then.
Did you take it home?
The rabbit.
Did you eat it?
No.
No, we left it there... in the dirt.
You know,
I think some men just have a taste for killing.
I think they like it.
The guy we're looking for... do you think... do you think this guy could ever be cured?
Do you think he could...
I don't know, repent?
I don't know.
I have a hard time imagining it.
Well...
I know one cure.
Terry:
Edward Conrad Gray, having been commissioned of Jesus Christ,
I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
- Amen.
- All: Amen.
We're all set up here.
You ready to go?
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.
It's not your fault, you know.
You're a good sheriff, Wes.
Better than I ever was.
That's not true and you know it.
It is true, and you know it.
That's a compliment.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Little places like this... our days are numbered, you know?
The rest of the world won't let us be.
They're going to drag us in, whether we like it or not.
See, what we got here is a little paradise.
And nothing attracts a serpent like a paradise.
Yeah.
*^ I want to be a rock star and travel really far *^
*^ And buy me a big expensive car *^
*^ And make lots of money and find me a honey *^
*^ And live in a nice big house where it's sunny *^
*^ With a pool and I'll be cool *^
*^ I'll always have a gig because I'll be big *^
*^ Have parties and friends and places to go *^
*^ The only problem is
I buried the banjo. *^
All right, you can look.
How do I look?
What?
Oh, never mind.
Peg, you don't have to do this.
Are you kidding? This is great...
I get to go undercover.
- You got your pencil?
- Mm-hmm.
Well, there was nowhere else to put it. Oww.
*^ I play the banjo
I play the banjo... *^
Did you boys order these empty beer bottles?
Yeah, right there.
Right over here.
These ones are from table seven.
And their names are Glen,
Dave, Danny...
How we going to keep all this straight?
We don't have to.
All we got to do is run the prints.
If there's a match, we get a name and a photo.
- And a rap sheet.
- That's right.
Who thought up this scheme?
I wish I could say it was me.
Wes.
Son of a gun.
- Do you want a smoke?
- No.
I don't smoke... anymore.
Okay.
Hey, Pete.
Hey, Sheriff.
What are you doing here?
Just keeping my eye on the party.
You still my bishop or did they release you?
I'm still your bishop.
Well, I'm going to keep an eye on you tonight.
Likewise.
Hey, hey.
What can I do for you boys?
What's your name?
Same as it was five minutes ago.
It's Peg, you idiot.
Well, Peg, how come it is that... you don't have a name tag like all the other girls here?
- 'Cause I'm new.
- She's the new girl!
- That's right.
- You know, that's, uh... that's kind of a coincidence because I happen to be looking for a new girl.
Are you now?
Okay, well, what can I get for you?
Give us another round, please.
- Okay.
- And some food, you got any food?
- Mm-hmm. We got food.
- All right, yeah, whatever.
- Okay.
- Chicken wings.
Anybody missing?
Just about everybody will roll in before last call.
Even the non-drinkers will come in, shoot some pool, chase some skirt.
I haven't been asked out on so many dates in all my life.
Well, the truck's full and so is the back of your car.
How much are these guys going to drink anyway?
- Things are slowing down in there.
- Thank heavens!
Terry, I need you to take Peg back to the office.
Peg, go ahead and start dusting these bottles.
Roger that.
Stu, you stay for another hour or so, then take this load back to the office.
- Can you stay awake that long?
- Sure, I can stay awake.
All right.
- Go to work, men.
- And woman.
I think we're going to get this guy.
Great.
Whoa.
A little bright there, huh?
Sorry.
You need a hand?
I think they gave me the wrong tool.
Yeah.
That happens.
I got something in the truck.
Thanks.
Give this a try?
- Hey, Stu.
- James.
You're up late.
Well, you know what they say... no rest for the wicked.
Is this all for you?
Ah, give me a pack of...
What was that?
A pack of cigarettes, Jamie.
Straights.
No filter.
One pack.
You want me to get you a Playboy, too?
I don't want a Playboy.
I want a pack of cigarettes.
Okay?
I'm not going to give them to you.
Well, you got them there for sale.
I'm the customer.
You're either going to sell them to me, or I'll go elsewhere and you suit yourself.
Dog-gone things are going to kill you.
I think I'm going to tell the bishop on you.
You mind your own business.
I'll get around to telling the bishop soon enough.
I always do.
- Thank you, very much.
- You're not very welcome.
You just won't make it easy for me, will you?
Jamie?
James?
Sheriff, I'm sorry.
Steve, let's give him a minute.
Bottles are still in the back of the truck.
I guess they didn't notice he had them.
Get them back to the office as fast as you can.
We don't have any time to waste.
Have you had enough of the real world yet, Terry?
Hey, Spence.
Are you going to find my sister?
I'm going to find her.
You say a few prayers in the mean time though.
- Okay.
- Okay.
How many sets of prints are we going to have?
43 7 bottles, 43 7 prints.
Some will be duplicates.
Terry:
Triplicates.
We're going to be here all night.
- It's Ed.
- Yeah, let him in.
If we find anything, it's not admissible in court, is it?
We're just trying to identify some suspects.
I just want to find Jamie.
Do you think she's still alive?
- Hey.
- Hey, Ed.
I heard about Stu.
Yeah. This is Meredith Cole, she's with the FBI.
Oh. Hi.
Nice to meet you.
Is there anything
I can do to help?
Why don't you grab some gloves.
Help Peg dust for prints.
Really?
Dust for prints. Wow.
It's not all that exciting, believe me.
Okay.
We'll find her.
First one's coming up.
Peg:
Well, what do you know?
I thought every man in that bar had a record of some kind.
We'll only flag the violent ones.
Sex offenders.
Peg, I want you to get on the phone.
See how many men you can get to meet me at the gazebo at 7:00 a.m.
It's 2:30 in the morning.
Doesn't give us much time.
Okay. There's going to be a lot of people hating me tonight.
Just tell them Jamie Harlan's life is on the line.
You won't hear much grumbling.
You've got yourself a nice town.
Yeah.
Yeah, they're good people.
Where are you from?
You a Salt Lake girl?
No.
No,
I'm just passing through.
Doing some training.
A Jack Mormon.
How's that going?
Oh,
I'll whip him into shape.
Actually,
I grew up in Manhattan.
Have you ever been there?
It's nice.
- Different, I hear.
- Oh, yeah.
Out here, with all the empty space, it's kind of creepy.
Creepy?
- Really?
- Sure.
You seem like a pretty reasonable man.
Intelligent.
Down to earth.
Okay.
I've been reading some of your books.
Your...
Scriptures.
All this about angels and prophets,
Jesus talking to people.
Do you really believe all that?
Yes, I do.
You're just a little naive, that's all.
Excuse me?
I've heard it all my life.
Because we don't want to experience some of the things out there, some people think we're naive.
We have our own experiences.
We get down on our knees and we say our prayers and do our best to live the way God wants us to live... and every now and again he gives us a... a little experience.
I guess we're both naive to one extent or another.
Just about different things.
I drove by.
Every cop in town was there.
We only got two cops.
Yeah, and they were both there.
All right.
It's 7:00.
Meredith, can you take over at the computer?
Don't give up.
- Wes: Ed.
- Hmm?
Now how many of you men served full-time missions for the church?
Now what I'm going to ask you to do is going to feel just like the old days.
I want you to pair off, two by two.
You're going to go from house to house.
You're going to knock on every door.
You're going to search every home in town.
Now I want you to be nice about this.
These people are your neighbors.
But I want you to be thorough.
- Mike?
- I have to be to work by 9:00.
Nobody's going to work today.
Jamie Harlan's life is more important than any of yourjobs.
You're going to look in every closet and every corner, in every attic, in every space that's large enough to hold a human body.
If anybody doesn't let you search the house... one of you is going to sit down on the front curb and the other one's going to come back here... immediately.
Except in that circumstance, you will not separate.
If anybody decides to take a 1 5-minute break,
I want to know about it.
I don't want anybody to have time to hide or move anything.
Do you understand?
- Ivan.
- Does this mean we're all suspects?
Yes, it does.
- Ivan: Morning, Megan.
- Hi.
The sheriff's asked us to go house to house in the town.
We're looking for Jamie Harlan.
Yeah?
Morning Sister Peck. Me and Mike have been asked by the sheriff to come search the homes here in town.
We're hoping you won't mind if we come inside and have a look around?
- You want to what?
- You heard that Jamie Harlan's missing?
We're searching all the homes in town.
You're not coming into my house.
You don't have a warrant.
- You're not even policemen.
- No, ma'am, we're not.
We're just out here trying to do the right thing.
You're not coming into my house.
Is Steve home?
Maybe we could talk to him.
No, he's not.
He's right... this is like being missionaries.
I'll wait here at the curb if you want to run into town.
I'm not running anywhere.
Ben:
Here we go.
- She won't let you in?
- No, not an inch.
Clara, this is Sheriff Clayton.
I want you to open up this door!
There's a young girl's life at stake!
Either open up this door or I'm going to break it down!
Clara!
You guys stay right here.
Kilo One to Kilo Two.
Terry?
- Come with me.
- What's going on?
You just come with me.
Steve:
Bishop.
What's going on?
Your mother won't let us search the house.
Well, you don't have a warrant.
Do you really want me to get one?
This isn't right.
This just isn't right.
You should be ashamed of yourself!
Poking around in my house!
- I'm going to sue this town!
- Mother!
I'm going to sue this town for every penny its got!
Clara, stay back.
Check under the bed.
Steve, I want you to let me in this closet.
- Bishop.
- Open this door.
No.
- What are you doing?!
- Clara, stay back!
- Get your hands off him!
- Get back!
Okay, Steve, this is getting out of hand.
I want you to unlock this door before somebody gets hurt!
Steve!
The key's in the cup there.
Let him go.
You have a darkroom in the garage.
We're going to need to see it.
Come on.
I kept meaning to talk to you about...
I think I would die if anyone knew.
Steve...
I need you to come back with me to the station.
For questioning.
- Bishop...
- Don't...
Don't call me "Bishop."
Right now, I have to care about the people in this town a lot more than
I care about you.
Do you understand me?
I never hurt anybody.
Not anybody.
Mike:
What's going on, Bishop?
Go ahead and get these people back to their houses.
It's all right.
There's nothing going on here.
This is the Peck's house.
Let's go, there's nothing wrong here.
Come on, let's go.
There's nothing wrong here.
Who's idea was this fingerprint thing anyway?
Just shut up.
Peg.
Peg!
Yeah?
I need the files on
Lisa Colvin and Tammy Hillam.
Meredith had them out.
I'll find them.
All right, here comes the last one.
Wes!
This had better be him.
Come on!
Son of a gun.
Peg:
I know him.
- Who is that?
- That's that construction guy.
Big guy.
I remember him.
Come on, give me the rap sheet.
- Possession of marijuana.
- That's it?
You've got to be kidding.
You get anything?
I don't think so.
- Now what?
- Now you go home and get some rest.
- Wes...
- Neither of you have slept in 48 hours.
I'm going to need you fresh again tomorrow.
How long has it been for you?
I'll be fine.
It's all right. We've done everything we can do for now.
Would it be okay if we said a prayer?
Sure.
Peg:
Heavenly Father... right now, we're kind of at the end of our rope.
We're losing some of our friends, some of our family.
Everything's falling apart.
Nobody trusts anybody.
Everybody's afraid.
And we're just so tired.
Please... help us find Jamie.
Please don't let her die.
Help us find this man who... keeps taking our friends.
And if we're just not... smart enough, or... strong enough to stop him... then... please take it into Your hands.
Please... please, Lord.
Please stop this man.
Please make him stop.
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Wes:
Thanks, Peg.
Here are the files.
Thanks.
Hey, Peg.
You knew her, right?
Tammy Hillam.
Before she took off.
She was a blonde?
If she's a blonde,
I'm a double D.
What do you mean by that?
She's a blonde in a bottle.
That girl's had red hair from the day she was born.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Oh, hey.
Are you going to let
Steve out before you go?
I don't know.
I haven't made up my mind yet.
We really don't have anything to hold him on.
I know that.
Will you... will you walk
Peg to her car?
Yeah.
Just call me if you need me.
I will.
Do you still carry that.38 in your purse?
This old thing?
I only carry this when
I don't know who to shoot.
You want a lift?
I'm just going to walk.
Are you sure?
I'll be okay.
Okay.
See you bright and early.
Good night, Peg.
Good night.
Oh! You scared the hell out of me.
You scared me.
What are you doing in here, anyway?
I was waiting for you.
I got tired. I fell asleep.
Come on. Get out.
I'll drive.
Hi, this is Sheriff Clayton.
Is Ryan still there?
Maybe you can help me.
Who is this?
Reed, I need some information about the California woman.
The one that was killed in Brigham.
Yes, something from the autopsy report.
Can you pull that for me?
Yeah, sure I can hold.
I'm going to take off and get some sleep.
I'm going to leave everything set up,
- If that's all right?
- Yeah, sure.
Meredith, do you need a place to stay?
My house... it's kind of empty.
I'm going to be here tonight.
No, thanks.
I'll just grab a motel.
I have an FBI charge card.
Never leave home without it.
Yeah, no,
I'm still here.
Yeah, look under hair color.
I need to know if she was really blonde.
Thanks for the offer.
Yeah.
No, it's a strange question, but I need to know if she was a natural blonde or if she dyed her hair.
Natural blonde.
You're absolutely sure about that?
No, no. Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Thanks, Reed.
Where are you taking me?
My place.
- Ed...
- Don't Ed me, Peg.
This is not a make-out thing.
I don't want you spending the night alone, or any night alone, until they catch this guy.
No fooling around?
Oh, I don't know.
No.
I'm saving myself for our wedding night.
You better be.
Father in heaven...
- Are we here?
- Yeah.
- Did you clean?
- No.
Come on, come on, come on.
Recording: We're sorry, the cellular phone you are calling is currently unavailable, or out of the...
- Bishop.
- What are you doing up?
The baby's decided he's a night owl.
I need to come in.
Yeah.
Come on in.
Between this baby and little Mac I don't know if I'll ever get any sleep.
- Is Terry home?
- Yeah, he's in the kitchen.
He couldn't sleep either.
Are you hungry?
- Did you get any dinner?
- No.
Hey.
I thought you were going to get some sleep.
- (baby crying)
- There he goes again. I'll be back.
What's on your mind?
I don't think...
I'm ever going to forgive myself.
What are you talking about?
You know, Sarah had this way of getting... behind my eyes.
She could help me understand what I was seeing.
If she was still here,
I would have figured out this thing a long time ago.
I know I'm no substitute for Sarah, if you want to talk.
Lisa Colvin.
Do you remember her?
- Pretty girl, red hair.
- Yeah.
She died in that rock climbing accident a few years ago.
- Right after you got here.
- Mm-hmm.
1 6 years old.
I can't stop thinking about those shoes she was wearing.
- Remember?
- No.
The shoes... they weren't made for hiking at all.
It never occurred to me to look for foul play.
It was just an accident, right?
Then Tammy Hillam.
She leaves for Hollywood and just disappears.
All this time we've been looking for her in Los Angeles.
I have this feeling that she didn't get very far from town.
When you came to town,
Ralph couldn't stop talking about you.
He said you were the best worker he ever had.
Returned missionary,
Eagle Scout, hard worker.
When I needed part-time help,
I didn't think twice.
I just deputized you.
Then when I needed you full-time, it never crossed my mind to run your prints.
I didn't even make you fill out an application.
It couldn't have happened anywhere, but a place like this.
I finally got around to running your prints.
The strange thing is, you don't come up as Terry Woodruff.
I found Terry, though.
I found him in Snowflake, Arizona.
There was an article about how he drowned.
In the Colorado River on a youth trip two weeks after he got home from his mission.
There's another kid in town who spent four years in prison for raping and almost killing a little girl.
A little red-haired girl.
The church folks talked in the paper about how he had turned his life around, how he found God in prison.
And then he just disappeared.
You know, the thing is... your prints match that man.
I want you to tell me... what you've done with Jamie's body.
There's a... there's this spot... about a half a mile up the canyon.
The horse trail forks off.
There's a little patch of Joshua trees.
Joshua trees.
I put her in there.
- Tammy Hillam.
- (sobbing)
Did you put her in there, too?
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I don't know why I can't stop.
I...
I've tried... so hard... to be good.
You've got to help me.
I don't want to go to hell.
Put those on.
There's one thing
I can't make sense of.
That woman from California.
Her hair wasn't red.
It was red... when I finished with it.
Terry...
- Put on those cuffs.
- They don't forgive you.
Not ever.
For the rest of your life, no matter how good you are, everybody knows.
- I had no choice.
- (cocks)
I had to become somebody else.
Terry, take your hands off that weapon, and put on those handcuffs.
This whole thing's your fault.
You put a badge on me and a gun in my hand.
You were supposed to protect this town from people like me.
You never even checked my background.
What were you thinking?
You brought the wolf... right into the center of the flock.
Terry... take your hands off that gun.
- Terry?
- April, stay back.
- What have you done?
- Terry, please.
- Terry, what's going on?
- Terry: You're so naive.
You think you can just close your eyes and the world's going to pass you by.
You think you can just... get down on your knees at night, and say your prayers, and God is going to protect you from people like me.
Well, guess what, Sheriff?
Jamie was praying pretty hard at the end.
And come to think of it, so were the others.
Isn't that something?
God isn't going to stop me.
For all the praying that goes on around here, you'd think God would care a little bit more about this town.
What is he talking about?
Terry, take your hands off that gun.
You might as well have killed those girls yourself.
- (baby crying)
- You're responsible.
You've got blood on your hands.
- Bishop, no!
- Terry, please.
When these parents find out what you've done, they're going to spit on your grave.
- Put the weapon down.
- What are you doing!?
April, take the baby out.
Take him out!
What do you think, Wes?
When I raise this gun, am I going to point it at my head or yours?
Tell them I'm sorry, Wes... when you see those girls.
- You tell them I'm sorry.
- (gun fires)
No! No!
- April...
- You get out!
Get out of here!
Hello.
We're wrapping things up.
I just wanted to come in and say goodbye.
We found out about the California woman.
Turns out she was born and raised in Snowflake, Arizona.
We figure he must have pulled her over for a speeding ticket, something like that.
Maybe she recognized him.
The meeting's starting.
Are you going in?
I was supposed to protect them.
I was supposed to take care of them.
Nobody blames you.
You're a good man, Wes.
You really are.
Congregation:
*^ Nearer, my God *^
*^ To Thee *^
*^ Nearer to Thee *^
*^ Even though it be a cross *^
*^ That raiseth me *^
*^ Still all my song shall be *^
*^ Nearer, my God, to Thee *^
*^ Nearer, my God, to Thee *^
It's Bishop.
*^ Nearer to Thee. *^
O, God, the Eternal Father, we ask Thee in the name of Thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this bread to the souls of all those who partake of it, that they may eat in remembrance of the body of Thy Son, and witness unto Thee,
O, God, the Eternal Father, that they are willing to take upon them the name of Thy Son, and always remember Him, and keep His commandments which He has given them, that they may always have
His Spirit to be with them,
- Amen.
- All: Amen.

[CASHIER SPEAKS FRENCH]
Where are you going?
MAN ON PA: The 2:15 to Mont Laurier will be loading at gate number 10.
One ticket, please. Mont Laurier.
Do you mind? The guy in the back, he won't stop snoring.
No. Sure.
I'm Matt.
- I'm Martin.
- Hey, Martin. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- Where you headed to?
Just as far away as I can get.
Well, I'll drink to that, brother.
Cheers.
[ENGINE BACKFIRES]
DRIVER: I think we got a little engine trouble here, folks. Just sit tight.
Man! You know, the same thing happened in St. Lawrence.
We had to sit tight for nearly eight hours.
Hell, this sucks. This totally sucks.
MAN: Three hundred and eighty-five dollars. Cash only.
All I got is my dad's credit card.
You can't read?
Cash only.
- You have a license?
- I had one. They took it away, though.
Looks like you're driving.
[SCREAMING]
MATT:
See that?
Fake.
- What happened?
- Courtesy of my stepdad.
Hit me so hard I flew across the kitchen, dented the Sheetrock.
My mom watched the whole thing.
- Why?
- Why does he do half the things he does?
Fucking psycho,
200 pounds of worthless grease.
But I got him back.
What? You popped him?
Got me a tour of hell, though. Had me in military school by the next morning.
But I don't believe in following people's rules, man.
Fuck people, fuck their rules. That's why I jumped the wall two days ago.
Now I'm going to Seattle to play music.
[GUITAR PLAYING]
[MATT SINGING]
[POPS]
Jesus Christ.
I'm so sorry, man. I'm an idiot,
I wasn't paying attention.
No. Forget about it, man.
We're lucky this piece of shit had a spare. Fuck.
You ever changed a tire before, Martin?
Didn't think so. Cool.
Okay. What do we got here?
Oh, yeah, I'll have us back on the road in no time, no time at all.
But this time, I'm driving. Cool?
[GRUNTING]
Fucker's on tight.
First one's always the hardest. After that, the rest of them come off pretty easy.
[MATT WHISTLING]
You and I are about the same height, man.
What?
[TIRES SCREECHING]
[MATT CHOKING]
Shh.
Be quiet.
[SINGING MATT'S SONG]
Officer. Officer, I need your help.
I just saw my son on the ferry.
[SPEAKING IN FRENCH]
My son is dead.
He died 19 years ago, but this was my son.
He walked straight in front of me.
We had eye contact.
He recognized me.
A mother's not wrong about things like this.
How can I explain how dangerous he was, how...?
No, not "was."
Is.
My son is a very dangerous man.
[SPEAKING IN FRENCH]
- What are you doing?
- Preparing a briefing for Agent Scott.
Agent Scott?
I don't understand why he needs someone else. We've got everything under control.
- We don't have anything, Joseph.
- Because we didn't have enough time.
- We need a couple more days, that's it.
- She here yet?
She was on the flight. They can't find her. Gérard is checking baggage claim.
- She's going to be advising, right?
- This isn't about territory, Paquette.
PAQUETTE: There hasn't been a murder like this in years.
And the first thing you do is bring in someone else. Come on.
I have a strange feeling about this murder.
We need help. We have nothing.
You call me as soon as she gets here.
[CAR DOOR CLOSES]
You got to be fucking kidding me.
- Special Agent Scott?
- Yes.
We were waiting for you at the station.
PAQUETTE: That's a grave, you know.
- Yes, I know that.
- Ah.
- Agent Scott.
Monsieur Director, hello.
I see you are already making yourself comfortable.
Joseph Paquette and Emile Duval.
They're leading the investigation.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. Thanks for inviting me.
We didn't.
We're pretty sure the victim was killed somewhere else, then brought here.
I think it was premeditated.
PAQUETTE: What?
- I think it was premeditated.
I think the killer chose this site, specifically, and dug it in advance.
I can show you... You can tell because...
See this? The corners?
They're neat. They're symmetrical.
The proportions are precise.
They're exactly 5 foot, 11 inches.
- Your victim 5-10?
- Yes, exactly.
I think he's been watching him for a few weeks... studying his habits, his routine.
And he knew he could rely on digging the grave right here.
And how did he know the victim would be here when he wanted?
That's a bicycle path, right?
On the photos you sent... the victim had these slight indentations on his ankles.
I'm guessing that's from bicycle clips.
Also, there's a sexual element to all this.
Strangling from behind, cutting off the hands, smashing in the face.
It's tactile. It's immediate.
It's what turns him on.
And... he wanted you to find the body.
I mean... why else bury it at a construction site, unless you want it to be dug up, right?
His eyes, we think they were removed, or are they still in his skull?
- We don't know.
- I assume you're doing...
Skull reconstruction. Yes, of course.
- It's being done right now.
- Okay.
Are we done here?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Good night.
Don't worry about Paquette.
He's impulsive.
He wants to rush into everything.
I don't blame him.
It's good to see you again, Illeana.
Means a lot that you're up here.
Lying in the grave.
My investigators think you are some kind of witch.
Well, I've been called worse.
- You know that.
- I know.
[KNOCKS ON DOOR]
Hi. I'm sorry for disturbing you.
A man was killed last night.
It happened in a parking lot outside a 24-hour health club around 9:00.
- Same m.o.?
- Same everything.
We found the garrotte there.
It looks homemade.
The face was bashed in with a loose stone.
No time to get to the hands, though.
- Why not?
- He was interrupted.
The victim's name was Clive Morin, and that's James Costa.
He claims he saw what happened.
COSTA:
He headed towards my car, and I hear...
When our guys got there, he was trying to revive the victim.
PAQUETTE:
What about the blood on you?
You try to help somebody who's bleeding to death...
ILLEANA: Is he checking out?
- ...you get blood on you.
James McKeen Costa.
Born Nova Scotia, 1965.
Everything looks pretty standard.
We've got blood samples and a DNA swab on the way to the lab.
I turn, and I see... a man standing over somebody else... with... a rock... in his hand.
And then... he started beating this guy's face in...
- So I shouted...
- What did you shout?
"Stop," you know. Something dumb like that. I don't know. I...
And then I ran towards them.
And he looked up at me, and he pointed a gun at me.
And I...
I don't know. I thought...
I don't know what I thought.
Then he ran away.
He's gone, and then I call the cops.
And I tried to perform CPR on the other guy until the paramedics came.
Did you remove the garrotte?
The...? Oh, the thing around his neck?
Yeah, I kind of had to.
- Did you see where the attacker went?
- Yeah, he went far from me. Right?
What kind of gun did he have?
He had the kind that puts really big holes in people.
I saw this guy.
All right? And I can draw a little bit, all right? So... maybe if you would give me a piece of paper, I can sketch him for you.
[DOOR OPENS]
I don't know about this guy.
I can't read him.
Something about his answers.
You mind if I give it a try?
No, please go ahead.
Hi.
You another cop?
In a way, yes.
I'm Special Agent Illeana Scott.
- Special agent?
- I'm FBI. I'm helping on the case.
- Can I ask a few questions?
- You asking the same ones... the other guy did?
- Yes, probably.
- Do you mind if I have a cigarette?
- No, of course not.
You nervous?
Yes, I am.
Extremely.
Thanks for the pad of paper.
So, what did he look like?
He had extremely bright eyes.
Burning, you know?
Even in the dark.
His hair... could have been blond.
He had a beard.
He had, not five-o'clock shadow... but something cultivated.
Did he seem agitated or in control?
COSTA:
Oh, Jesus.
Is that what I think it is?
Is that...? That's the...
That was around his neck, right?
Am I right?
- Am I right?
ILLEANA: Yes, yes.
COSTA:
You did that on purpose?
All right, I'm doing my best here, all right?
That man's face was half gone!
I couldn't even...
It didn't even look human.
I did everything I could to try to help him, and he...
He died, okay? He died. There was...
Look, there was too much blood there.
I'd never seen so much blood in my life.
And I kept trying, even though I knew that it was too late.
I saw the man who did this. Okay?
I saw him, and I can show you what he looks like.
And then... you can go catch him.
Okay.
What do you think?
Yeah, pattern marks on Morin's neck show the killer's left-handed.
He sketches with his right, tried to light a cigarette with his right.
I think we need a little more than that, no?
I know. There's also a file open on the table.
It's your profile.
Evidence, notes, everything.
If he were the killer, chances are he'd be trying to take a look.
Psychopaths actually have very different brain patterns.
You say words like "tree," "sofa,"
"house," "rape," "incest," "murder"... a normal person's brain pattern changes, their frontal lobe reacts.
Psychopaths have no reaction.
They feel the same about murder as they do about dinner.
They have no emotional connection.
Anyway, my point is that when he saw the garrotte... he reacted... with genuine shock and disgust.
PAQUETTE:
A psychopath's brain?
You learn a lot of that stuff at the FBI, don't you?
I mean, all those theories, all those books.
Yeah, that's right.
I'm not sure what I see in you yet, with your tricks.
- I don't have any.
- Bullshit.
You pulled a lot of them in that room.
COSTA:
Agent Scott?
- Could I talk to you for a second?
- Excuse me.
My sisters get that look in their eye when they're cornered and don't like it.
- I'm sorry if I'm wrong, but...
- No.
- Thank you.
- All right.
- Agent Scott.
- Can I talk to you?
- You haven't slept yet.
- No.
There's a guard in the lobby of that hotel.
And we're right by a road.
So it doesn't make any sense.
Do you think it was staged?
No. There's always a sense of joy in a staging.
A kind of arrogance.
There's none of that behavior here.
Maybe he wants us to find the bodies quickly, like at the construction site.
Yeah. But why?
I mean, why?
He's not taunting us.
You know, there's no "fuck you" anywhere.
[PARTIERS CHEERING]
Why do you do that?
- What?
- Cover your ears?
I just think better when it's quiet.
It makes sense.
With all this, maybe he's just getting desperate.
- That happens, doesn't it?
- Yeah, but why?
We're nowhere near him.
And he knows it.
[SPEAKING IN FRENCH]
PAQUETTE:
Henri Bisonnette, a freelance scuba diver.
- Is that our construction site body?
PAQUETTE: Yes.
His sister identified him.
Bisonnette used to work for him on and off for a few years.
Also, his sister said he disappeared just about a couple of weeks ago.
But his credit cards have been in use all this time.
[SPEAKING IN FRENCH]
What kind of a man was he?
What do we know?
He lived in a small apartment... picked up odd computer jobs... didn't have a lot of friends.
You ever do that? Go diving?
My ex-wife made us take one of those Club Med holidays.
She wasn't down 20 feet before she freaked out. Couldn't take it.
[SPEAKING IN FRENCH]
PAQUETTE:
That's a good one.
Have you ever gone diving,
Agent Scott?
[SPEAKING IN FRENCH]
No, I've never tried it.
[PHONE RINGING]
DUVAL: it's very serene.
- Oui?
The fish swim all around you.
They don't even mind you're there.
You'd like it, it's quiet.
[PHONE DROPS]
- I've got a hit on that sketch.
- Where?
Some residential hotel near the river.
- What are you doing?
- Shouldn't we be going?
We're still eating our breakfast.
- Follow me.
- Thank you.
So he paid me cash three months in advance, and I never see him.
Did you see him here?
MAN:
Yeah, that's him.
But before you guys bust him, he kind of owes me $90 on the phone bill.
Maybe you guys can take care of that.
You know what?
We need that phone bill.
- All right. You guys gonna pay it?
PAQUETTE: We'll see.
[BANGS]
[WATER RUNNING]
[SNIFFS]
DUVAL:
Everything's clear.
- Oh, shit.
- What?
Ah!
The ring from the finger was engraved with the name Clark William Edwards.
It's from Vancouver Secondary School.
Thirty-four years old.
Works part-time on an Alaskan cruise line.
His credit card was used yesterday in Montreal.
- He had not been reported missing.
- Good.
- Let's keep it that way.
- Why?
Let's not reward the killer with coverage.
He likes attention. He'll be pissed.
If he's pissed off, he'll make a mistake.
We should put a marker on Edwards' credit card... and order surveillance of this place.
- So we're getting close.
- One more thing.
The lab results on Costa's DNA came in.
- He's clean.
- Good.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
[LAUGHING]
[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
COSTA:
Man...
You got those coffees and a sandwich?
So this isn't a coincidence, right?
ILLEANA:
No.
The two cops outside the gallery?
That's not a coincidence either, right?
Does that bother you?
I've been looking over my shoulder since this whole thing happened, so no.
- I'm glad for the company.
- How are you doing?
I can't sleep.
But that's all right.
I have a giant show on Friday, bunch of new paintings.
If I don't sell them,
I'm gonna go broke.
So I'm throwing myself into my work.
Kind of like you.
- Here you go.
- Keep it. Thanks.
Did you get any responses to the sketch?
Maybe.
You're being vague.
That night, do you remember
Clive Morin fighting back?
Um, uh...
I mean, you know... it took me a couple seconds to see, even register, what was going on.
I heard these sounds,
I saw him with the rock.
By the time I saw Clive Morin... you know, he wasn't doing anything.
How do you know CPR?
I don't.
I mean, I...
I tried to do CPR on him... but I just did what I could, you know?
I imitated what I've seen on TV.
You looking at my fingers?
You looking at this?
- Yes.
- You're, like, looking at everything.
No, this is... This is... I...
I make my own frames.
You know, and I...
The closer we get to the show, the worse my accuracy is.
How long have you been doing that, dealing art?
I started right after school.
I went to Thailand, you know?
And I...
I met this very strange old man who was a painter.
But he didn't have any money so he just...
You know, he'd just paint everything.
And he had these doors.
These incredible doors that he'd painted.
And he gave me a couple of them.
And so I brought them here and I sold them... for, you know, not much money, but I sent it back to him, the money.
You know? And it was a fortune to him.
And that's how I started.
That's very nice.
I'd like to buy you a cup of coffee, but it looks like you have a problem.
Well, the first step is admitting to it.
Is that a sense of humor?
Is that what that is? It is.
All that and... What's this?
My cell phone number, in case you remember anything else.
Anything that might be helpful.
Okay.
All right. Well, thanks.
Okay, I'll...
Maybe you want to come to the show on Friday night.
You know, I think you'd like it.
Lots of strange, disturbing pieces.
All right.
Whoever was in that hotel room called this number 20 times.
"Rebecca Asher."
DUVAL:
She claimed to have seen her son... at the Quebec ferry terminal three weeks ago.
- And what do we know about her?
- Ln her late 60s, no husband, lives alone.
I'm gonna handle this one on my own, I think. Okay?
[PAQUETTE SPEAKING IN FRENCH]
[ILLEANA SPEAKING IN FRENCH]
[DUVAL LAUGHS]
[SPEAKS IN FRENCH]
ILLEANA: I know you've seen this picture on the news... but if you could take a closer look at it, please?
Of course.
ILLEANA:
Could that be your son?
It could be.
[BIRDS CHIRPING]
I recognized him on the ferry.
He had a full beard, hat low on his forehead.
But his eyes... they were unmistakable.
And he was pulling on his ear.
It's an old nervous tic from childhood.
I could never get him to break it.
Were you ever actually asked to identify a body years ago?
They showed me some remains... that had been hit by a truck.
I can't say that I was in any way prepared for it.
No, of course not.
I'm sorry.
- May I?
- Please.
Martin.
No. No, that is Reese.
- That's Martin's older brother.
- Oh.
By older, I mean three minutes.
- Twins?
- Identical.
Has Reese been receiving any strange phone calls, or...?
Of course you couldn't know.
Reese passed away.
Oh, I'm sorry.
They were 14.
They took a raft out on the Saint Michel.
There had been a very big snow melt-off that year... and Martin fell overboard.
Reese jumped in to save him.
Only Martin reached the shore.
- That must have been devastating for you.
- Lt was.
Well, it was for Martin too.
You know, Reese...
He was just charismatic... outgoing.
After he died,
Martin just took a strange turn.
He became violent.
And when he was 16, he stole most of my jewelry and ran away.
The police from St. Jovite called me just a few days later... telling me about the accident.
That's a great one.
MRS. ASHER:
Oh, yes.
Summer vacation, Fort Rupert.
ILLEANA:
And this?
MRS. ASHER:
Oh, that was our first symphony.
- The Magic Flute.
- Of course.
He's cute.
He was.
He was cute.
Now, that's Martin.
He always had to wear those big glasses.
Half the time, I couldn't tell them apart unless he had those on.
Here, I'll just take... that thing for you.
- Oh, I forgot my purse. I'll just be...
- I'll get it.
Here you are.
Thanks. I appreciate your time.
You've been very helpful.
You will call me when you find him, won't you?
Yes, of course.
Good.
DUVAL:
So?
How long does it take here to dig up a body?
[WOOD CREAKING]
According to his mother, Martin Asher had only broken one bone in his life:
The left radius, falling off a chair or something.
This kid broke a lot of bones.
Mostly in his face, hands and torso.
But as you can see, the left radius is intact.
This isn't the body of Martin Asher.
Okay. We better get Mrs. Asher someplace safe.
DESK CLERK:
Here, Mrs. Asher, 601.
No, no. I'm afraid that room is unacceptable.
It's too near the elevator.
- How'd she talk you into putting her here?
- Mrs. Asher has a way with words.
She's hiding something.
There's a door in the house hidden by a bookcase.
Her house is under the department's protection... but we can't just go and search it.
Well, what about a headstrong FBI agent who's just not familiar with the rules?
Now, that's a different story.
[CLICKS]
[WOOD SCRAPES]
[LIGHT SWITCH CLICKS]
ILLEANA:
There you are.
[SCREAMS]
[PHONE RINGING]
- Scott.
DUVAL: Illeana.
The crime scene investigators think he came in through a second story window.
Mrs. Asher claims no one else has a key.
And so far, the fingerprints haven't turned up anything.
- How are you feeling? You okay?
- I'm fine.
- Are you sure?
- I'm fine.
Illeana, Leclair knows you were at the house.
I don't think he connected you with anything else...
Could...? Would you come to the office about an hour early tomorrow?
Sure.
- I'll see you there.
- Bye.
ILLEANA:
Taking lives.
That's what Martin Asher's been doing for almost 20 years.
His first victim, John Doe.
He was clumsier then.
He covered with a car accident... to fake his own death, and then he took the boy's identity.
There's a gap between
John Doe and Henri Bisonnette... but that doesn't mean
Asher was dormant.
Yes, VICLAS gave us 19 unsolved murders throughout eastern Canada.
At least 11 match the m.o.
All who either lived solitary lives or simply would not be missed right away.
Henri Bisonnette. Asher kills him, takes his life, his apartment... uses his credit cards.
He even pays his taxes.
Nothing extravagant.
He's just living Bisonnette's life.
Then he drops him for Clark William
Edwards, and as Edwards he stalks Morin.
All of these men have something in common, something that he desires.
Simply, a life different from his own.
I met his mother.
Asher had a twin brother who she clearly favored.
He died in a drowning accident.
It wouldn't take much to get her to admit... that she thinks Martin had something to do with it. She hates him.
So this guy can't stand to be who he actually is for even a moment.
So... he overlaps bodies.
He's like a hermit crab.
He outgrows one shell, and he starts looking for a new one.
Okay.
Someone just broke into James Costa's gallery.
All that's missing is my organizer and a business checkbook? Nothing else?
PAQUETTE: The alarm system was cut.
- Yeah, right.
So this doesn't feel like a normal break-in?
DUVAL:
What happened tonight, Mr. Costa?
Right, listen,
I do all my calls to Europe at night.
All my shipping stuff at night.
I want a cup of coffee,
I go to the diner across the street.
I come back in, the door's busted open, and my desk is all messed up.
You think it's him, right?
DUVAL: We'll assign more officers to your apartment until we're sure it's nothing.
COSTA: That answers my question.
- Clark William Edwards.
You're meeting with someone named
Clark William Edwards tomorrow night?
- Is that right?
- Yeah. He's a potential buyer.
His rep called me up yesterday.
Could be a really big client.
You're kidding me.
We'll have undercover officers watching all the time.
The best surveillance team.
We're still talking about the same guy who smashes in people's faces... and cuts off their hands?
PAQUETTE: He won't come within 50 yards of you, okay?
DUVAL: it would be a great service to the city of Montreal.
It is dangerous, but it is probably our best shot at catching this guy.
All right?
All right. All right.
But only in service to the great city of Montreal.
[SPEAKING IN FRENCH]
Is he gonna drive me home?
Could Agent Scott drive me home?
I should have stayed in Winnipeg, you know?
I had a nice gallery, three paintings on the wall, nobody ever came in.
If you stayed there, we wouldn't have had a witness who could draw the killer.
And that's made a big difference.
- That's a generous way of looking at it.
- Left here?
No, just keep going straight, past Chevalier.
Can I...?
Can I ask you a question?
Yes.
How do you do it?
How do you live your life surrounded by all this... ugliness? You know,
I mean, murderers... and victims and these pictures, you know?
What I'm going through, just a little bit, is what you live every day, right?
- This is my job.
- There are different jobs.
- There are better jobs.
- Not for me. No there isn't. 219?
219? Yeah, yeah, right up here.
- You say that like it's a punishment.
- It's not a punishment. It's...
It's more like a compulsion.
Okay, we're here.
What compels you?
Fine. When I was 12 years old...
I heard a noise downstairs and I thought it was my dad.
So... So I went down.
And somebody had broken into our house.
He saw me and he came towards me.
I grabbed a knife and I ran towards him.
And I killed him.
He was 16 years old.
He was probably trying to steal the TV.
But I killed him.
That's what compels me.
[KNOCKS ON WINDOW]
- Walk you to the door, Mr. Costa?
- Yeah, great. I'll...
What does Mr. Agent Scott think about all this?
I'm not married.
I just... l just wear that.
So listen, tomorrow...
It's gonna be okay.
Try to get some sleep.
Then I'll look forward to seeing you tomorrow, okay?
Is there some kind of signal
I should give if I need help?
- You know, like...
PAQUETTE: No need.
All eyes will be on you.
DUVAL: We've got five men on the inside and a dozen outside.
So don't worry. When he shows up, we'll be right on top of him.
Well, that's a comfort.
[CROWD CHATTERING]
BARTENDER:
Everything okay?
- What?
- Would you like another?
- Refill?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
BARTENDER: Scotch, right?
- Yeah.
He's late.
Yes, he is.
COSTA: I just got a note. It says,
"Meet me in the men's room."
I'm going to the restroom.
Meet me outside.
What's going on?
DUVAL: We thought it best to cut it off.
- I was sitting in there for two hours.
- He must've made us.
- "Made us"? What does that mean?
He saw you?
He knows what's happening?
He knows I'm cooperating with police?
PAQUETTE: Take it easy, okay?
- Take it easy? Have you ever been fishing?
The bait always dies.
Oh, boy.
This ought to provide you with some juicy profiling material.
Single art dealer... living in constant state of organized chaos.
Purchases firearm, even though he doesn't know how to use one... for a false sense of security.
- You... You can come in, you know.
- No, it's all right. Thank you.
You two, back door.
You'll be safe.
You have two guys in back... and two in the hallway. Okay?
- Great.
Just going to check the street one more time.
If you need anything, you know how to get me, Duval or Paquette?
- Yeah. Back there at the bar...
- It's okay.
No, I really wish
I didn't freak out like that.
I wasn't helping anybody.
You've been great.
You're making me sound nicer than I am.
- You are nice.
- No. That's...
That's the kiss of death.
What do you mean?
Us nice guys never get the girl.
I should go.
You know how to find us.
ILLEANA:
So I'm leaving.
What do you mean?
My job is done here.
You have a profile and a witness.
You don't need me any more.
Illeana... we need someone who can get into Asher's head.
- You have that, and you have a suspect.
- That might not be enough.
What's really going on here?
Nothing.
Please. What is it?
I might be having a reaction to the witness.
A reaction?
Favorable.
One that could cloud my judgment.
I see.
Illeana... how long did we know each other when I was at Quantico?
- Six months.
- How many times... were you asked for a drink?
- I don't know.
How many times did you turn them down?
- Every time.
- Well...
I think it takes a lot to cloud your judgment.
Listen, I have to catch this guy.
I know you. You have to catch him too.
I really need you.
Please.
[SPEAKING IN FRENCH]
[SPEAKS IN FRENCH]
DUVAL:
At least the food is good.
PAQUETTE:
Yeah, because the art is shit.
Try not to look so much like cops.
I almost didn't recognize you without a picture of a dead body.
- That's nice.
- Lt sounded better in my head.
- Have a drink.
- No, thank you.
I mean, it's just water.
- All right?
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.
- This one is my favorite.
You know, it just...
I don't know why. The sky...
The sky in it reminds me of growing up in Nova Scotia.
Where'd you grow up?
- Just outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
- Oh, yeah? You a country girl?
- I'll let you get back to work.
- Thank you.
[SPEAKS IN FRENCH]
It's him.
PAQUETTE:
Freeze!
[CROWD SCREAMING]
[CROWD YELLING IN FRENCH]
[FIREWORKS EXPLODING]
[BAND PLAYING]
So now he's running loose again.
We lost him in the crowd.
It was a fucking mob scene.
LECLAIR:
"Fucking mob scene." And Costa?
Shaken up, but he wasn't hurt.
LECLAIR:
What do you think his next move is?
I think he sees James Costa as unfinished business.
We've got Costa on a flight to Toronto tomorrow morning at 8:30.
Then I want one of you to take him personally to the airport.
Okay, I'll go.
Dismissed.
COSTA:
Oh, hey. Would you mind taking these?
- We are running a little late.
- Yeah, I know. I know, I'm coming.
Hi, James.
Where you going?
[SPEAKING IN FRENCH]
Not leaving, are you?
Come on, after all these fun games we've been playing?
All this time that I've put into it?
Take a seat.
There's a police officer outside your apartment.
I also couldn't help but notice that you've been packing.
And that... is not... okay!
[CHOKING]
Now, I thought you and I had a special relationship.
The kind that demanded a great deal of respect.
But obviously, you don't understand.
So I'm gonna explain it to you again.
You have something that I want.
Therefore... it's mine.
So this idea of running away... it's not gonna happen.
I need you to answer something for me.
What did you tell the police about me?
What do the police know about...?
[COUGHING]
COSTA:
Help!
Help me!
Help!
Drop it.
I said, drop it!
[GUN SHOOTING]
This is Agent Scott.
Officer down, 219 St. Amelie.
Shit.
[TIRES SCREECHING]
[HORNS HONKING]
Help!
[FABRIC TEARS]
[GROANING]
Is he dead?
Help! Is he dead?
- He shot Duval.
- Drop your weapon!
It's him?
ILLEANA: Drop your weapon!
- It's him. It's Asher!
- Drop your weapon!
- He shot Duval.
ILLEANA:
Move, move! Go!
He was lucky.
An accident like this, only stitches.
Do you know where he was taking you,
Mr. Costa?
I have no idea.
I think he wanted to add Mr. Costa to his collection.
I'm so sorry about Inspector Duval.
He was trying to save my life.
- So, what now?
LECLAIR: We got our lab results.
Asher's DNA matches the hairs found on Clive Morin's body.
So it's over?
LECLAIR: I will need a statement from you, some paperwork.
Other than that, yeah, it's over.
You did a very brave thing in that car today, Mr. Costa.
You were great.
[STUTTERS]
Thank you.
Bye.
[KNOCKS ON DOOR]
[BREATHING HEAVILY]
[MOANING]
- May I help you?
- Call Ms. Scott's room, please.
Of course.
I'm so sorry, sir.
She has a "do not disturb."
Can I take a message for her?
No.
[CHURCH BELLS RINGING]
Hey. Hey.
Hey.
What? Ow.
It's the stitches.
Looks like you opened up some last night.
I'll have to redo some of them.
- They got art down there, don't they?
- What?
Down there in Washington, D.C.
Those politician types, they like to hang things on their walls, don't they?
I'm just saying, I could start a little...
You know, a gallery.
I could find a space there.
They have galleries there, right?
[PHONE RINGING]
Oh, God.
Where is it? Oh, my God.
Scott.
She's here?
No. I'm in the hospital already.
I'm just here with a friend.
- Be gentle.
ILLEANA: I'll be right up. Okay.
- That was Leclair.
- Ow!
ILLEANA: I have to meet him upstairs.
DOCTOR: Sorry.
Do you wanna come back here or meet in the lobby?
Lobby.
All right.
- How's your friend?
- He's fine.
LECLAIR:
I know this is unpleasant for you... but if you could just give us a definitive identification.
I understand.
Can't touch the body.
I'll touch anything I wish.
Crazy old bat.
ILLEANA:
Mrs. Asher?
Mrs. Asher!
Mrs. Asher?
MAN:
Hello, Mother.
All I ever wanted... was to love you.
But you wouldn't let me.
It was always Reese.
You could have had me forever, but you... ruined it. You ruined... everything.
Step back, Martin.
You don't frighten me.
[ELEVATOR RINGS]
LECLAIR:
Illeana!
Illeana!
Costa did it.
Costa is Asher.
What did you say?
Oh, shit!
- Costa did it.
- Where is he?
- Where?
ILLEANA: Elevator.
- Down? Up?
ILLEANA: Down!
LECLAIR:
Which one?
[YELLING IN FRENCH]
Fuck!
[LECLAIR SPEAKING IN FRENCH]
Come on, for fuck's sakes.
Hey, man. I found these in the machine.
Are they yours?
- Yeah. Thanks, man.
COSTA: I was buying a pack...
[YELLING]
You don't trust us, but you did trust her enough to come here and fuck our killer.
LECLAIR: Case was closed. She's handled herself in a professional manner.
Bullshit!
Tell that to Duval. You remember Duval?
And the poor bastard lying in the morgue?
I know how you feel.
If you have something to say, say it to me.
PAQUETTE: What did you say?
- If you have something to say...
Paquette!
[TRAIN HORN HONKING]
MAN: For the past four years,
I've been scouting for the League.
Quebec, Alberta, Manitoba, BC last year.
Whenever I hear about some star kid.
- Always traveling?
- You get used to it after a while.
- Tough on the wife, though.
- Not married.
No? So it's just you and the two sisters, right?
MAN:
Susan and Debbie.
And where are they?
- They're back home in Tracadie.
- Tracadie.
Hockey's big out there.
Yeah, there's nothing else to do in that fucking town.
- You play as a kid?
- Yeah, a little.
World Junior Team two years in a row.
No shit. I could tell, I could tell.
You got all that residual confidence left over from being a golden boy.
The way you smoke... your voice... it's a little low.
Trying to be cool, so kids at the rink don't know what a loser you've become.
What the fuck you saying, man?
Don't get tense.
PAQUETTE:
That's Christopher Hart.
LECLAIR:
What do we know about him?
PAQUETTE:
He's a drug addict and an art thief.
Costa was selling stolen art for him.
E-mails show Costa wasn't paying him.
All Hart wanted was his money.
He owed him over $80,000.
Costa set him up.
LECLAIR:
Yeah.
[PHONE RINGING]
COSTA:
Hi. Are you there?
It's me.
- Who is this?
- You know who it is.
Come on, Illeana.
You didn't fall for James Costa.
Somebody as beautiful and powerful as you... doesn't fall for a faggy art dealer.
Okay?
That guy was nothing, all right?
I didn't take his life, I lived it.
I was the best thing that ever happened to that guy.
You looked at him... and you saw me.
And I looked at you, and I saw you.
And we are the same.
Fuck you.
"Fuck you"?
Fuck you. Yeah, I did fuck you.
Remember making love with those pictures of the dead people around us?
Let's face it, Illeana... an ordinary person does not love that as much as we did.
I mean, coming inside of you was the best moment of my life.
And I feel so much better now.
Everything just keeps going my way, you know?
Bye-bye.
- What'd he say?
- Where is he?
A hit. Morin's credit card.
Bought a train ticket... to Moncton 3 hours ago.
- He'll be there in 20 minutes.
Get Commander Hache on the phone and the Moncton director.
ILLEANA:
I'll be fine.
Thank you.
COSTA: I want a cup of coffee,
I go to the diner across the street.
I come back in, the door's busted open, and my desk is all messed up.
This isn't a coincidence, is it?
Help!

Seal off all the exits.
Now, now! Do it now!
PAQUETTE:
You.
[GRUNTING]
Ah!
Merde!
MAN: After carefully reviewing Special
Agent Scott's record with the Bureau... the Office of Professional Responsibility has issued a letter of termination... citing egregious lack of judgment... and conduct unbecoming of a federal agent.
Though the Bureau is saddened to lose an agent of your caliber... we're confident that this decision will best serve all parties involved.
RADIO ANNOUNCER: Last reported observation at Fort Collins airport... showed wind gusts to 80 knots.
Clouds to 8000 feet.

I scared you. I'm sorry.
Come on, have a seat.
No, no. Come on, have a seat.
You were making some tea?
All right, let me make you a cup.
Are you...? What are you looking for?
Huh?
You looking...?
You looking for this?
Now, you see, that's got me very confused, Illeana.
I mean, you got these planted all over the house.
Got this one behind the fridge.
You got one under the bed... the underside of the bathtub.
You must be awfully scared out here on your own.
Is that it?
You feeling scared?
I followed all that business down there in Washington... which, I thought... was completely bogus, by the way.
They were lucky to have you.
Very lucky.
But then you just disappeared.
You dropped out.
You left a few footprints, though, didn't you?
I thought you were pretty easy to find.
Come out here, there's never any cops around.
You don't make any phone calls.
Here you go.
Careful, it's still hot.
And then I saw that your belly was growing... and I knew that you were waiting for me.
They're boys, aren't they?
Twins?
[EXHALES]
I like going into their room.
It's full of so much love and warmth.
I can...
I can picture them in there, playing... having fun.
You and I... watching... and laughing.
You and I.
We can start fresh.
We can do this.
What? What is it?
I don't want to.
[GRUNTING]
I'm sorry. Those are our babies.
- I know those are.
- These are not your babies.
These are James Costa's babies.
I don't know who you are.
Why would you say something like that?
- Take it back.
- Okay, okay. I take it back. I take it back!
All right.
All right. Well, then stand up. Come on.
[CRYING]
Stand up.
You okay?
- Whose babies are they?
- Yours.
They're mine?
Give me a kiss.
[RETCHING]
[YELLS]
[WHIMPERING]

Kiss me.
It's all right.
I'm not gonna kill you.
I'm gonna do this until you pass out.
You're probably getting light-headed right about now. That's all right. Relax.
It's okay.
Okay. All right, come.
Give those to me.
Hey. Hey, hey.
It's all right. It's all right.
Hey, calm down. Give it to me.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.
Calm down.
Give it to me. All right?
Ah!
What are you doing?
What is wrong with you?
Hey, hey. Hey.
Okay!
You gonna calm down?
I'm not gonna hurt you, all right?
I don't want to hurt you.
- Are you gonna calm down?
- Yes! Yes. Yes.

[ENGLISH SDH]
Cold Creek Manor (2003) - CD2 - 23.976fps
What?
Dave Miller.
Yeah.
Dave Miller.
Hit on me on the airplane.
He offered me the VP spot and then asked me to spend the night with him in Chicago.
- What did you do?
- What did I do?
I moved out here into the middle of nowhere with you.
I turned into some 19th-century housewife.
Which was great for a while.
It felt like this weight was lifted off my shoulders.
And you were supposed to carry us through.
But that is not what's happening.
- We're drowning here.
- No. No.
- And it is time to get out.
- No. That's not what I said.
What did you do?
I said yes.
But then I called you on the phone.
And that was the day that Jesse was very nearly killed by that car.
Cooper, that was a wake-up call for me.
So...
That's why you agreed to come out here, right?
[Exhales deeply]
[Bell chimes]
[Rock music playing in distance]
[Laughter, billiard balls clacking]
Hey, buddy.
Hey.
Hey. How are you?
I understand
Steph and Kristen, they're gonna go on a shopping spree with their moms.
Yeah, yeah.
Can I buy you a drink?
Uh, no.
I got to get back.
One beer's not gonna kill you.
No.
Look, Cooper.
Word to the wise.
Be cool around here, okay?
I didn't come here to start a war, Ray.
Exactly.
All I'm saying is come in, buy a round of drinks.
Show there's no hard feelings between you and Dale.
What do you say?
Come on.
I'll buy you a beer.
Come on.
Drinks on Mr. Tilson.
Thanks, Mr. Tilson.
Appreciate it.
# Well, I'm so tired of crying but I'm out #

It's my birthday.
What do you say?
Happy birthday.
Mmm.
Thank you.
Another round.
Cheers.
One more.
No. No. No.
None for me.
I got to get going.
That is true,
Mr., uh, City Slicker.
Mr. Fuckin' Coop.
Get out of my face.
And get out of my home.
I know you put the snakes in my house.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Why don't you try and prove that?
Let me give you some advice.
Don't you ever... come to my house again.
And if you harm one hair on my family's head,
I will kill you.
Ooh.
Did you hear that, sheriff?
This man's threatening my life.
How much?
Scratch!
[Laughter]
Come on.
Loosen up.
I'm trying to play a game right now.
Dale, I'm gonna...
[Screams indistinctly]
- You ever fuckin' shut up?
- Hey, Dale...
You just never shut the fuck up, do you, Ruby?
You're not a man.
- You're not a fucking man, Dale!
- Oh, yeah?
You gonna keep talking to me?
Is that it?
Dale, don't!
MAN:
What are you doing?
[Glass breaking]
RUB Y: Dale!
Get the fuck off me!
Dale! Wait!
Dale!
Stop it!
Enough! Enough!
Back the fuck away, Massie.
Back up!
Step away!
I got enough to throw you back inside for the next five years, you piece of shit.
RUB Y: Annie.
You touch my sister ever again,
I swear to God it'll be the last thing you ever fucking do.
Annie, he didn't touch me, okay?
I fell.
I've been drinking, and I fell.
He didn't touch me, okay?
You made your point.
Are we done?
Get the fuck out of here.
[Door opens, closes]
[Engine revving]
Asshole.
[Grunts]
God!
[Breathing heavily]
JESSE:
What happened to the car?
It's all bloody and broken.
And everybody's out there.
Mom's out there.
- She seems a little bit mad.
- Huh?
So what happened?
Did you hit something?
Did you hit another car?
- Oh. Oh.
- What happened?
What'd you hit?
It was a deer.
Couldn't stop.
Jumped right in front of me.
What happened to you last night?
Mom, Dad, come here!
- What?
- Hurry up!
There's something over here!
Come on!
- What's going on?
- What's wrong?
LEAH:
Now what?
What is it?
Oh! Cooper!
KRISTEN:
Bastard!
You killed my pony!
JESSE:
Kris. Kris, wait up.
Wait for me!
COOPER:
Oh, my God.
LEAH:
Kristen!
DECLAN: You want us to take care of this, Mr. T?
I didn't do this.
I didn't hit the pony.
Just leave her alone.
She's crying.
It was Dale.
Oh.
Last night at the bar, there was this thing.
It was a fight.
- And Dale and I spoke.
- Were you drinking?
Yes.
But I did not kill Chester.
How many?
So you were drinking and you hit a deer.
You are absolutely sure that it was a deer?
Yes, I was absolutely sure it was a deer.
Leah, you have got to believe me.
Last night,
Dale, he would've killed Stan if the sheriff hadn't drawn a gun on him.
And he punched out his girlfriend.
If the sheriff hadn't been there,
I don't know what would've happened.
Let's get out of here.
Right now.
From whatever is happening.
Okay?
We promised we would never put these kids at risk.
Let's just go back.
Go back to what?
We already sold the house.
There is no place to go back to.
This is our house.
This is our house.
So what, you're not gonna do anything about this?
No.
I didn't say that.
I'm gonna give him unofficial warning.
I'm gonna tell him to keep off your property.
That will not do a damn thing.
Then maybe you should take your family back to the city.
Hey.
I will not be intimidated by a thug.
You have it your own way,
Mr. Tilson.
I am just trying to help here.
Why don't you call me when you got something to show me?
Hey, Dad.
Hey, son.
Kristen...
Listen, honey.
Sweetheart.
I know you think that I did a terrible thing.
I swear to you
I didn't do it.
On my life, honey.
I didn't do it.
Dad wouldn't kill Chester.
He's probably gonna kill whoever did it.
All right.
That's enough, Jesse.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Then who would do such a horrible thing?
Hey, fellas.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Is that you, Janice?
Oh, you're looking good.
Dale Massie.
When are we gonna have the pleasure of your company?
Soon.
I've just been busy sorting everything out at the house.
Right.
- You walking?
- Yeah.
He seems like a nice man.
- Who's that?
- Mr. Tilson.
Mm. He's married, Janice.
He's got kin.
I didn't mean like that, Dale.
I just meant he seems like a nice guy.
- So you met him, huh?
- Yeah.
Where at?
He came by to visit your father the other day.
Why?
He was making a documentary about the house.
He wanted to ask some questions.
Excuse me.
You are a piece of work, man.
Accusing me of trespassing?
Did I say anything when it was my house?
When I was stuck in jail and you were caught red-handed going through the place, did I say anything?
No, I didn't.
I didn't say a goddamn thing,
'cause I wouldn't do that.
He had all my personal photographs...
Lorna and the kids... all laid out on the table on bulletin boards.
Real personal stuff to me.
COOPER:
Ruby? Ruby?
Can I get a check, please?
Ain't it cool?
You come tap-dancing in here, grab the property out from under a guy who's late on a few payments.
Guess what he paid for the property and the contents.
[Sniffs]
Joe?
Joe, take a guess.
What do you think it was worth?
Your place is about the same size, right?
Maybe five.
- Try 210 grand.
- [Crowd murmurs]
How about that?
How much are you getting for that movie about my family?
Huh?
Oh, don't worry.
I'll be sure and buy the DVD with that $50 I got for fixing your pool.
[Laughter]
I mean, here I am.
I'm doing my level best to try and be a good neighbor, right?
And you accuse me of being some kind of sadistic prick.
[Coins jingling]
Well, I guess you're just trying to protect your family the best way you can.
But when I've done wrong,
I own up to it like a man and I set things straight.
That's what I do, Cooper.
We'll have our time, Massie.
This isn't it.
I think you're full of shit.
That's what I think.
Why don't we go outside right now?
Hit him, Dad.
Knock his brains out.
When your man starts pointing fingers, he better be ready to back it up, don't you think?
Ruby, I got no beef with Mrs. Tilson.
- Out in the car.
- Kristen, get in the car.
It's that motherfucker right there that's pissin' me off.
Hammerhead will smash your skull!
Hammerhead will bash your brains!
Throw you down the devil's throat!
[Door opens, closes]
[Creaking]
He killed his children.
I want you to get the kids out of here.
I want you to take them back to the city.
To New York.
Just get them out of here.
- What?
- Stay with Tina.
- No. You have to come.
- Okay?
Just pack enough clothes for a couple of days.
- I'll come as soon as I can.
- What?
- I just have to find...
- What?
I have to...
I have to find more...
- What?
- More evidence.
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

Give me another cherry.
Down the devil's throat.
SHERIFF FERGUSON:
Jesus Christ.
[Sighs]
What is the devil's throat?
I have no idea.
Mr. Tilson, this here, this is all circumstantial.
This won't hold up in a court of law.
You think they're buried on your property, which is how big?
1,200 acres.
I'll search every inch of it if I have to.
[Sighs]
Well, there are two issues here.
Both are relating to
Dale Massie.
He's a piece of shit, all right.
But I don't think he's a murderer.
I don't want to believe it.
I don't want to believe that he murdered his wife and his two small kids.
But he is on to you.
You have absolutely pissed him off.
You should be careful.
So here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna give you a walkie.
It's a secure channel.
Keep it with you.
And if you need anything, you just holler.
I'm gonna check in with you on a regular basis.
I will check this all out just to be sure.
Johnny Roth does everybody's teeth around here.
I'm gonna run that engine number, all right?
All right.

KRISTEN:
Hey, Mom?
Got it.
Cooper.
Hi.
So you made it.
Everyone okay?
Sweetheart, I am so close.
I swear.
Then everything is gonna be all right.
Cooper, this is destroying all of us.
Leah, do you remember the other day in the diner when Jesse shouted something at Dale?
Something about the devil's throat?
You remember that?
I need to talk with him about that.
Cooper, we can't drag the kids into this.
They've been through enough.
They're traumatized already.
Just this one thing.
It's the key to everything.
- Lf I can find...
- [Static]
Cooper?
Leah?
Leah?

Hello?

Shit.
Sheriff Ferguson, come in.
Sheriff Ferguson, can you read me?
Howdy, Mr. Tilson.
Listen.
Something's strange.
My phone just went down.
Is your phone working?
Yeah, it is.
But maybe not for long.
We got a storm blowing in.
Listen.
I ran that Honda number, and it matches.
That's Lorna's car, all right.
Now, don't get too excited.
It's just circumstantial.
Yes.
But maybe I'm not crazy.
It's possible.
Anything's possible.
I'll swing by later on.
Over.
Mom.
- Mom.
- Yeah?
We have to talk to you.
Sure.
Show her.
Um...
[Door closes]
You fix that front gate?
Yes, sir.
I took care of it on Tuesday.
I put in three new hinge bolts.
She's as good as new.
Hey, look.
I brought your favorite.
You're lying.
Sir?
You lost the farm.
Where'd you hear a crazy thing like that, sir?
That's not true.
Here.
Have a chocolate.
- I got the ones with the dark...
- Don't you lie to me, boy.
You're the corrupt spawn of your whoring mother.
I saw it.
I saw you.
Shut up.
Please.
Please, sir.
Just shut up.
I saw everything.
[Chuckles]
Everything you did.
She told you she was leaving you and taking the kids.
They weren't even your kids.
See, you couldn't even make babies.
Useless.
You're not even a man.
Not even a man.
"Pooh. Pooh."
[Chuckles]
You couldn't kill an animal.
But you killed them.
Hey, what'd you do with the bodies, boy?
I buried them, sir.
Is that what you did, boy?
Yeah.
Are you ready for a cherry, sir?
I'll get you a good one.
[Sniffs]
Here you go, Pop.
[Chuckles]
[Sniffs]
You got a little chocolate here.
[Muffled grunting]
She was doing it with everyone.
You hear me?
With everyone.
She told me.
She did everyone!

Leah?
Are you all right?
I know where it is.
What?
The devil's throat.
The kids found it when we first moved in.
I got two speeding tickets trying to get here.
And I'm so sorry
I didn't believe you.
COOPER:
God, we have brilliant children.
LEAH:
Yes, we do.
Annie.
I'm going for a smoke break.
All right.
Yeah, hi.
Yeah, this is Sheriff Ferguson.
I had a question for Dr. Roth.
No, I understand.
Are you his assistant?
What I wanted to know was did he treat the Massie children,
Tammy and Grady?
Look.
There's an edge.
Hey. Look.
Take this off.
- Help me lift this.
- [Grunts]
Lift. Lift.
Oh!
Oh!
[Coughs]
Oh, my God.
Oh.
- Be careful.
- Oh, Jesus.
Annie, I'm here.
Hey, Rose.
Where's Annie?
I don't know.
She must have stepped out.
[Indistinct talking on police radio]
- [Sighs]
- Have a good one.
[Thunder rumbles]
I'm gonna lower the video camera.
See what's down there.
[Camera beeps]
It's on.
Here.
You know, it's getting dark.
Maybe we should come back tomorrow.
Just five more minutes, all right?
Then we'll go.
Night vision.
Okay.
Hold the light.
[Water dripping]
Down.
[Thunder rumbles]
[Water sloshing]
Here.
Okay.
It's down.
- Wait.
- What?
- I saw something. Go back.
- Where?
- Back a few frames.
- Back?
[Exhales sharply]
What is that?
Oh, my...
Oh, my God.
[Walkie-talkie crackles]
Do you read me?
Yeah, sheriff.
Sheriff, I read you.
Listen.
We found the devil's throat.
They're down there.
The bodies.
I'm at the house.
Where are you?
[Static]
Uh, we're close by.
Listen.
Just take the back road.
Cut across the first field.
You're gonna see my truck.
I'll come meet you.
Okay. Over.
[Sighs]
[Static]
Sheriff, I don't see you.
[Thunder rumbles]
Oh, my God.
Oh!
COOPER:
Sheriff, do you read me?
What is your position?
Devil's throat, Mr. Tilson.
Hi, Leah.
[Screams]
[Rapid footsteps]
[Gasps, screams]
[Grunts]
Leah!
Cooper!
Cooper!
Hang on!
Cooper, it's Dale!
It's Dale! It's Dale!
Look out!
[Whimpering]
Oh, Cooper!
Leah!
You're gonna be all right.
Grab that vine.
Oh!
I'm here, honey.
I'm here.
- I'm not gonna let you go.
- Cooper, he's up there!
Don't worry about that.
Come on.
Just get out of here.
[Grunting]
Take another step, honey.
[Grunts]
That's it.
[Thunder rumbles]
Come on, honey.
Grab the rope.
Keep hold of the rope.
That's it.
Come on, baby.
That's it.
I got you.
Come on.
[Wind howling]
LEAH:
Ow! Careful!
COOPER:
We'll take the Jeep.
We'll get to a pay phone.
Call the sheriff.
[Thunder rumbles]
[Crying] I saw them!
I saw them in there!
Oh!
Oh, my God!
Son of a bitch!
Let's get in the house.
What are we gonna do?
Let's have a look at your ankle. Come on.
Get on the table.
[Grunts]
Let me see.
Is it cut?
Shit.
[Screams]
Cooper!
Leah!
[Grunts]
You motherfuckers!
[Grunts]
[Muffled scream]
[Dale grunting]
Give me the flashlight.
Go upstairs.
Hide.
- Go! Go! Go!
- I'll never go without you.
[Glass shatters]
Come on, motherfucker!
[Dale shouting in distance]
Cooper?
[Wind whistling]
[Muffled scream]
Shh.
It's me.
Shh.
Let's go this way.
You scared the shit out of me.
Shh.
[Glass shatters,
Leah screams]
[Gasping]
- Open it!
- [Doorknob rattles]
- It won't open!
- We're trapped!
Up.
[Thunder crashes]
Come on!
[Leah screams]
You guys should have stayed in New York.
This isn't the place for you.
You know nothing about farming.
Dale, what are you doing?
What do you want?
It's a little too late for "want," Leah.
"Do" is something, though.
What am I gonna do?
I'm gonna smash both your skulls in and throw you down the devil's throat.
That's what I'm gonna do.
How'd you like it down there?
Huh?
Did you see my family down there?
Did you meet them?
What?
You gonna throw those at me?
Whoa!
Try and hit me, Leah.
[Grunts]
Oh, fuck!
No good, Cooper.
I could have fucked her anytime I wanted to.
Just like the rest of them.
Bunch of fucking whores.
LEAH: No!
Whoops.
Did I hear a bone crack, Coop?
Let me tell you what's gonna happen.
It's only fair that you should know.
It's gonna be real quick.
Real painless.
A blow to each of your heads.
And then I'm gonna throw your bodies down that hole.
It's that simple.
I got a question for you, though.
Do you think I'm nuts?
Quick.
Yes or no?
No.
Wrong.
I got another question.
Yeah.
You know what?
Fuck it.
Fuck it.
Let's just do this.
Get up.
I said get up!
Now!
You got anything you want to say?
Any last words?
[Screams]
Keep it tight, Leah!
[Dale grunting]
Looking for this?
Huh?
Keep those legs down!
[Screams]
What's the matter, Dale?
Did I hear a bone crack?
How's it feel, Dale?
You fuck!
[Screams]
Get out of my house!
[Screaming]
[Birds chirping]

GRACE: Now, children, are you sitting comfortably?
Then I'll begin.
This story started many thousands of years ago... but it was all over in just seven days.
All that long, long time ago... none of the things we can see now-- the sun, the moon, the stars, the earh... the animals and plants-- not a single one existed. only God existed... and so only He could have created them.
And He did.
[Screaming]
[Sobs]
[Panting]
[gasping]
[Laughter]
MRS. MILLS: Simpson. what a character he was.
I wonder whatever became of him?
MR TUTTLE: Oh, I imagine he's dead like all the rest.
MRS. MILLS:
Ah, those were the days.
[Bell rings]
Mr Tuttle, your hair.
[Lock clicks]
Yes?
Good morning, ma'am. we've come about the--
Oh, yes, of course.
Come in.
I wasn't expecting you so soon.
You are...?
I'm Bertha Mills, ma'am.
And this is Edmund Tuttle.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
You must be the gardener.
That's right. The gardener.
And this young lady is called Lydia.
Have you had much experience in service?
Oh, don't let that angel face fool you, ma'am.
She's older than she looks.
Can you iron?
What's the matter?
Has the cat got your tongue?
She can't talk, ma'am.
The poor little mite's a mute.
Oh.
Oh, but she's a good little worker.
I can promise you that.
All right.
All right. The other girl
I had spoke too much, anyway.
Follow me.
Mrs. Mills, you and the girl... will sleep in the attic room at the top of the stairs.
-And you, Mr...
-Tuttle, ma'am.
You could sleep in the shed around the back.
As you can see, the housework has been rather neglected... since the servants disappeared almost a week ago.
You mean they just vanished?
GRACE: Into thin air.
No notice, nothing. They didn't even collect their wages.
They... they just left us.
MRS. MILLS:
What a strange thing to do.
GRACE: You'll soon find out there are times... when this house is not exactly an ideal home.
Hence my advertisement in the newspaper... requesting honest, hard-working people.
There's nobody more honest or hard-working than us.
Isn't that right, Mr Tuttle?
Oh, aye, we're very honest.
And, um, very hard-working.
The kitchen.
I have breakfast at 8:00... the children at 9:00.
Lunch will be served at 1:00 and dinner at 7:30.
MRS. MILLS:
And the master, ma'am?
The master went off to war... a year and a half ago.
I've had no news since the war ended.
Which of you does the cooking?
MRS. MILLS:
I'm so sorry, ma'am.
Which of you does the cooking?
You'll notice what I'm doing.
In this house, no door must be opened... without the previous one being closed first.
It is vital that you remember this.
It's not as easy as it may seem.
There are 15 different keys for all of the 50 doors... depending on which area of the house you're in at the time.
Mrs. Mills, from tomorrow onwards...
I will be leaving a set of keys in your charge.
Yes, ma'am.
The music room.
That old piano was already here when we moved in.
Please do not let the children thump away on it.
It sets off my migraine.
Silence is something that we prize very highly in this house.
That is why you will not find a telephone, a radio... or anything else that makes a racket.
Oh, we don't have electricity, either.
During the war, the Germans kept cutting it off... so we learned to live without it. Let's continue.
Ma'am, there's no need to show us the whole house.
GRACE: Yes!
Yes, there is.
Most of the time, you can hardly see your way.
It's often difficult to make out... if there is a table, a chair, a door, a sideboard... or one of my children playing hide and seek.
What do you mean, ma'am?
Perhaps I should introduce you to the children.
[Lock clicks]
Mr Tuttle, you can see to the garden now.
You'll find tools in the shed.
Yes, ma'am.
You two can start closing the curtains.
All of them.
Come.
I'll wake them.
You wait here.
Whatever you do, don't open the curtains.
Wakey, wakey.
Now, come on.
Eyes closed, hands together.
CHILDREN:
Let it be, at light of day...
Jesus, to whom now I pray.
Blessed be the Virgin pure... whom I greet with faith too short.
Jesus, Mary, spotless rose... keep us till this day doth close.
They're still half asleep.
MRS. MILLS:
What sweet little children.
Well... what do you say?
How do you do?
How do you do?
How do you do, children?
My name is Mrs. Mills... but you can call me
Bertha if you like.
What are your names?
-Anne.
-Nicholas.
Anne and Nicholas.
What pretty names.
ANNE: Are you going to be our new nanny?
Mm-hmm.
Yes, my dears.
I'm your new nanny.
It's time for their breakfast.
Lydia, go to the kitchen and close every shutter.
[Keys jingle]
The doctors were never able to find a cure.
For what?
Their condition.
The children have a very serious allergy to light.
They are photosensitive and must never be exposed... to any light much stronger than this. otherwise, in a matter of minutes... they will break out in sores and blisters... and begin to suffocate.
It would eventually be fatal.
MRS. MILLS: Good heavens.
I don't like this toast.
Oh? Why not?
It tastes funny.
I liked it better before.
That's because before, somebody else made it.
When are they coming back?
They're not coming back, child.
Just like Daddy.
Daddy is coming back, though.
Mrs. Mills, our father's fighting in a war in France.
NICHOLAS: It's the World War.
I know, but he's in France.
That's enough, chatterboxes.
Finish up your breakfasts.
Are you going to leave us, too?
Of course not!
Why should I leave you?
The others said they wouldn't... but they did, and then it happened.
Be quiet!
What do you mean, Anne?
What happened?
Mummy went... mad.
-Nothing happened.
-Yes, it did.
-No, it didn't!
-Yes, it did!
GRACE: Be quiet.
What's going on?
I want those plates empty... in less than a minute.
Is that clear?
Mrs. Mills, would you come outside a moment?
I'd like a word with you.
Yes, ma'am.
The postman usually comes every Wednesday.
But I just checked the letter-box... and this week he hasn't.
I'm afraid
I don't follow, ma'am.
This letter should have been collected... and delivered to the newspaper five days ago.
It's an advertisement for servants.
Since it was never published... would you explain what you're doing here?
Oh, I understand.
Ma'am, that's what
I was going to say to you... when you opened the door to us.
The truth is that we just come by... on the off chance.
A big house like this... is always in need of someone who knows the ropes.
You've served in a house like this one before?
This may come as a surprise to you, ma'am, but...
We, in fact, used to work here.
Here?
Oh, now,
'twas a few years ago.
If you don't mind my saying so, ma'am... they were the best years of my life.
That's why we come by, because this house... means a lot to us.
Perhaps I'd best show you our references, ma'am.
No, no, no. Don't bother.
There's no need.
So you say you know the house well?
MRS. MILLS:
Like the back of my hand.
That is assuming the walls haven't sprouted legs... and moved in the meantime.
GRACE: The only thing that moves here is the light.
[Sighs]
But it changes everything.
It's rather difficult, to say the least.
One might almost say... unbearable.
The only way of enduring it is by keeping a cool head.
Oh, yes, ma'am.
I don't like fantasies.
Strange ideas.
Do you know what I mean?
I think so, ma'am.
My children sometimes have strange ideas.
But you mustn't pay any attention to them.
Children will be children.
Yes, of course, ma'am.
All right. You can stay.
Thank you very much, ma'am.
It did happen.
NICHOLAS: "The Roman governor tried to make them...
"change their minds afterwards..."
"To make them change their minds." Full stop.
-"Afterwards..."
-Mm-hmm.
"He ordered them to be beaten.
"But Justus and Pastor, far from being afraid...
"rejoiced and showed themselves willing to die for Christ.
"When he saw this...
"the Roman governor was filled with rage...
"and ordered their heads to be cut off."
[giggles]
[Snickers]
What do you find so amusing?
Well...
Well, what?
Those children were really stupid.
Why?
Because they said they only believed in Jesus... and then they got killed for it.
And what would you have done, deny Christ?
ANNE: Well, yes.
Inside I would have believed in him... but I wouldn't have told the ROMANS that.
Is that what you think, too,
Nicholas?
I see.
So you would have lied to the point of denying Christ.
You'd have saved your heads from the ROMANS, that's true.
But what would have happened afterwards?
When?
In the next life.
The one waiting for us after we die.
Where would you have gone?
Ahh.
Where, Nicholas?
To the children's limbo.
GRACE: What is the children's limbo, Anne?
One of the four Hells.
Which are?
[gasps]
ANNE: Me, me, me! Me!
GRACE: No. Let him answer. which are?
There's the Hell where the damned go... then there's Purgatory...
Yes.
And the bosom of Abraham where the just go... and limbo where children go.
At the center of the earth.
Where it's very, very hot.
That's where children go who tell lies... but they don't just go there for a few days.
Oh, no.
No, they're damned. Forever.
Think about it.
Try to imagine the end of eternity.
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes and try to imagine it.
Forever.
Pain... forever.
I'm getting dizzy. Heh.
Now do you understand... why Justus and Pastor told the truth?
[Sighs] All right.
Open your readers at lesson six.
ANNE: Can't we play?
You most certainly cannot.
First you're going to read the lesson... then you're going to learn it by hear.
All of it?
Any more protests... and there'll be no playing at all today.
In fact, I think you can study in separate rooms.
-CHILDREN: No, no, no!
-GRACE: Yes, yes, yes!
ANNE: But we get scared if we're separated!
GRACE: Scared? As if you weren't used to this house by now.
NICHOLAS:
What if we see a ghost?
Has your sister been telling you one of her stories?
I haven't told him anything!
If you see a ghost you say "Hello"... and continue on studying.
-Come to the music room.
-Why me?
Because I say so!
Now come on.
Take your book.
Nicholas, I want to see that lesson learned... in less than an hour.
-Mummy...
- What?
Give me a kiss.
ANNE: "give me a kiss.
Give me a kiss."
Anne, wait for me outside.
You know I can't.
Over there.
Mrs. Mills, close all the curtains.
My daughter is going to cross the living room.
Yes, ma'am.
All right, Anne.
[Humming]
Darling...
Mummy can't be with you all the time, hmm?
You must learn to be on your own.
Where's your rosary?
Ahh!
Whenever you feel afraid...
I want you to squeeze it with all your might... say an our Father, and your fear will go away.
- It won't.
- Yes, it will. Honestly.
Don't you see that when you do that... the Lord is with you?
There's no reason to be afraid.
[Blows kiss]
[Lock clicks]
[Footsteps fading]
[Distant door closing]
NICHOLAS:
"The house and the family.
"We all live in a house with our family.
"The family is usually made up of parents...
"children, and their grandparents.
"We must be obedient..."
ANNE: "... and kind towards other members of our family...
"and we must never argue or fight...
"with our brothers and sisters."
Do you have any children?
MRS. MILLS: No.
Mr Tuttle and the girl Lydia are all I've got... and I'm all they've got.
GRACE: Was she born like that?
Beg your pardon, ma'am?
The girl. was she born a mute?
No.
I think
I've finished here, ma'am.
If you'll excuse me,
I think I'll go... and see if Mr Tuttle needs a hand.
[Door closes]
[Sighs]
[Child sobbing]
Nicholas!
Nicholas, I'm coming!
Oh!
- Nicholas?
- What's the matter?
Why were you crying?
I wasn't crying.
I was reading.
But I just heard you...
Anne!
[Door closes]
[Child sobbing]
Anne!
Anne?
ANNE:
I haven't learned it yet, Mummy.
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
- Why were you crying?
- I wasn't.
I just heard you a moment ago.
There's no need to feel ashamed, darling.
I don't.
If I'd been crying,
I'd tell you.
Oh, really.
So I imagined it, did I?
No. It was that boy.
What boy?
Victor.
Who's Victor?
The boy that was here a moment ago.
I told him to let me study... but he wouldn't stop crying.
I think he's a spoiled brat.
He said we'd have to leave the house.
GRACE: Oh, did he, now?
And why was he crying?
Because he doesn't like this house... but he has to live here.
His father's a pianist--
- His father's a pianist?
- Yes.
I already told him he's not allowed to touch the piano.
He isn't, is he, Mummy?
[Sighs]
So, you've spoken to his father as well?
ANNE: No, only with Victor.
His father's with the others in the hall.
I've just come from the hall.
There's no one there.
They must've gone upstairs.
They're viewing the house.
That'll do, Anne!
That's enough!
Now why were you crying?
It was Victor!
-So where is he now?
-He went out through there!
Would you mind telling me how a boy... can get in and out of this room if it's locked?
[gasps]
GRACE: I thought
I made myself quite clear.
No door is to be opened... without the previous one being closed first.
Is that so hard to understand?
This house is like a ship.
The light must be contained as if it were water... by opening and closing the doors.
My children's lives are at stake!
MRS. MILLS: But, ma'am--
Do not argue with me!
Be quiet!
Which was the last of you to enter that room?
Lydia?
She hasn't got a key.
I already told you that.
That leaves you, then.
But I was in the hall the whole time.
And then I went out into the garden.
You saw me with your own eyes.
I hope you are not suggesting that it was me!
Do you think that
I would overlook such a thing... and endanger the life of my own daughter?
[Fire crackling]
NICHOLAS: You're not supposed to read at the table.
ANNE: Oh, really?
Who's going to tell Mummy?
You?
Or perhaps you?
[Giggles]
Did you really see a boy?
Yes. He's called Victor.
Is he a ghost?
Don't be stupid.
Ghosts aren't like that.
What are they like?
I've told you a thousand times.
They go about in white sheets and carry chains.
-How do you know?
-Because I've seen them.
They come out at night.
Fibber. Where?
[Inhales]
[Clank]
[Laughs]
-You're stupid.
-Not half as much as you.
I don't believe you saw that boy.
Believe what you like.
You'll soon be begging us to play with you.
ANNE: Nicholas!
NICHOLAS: Huh? what?
Look.
Why have you opened the curtains?
-It wasn't me.
-Who was it, then?
It was Victor.
He's been doing it all night.
You're lying.
I'm going to tell Mummy.
-So I'm a liar, am I?
-Yes.
Victor, come out from behind that curain... so my stupid brother can see you.
[Breathing heavily]
[gasps]
Leave me alone.
ANNE: So you don't want to see him now, eh?
You're a cowardly custard.
Cowardly cowardly custard.
I'll just have to do it myself, then.
ANNE: That's enough, Victor.
Nicholas. Nicholas.
Tell him to leave the curtains alone.
He won't listen to me.
VICTOR: Stop it.
Get off my bed, both of you.
ANNE: This is our bed.
VICTOR: No, it's mine.
Anne, please stop putting on that voice.
You be quiet, cowardly custard.
Listen, if you don't stop,
I'll call my mother... and she'll kick you out.
You don't know my mother.
VICTOR:
And you don't know my parents.
Anne, I'm going to tell
Mummy about you.
Don't be stupid.
Can't you see it's not me?
Victor, touch his cheek so he knows you're real.
[Breathing rapidly]
Aah!
[Nicholas screaming]
NICHOLAS: Mummy! Help!
Help! Help, Mummy!
What is it? What is it?
[Crying]
What is it?
She was fighting with me, and I told her to be quiet.
I'm fed up.
Do you hear me?
I am fed up with you!
I didn't do anything!
"Therefore the Lord god sent him forh...
"from the garden of Eden...
"to till the ground from whence he was taken.
"So he drove out the man...
"and placed to the east of the Garden of Eden...
"cherubims and a flaming sword...
"which turned every way to keep the way...
"of the Tree of Life."
There. I finished.
[Closes book]
Very good.
[Sighs]
Now you can ask the Virgin for forgiveness.
What?
That's not what we agreed!
We didn't agree anything, young lady.
Today you're being punished, and you'll do as I say.
You can't make me ask the Virgin for forgiveness.
How dare you!
Mummy, I won't ask forgiveness for something I didn't do!
You told your brother someone else was in the room!
- There was!
- You're lying!
I am not!
[Sighs]
Anne... do you remember the story about Justus and Pastor?
Children who don't tell the truth end up in limbo.
That's what you say, but I read the other day... that limbo's only for children who haven't been baptized.
And I have!
ANNE:
"And Abraham took the wood...
"of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son.
"And he took the fire in his hand and a knife...
"and they went, both of them together.
"And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father...
"and said,'My father...'
"and he said,
'Here I am, my son.'"
Did you look in on Nicholas?
Yes, ma'am.
The little angel is fast asleep.
What about Anne?
Is she still on the stairs?
Oh, yes, ma'am.
I'd prefer to have her where I can see her... but I can't embroider in such poor light.
How long is this punishment going to go on?
It's been three days now.
It's up to her.
She's got to learn to swallow her pride... and ask for forgiveness.
Anyway, it's time she started to read the Bible.
The priest will be very pleased to hear that, ma'am.
GRACE: If he ever deigns to pay us another visit.
He knows perfectly well that the children can't go out.
MRS. MILLS:
He told me yesterday... he'd be by as soon as possible.
I'm beginning to feel totally cut off from the world.
This fog doesn't exactly help.
It's never lasted this long before.
Oh, that's true, ma'am.
Even the seagulls have gone quiet.
Anne!
Anne, I can't hear you.
[Anne reading indistinctly]
Ohh!
Incidentally, Mrs. Mills, I've had to put up with the noise... of Lydia running around above my head.
She's been hurling backwards and forwards... as if there were three of her.
Would you kindly tell her it's not necessary... to kick up quite such a rumpus just to do a little cleaning?
I couldn't bear to get another migraine attack.
I'll tell her, ma'am.
GRACE: Thank you.
[Footsteps receding]
[Anne reading indistinctly]
[Thumping overhead]
[Thumping overhead]
[Sighs]
[Louder thumps overhead]
[Thumping, glass rattling]
[Banging overhead]
Now she's really gone too far.
Lydia! Lydia!
[Anne reading]
"... in the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
"And the angel of the Lord-- "
What's going on up there?
Nothing, Mummy.
I'm just reading.
-Did you hear it as well?
-Hear what?
"And the angel of the Lord...
"called unto Abraham out of Heaven...
"the second time and said...
"'By myself, I have sworn,' saith the Lord-- "
Shh!
[Faint squeaking]
What was that?
I don't know.
Anne, tell me who's making that noise.
I can't tell you, Mummy.
You tell me.
I told you there was someone in the room... and you punished me.
Now I don't know what to say.
Anne, I want the truth.
Tell me if there is someone upstairs.
There. In that junk room.
ANNE: Mummy, you're letting the light in.
[gasps]
[Steps on glass]
[ghostly voices whispering]
Shh!
-She's a woman.
-She's what?
[gasps]
[Creaking]
Where did they go?
They just came past here.
Didn't you see them?
Which way did they go?
Over there, over there, and down there as well.
[Door closes]
They're everywhere.
They say this house is theirs.
And they're going to take the curtains down.
Ma'am, stay calm, please.
I will not stay calm!
For five whole years during the occupation...
I managed to avoid a single Nazi stepping foot in this house... and now there is someone here, opening and closing the doors.
Ma'am, this is a very old house.
The floorboards squeak and the plumbing clanks--
There were voices.
I'm telling you.
ANNE: Mummy, look.
A boy and two women, talking together.
Mummy, look!
I did it yesterday.
This is the father, this is the mother... this is Victor, and this is the old woman.
What do these numbers stand for?
ANNE: That's the number of times I've seen them.
I've seen the old woman the most.
Oh, god in Heaven.
Mrs. Mills, go and call Mr Tuttle.
We have to search the whole house immediately... before it gets dark.
-Yes, ma'am. There, now.
-Mummy!
Yes, darling. It's all right.
Nothing will happen to you while Mummy's here.
ANNE: Look, Mummy.
She really scares me.
It's as if she's not looking at you... but she can see you.
And she's always around saying "Come with me "--
No, Anne, don't lie to me.
ANNE: Honestly, Mummy.
And she asks me things.
Victor told me she's a witch.
What does she ask you?
Things.
Her breath smells.
We have to open all the curtains.
I don't want any dark corners where someone could hide.
Yes, ma'am.
You both search the right side, and I'll take the left.
Then we'll search upstairs.
[Sighs]
NICHOLAS:
Perhaps they're ghosts...
Who lived in this house before.
Don't be stupid.
I've already told you.
Ghosts go about in white sheets... and carry chains and go "OOO. "
MRS. MILLS: Now, Anne.
Why do you make up such stories?
ANNE: I don't.
I read them in books.
Well, you shouldn't believe everything... that you read in books.
That's what our mother says.
She says all this stuff about ghosts is rubbish... and then she expects us... to believe everything written in the Bible.
And don't you believe it?
I believe some things.
But, for example,
I don't believe... that God made the world in seven days.
And I don't believe that Noah... got all those animals into one boat... or the Holy Spirit is a dove.
No, I don't believe that, either.
ANNE:
Doves are anything but holy.
They poo on our windows.
[Chuckles]
Have you mentioned any of this to your mother?
Oh.
[Knocking]
MRS. MILLS: Ma'am.
Yes?
They've searched everywhere, ma'am.
There's no one.
I see.
Mrs. Mills.
Yes, ma'am?
Do you have any idea what this might be?
'Tis a photograph album, ma'am.
No, but look.
They're all asleep.
Look.
They're not asleep, ma'am.
They're dead.
'Tis a book of the dead.
In the last century,
I believe... they used to take photographs of the dead... in the hopes that their souls... would go on living through the portraits.
There are even group portraits.
[gasps] And children!
Oh, it's macabre!
How could these people be so superstitious?
Grief over the death of a loved one... can lead people to do the strangest things.
GRACE: get rid of it.
I don't want it in the house.
MRS. MILLS: Yes, ma'am.
Mrs. Mills, it's cold.
Why don't you come and sit by the fire?
Thank you very much, ma'am.
So... tell me about when you worked here before.
Did you have to look after children then?
No, I was in charge of organizing the housework.
Hmm. were there many servants?
Oh, about fifteen.
Though in the end... there were just the three of us left.
Why?
My employers moved to London.
They came here less and less... it being so out of the way like.
So gradually the house just became empty.
Everybody ends up leaving this damned island.
My family left in the summer of 1940.... just before the invasion.
That was the last
I've heard of them.
Ohh.
I don't blame them.
Actually, we left, too.
Although, you know... sometimes when you leave a place... it's like it's there with you all the time.
I always felt like I never left this house.
Why did you leave?
Oh,'twas on account of the tuberculosis.
The whole area was evacuated.
Ohh.
Was that when Lydia went dumb?
Yes, I think so... though my memory's a bit rusty these days, ma'am.
What happened to her?
It was suddenly one day.
She just... stopped talking.
There must've been a reason.
People don't just stop talking.
These things are always the result... of some sort of trauma.
Something must've happened to her.
Did your employers treat you well?
Oh, they were always very kind to us.
They treated us just like family.
You know, ma'am,
I think I will go to bed.
I'll never be able to get up in the morning.
Off you go.
I'm going to stay here a while longer.
Yes, ma'am.
[Sighs]
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.
Can you forgive me?
Anne.
NICHOLAS: Mummy.
What?
When's Daddy coming home?
When the war's over.
Why did he go to war?
I mean, nobody's done anything bad to us.
Daddy went...
Daddy went because he's very brave... and because he wasn't prepared... to let the Germans tell him what he had to do.
NICHOLAS: why?
[Sobbing]
Charles...
Where are you?
[Piano playing]
[Piano playing]
[Music grows louder]
[gasping]
[Music stops]
[Muffled thumping]
[Creaking]
[Lock clicks]
[Creak]
[Bang]
-[Slam]
-Oh!
[Door locking]
Mrs. Mills!
Mrs. Mills!
What's the matter, ma'am?
The key to the music room, give it to me! Quickly!
- What's happening, ma'am?
-Come on!
Oh, my god.
Ohh!
I checked that room myself.
It was empty.
Take these tablets, ma'am.
They'll do you good.
And yet I felt as if there was someone else there.
And it wasn't human.
There is something in this house.
Something diabolic.
Ma'am...
Something which is not... not at rest.
[Sighs]
I know you don't believe it.
You don't believe it, do you?
I don't blame you.
I used to not believe these things.
[Sighs]
I do believe it, ma'am.
I've always believed in those things.
They're not easy to explain... but they do happen.
We've all heard stories of... the beyond... now and then... and I think sometimes the world of the dead... gets mixed up with the world of the living.
But it's impossible.
The Lord would never allow such an aberration.
The living and the dead... will only meet at the end of eternity.
It says so in the Bible.
Ma'am... there isn't always an answer for everything.
[Door opens]
MRS. MILLS: where are you off to, ma'am?
I'm going to the village to pay Father McGraw a visit.
If he won't come here, then I shall go to him.
I shall bring him back.
Ma'am, you should wait till the weather improves.
I've waited long enough.
Ma'am, the priest told me that--
I don't care what he told you!
I want him to tell me personally!
He must come today!
MRS. MILLS: But what are you going to tell him?
That we have searched every room inch by inch... and now I need them to be blessed.
MRS. MILLS:
Ma'am, please, wait.
Still, it's very early.
-Mr Tuttle.
-Morning, ma'am.
I need you to search the garden for gravestones.
Gravestones?
Yes. when my husband bought this house... we were told there was a little cemetery.
I think it was over there, amongst the trees.
I've not seen anything.
Check carefully.
It could be overgrown.
Yes, ma'am.
I need to know if there was a family buried here... and if they had a little boy-- Victor.
[gate squeaking]
Now she thinks the house is haunted.
Do you think it's safe to let her go?
Oh, don't worry. The fog won't let her get very far.
Oh, yes, the fog.
The fog, of course.
And when do you think... we should bring all this out into the open?
All in good time, Mr Tuttle.
All in good time.
Speaking of which.
Oh!
[gasping]
Wha--
Oh.
[Footsteps]
Oh!
Charles?
Grace?
Ohh.
Oh!
Oh!
You're here. You're here.
They said there was no hope.
They said I should give you up for dead.
They say a lot of things.
GRACE: Ohh.
Ohh!
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, God.
Thank you, God.
Every night I prayed for this... begging God to bring you back.
Bring the children their father back.
Bring him...
But where have you been all this time? out there... looking for my home.
[Sighs]
You're so different.
So different.
Sometimes I bleed.
[Laughs]
[Front door closes]
Ma'am--
Mrs. Mills... this is my husband.
I'm very pleased to meet you, sir.
He's very weak.
Here.
I want you to prepare a hot bath and some clean clothes.
And something to eat.
Right away, ma'am.
How are my little ones?
Daddy!
ANNE: [Kiss] why did you take so long?
[Crying]
Hello, Nicholas.
I told you, you see.
I told you he'd come back.
[Kiss]
Have you both been well-behaved?
We've been very good.
Have you been good to your mother?
Very good.
We study every day for our First Communion.
Daddy, did you kill anyone?
[Door closes]
Oh! Here he comes!
Darling, we've prepared lunch for you.
Are you coming down or would you prefer--
[Door closes]
ANNE:
When's Daddy coming down?
Be patient, Anne.
Daddy is... not well.
ANNE: He said he'd seen a lot of dead men.
Shh.
Mummy, when people die in the war...
Where do they go?
Oh, what a question.
-It depends.
-On what?
Whether they fought on the side of the goodies or the baddies.
Your father, for example, fought for England... on the side of the goodies.
How do you know who the goodies and the baddies are?
[Sighs] That's enough questions.
Eat your food.
You'll never go to war.
We'll never go anywhere.
Ohh.
You're not missing out on anything.
You're much better off at home with your Mummy and Daddy... who love you very, very much.
And the intruders.
There are no intruders here.
But you said that there were.
No, I said that there are no intruders here.
I don't want to hear another word on the subject.
-But you said--
-That is enough!
Can I say something?
-No!
-Why not?
Because you can't!
[Fork clatters]
[Breathing heavily]
Anne, stop breathing like that.
You heard me. Stop it.
Stop breathing.
Right, you go to your room.
Go to your room.
No dessert for you today.
[Sighs]
[Anne sobbing]
Ohh, no crying now, no crying.
Oh, stop that here.
Look what an awful face you've got when you cry.
-I don't care!
-There, there.
You listen to me.
I've seen them, too.
You have?
Yes.
Why don't you tell my mother?
Then maybe she'll believe me.
There are things your mother doesn't want to hear.
She only believes in what she was taught.
But don't worry, sooner or later... she'll see them.
Then everything will be different.
How?
Oh, you'll see.
There are going to be some big surprises.
There are going to be... changes.
Changes?
Now she's behaving as if nothing had happened.
What about her daughter?
Oh, she's not so stubborn.
The children will be easier to convince.
No, it's the mother who's going to cause us problems.
Do you think her husband suspects anything?
No. I don't think he even knows where he is. ohh, look what a pretty daughter I've got.
Mummy made this veil especially for you.
-Hmm?
-I look like a bride.
Yes. You do.
[Sighs] I need to shorten the sleeves a little.
-You can take it off now.
-No.
This dress has to be spotless for your First Communion.
I promise I won't dirty it.
Just let me wear it for a little longer.
Oh, just a little?
All right.
I'll be back shortly.
No sitting on the floor or leaning against the walls.
No.
[Locks door]
Monsieur, would you like to dance?
[Deep voice] I'd love to.
[Humming]
Charles, you can't go on like this.
You must eat something.
OOOO.
[giggles]
[Humming]
# In the sky #
# I don't know if it's cloudy or bright #
# But I only have eyes #
# For you, dear #
# The moon may be high #
[Humming]
[Humming]
[Crying]
[Anne humming]
Anne, you need to take the dress off now.
[Humming]
[Sighs]
Anne, are you listening to me?
Anne?
What did I tell you about sitting on the floor?
ANNE: But it's clean.
It makes no difference.
Why can't you ever do as you're told...
[Humming]
[Anne's voice]
What's the matter?
Where is my daughter?
[giggles]
What have you done with my daughter?
Are you mad?
I am your daughter.
[gasps]
No! You're not my daughter!
[Anne screaming]
No! No!
[Fabric tearing]
Aah!
You're not my daughter! No!
-Aah!
-No! Aah!
[gasping]
[Sobbing]
Ma'am, I heard shouts.
She wants to kill me!
She won't stop until she kills us!
She won't stop!
MRS. MILLS:
Hush, child. Come with me.
ANNE: You're wicked!
You're wicked! wicked!
[Door closes]
ANNE: wicked!
[gasps]
[water running]
How is she?
There's no calming her... so I've left her with her father.
Oh!
She insisted on speaking with him.
What happened?
Why did you fight?
GRACE: It wasn't her.
It was the old woman with the strange eyes.
She was imitating my daughter's voice.
I'd swear to god that it wasn't my daughter.
Oh, God. God help me.
God help me.
What's the matter with me?
I don't know what's the matter with me.
MRS. MILLS:
You must get more rest.
You can't take on the whole responsibility of this house.
Leave it to us.
We know what has to be done.
What do you mean by that?
What do you mean you know what has to be done?
Nothing, ma'am.
I was just suggesting--
There's nothing to suggest.
Who do you think you are?
You have no idea what has to be done.
[Softly] or do you?
What are these?
The tablets for your migraine, ma'am.
The ones you always take.
Please,
I need to be on my own.
Yes, ma'am.
Come, child.
[Door opens]
[Footsteps]
CHARLES: Anne told me everything.
I wish I had an explanation, but I haven't.
At first, I thought there was someone else in the house.
Even thought there were ghosts.
I'm not talking about the ghosts.
I'm talking about what happened that day.
I don't know what you're talking about.
CHARLES: Tell me it's not true.
Tell me what happened.
Happened?
[Sighs]
I don't know what came over me that day.
The servants had left during the night.
Hadn't the courage to tell me to my face.
They knew that I couldn't leave the house.
They knew. [Sobs]
Anne.
Anne, what happened?
She hit me.
She went mad like she did that day.
Do you remember?
No.
You must forgive me, Charles.
Not me. The children.
They know that I love them.
They know I'd never hurt them.
I'd die first.
What are you going to do?
Are you angry with me?
I just came back to say good-bye... to my wife and children.
Now I must go.
Go where?
To the front.
No. The war's over.
The war is not over.
What are you talking about?
You're not going, do you hear me?
You left us once already.
You can't go!
Why?
Why did you have to go to that stupid war... that had nothing to do with us?
Why couldn't you have stayed here like the others?
The others surrendered.
We all surrendered!
The whole island was occupied!
What did you expect?
[Sighs]
What were you trying to prove by going to war?
Your place was here with us.
With your family.
[Sighs]
I loved you.
That was enough for me.
Living in this darkness...
In this prison.
But not for you.
I wasn't enough for you.
That's why you left.
[Crying]
It wasn't just the war.
You want to leave me, don't you?
[Sighs]
Ohh.
[gasps]
[Screaming]
Anne!
Nicholas!
[Children screaming]
[Screaming]
What is it? What--
Ohh! Ohh!
[Screaming]
Oh, my god!
Here! Oh, my god!
Oh! Oh!
Here!
Oh!
Aah!
Where are the curtains?
[Screaming]
GRACE: Mrs. Mills!
Let me see. Let me see.
Oh, you're all right!
You're all right!
I want my daddy!
[Crying]
Daddy's gone.
It's not true!
Yes, it is.
It is true.
[Sobbing]
I love you, Mummy.
[Sighs]
Find the curtains.
Who was it?
Who did this?
Tell me!
Tell me!
[Struggling]
You know what's happening here!
You know because it happened to you, too!
You'll tell me.
You write it down.
Write it down! Please!
MRS. MILLS: That attitude won't solve anything, ma'am.
Anyway, she can't write.
- Where are they?
- What?
The curtains!
The curtains my children's lives depend on!
Someone has taken the curtains!
I have noticed, ma'am.
There's no need for you to raise your voice.
Oh, Mr Tuttle. I was just on the point of calling you.
Did you know that someone has taken all the curtains?
The curtains?
Oh, dear.
Why should anyone want to take all the curtains?
To let some daylight into this house, I imagine.
Daylight. of course.
Someone wants to kill my children.
Why do you think that the daylight would kill them?
Are you mad?
I told you.
I already told you!
The children are photosensitive!
The light will kill them!
Yes, but that was before.
The condition could have cleared up by itself.
If you never expose them to daylight... how do you know they're not cured?
My sister-in-law had terrible attacks of rheumatism... in her legs and back.
Then one fine day... they disappeared.
I am going to find those curtains... and when you have finished helping me hang them... you will leave this house!
And what about the master, ma'am?
What has he got to say about all of this?
Give me your keys.
I want your keys now!
I know what you want.
You want to frighten us.
You want to get us out, me and my children.
You've wanted to take over this house... ever since the first day you arrived.
Now, you give me those keys.
I will not ask again.
You should try and calm down, ma'am.
Give me the keys.
Give them to me.
And now get out of here.
[Door closes]
You know something, Mr Tuttle?
I think I've reached the end of my tether.
What about you?
Oh, yes. Definitely.
We'd better go and uncover the gravestones.
[Clattering]
[Keys rattling]
[Footsteps]
[Door slams]
What's Mummy doing?
I've already told you.
She's gone mad.
Liar.
-She's gone mad!
-Liar, liar!
Night-time.
Where are you going?
I've had enough.
I'm going into the woods to look for Daddy.
Are you going to run away?
If I hang onto the pipe,
I can climb down to the ground.
It's very easy.
[wind whistling]
NICHOLAS: If Mummy finds out, you're in for it.
ANNE: Yes, yes, yes.
NICHOLAS: Anne, wait!
I want to come and look for Daddy, too.
Liar. You just don't want to be left on your own.
Scaredy-pants, scaredy-pants!
Be quiet!
[Thumping]
[Noise]
Anne, I think we got lost.
We still haven't left the garden yet, silly.
-I'm scared.
-Shouldn't have come, then.
-Say something.
-What shall I say?
I don't know. Anything.
Let's see.
My name is Anne and I'm walking.
I'm walking and my name is Anne.
[Creaking]
What's that over there?
I think they're graves.
Don't go near!
Why not?
What if a ghost jumps out?
Graves don't have ghosts. only skeletons.
[Sighs]
There's something written here.
NICHOLAS: Let's go!
Wait! [Brushing]
[gasps]
Oh!
Anne! what does it say?
[gasps]
MRS. MILLS: You must be strong now, children.
ANNE: Nicholas, come here!
Mrs. Mills, please don't tell Mummy we've run away.
Don't speak to them!
Why?
- They're dead!
- What?
ANNE: They're ghosts!
Please come here!
Children!
ANNE: Nicholas!
They're ghosts?
Why aren't they wearing sheets and clanking chains?
You said that--
I don't care what I said!
Get away from them!
You're always teasing me and telling lies... and I'm sick of it!
I'm not teasing you!
I'm telling the truth!
Come here!
[gasps]
Quick!
Aah! Mum! Mum!
Children!
[Screaming]
GRACE: Pun!
Run!
Go! Into the house!
GRACE: Don't come any closer!
Don't move! [Panting]
MRS. MILLS:
Don't trouble yourself, ma'am.
Tuberculosis finished us off... more than half a century ago.
[Keys rattling]
[Locks door]
GRACE: Go away!
[Doorknob rattling]
MRS. MILLS:
Open the door, ma'am. Please.
What do you want?
Mummy, don't open the door.
Don't.
We've seen their graves.
Go upstairs and hide.
-Go on.
-I'm scared.
Ohh!
Don't separate! Oh!
Ohh!
Whatever you do, don't separate.
Go hide. Go. Go.
MRS. MILLS: We've been trying to make you understand.
Understand what?
About the house.
About the new situation.
GRACE: What situation?
We must all learn to live together... the living and the dead.
Ohh
If you're dead, leave us in peace!
Oh. Leave us in peace!
GRACE: [Echoing]
Leave us in peace!
In here. get inside.
MRS. MILLS:
And suppose we do leave you.
Do you think they will?
Who?
The intruders.
There are no intruders.
MR TUTTLE:
They took the curtains down.
There are no intruders.
Oh, yes,
I assure you it was them.
And now they're in there with you and the children.
-Waiting for you.
-No!
Yes. And believe me, sooner or later... they'll find you.
Listen, wait here, and I'll be back in a minute.
No, no, no. Mummy said we shouldn't separate.
We can't leave her on her own.
[Panting]
Stop breathing like that.
[Breathing]
Nicholas, stop breathing like that.
Stop breathing!
[Breathing]
Can't you hear it?
There's someone there.
WOMAN: Come with us, children.
Come with us.
[Screaming]
Aah!
Nicholas?
Anne?
Where are you?
Answer me!
MRS. MILLS:
The intruders have found them.
MR TUTTLE:
There's nothing we can do now.
MRS. MILLS: You'll have to go upstairs and talk to them.
[gasping]
[Rattling]
Our Father, who art in Heaven... hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come...
Thy will be done on earh... as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread... and forgive us our trespasses...
[Nicholas whimpering]
WOMAN:
Why are you afraid, children?
Why don't you want us to be your friends?
[whimpering]
Come on. Speak to us.
Speak to us.
Tell me what happened.
[whimpering]
NICHOLAS: Don't tell her!
Don't tell her!
MAN: "Don't tell her. "
ANNE: If I tell her, they'll leave us in peace.
NICHOLAS: Mummy!
MAN: "Mummy."
Why are you crying, children?
What happened in this room?
What did your mother do to you?
[whispering]
Something about a pillow.
Is that how she killed you?
[Rosary drops]
With a pillow?
She didn't kill us!
Children, if you're dead... why do you remain in this house?
ANNE: We're not dead!
[Sobs]
WOMAN: Why do you remain in this house?
We're not dead!
NICHOLAS: We're not dead!
We're not dead!
WOMAN: Why do you remain in this house?
"We're not dead. we're not dead. "
- We're not dead!
- We're not dead!
We're not dead!
[Yelling]
Oh!
[gasps]
[Exhales]
MAN: Are you all right?
Yes. Just a bit dizzy, that's all.
What happened?
They made contact.
All three?
Apparently, yes.
The mother and the two children.
Quite interesting, don't you think?
MRS. MARLISH: Interesting?
I was scared out of my wits!
Darling, calm down.
No. So far, we have handled this matter your way... but now you listen to me.
We can't possibly stay in this house any longer.
It is quite clear these beings do not want us to live here.
We don't know anything about them yet.
Yes, we do!
We know the woman went mad... smothered her two children, and then shot herself.
That's quite enough.
Think of our son.
There's nothing wrong with Victor.
Yes, there is!
He has nightmares.
He says he has seen that girl... and even this lady has been possessed by her.
Please, let us leave this house.
All right.
We will leave tomorrow morning.
Oh, thank god for that.
I'll just go and check on Victor.
Once again, thank you so much for coming.
MAN: A pleasure.
I hope we've been of some help.
MR MARLISH: Oh, yes, of course.
Though I must admit...
At first,
I couldn't understand... what the pillow was doing in my hands... or why you didn't move.
But then I knew.
It had happened.
I had killed my children.
[Inhales]
I got the rifle.
I put it to my forehead.
Then I pulled the trigger.
Nothing.
Then I heard your laughter in the bedroom.
Ahh.
You were playing with the pillows... as if nothing had happened.
And I thought the Lord in His great mercy... was giving me another chance... telling me, "Don't give up."
"Be strong."
"Be a good mother."
"For them."
But now... now... what does all this mean?
Where are we?
MRS. MILLS: Young Lydia said the very same thing... when she realized the three of us were dead.
And that was the last time she ever spoke.
But I couldn't tell you that before now.
Shall I make us a nice cup of tea, ma'am?
The intruders are leaving... but others will come.
Now, sometimes we'll sense them.
Other times, we won't.
But that's the way it's always been.
Ma'am.
NICHOLAS: Mummy...
Daddy died in the war, didn't he?
GRACE: Yes.
Will we ever see him again?
I don't know.
If we're dead, where's limbo?
I don't know if there even is a limbo.
I'm no wiser than you are.
But I do know that I love you.
I've always loved you.
And this house is ours.
You say it with me.
This house is ours.
NICHOLAS:
This house is ours.
This house is ours.
[All repeating]
Mummy, look.
It doesn't hurt any more.
No one can make us leave this house.
Come along, Victor.

{6077}{6189}I'd never forget you, McQueen.

{6310}{6360}What does a whore|need buttons for?
{6361}{6478}I warned you and your friends|payment was expected Monday.

{9417}{9476}- Oh, yeah.|- Yeah.
{9477}{9572}She is a perfect love. But, Ann,|we're all in a terrible way for money.
{9573}{9632}- The Nichols gang...|- They want our blood.
{9633}{9700}- Know what they said they're gonna do?|- Don't start that now.
{9701}{9744}Or what?|What's she saying?
{9745}{9805}They want a pound a week|from each of us.

{9929}{10028}We're needing four pound to pay him,|so I can't spare the time.

{10111}{10182}- He might say no.|- He won't.
{10183}{10230}I know he won't.
{10231}{10290}He's been in France on business.
{10291}{10350}He wrote he sold|a lot of his paintings.
{10351}{10422}He's sure to have full pockets|and feel generous.
{10423}{10474}- To you, perhaps, but...|- I'll ask for myself.
{10475}{10607}I'll get you the four pounds.|I promise, Mary.
{10797}{10868}I'm not gonna hurt you, Netley.

{10918}{10996}Remember who I am?
{10997}{11069}Your charge will be coming down|sooner than expected.
{11070}{11140}Much sooner than expected.
{11141}{11212}Be a good man, Netley.|Get him home quickly.
{11213}{11327}Quickly and quietly.|Understood?
{11356}{11403}Well said, Netley.
{11404}{11497}Very well said.
{12409}{12478}- Take them out.|- What is the meaning of this?
{12479}{12586}- Kidney, what are you doing?|- Ohh! Albert! Aaah!
{12587}{12640}Albert!|My baby!
{12641}{12712}- I want this room in pieces.
{12713}{12801}Oh, no! No!
{12848}{12905}Release me at once!
{12906}{13004}- I demand an explanation!|- It's Albert.
{13005}{13083}Go!
{13102}{13180}- Albert! Aaah!
{13181}{13232}- Get off me! Get off me!
{13233}{13276}Shh, shh, shh.
{13277}{13324}- Please, no!|- Go!
{13325}{13411}Get off!.
{13458}{13535}Who knows?
{13536}{13605}I didn't know.
{13606}{13653}I swear I didn't.
{13654}{13713}How could I tell anyone else?
{13714}{13761}Tsk, tsk, tsk.
{13762}{13849}Who knows?
{13904}{13991}Who knows?
{14068}{14143}I don't know.|I don't know who they could be.
{14144}{14206}Albert must have mixed in|with something terrible.
{14207}{14327}- She's hungry and cold, poor thing.
{14328}{14429}I've got to take her to 'em.|I've got to take her to Ann's parents.
{14430}{14505}All right, you go.|Leave Baby Alice with them.
{14506}{14654}I'll get to work, and I'll|meet you later at the Ten Bells.
{16906}{17008}Mostly Jews live here.
{17430}{17540}Notice something, Inspector?
{17850}{17921}I paid.|I already paid.
{17922}{18041}I'm not after you, Emperor.|Where is he?
{18042}{18088}Move it!
{18089}{18169}Hey!
{18265}{18348}Get up.
{18397}{18480}Get up!
{18510}{18603}Hello, darling.
{18926}{19012}Sergeant.
{19021}{19068}It's night.
{19069}{19153}Well spotted, Inspector Abberline.|Indeed, it is night.
{19154}{19200}The genius has returned to us.
{19201}{19248}Thank you, gentlemen, and remember... 
{19249}{19346}if you ever wish to escape the dreary|confines of your present duties... 
{19347}{19394}this never happened.
{19395}{19488}Cut along, now.
{19494}{19540}Have I lost a day?
{19541}{19612}No, Inspector. Indeed, it's only|four hours since you left here.
{19613}{19721}Oh, deepest apologies|for the, uh, rude awakening.
{19722}{19782}I suspect you enjoyed that.
{19783}{19854}I must be cruel only to be kind,|as the poet said.
{19855}{19944}Although I would happily wallop you|every time you chased the dragon.
{19945}{20016}Well, I had a sneaking suspicion|you might interrupt.
{20017}{20080}You've seen something.
{20081}{20177}What did you see?
{20188}{20284}Are her petticoats|saturated with blood?
{20285}{20392}You know, they used to|burn men like you alive.
{20393}{20466}Sometime this evening a bang-tail|was murdered in George Yard.
{20467}{20540}That doesn't sound much|out of the ordinary.
{20541}{20588}'Twas the way she was done,|Inspector.
{20589}{20648}'Twas the way|the bang-tail was done... 
{20649}{20775}that cries out|for a man of your talents.
{20952}{21079}Her name was Martha Tabram. I don't|know what sort of name Tabram is.
{21080}{21142}It sounds foreign to me.
{21143}{21202}This is not what I saw.
{21203}{21271}Not the woman of your dreams?
{21272}{21358}- You sure?|- Yeah.
{21359}{21413}- Show him.|- You show him.
{21414}{21560}Why do I have to be exposed to this|degradation over and over again?
{21561}{21673}I've looked at the mess twice!
{21722}{21805}Before he cut|her throat, he removed her livelihood... 
{21806}{21898}as a keepsake.
{22087}{22170}Gentlemen, we are indeed|fortunate today... 
{22171}{22242}to be able to observe|an entirely new approach... 
{22243}{22310}to the treatment of insanity.
{22311}{22361}It is... Oh, Dr. Ferral.
{22362}{22456}I was just saying, we're here|in the hope that you will permit us... 
{22457}{22504}to observe|this new treatment of yours.
{22505}{22584}Well, I wasn't expecting such|distinguished visitors, Sir William.
{22585}{22648}But you're all welcome, of course.
{22649}{22692}I'm ready to begin right now.
{22693}{22752}- Who is your patient?|- Ann Crook.
{22753}{22812}An unfortunate, Sir William... 
{22813}{22872}who's hysterical and violent... 
{22873}{22932}and has severe delusions|of persecution.
{22933}{23040}Oh, poor girl.|Uh, do please proceed, Dr. Ferral.
{23041}{23128}Gentlemen.
{24253}{24358}We have one tap above... 
{24410}{24521}and one into the left lobe... 
{24550}{24592}and... 
{24593}{24668}one on the right... 
{24669}{24747}and this unlucky patient's dementia... 
{24748}{24798}will no longer take a violent form.
{24799}{24882}Thanks to this simple procedure... 
{24883}{25031}we can now permanently alleviate|the poor girl's suffering.
{25109}{25192}What could I do? I had to|leave the baby with Ann's parents.
{25193}{25241}Rich man. Thought he was|gonna take care of Ann.
{25242}{25312}Knew that was|too bloody good to be true.
{25313}{25372}They're gonna kill|every one of us.
{25373}{25432}Who is this Albert, anyway?|Who is he?
{25433}{25517}Oh, for God's sake, who cares|about Albert and Ann's troubles?
{25518}{25616}What are we gonna do? We can't|stay clear of the Nichols boys forever.
{25617}{25688}You know, they say|they held poor Martha down... 
{25689}{25785}and watched her bleed until she|passed out, and then cut her throat.
{25786}{25848}- Oh! Shocking.|- McQueen is mad.
{25849}{25896}He enjoys hurting women.
{25897}{25990}That's insane. They want four pounds.|How we gonna get four pounds?
{25991}{26098}Not with my old cunny.|I'd be lucky to get four pence.
{26099}{26170}Oi, oi, oi!|Behave yourselves or bugger off!.
{26171}{26218}Yeah, you can bugger off... 
{26219}{26277}We work, girls.
{26278}{26349}We work the streets|harder than ever.
{26350}{26441}Right? Right?
{26463}{26534}All right, we can do it here.|But hurry up.
{26535}{26582}The bobbies are fussing us tonight.
{26583}{26654}All right. Gotta get|the old man off first, right?
{26655}{26726}- Give it here. I'll put it in meself.|- Oh, that's ni... 
{26727}{26774}Ooh!
{26775}{26822}- Eh?|- Yeah, yeah.
{26823}{26882}- Is it in?|- Of course it is. Come on.
{26883}{26954}No, it's not. You got it|stuck between your bleedin' legs.
{26955}{27117}- No, I haven't. Come on, get a move on.|- I knows it when I feels it.
{27321}{27392}- Oh!|- That's mine, Polly.
{27393}{27488}That's my money.
{27546}{27608}I could pop your eye out.
{27609}{27646}Customers wouldn't mind.
{27647}{27768}They don't mind|if a whore can't see.
{27770}{27817}- What's that?
{27818}{27869}What have I got here?
{27870}{27936}What have I got here, Constable?|Only a little thing.
{27937}{28020}Only a little thing to you,|but a great thing to me.
{28021}{28141}Move, or I'll bash|that smart mouth.
{28145}{28245}You're a dead woman.
{28389}{28472}- He won't bother you again tonight.|- Yeah, that's right.
{28473}{28544}Look, one for the Nichols. Yeah?
{28545}{28612}- And one for me. Right?
{28613}{28664}Oh. Come here. Come here.
{28665}{28719}Hey. Shh.
{28720}{28775}Hey, we work the streets together.
{28776}{28893}I'll keep my eye on you, love, eh?
{28956}{29007}Oh, you pig!
{29008}{29108}You disgusting pig!
{29129}{29180}Yeah, I'm a pig.
{29181}{29252}I'm what's wrong with the world.
{29253}{29300}Be on your own, then.
{29301}{29356}Oh, no!
{29357}{29457}You don't want the company of a pig!
{29458}{29517}What the fuck are you lookin' at?
{29518}{29614}I slept with you!
{29920}{29967}Thirsty?
{29968}{30048}Mmm.
{30088}{30159}That was the thing|that was in my dream.
{30160}{30207}What's it called again?
{30208}{30260}Cleopatra's Needle.
{30261}{30308}Mmm. Cleopatra.
{30309}{30357}She was a beauty, wasn't she?
{30358}{30493}It was carved 1,500 years|before the Son of God was born.
{30494}{30541}Mmm.
{30542}{30613}Six men died to bring it here... 
{30614}{30702}from Egypt.
{32152}{32263}May the Good Lord have mercy.
{32541}{32612}She was like that when I found her...|all murdered.
{32613}{32684}What kind of monster did this?
{32685}{32817}- Woman, I told you.|- Who was the first to see her?
{32818}{32954}You go in. Keep to the streets.|Settle back, now.
{32963}{33029}The boys have made their rounds of the|taverns and the delightful domiciles... 
{33030}{33097}that make up|this charming little street.
{33098}{33156}Would it surprise you to learn|that nobody heard a sound?
{33157}{33237}Throat was cut, but there's|no arterial spray on the wall.
{33238}{33350}She was killed somewhere else.
{33402}{33523}- It rained last night, didn't it?|- Mm-hmm.
{33524}{33600}She's dry.
{33601}{33664}She was brought here|in a carriage or something.
{33665}{33724}Throat must have been cut|in the carriage.
{33725}{33780}I imagine they stopped it|just over there.
{33781}{33808}"They"?
{33809}{33833}"They"?
{33834}{33951}- There's more than one, then.|- Most definitely.
{33952}{34003}This was all in your vision?
{34004}{34074}- Take your missus home.
{34075}{34132}Where were the coppers last night?
{34133}{34188}Oh, Jesus.
{34189}{34248}So... 
{34249}{34296}definitely more than one person.
{34297}{34425}Has to be a message from|the Nichols boys. Am I right?
{34426}{34470}What the hell?
{34471}{34520}That's grapes, isn't it?
{34521}{34662}What the hell would a bang-tail|be doing with grapes?
{35661}{35732}I'd like to give them an answer.
{35733}{35792}- What are you talking about?|- The Nichols boys.
{35793}{35840}I would welcome the opportunity... 
{35841}{35912}to give them an answer|to their bloody message.
{35913}{35972}There is most definitely|a message here.
{35973}{36081}- You're right about that.|- And what am I wrong about?
{36082}{36188}Martha Tabram was raped,|tortured and killed.
{36189}{36236}That's cruel.
{36237}{36348}But I've seen that sort of cruelty|in the East End before.
{36349}{36412}This is methodical.
{36413}{36460}The butchery's irrational... 
{36461}{36573}yet meticulous and deliberate.
{36596}{36712}Altogether a different|breed of killer.
{36713}{36784}As soon as possible|I'd like to know what he took.
{36785}{36864}What? What do you mean,|what he took?
{36865}{36936}- Didn't you notice?|- What?
{36937}{36996}He's taken at least one|of her organs.
{36997}{37080}Oh, no.
{37224}{37311}I want every veterinarian,|butcher... 
{37312}{37383}and furrier in the district|interviewed.
{37384}{37445}Furrier? What did he do, sir?|Skin her?
{37446}{37513}- Pipe down, Withers.
{37514}{37609}When the inspector is talking,|you are listening. Do you understand?
{37610}{37660}Yes, Sergeant.
{37661}{37732}He disemboweled her.
{37733}{37816}After he cut her throat,|he stabbed her in the chest... 
{37817}{37864}cut open her stomach... 
{37865}{37981}and, uh, took out her intestines.
{38001}{38076}At least one|of her organs was removed.
{38077}{38228}I'm waiting for the police surgeon's|report for more details.
{38233}{38300}I see.
{38301}{38348}Well, one thing's for certain:
{38349}{38457}an Englishman didn't do it.
{38459}{38560}Maybe one of these red Indians... 
{38561}{38716}wandered into White chapel|and indulged his natural inclinations.
{38720}{38772}With all due respect, sir... 
{38773}{38821}I believe this was done by someone... 
{38822}{38878}with at least|a working knowledge of dissection.
{38879}{38950}- An educated man, such as a doctor...|- An educated man?
{38951}{39063}That's preposterous.|No well-bred man would do this.
{39064}{39124}Probably a tradesman or a butcher.
{39125}{39233}A tradesman is|a possibility, sir, yes.
{39234}{39306}But there's a strong|indication against it.
{39307}{39368}There was a sprig of grapes|found under her body.
{39369}{39404}What are you driving at?
{39405}{39505}No one in Whitechapel,|no matter what their trade... 
{39506}{39548}could afford grapes.
{39549}{39604}Obviously they were|given to her by the killer.
{39605}{39684}And it follows that|he must be someone with money.
{39685}{39773}What about the Jews?|A Jew butcher.
{39774}{39839}Or a Jew tailor|might have money.
{39840}{39888}There are plenty of them|in Whitechapel.
{39889}{39969}Well, sir, for the sake|of public safety in general... 
{39970}{40096}I'd like to be careful about spreading|the rumours that it might be a Jew.
{40097}{40144}Inspector, I know your reputation... 
{40145}{40216}for making brilliant guesses|that turn out to be right.
{40217}{40304}Someone told me you claimed|to dream the answers.
{40305}{40390}Frankly, it doesn't matter to me|what your methods are.
{40391}{40468}But be certain you don't|proceed without proof.
{40469}{40522}- Is that clear?|- Of course, sir.
{40523}{40570}Personally, I don't care.
{40571}{40640}The fewer pinch-pricks|on the streets, the better.
{40641}{40748}But the sooner you find|this butcher or tailor, Inspector... 
{40749}{40860}the sooner we can all|celebrate your promotion.
{40861}{40957}Keep me informed.
{41277}{41348}He didn't know nothin'!
{41349}{41420}Bloody Jew did it!|It's gotta be!
{41421}{41516}Murdering kikes!
{41517}{41588}Every cellar!|Every stable!
{41589}{41636}We'll find him out!
{41637}{41683}Some bleedin' Jew! Come on!
{41684}{41801}That's enough!|Let's burn 'em out!
{44625}{44677}I have wonderful news.
{44678}{44725}Tell me.
{44726}{44791}Surely you, of all people,|can guess.
{44792}{44897}I don't want to guess with you.
{44898}{44996}Dr. Marbury says... 
{45009}{45093}Dr. Marbury says?
{45094}{45226}Dr. Marbury says|I'm going to have your child.
{45915}{45990}Aye, to die... 
{45991}{46041}and go we know not where... 
{46042}{46169}but to lie in cold obstruction|and to rot.
{46177}{46248}A simple "rest in peace"|would suffice, Godley.
{46249}{46296}Yes, sir.
{46297}{46368}In the midst of life|we are in death.
{46369}{46456}Of whom may we seek for succor|but of thee, O Lord... 
{46457}{46530}who, for our sins,|are justly displeased?
{46531}{46664}Yet, O Lord, God most holy,|O Lord most mighty... 
{46982}{47037}Good afternoon, ladies.
{47038}{47109}I'm Inspector Abberline.|This is Sergeant Godley.
{47110}{47203}We're investigating the murders|of Polly Nichols and Martha Tabram.
{47204}{47273}Yes, we understand that they|were both friends of you ladies.
{47274}{47357}Close friends. We're rather hoping|you'd be able to help us out.
{47358}{47405}Don't know nothing.
{47406}{47453}Me neither.
{47454}{47532}Why you botherin' us?|You ought to be botherin'  McQueen.
{47533}{47605}- Is he the boss on Nichol Street?|- He's the heart and soul of the gang.
{47606}{47736}Isn't it your job|to be knowin' that small detail?
{47737}{47808}And what makes you think McQueen|did this to your friends?
{47809}{47906}Can't prove nothing by me.
{47907}{47969}- You're Mary Kelly. Is that right?|- That's right.
{47970}{48060}Well, Mary Kelly, unless one of you|is willing to testify against McQueen... 
{48061}{48128}I can't do nothing.
{48129}{48176}Surely, Inspector... 
{48177}{48229}a strong, handsome man like you... 
{48230}{48344}you could do anything|you put your brilliant mind to.
{48345}{48444}I'm a coward and a weakling and I can't|help meself. What's your excuse?
{48445}{48557}Why are you so bloody useless?
{48589}{48706}Come on, Mary.|That won't help us.
{49218}{49308}Is that you?
{49313}{49393}Before my mother died,|back in Ireland.
{49394}{49450}- Is that when you came here?|- Yeah.
{49451}{49509}When I was eight.
{49510}{49557}When things was good.
{49558}{49698}We were starvin',|but we were starvin' in fresh air.
{49706}{49765}I was thinking... 
{49766}{49844}we ain't ever gonna earn enough|to satisfy the Nichols boys... 
{49845}{49937}and feed our own mouths.
{49938}{50006}You said, right...|You said those men, yeah?
{50007}{50090}The ones who took her rich artist man|and who took her as well.
{50091}{50194}You said they was clean shaven|and their clothes was neat.
{50195}{50270}- Yeah, right.|- Well, they weren't no criminals then.
{50271}{50342}I mean, they weren't the likes|of the Nichols boys.
{50343}{50388}They was unusual.
{50389}{50437}Perhaps even official.
{50438}{50526}What are you gettin' at, Annie?
{50527}{50584}Maybe we could go with the papers.
{50585}{50632}Get paid for the story, you know.
{50633}{50691}"Where is Ann Crook?"|That sort of thing.
{50692}{50755}The papers are always desperate|for things bad about the government.
{50756}{50796}And it's a mystery to boot.
{50797}{50854}It's not a bad plan.|What do you think, Mary?
{50855}{50938}I'm thinkin' we should talk to that|inspector, the one at Polly's funeral.
{50939}{50986}Oh, fuck me, no!
{50987}{51082}If we go to the papers they might|hurt Ann or do something to her baby.
{51083}{51172}What, worse than what'll happen to her|in Whitechapel when she sprouts teats?
{51173}{51282}I don't know for sure, but I think we're|better off talkin' to that inspector.
{51283}{51395}Lord, you are young after all.
{51427}{51509}Four bitches.|That's what I thought.
{51510}{51566}You only paid|for one bloody person.
{51567}{51614}- They're my guests.|- Guests?
{51615}{51678}Well, let me welcome your guests.
{51679}{51748}- Go on, get out!
{51749}{51796}Go on, get out!
{51797}{51877}Get out of here, you bloody whores!|Go on!
{51878}{51925}When you have four pence... 
{51926}{52031}you can come back with your|ladies-in-waitin', Your Grace.
{52032}{52079}Oh, shut up!
{52080}{52127}Ow!
{52128}{52175}Back to work, then.
{52176}{52247}- Well, let's try and stay together.|- You know we can't.
{52248}{52319}Then stay good and clear|of Nichol Street.
{52320}{52393}Come on!
{52394}{52441}- All right, Annie?|- Ehh.
{52442}{52489}Bloody bastard.
{52490}{52610}- How's your head?|- Oh, very funny!
{54363}{54444}Hyah!
{55401}{55481}Boo!
{55519}{55605}I didn't frighten you, did I?
{55606}{55653}I been lookin' for ya.
{55654}{55702}I been lookin' all over for ya.
{55703}{55758}You been looking for me?
{55759}{55830}Not for me.|On behalf of my gentleman.
{55831}{55902}A very fine gentleman.|He sent me to find ya.
{55903}{55972}Your gentleman sent you to find me?
{55973}{56068}Oh, get off. I might be unfortunate,|but I'm not a blitherin' idiot.
{56069}{56156}It's the truth.|It's the God's truth.
{56157}{56205}He seen ya.|He likes ya.
{56206}{56314}And he said tonight only you'll do.
{56315}{56386}So he said to find ya,|take ya to Hanover Street... 
{56387}{56444}where he's waitin' for ya.
{56445}{56546}- You're very pretty.
{56565}{56633}Go on, then, get in.|I'll take you there.
{56634}{56691}Oh, I almost forgot.
{56692}{56782}My gentleman got you a present.|You like grapes?
{56783}{56864}Yeah.
{56889}{56960}Whoa!
{56961}{57060}Your gentleman,|he must be very refined.
{57061}{57116}- Very refined indeed.|- Get in.
{57117}{57235}- I'll take you there.|- All right.
{57436}{57526}Here we are.
{57685}{57756}- I'm like a lady.|- You are a lady.
{57757}{57833}Your gaffer,|does he want anything special?
{57834}{57905}Just the usual, I expect.
{57906}{57985}Now, this alley|takes you to a yard.
{57986}{58033}My gentleman, he's quiet.
{58034}{58105}He doesn't like disturbances.
{58106}{58157}What I wanna know, right... 
{58158}{58283}is at off like him,|how much is he offerin'?
{58284}{58331}Here. Two florin.
{58332}{58379}That'll do me.
{58380}{58438}Let me see ya. Go on.
{58439}{58486}- Down here?|- Yeah.
{58487}{58568}Straight down.|Straight down to the door at the end.
{58569}{58622}Shh.
{58623}{58660}Shh.
{58661}{58756}Straight down there, yeah?
{58757}{58838}Oops.
{58864}{58942}No!
{59401}{59460}- Bugger off!.
{59461}{59540}You watch your mouth!
{59541}{59588}Anymore information?
{59589}{59660}- My readers wanna know this stuff...|- Oh, do they?
{59661}{59720}Found a piece of leather apron|in her mouth?
{59721}{59776}No, Mr. Best,|but if it's your fancy... 
{59777}{59860}I'd be delighted to stuff your mouth|with a piece of leather.
{59861}{59933}Come on, give us a tip.|Put your picture on the front page.
{59934}{59980}Cover-up!
{59981}{60058}You're supposed to do something|about it! This is ridiculous!
{60059}{60124}There's a bleeding|murderer on the loose!
{60125}{60223}What about my wife?
{60935}{60992}This is Annie.
{60993}{61064}Yes. Another of|the circle of friends.
{61065}{61140}Annie Chapman.|Dark Annie, they called her.
{61141}{61268}You still say this|isn't the Nichols boys?
{61274}{61348}Did the constable show you the leather|they found down by the water spout?
{61349}{61420}Could be part of a butcher's apron.
{61421}{61492}Leather apron. Dear God.
{61493}{61560}We could be looking|for a butcher after all.
{61561}{61626}I saw her.
{61627}{61718}- This one?|- Yeah. Last night.
{61719}{61812}I saw her face.
{61872}{61929}Don't trample over this area.
{61930}{61993}Let us see the body!
{61994}{62060}- Come on, let us see!|- Oh, God.
{62061}{62096}There's your typical Londoner... 
{62097}{62169}imbued with the Christian spirit|of sympathy for his fellow man.
{62170}{62223}Or fellow whore, in this case.
{62224}{62292}He's really out done himself|this time, hasn't he?
{62293}{62340}He not only severed the intestines... 
{62341}{62409}he carefully arranged them|around the neck and shoulders.
{62410}{62536}I think he's taken|more organs this time.
{62634}{62727}Grapes again. Why grapes?
{62728}{62799}Only Polly and Dark Annie|were given grapes.
{62800}{62885}Only they were disemboweled|in such a meticulous fashion.
{62886}{62981}This ain't killing for profit.
{62982}{63030}This is ritual.
{63031}{63132}Yeah, but why grapes?
{63293}{63413}So they'll trust whatever he offers.
{63613}{63668}I've never fully understood|that tradition.
{63669}{63705}They're for the ferryman... 
{63706}{63801}who takes the body across the river|into the land of the dead.
{63802}{63885}If she don't have|the money to pay him... 
{63886}{64033}she'd have to wander forever,|lost between the two worlds.
{64156}{64219}I need to consult a doctor.
{64220}{64261}Are you ill, Inspector?
{64262}{64317}A surgeon, to be specific.
{64318}{64411}The killer removed the victim's uterus|and its attachments.
{64412}{64480}My God.|He's out of his mind.
{64481}{64544}That's very astute of you, sir.
{64545}{64616}I don't appreciate sarcasm, Inspector.
{64617}{64676}I'm sorry, sir.|I meant nothing by it.
{64677}{64745}You already have a surgeon|at your disposal.
{64746}{64831}I need a man with a strong stomach|and a sober mind.
{64832}{64882}The police surgeon has neither.
{64883}{64954}- No. Request denied.|- Why?
{64955}{65002}Are you questioning my decision?
{65003}{65056}No, sir.|I simply want to know why.
{65057}{65130}There's already too much nonsense|and gossip in the press.
{65131}{65178}You start consulting doctors... 
{65179}{65244}and all sorts of wild notions|will be printed.
{65245}{65345}No one else is to see the bodies.
{65346}{65393}It is my honour... 
{65394}{65524}to present this...|unique medical phenomenon.
{65525}{65600}Until last week, Mr. Joseph Merrick... 
{65601}{65648}John Merrick.
{65649}{65696}I beg your pardon.
{65697}{65744}Mr. John Merrick... 
{65745}{65808}was an attraction at a side-show.
{65809}{65864}Now he's being cared for... 
{65865}{65945}at England's leading hospital... 
{65946}{65993}and with your generosity... 
{65994}{66096}we will be able|to continue to do so.
{66097}{66168}Ladies and gentlemen... 
{66169}{66264}Mr. John Merrick.
{66309}{66399}Turn around.
{66525}{66572}Oh, please.
{66573}{66619}I can't stand it.
{66620}{66745}Oh! He should have|been killed at birth!
{66869}{66961}- Good health!
{67109}{67240}That'll be the last one,|Your Royal Highness.
{67490}{67584}These hands are a gift from God.
{67585}{67650}- The psychotic patient is...|- Pardon, sir.
{67651}{67712}- You Dr. Ferral?|- I am, yes.
{67713}{67789}I'm Inspector Abberline,|assigned to Whitechapel.
{67790}{67850}- My lord, you're the Ripper case.
{67851}{67904}- Am I right?|- Yeah.
{67905}{67976}Jolly good.|You've come to the perfect place.
{67977}{68033}We've got butchers aplenty here.
{68034}{68081}- I see.
{68082}{68172}I could use the expertise of someone|like yourself to help solve this case.
{68173}{68244}They tell me you're|the best young surgeon in London.
{68245}{68296}Really?
{68297}{68392}I don't see how a reputable surgeon|could know anything about it.
{68393}{68454}This country's over run with foreigners.
{68455}{68504}Orientals and... 
{68505}{68556}Jews.
{68557}{68669}Socialists trying to stir things up|against our monarchy.
{68670}{68721}That's who you should be pursuing.
{68722}{68769}Don't you think?
{68770}{68821}Excuse me.
{68822}{68934}You don't belong here, do you?
{68942}{69037}I'm afraid Dr. Ferral suffers|from the surgeon's malady.
{69038}{69084}And what's that, sir?
{69085}{69137}Want of feeling.
{69138}{69195}He knows everything|about anatomy... 
{69196}{69264}and nothing about the soul.
{69265}{69326}How may I assist you, Inspector?
{69327}{69398}Well, forgive my ignorance,|sir, but, um... 
{69399}{69446}are you a surgeon?
{69447}{69494}I was.
{69495}{69564}Unfortunately, I suffered|a brain seizure six months ago.
{69565}{69700}- Sorry to hear that, sir.|- These days I limit myself to teaching.
{69701}{69834}So you see, I'm accustomed|to answering questions, Inspector.
{69835}{69888}Well, sir... 
{69889}{70036}could you tell me what sort|of a knife, uh, would this be?
{70194}{70265}I think you mean to|draw a Liston knife.
{70266}{70337}It's named for Liston,|who was a surgeon in the Crimean War.
{70338}{70397}Because there was no anaesthetic|on the battlefield... 
{70398}{70458}he had to carry out these amputations|very quickly.
{70459}{70506}Uh... 
{70507}{70592}do you, by any chance, have|the police surgeon's report available?
{70593}{70640}Yes, I do, sir.
{70641}{70687}May I?
{70688}{70810}- We must keep this confidential.|- Of course.
{70811}{70919}- There it is.|- Thank you.
{70983}{71063}Hmm.
{71081}{71161}Yes.
{71214}{71261}Wouldn't someone|have heard their screams?
{71262}{71346}Not if you cut their throats first.
{71347}{71394}Yes.
{71395}{71496}And how can you be sure they wouldn't|react to seeing the Liston knife?
{71497}{71565}Grapes.
{71566}{71612}He offers them grapes first.
{71613}{71697}- Ah.|- Grapes are very tempting.
{71698}{71761}Yes, of course.|They'd gobble them up, wouldn't they?
{71762}{71833}And he might offer them|a drink to ease them down.
{71834}{71910}A drink laced with laudanum.
{71911}{71958}How do you know that?
{71959}{72030}I found a sprig of grapes|on both victims' bodies... 
{72031}{72088}and I smelled the laudanum|on their lips.
{72089}{72180}Laudanum is a derivative of opium.
{72181}{72331}Apart from doctors and addicts,|not many would recognise it.
{72361}{72494}How long have you|chased the dragon, Inspector?
{72524}{72608}Well, these should help|with the headaches.
{72609}{72677}And, um... 
{72678}{72749}opium leeches minerals|out of the body... 
{72750}{72801}so I've also given you a tonic... 
{72802}{72849}that will help to|restore your appetite.
{72850}{72956}Thank you very much, sir.
{72982}{73029}I'm a fool.
{73030}{73116}I don't think you're a fool.|Far from it.
{73117}{73205}I ought to have known, sir, that you're|Physician Ordinary to the Royal Family.
{73206}{73253}Well, yes, it's certainly an honour... 
{73254}{73321}but it's an honour|best owed on many doctors.
{73322}{73398}Now, about our friend here,|I can tell you this much:
{73399}{73496}He cut their throats from left to right,|therefore he's right-handed.
{73497}{73544}Excuse me.
{73545}{73635}He had to slice through|four layers of tissue... 
{73636}{73695}and up to an inch|of subcutaneous fat.
{73696}{73743}After that... 
{73744}{73791}he entered the abdominal cavity... 
{73792}{73872}so he would have had to use more|than just merely the Liston knife.
{73873}{74013}Perhaps he was carrying a portable|amputation kit similar to this.
{74014}{74111}What do you think?
{74239}{74310}Is it possible, sir, that the killer|is an educated man... 
{74311}{74358}perhaps someone who studied medicine... 
{74359}{74456}but who is, in fact,|not a surgeon himself?
{74457}{74504}The intestines are simple enough.
{74505}{74560}But, uh, the uterus?
{74561}{74644}The liver, especially. Hard to locate,|unless you know what you're doing.
{74645}{74702}And he was working quickly, in the dark.
{74703}{74764}I had held out hope that this... 
{74765}{74812}monster was a veterinarian... 
{74813}{74881}or a furrier or an... 
{74882}{74946}especially well-educated butcher.
{74947}{75035}No, I must admit, if I were you... 
{75036}{75160}I'd look for someone with|a thorough knowledge of human anatomy.
{75161}{75247}Damn him.
{75893}{75952}Do you want me to suck it?
{75953}{76012}I can suck the Thames dry.
{76013}{76123}Don't be frightened, dearie.
{76462}{76589}How far advanced|is our grandson's malady?
{76611}{76696}Uh, no lesions have appeared, ma'am.
{76697}{76786}There is some neural damage...|a slight trembling of the right hand.
{76787}{76838}But I'm hopeful...|more than hopeful... 
{76839}{76886}that treatment will arrest the disease.
{76887}{77006}He seems to us to be suffering|greatly in his mind.
{77007}{77068}Is the disease affecting his emotions?
{77069}{77143}Yes, well, of course|his mood is depressed... 
{77144}{77240}because of the news of the diagnosis.
{77241}{77340}But that should improve|as he regains his strength.
{77341}{77415}You are a true physician, Sir William.
{77416}{77507}In all ways, you attend|to the health of our empire.
{77508}{77559}We are grateful.
{77560}{77656}Thank you, ma'am.
{77949}{78012}If this is the beginning... 
{78013}{78078}of a five-pointed star... 
{78079}{78158}- A bloody Jewish star.|- Withers!
{78159}{78241}Inspector is talking,|which means you are what?
{78242}{78340}- I'm listening, sir.|- Yes.
{78341}{78415}This area would form a likely point.
{78416}{78492}I want double shifts within|these streets until further notice.
{78493}{78566}And don't only worry|about Jews and butchers.
{78567}{78621}You stop anyone suspicious... 
{78622}{78678}including well-dressed gentlemen.
{78679}{78726}And by the way, Withers... 
{78727}{78843}the Star of David has six points.
{78863}{78984}Right. Once more into the breach,|dear friends.
{78985}{79072}Dismissed!
{79236}{79346}Why have you called me here?
{79359}{79428}It's just... 
{79429}{79541}It's just you say three more|have to be killed.
{79542}{79595}I can't take it, sir.
{79596}{79721}It's everywhere.|It's in all the papers.
{79756}{79811}I'm just a simple chap, sir.
{79812}{79900}I'm not a great man like you.
{79901}{80020}I just don't know|where I am at... anymore.
{80021}{80096}There, there, Netley.
{80097}{80209}I shall tell you where we are.
{80227}{80315}We are in the most extreme|and utter region... 
{80316}{80391}of the human mind.
{80392}{80443}A radiant abyss... 
{80444}{80541}where men meet themselves.
{80542}{80605}I don't understand that.
{80606}{80711}I don't understand, sir.
{80712}{80803}Hell, Netley.
{80824}{80917}We are in hell.
{81140}{81221}- Let me go! Get your hands off me!|- Pull yourself together.
{81222}{81282}Go on!
{81283}{81329}- In with you!
{81330}{81377}Sorry about that, Inspector.
{81378}{81432}She's madly in love with me... 
{81433}{81518}although she hides it well.
{81519}{81581}You said McQueen|killed your two friends.
{81582}{81634}- So what are you doing here?|- Oh, I see.
{81635}{81737}Women are butchered right and left,|and you can't do piss about it.
{81738}{81802}- And I'm the fool.|- We're watching them.
{81803}{81864}Can't arrest them without evidence,|so we watch them.
{81865}{81934}- What else can we do?|- I'll testify.
{81935}{82032}If you keep meself|and me friends alive, I'll testify.
{82033}{82068}To what, precisely?
{82069}{82143}That McQueen said he'd cut me|unless I pay him a pound a week.
{82144}{82196}- No.|- What you mean, no?
{82197}{82296}You asked me to testify.|Are you worried I'll let you down?
{82297}{82364}I won't.|I promise I won't.
{82365}{82441}You testify against McQueen,|maybe he goes in for a year or two.
{82442}{82552}But his boys, they'll take|their revenge on you and your friends.
{82553}{82655}I can't let you do it.
{82750}{82857}It's your round this time.
{82879}{82944}I confess, I have an appetite.
{82945}{83026}One day, I'll be|a great big round woman... 
{83027}{83097}with a skinny little man|for a husband.
{83098}{83188}And a dozen plump children, I imagine.
{83189}{83285}You think that's funny... an unfortunate|like me being a decent mother?
{83286}{83336}No, no, I didn't mean that.|I didn't mean that at all.
{83337}{83394}You'll be a wonderful mother|someday, Mary.
{83395}{83446}Honest. I can see it.
{83447}{83522}I see you in a little cottage|by the sea... 
{83523}{83570}surrounded by children.
{83571}{83687}I can see it, Mary, clear as day.
{83716}{83796}- I really do have visions, you know.|- Are you serious?
{83797}{83916}Sergeant Godley calls 'em my intuitions.
{83917}{83964}As a matter of fact... 
{83965}{84016}I had one about you in this case.
{84017}{84074}You have visions about me?
{84075}{84175}What might those be?
{84221}{84271}I want you to think carefully.
{84272}{84344}Besides McQueen,|besides these awful murders... 
{84345}{84406}has anything else happened to you|or perhaps to one of your friends... 
{84407}{84490}that's a bit out of the ordinary?
{84491}{84585}Ben Kidney? That's Special Branch|she's describing, you know.
{84586}{84660}What the hell would Ben Kidney and|Special Branch be doing in Whitechapel?
{84661}{84707}Wait a minute.
{84708}{84761}She's Irish-born, isn't she?|There's your answer.
{84762}{84870}A secret Irish rebel. That's why|they would be after her, right?
{84871}{84929}They were after Ann Crook... 
{84930}{84977}who was having an affair|with a wealthy gentleman.
{84978}{85035}A man she bore a child.
{85036}{85148}A child that's now missing,|along with its grandparents.
{85149}{85266}- Right. Drive on, please, driver.
{85293}{85357}You do not fuck with Special Branch.
{85358}{85456}They fuck with you.
{85596}{85746}I don't know what you're thinking,|and I don't care to know.
{85844}{85904}Inspector Adderly.|Mr. Kidney wants to see me.
{85905}{85940}Mr. Kidney's gone, sir.
{85941}{85995}Didn't say where.|Could be for the night.
{85996}{86060}No. He said he'd be back before 11:00,|and I should wait.
{86061}{86140}Where are you going, sir?
{86141}{86218}He said I should wait in his office.
{86219}{86321}And what floor|is Mr. Kidney's office on?
{86322}{86369}I don't know what floor,|you bloody idiot... 
{86370}{86426}because I haven't been to|his fucking office yet, have I?
{86427}{86478}He told me to have|the desk man let me up.
{86479}{86542}But I'm more than happy|to stand here like a knob... 
{86543}{86622}because you disobeyed|Ben Kidney's order.
{86623}{86670}It's the second floor on the right.
{86671}{86754}Thanks.
{89159}{89250}Free Ireland!
{89258}{89349}Free Ireland!
{89399}{89494}Get inside, sir!
{89710}{89760}Just some gunpowder, sir.|That's all.
{89761}{89837}Little more than a firework.
{89838}{89887}Anyone go in or out?
{89888}{89964}Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.|Yes, uh... 
{89965}{90095}There's an Inspector Adderly|in your office.
{90272}{90388}No, there's nothing missing here.
{90456}{90597}The bastards have been in here, sir.|I can smell 'em.
{91043}{91090}- No.|- Yes.
{91091}{91162}No, not together.|Too suspicious.
{91163}{91254}You wait for me, and if she's in there|you can go and visit her on your own.
{91255}{91302}I'm going with you right now... 
{91303}{91392}or I'm going to the newspapers.
{91393}{91480}I mean it.
{91615}{91694}There's a number of mental disorders|for which it is necessary... 
{91695}{91785}to remove the front part of the brain.
{91786}{91858}Her records indicate|that she was violent... 
{91859}{91943}threatening to do harm|to herself... and others.
{91944}{91991}Does she have any relations?
{91992}{92046}No, she's a ward of the state.
{92047}{92115}- That's a lie.|- Listen to me.
{92116}{92169}You're under arrest.|You're here to assist my investigation.
{92170}{92257}- Keep your mouth shut. Is that clear?|- Sorry, sir.
{92258}{92312}Good.
{92313}{92360}What else do you know about her?
{92361}{92426}All we know is that|she was an unfortunate... 
{92427}{92512}who lived in|the Whitechapel district.
{92513}{92610}I'd like to ask her|a few questions.
{92611}{92693}You won't get any sense out of her.
{92694}{92790}I'm used to that.
{93045}{93142}Hello, Ann.|I brought Mary Kelly.
{93143}{93260}- Do you remember Mary Kelly?|- Ann, you know me.
{93261}{93339}I'm your best friend|in all the world.
{93340}{93447}Go away. Go away. Go away.
{93462}{93538}Ann, I'm gonna find Baby Alice.
{93539}{93598}I'm gonna take care of her.
{93599}{93692}Alice is laughing to me.|Laughing to me.
{93693}{93770}Laughing to me all day long.
{93771}{93837}It's all right.|It's all right, darling.
{93838}{93910}What about her father?
{93911}{94028}Have you seen|Alice's father, Ann?
{94032}{94137}He's a prince. A prince.
{94140}{94226}A prince! A prince!|And I'm a queen.
{94227}{94333}I'm a queen! I'm a queen!
{94347}{94421}How do you know he was a painter?
{94422}{94470}He hired us to pose as artist models.
{94471}{94578}And what exactly does that entail?|"Artist models."
{94579}{94654}We stood very still|so he could paint us.
{94655}{94725}What's the matter?|You think I was born a whore?
{94726}{94781}Oh, I'm sorry.|I'm an unfortunate, not a whore.
{94782}{94830}England doesn't have whores.
{94831}{94918}Just a great mass|of very unlucky women.
{94919}{94983}So, Ann Crook... 
{94984}{95041}and the painter became lovers...|is that it?
{95042}{95152}He married her... in a lovely|Catholic church... Saint Savior's.
{95153}{95206}I was a witness,|as a matter off act.
{95207}{95289}He married her in a Catholic church.
{95290}{95420}What do you think|they've done to Baby Alice?
{95438}{95501}Special Branch|dumped her in Bishops gate?
{95502}{95569}Yeah, as an unknown.
{95570}{95664}- But why?|- When I find out, I'll tell you.
{95665}{95756}- Take me to her. You have to.|- No, not yet.
{95757}{95855}I need to know more first.
{95856}{95941}Look here, I promise... 
{95942}{96002}that I'll help you|with Baby Alice, but not yet.
{96003}{96128}You gotta trust me on that,|at least a little bit.
{96129}{96201}I do. I do trust you.
{96202}{96261}Good.
{96262}{96338}Do you have little ones, Inspector?
{96339}{96422}No. No.
{96459}{96553}A year ago...|No, two years... 
{96554}{96620}I'm sorry, more than two years... 
{96621}{96714}my wife, um, passed away... 
{96715}{96784}giving birth to|what I'm told was a son.
{96785}{96848}I'm sorry.
{96849}{96932}Thanks.
{97014}{97085}I wanna show you some paintings|on the way out, yeah?
{97086}{97192}- Are you gonna take me into the gallery?|- Why not?
{97193}{97278}Come on.
{97786}{97946}- Did you see the look on her face?|- I think she stopped breathing.
{97981}{98028}She's a fright.
{98029}{98093}She has cold eyes.
{98094}{98178}I feel like someone's|walking over my grave.
{98179}{98309}There's one more painting|I want you to see.
{98683}{98743}You know him, don't you?
{98744}{98840}Those whom God has|joined together, let no man put a sunder.
{98841}{98896}I pronounce... 
{98897}{98956}that they be man and wife.
{98957}{99098}In nomine Patris, et Filii,|et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.
{99313}{99436}- Sir William Gull, please.|- Sir William isn't receiving visitors.
{99437}{99476}Uh... 
{99477}{99542}Sir William?|It's Inspector Abberline.
{99543}{99591}I need to speak with you, sir.
{99592}{99721}Sir William is ill.|Can't receive any visitors.
{99722}{99768}I said... 
{99769}{99834}you can't go in.
{99835}{99914}It's all right, Dr. Ferral.|I don't mind company.
{99915}{100048}Have Anna bring us some tea,|would you, please?
{100111}{100196}Ah, well, I wish|I could tell you, Inspector... 
{100197}{100296}that your story was fantastical.
{100297}{100370}Unhappily, I cannot.
{100371}{100504}I know for a fact that the prince|has a taste in unfortunate women.
{100505}{100565}And I suppose it's|more than possible that... 
{100566}{100635}he concocted this elaborate deception... 
{100636}{100728}to have some privacy while|he indulged in his secret life.
{100729}{100812}But I know one reason|I have for stating... 
{100813}{100929}that Prince Edward being Jack the Ripper|is just incomprehensible.
{100930}{101026}What's that, sir?
{101059}{101153}If you repeat what I'm about to tell|you, both our lives are in jeopardy.
{101154}{101219}Indeed, I hope for your sake|that what I'm about to say... 
{101220}{101290}will steer you clear of|the very real danger you're in.
{101291}{101416}I think I'm well past the point|of safe return, sir.
{101417}{101525}Prince Edward has syphilis.
{101526}{101610}Not a pleasant state secret,|but a vital one.
{101611}{101658}Well, then that proves it.
{101659}{101763}I couldn't understand why the prince|was killing Ann Crook's friends... 
{101764}{101828}especially so savagely, but... 
{101829}{101905}he's not merely killing them.
{101906}{101953}He's punishing them.
{101954}{102011}He wants revenge.|Don't you see, sir?
{102012}{102095}No, Inspector, I don't see.
{102096}{102182}I'm afraid your wild speculations|about the prince's mental state... 
{102183}{102246}clever though they maybe... 
{102247}{102294}cannot overcome|the physical impossibility... 
{102295}{102342}of his committing these crimes.
{102343}{102407}The disease is|far enough along that... 
{102408}{102477}the prince's hands|tremble uncontrollably.
{102478}{102542}He's very weak,|and the killings of Jack the Ripper... 
{102543}{102662}require sure hands|and considerable vigour.
{102663}{102755}And have you forgotten|the most telling fact?
{102756}{102803}Whatever else the prince may be... 
{102804}{102934}he knows little or nothing|of human anatomy.
{103763}{103872}Conduct the candidate to the centre|of the lodge and cause him to kneel... 
{103873}{103980}for the benefit of prayer.
{104061}{104146}Vouch safe thine aid,|Almighty Father of the universe... 
{104147}{104238}to this, our present convention.
{104239}{104309}Who is this?
{104310}{104373}A poor candidate|in a state of darkness... 
{104374}{104445}who comes of his own free will... 
{104446}{104521}perfectly prepared,|humbly soliciting... 
{104522}{104633}to be admitted into|the my steries and privileges.
{104634}{104713}In all cases of danger and distress... 
{104714}{104772}in whom do you put your trust?
{104773}{104816}In God.
{104817}{104910}How did he find out about|the unfortunate and her child?
{104911}{104969}Well, he has|that kind of cleverness... 
{104970}{105039}you'll sometimes find|in the middle classes.
{105040}{105151}A cheap sort of intelligence,|but effective nevertheless.
{105152}{105242}Hmm. Thank God that's not|something you're burdened by.
{105243}{105290}Yes, thank God.
{105291}{105358}Recite the solemn oath.
{105359}{105410}Never to reveal our secrets... 
{105411}{105472}under no less a penalty than... 
{105473}{105536}my throat be cut across... 
{105537}{105606}my tongue be torn out by its root... 
{105607}{105681}and that I be buried in sand... 
{105682}{105770}a cable's length from shore.
{105771}{105835}You don't think Gull|is confiding in him, do you?
{105836}{105924}The old fellow isn't as far gone|as all that, is he?
{105925}{106032}No. He's not that foolish.
{106107}{106224}Let the brother receive the light.
{106545}{106660}'Another beautiful|murder will be committed by me."
{106661}{106720}"Fear me. Jack the Ripper."
{106721}{106802}- They're rubbish, you know that.|- Yes, I agree. They're rubbish.
{106803}{106898}Though why you persist in believing that|red-haired jezebel, I'll never know.
{106899}{106978}Have you considered that she's the sort|of woman who likes to make up stories... 
{106979}{107026}particularly about men?
{107027}{107157}She is, after all, a whore.|She's a woman who... 
{107158}{107281}"A rose by any other name."|Is that it?
{107297}{107377}Frederick, my dear chum, no one|is more delighted than I am... 
{107378}{107450}that you've decided to resume|your interest in the fairer sex... 
{107451}{107500}but please remember... 
{107501}{107570}a woman like that can make a man feel|whatever she wants him to feel.
{107571}{107626}- Sergeant Godley.|- Yes, sir.
{107627}{107666}Arrest the Nichol Street gang.
{107667}{107725}- Right away, Inspector.|- I tried to stop them, Inspector.
{107726}{107786}This arrived with this afternoon's post.
{107787}{107834}Open it up!
{107835}{107926}"I send you half the kidney I took|from one woman, preserved for you.
{107927}{108023}T'other piece I fried and ate.|It was very nice."
{108024}{108096}We demand something be done,|and done tonight.
{108097}{108166}"From Hell."
{108167}{108234}Well, at least|they got the address right.
{108235}{108313}It can't be.|Are you sure he was the same?
{108314}{108383}I know him.|I posed for him twice meself.
{108384}{108460}I stood there naked as a babe|watching him paint me for hours.
{108461}{108517}And he was with Ann for what...|over a year?
{108518}{108609}- Nearly two.
{108635}{108701}Ah, here you are.|Hello, girls.
{108702}{108762}Where have you been?|I told you to wait for me.
{108763}{108841}I can't stay in a pub|and not have a drink.
{108842}{108912}That's cruel.|But look who I bumped into.
{108913}{108993}Remember Ada?
{108994}{109106}- She's from France.|- Bruxelles.
{109107}{109162}- Bruxelles.|- Yes.
{109163}{109250}Oh, she is pretty, isn't she?
{109251}{109338}Not in public, love.|Not in public.
{109339}{109421}Would you give us a minute alone?|We need to speak with Liz.
{109422}{109507}No, Ada, you stay where you are.
{109508}{109557}Come, Mary.|Get a drinksy.
{109558}{109641}- Mary.
{109830}{109900}You don't have to worry|about Nichol Street for at least a week.
{109901}{109971}- I can keep 'em that long.|- Well, that's something, anyway.
{109972}{110033}- Thank you.|- Yeah.
{110034}{110120}- Baby Alice, she's all right?|- Yeah, she's all right.
{110121}{110168}We'll get her out after this is over.
{110169}{110217}"We'll get her."
{110218}{110266}Listen.
{110267}{110336}I want you and your friends off the|streets until I can sort this thing out.
{110337}{110404}- Off the streets? For how long?|- A few days, at least.
{110405}{110452}Well, you better|throw us in jail then... 
{110453}{110518}'cause we have no money for food|and no money for a doss.
{110519}{110588}All right. You take this.
{110589}{110656}Buy some food,|get a room and stay there.
{110657}{110749}Don't tell anyone where you're going.|I don't want to know.
{110750}{110829}In three days, come to the Ten Bells.
{110830}{110952}I'll leave a message|with the barkeep.
{110962}{111041}What? It's not enough?
{111042}{111150}I wish I could show you|the little village where I was born.
{111151}{111206}It's so lovely there.
{111207}{111297}It's by the sea,|the way you said you saw me.
{111298}{111375}I used to think it too small|to spend a life in... 
{111376}{111481}but now I'm not so sure.
{111575}{111630}Don't. Don't.
{111631}{111718}What? Do you think|I'm paying you back?
{111719}{111781}I didn't mean it as business.
{111782}{111844}I'm still a woman.|They haven't taken that away from me.
{111845}{111941}Not yet, anyways.
{112195}{112274}- Enough of that.
{112275}{112381}Now, lad, at least take... 
{112387}{112475}Sorry, sir.
{112891}{113002}There, milady.|One more time.
{113055}{113143}And curtsy.
{113146}{113239}And we're done.
{113423}{113565}Oh, don't be modest, girl.|They don't care what we do.
{113706}{113769}I paid for your supper, remember.
{113770}{113837}Stop shaking your head at me,|you slag!
{113838}{113885}Leave her alone.
{113886}{113936}She is my business.|She's not yours.
{113937}{113984}Liz, just be quiet for one bloody night.
{113985}{114035}No, I fucking won't keep my voice down!
{114036}{114083}Calm down!|They'll call the land lord on us.
{114084}{114133}Don't go out.|It's not safe.
{114134}{114204}I need something to sustain myself.
{114205}{114260}- I will be right back.|- Liz, don't be so fucking stupid!
{114261}{114320}- Do without for a night.|- No.
{114321}{114435}- I want a fucking drink.|- Liz!
{114457}{114523}Here we are.|Service records.
{114524}{114651}Grenadier Guards.|Lieutenant Benjamin Kidney.
{114652}{114763}There, just as you suspected.
{114766}{114814}Before he joined Special Branch... 
{114815}{114872}Ben Kidney served|in the Grenadier Guards.
{114873}{114963}Part of his duties included|assisting the field surgeon.
{114964}{115030}Let me tell you something, Inspector,|of which I'm absolutely certain.
{115031}{115130}Assisting an expert is different...|very, very different... 
{115131}{115178}from doing it oneself.
{115179}{115246}Think about it. Someone's|gotta clean up after the prince.
{115247}{115325}And whose job is it|to take care of the widow's messes?
{115326}{115382}You've turned into Othello.|Do you know that?
{115383}{115434}Everything is a suspicion.
{115435}{115470}And like that tragic Moor... 
{115471}{115527}all your suspicions|will end up in your own demise.
{115528}{115606}For heaven's sake, man,|these women aren't just being silenced.
{115607}{115696}They're being murdered most brutally.|Why would Ben Kidney do that?
{115697}{115774}To scare people.|To keep their mind off the real point.
{115775}{115805}Which is?
{115806}{115861}Think what's at stake|for Special Branch.
{115862}{115946}Prince Edward married Ann Crook,|a commoner and a Catholic.
{115947}{116013}Married her in a Catholic church.|They had a baby.
{116014}{116121}A legitimate baby, who is, in fact,|heir to the throne of England.
{116122}{116178}All these women were there.
{116179}{116280}All these women|were eyewitnesses to an event... 
{116281}{116401}that could rip the empire to pieces.
{116515}{116597}When she starts drinking,|she'll go all night. You know that.
{116598}{116649}But she knows how dangerous it is.
{116650}{116703}She don't believe you|about the prince.
{116704}{116865}She thinks you're feeding that copper|candies to keep him interested.
{116966}{117019}Hello, sir.
{117020}{117087}Is anything wrong, my dear?
{117088}{117192}No, sir. For a moment,|I thought you were someone else.
{117193}{117258}Oh.
{117259}{117344}Thirsty?
{117475}{117553}Always parched, sir.
{117554}{117630}Perhaps there is somewhere nearby|that we might go... 
{117631}{117720}while my coach man keeps watch.
{117721}{117790}Oh, yeah.
{117791}{117864}Yeah. This way.
{117865}{117952}Follow me.
{118588}{118701}Yeah, it's this way.|Follow me.
{118754}{118826}I dropped my grapes.
{118827}{118905}Oh!
{119139}{119217}No!
{119314}{119441}What the fuck|are you looking at, Lipski?
{119467}{119563}Shut up! Shut up!
{120092}{120152}- I hear someone coming, sir.
{120153}{120235}- Sir!
{120741}{120813}All right, George, that's enough.
{120814}{120878}It's one of them, isn't it?
{120879}{120934}Throat's cut the same way.
{120935}{120990}Yeah.
{120991}{121050}He didn't finish.
{121051}{121145}Well, she's no less dead for that.
{121146}{121258}He won't be satisfied by this.
{121303}{121385}Wilkins?
{121386}{121508}Fetch the ambulance.|Go on, run along.
{122507}{122602}Excuse me, miss.
{123543}{123638}You could be dead... right now.
{123639}{123775}But then there would be|too many bloody questions.
{123792}{123882}Ignore the old man's blathering.|Find a scape goat.
{123883}{123958}Or next time we won't care who asks... 
{123959}{124087}"Whatever happened|to Inspector Abberline?"
{124667}{124776}We should hurry up, sir.|It's clearin' up.
{124777}{124858}Do you have a piece of chalk, Netley?
{124859}{124906}Chalk, sir?
{124907}{125032}- They found another one in Mitre Square!
{125262}{125375}Bastards! They did another one!
{125490}{125586}I heard he cut off her nose this time.
{125587}{125672}Nice work, Inspector. You've|encouraged him to do two a night now.
{125673}{125783}Out of the fucking way, cunt.
{125927}{125992}Katherine Eddowes.
{125993}{126052}There's some writing on a wall|just down the road there.
{126053}{126138}You should have a look at it.
{126139}{126243}"The 'Juwes' are the men|that will not be blamed for nothing."
{126244}{126366}It's hardly Shakespeare, but it'll do.
{126374}{126422}I was busy with the children... 
{126423}{126492}Madame, slow down. Slow down.
{126493}{126620}Make sure you get|the apron as well, yeah?
{126810}{126868}It was written by the killer, sir.
{126869}{126926}And how do you know that?
{126927}{127026}I was here three-quarters|of an hour ago.
{127027}{127088}This building... mostly Jews|live here, is that right?
{127089}{127157}- Yeah, that's right.|- Ready now, sir.
{127158}{127270}Put that away and get out of here|immediately.
{127271}{127318}- Abberline.|- Yeah?
{127319}{127353}Wash that off.
{127354}{127397}- What?|- You heard me.
{127398}{127464}- It's evidence, sir.|- Listen to me.
{127465}{127572}In another hour, there will be|a thousand people poking about in here.
{127573}{127661}If those words are seen,|not a Jew in London will be safe.
{127662}{127746}We'll have may hem on the streets.|So wash it off!.
{127747}{127858}That's an educated hand, sir.|An educated man wrote that.
{127859}{127945}- Look for yourself.|- I don't have to look. I've seen it.
{127946}{128034}An educated man|knows how to spell "Jews."
{128035}{128091}I don't know what this refers to,|but I'm sure it's got nothing to do... 
{128092}{128213}with the people who live around here.
{128229}{128333}Sergeant, I want two constables|to wash that off.
{128334}{128448}What are you looking to him for?|Wash it off!.
{128449}{128535}Yes, sir.
{128537}{128605}Half a dozen men have seen it already.|The sergeant has copied it down.
{128606}{128679}I'll remember these words|for as long as I live.
{128680}{128769}So all you're doing|is destroying its value as evidence.
{128770}{128838}No, all I'm doing is taking|charge of an investigation... 
{128839}{128920}that you have bungled|to the point of gross inefficiency... 
{128921}{128974}and I've had enough.
{128975}{129068}You are suspended from duty, Abberline.
{129069}{129168}Inspector Abberline is suspended.
{129169}{129302}- All his privileges are cancelled.|- Yes, sir.
{129620}{129690}You've not seen her, then?
{129691}{129809}Well, if she comes around,|give her this.
{129810}{129895}Long letter, eh?
{129896}{129970}This is for your trouble.
{129971}{130034}The letter's private.|You understand?
{130035}{130140}- I understand.|- Right.
{131295}{131386}Where's this?
{131454}{131510}Recite the solemn oath.
{131511}{131622}Never to reveal our secrets... 
{132036}{132116}Grapes again.
{132117}{132168}Why grapes?
{132169}{132216}This ain't killing for profit.
{132217}{132270}- He's not that foolish.|- You oughta be botherin' McQueen.
{132271}{132412}- Are you questioning my decision?|- Find a scape goat.
{132415}{132508}This is ritual.
{134116}{134221}"Jubela, Jubelo, Jubelum."
{134265}{134350}"Juwes."
{135042}{135133}- It's me, Ada. Me. Only me.
{135134}{135246}I bring everything for supper.
{135257}{135328}You little thief.|I need this money.
{135329}{135404}I just take some money|and buy food for me and for you.
{135405}{135476}Is that bad, Marie?
{135477}{135550}It's fine, dear.|You're a good person, but listen.
{135551}{135645}Until I go away from London,|it's not safe for you to go out.
{135646}{135715}Understand?
{135716}{135806}I stay with Marie.|Beautiful Marie.
{135807}{135894}It's all right, darling.|You don't have to pay for your food.
{135895}{135978}Pardon?
{136012}{136112}Here's to our feast.
{136891}{136988}I'm so sorry to greet you|like this, Inspector, but... 
{136989}{137036}but I'm rather late|for an appointment.
{137037}{137089}Will you excuse me|if I finish dressing while we talk?
{137090}{137137}No, no. Please, go on.
{137138}{137216}Thank you.
{137217}{137349}I'd like to speak to you about|the Freemasons if I might, sir.
{137350}{137463}The arrangement of the coins|at Dark Annie's feet... 
{137464}{137577}and also the locations of the bodies... 
{137578}{137626}form a pentacle star.
{137627}{137702}A pentacle star is a symbol|of the Freemasons, is it not, sir?
{137703}{137783}Yes.
{137796}{137937}And the way that all these women were|killed... throats cut left to right... 
{137938}{138030}organs removed.
{138031}{138154}They're reenactments,|aren't they, sir?
{138155}{138202}Reenactments of what?
{138203}{138282}The Juwes.
{138283}{138345}The traitors who killed Hiram Abiff,|founder of the Masons... 
{138346}{138411}that's how they were executed.
{138412}{138510}Ah, yes.|So the great book tells us.
{138511}{138644}So Jack the Ripper|isn't just merely killing whores.
{138645}{138692}He's executing traitors.
{138693}{138770}He's a Mason fulfilling a duty.
{138771}{138833}Yes, I'm afraid, Inspector... 
{138834}{138884}that you won't be permitted|to arrest him.
{138885}{138993}I don't want to arrest him.
{139024}{139093}The Ripper has|one more traitor yet to kill... 
{139094}{139194}and I will stop him.
{139278}{139338}Did they come to you, sir... 
{139339}{139430}as a loyal Mason?
{139431}{139591}Did they ask you to help them cover up|the prince's secret marriage?
{139604}{139658}That's how it started, yes.
{139659}{139775}And then you discovered|the prince had syphilis.
{139776}{139881}He's going to die of it, Inspector.
{139882}{140012}Would you like a tour|of the syphilis wards?
{140026}{140144}You're a physician ordinary|to the queen... 
{140145}{140237}entrusted with the well-being|of the heir to the throne.
{140238}{140303}Only you... 
{140304}{140387}had reason to believe|that these unfortunates... 
{140388}{140443}these whores... 
{140444}{140542}these... traitors... 
{140543}{140651}destroyed your life's work.
{140805}{140889}Below the skin of history... 
{140890}{140938}are London's veins.
{140939}{141071}These symbols...|the mitre, the pentacle star... 
{141075}{141136}even someone as ignorant... 
{141137}{141225}and degenerate as you... 
{141226}{141364}can sense that they course|with energy and meaning.
{141416}{141496}I am that meaning.
{141497}{141593}I am that energy.
{141763}{141870}One day, men will look back... 
{141871}{141997}and say I gave birth|to the 20th century.
{142118}{142244}You're not going to see|the 20th century.
{143167}{143265}Roll up his sleeve.
{143306}{143402}- Don't struggle.
{143415}{143533}You'll only make this more painful.
{145451}{145551}You all right, mate?
{148444}{148514}- Dr. Gull.|- Yes!
{148515}{148614}You were describing|the human heart.
{148615}{148694}Yes.
{148695}{148762}Yes.
{148763}{148826}The human heart... 
{148827}{148926}is a dense and powerful muscle... 
{148927}{149028}much like the organic|equivalent of mahogany.
{149029}{149114}And notoriously difficult... 
{149115}{149200}to burn.
{149238}{149322}About the size of a fist... 
{149323}{149445}it provides the motor power|for the circulatory system.
{149446}{149538}The heart contains two atria,|two ventricles... 
{149539}{149613}and four valves.
{149614}{149710}It is, in effect, a single pump... 
{149711}{149818}powering a double circuit.
{149826}{149977}In the adult the heart rate|averages 70 to 80 beats a minute.
{150008}{150096}Such is the force|of the heartbeat... 
{150097}{150245}that if the body's largest artery,|the aorta, is severed... 
{150257}{150364}- a six-foot jet of blood... 
{150365}{150455}is released.
{151234}{151351}Let the brother receive the light.
{151391}{151499}For you fear no God, arise.
{151538}{151646}Your faith is well founded.
{152547}{152613}Don't. Don't go in there.|There's no need.
{152614}{152683}How bad is it?
{152684}{152759}She's-She's in pieces, sir.
{152760}{152863}Sergeant, he can go in.
{153114}{153186}- Give him to me!|- He'll be taken care of, I swear to it.
{153187}{153269}- I want him.|- He's done. I give you my word.
{153270}{153373}Fuck your word! I'll bring every|last one of you fucking cunts down.
{153374}{153421}You and your fucking brothers!
{153422}{153466}Now, listen to me, Abberline.
{153467}{153526}Your situation...|your difficult situation... 
{153527}{153573}has been thoroughly discussed.
{153574}{153705}You are reinstated.|Indeed, you are promoted.
{153719}{153769}- No! No.
{153770}{153840}Come on. This is not helping anything.|Come on! Come on.
{153841}{153926}Don't be a fool, Inspector.
{153927}{154023}You will be very closely watched.
{154024}{154071}Yeah, you're all there now, ain't ya?
{154072}{154120}Where were you|when this was happening?
{154121}{154197}It's all right for you, standing|around there chatting. What about us?
{154198}{154274}Inspector Abberline is in charge.
{154275}{154400}Give him all the assistance|he requires.
{154503}{154550}No!
{154551}{154620}Remember, you're being watched.
{154621}{154685}All right, come on, you men.|Clear this passage.
{154686}{154816}- Come on. Move 'em away.|- Move back! Back!
{154942}{155052}Shall we proceed, Inspector?
{155465}{155532}Body lies in middle of bed.
{155533}{155657}Shoulders flat,|but axis of body inclined toward right.
{155658}{155710}The left arm is close to the body... 
{155711}{155757}the forearm flexed at a right angle... 
{155758}{155825}resting across the abdomen.
{155826}{155940}The right arm|is slightly abducted from the body.
{155941}{156006}It rests on the mattress|with the elbow bent... 
{156007}{156102}and the forearm supine.
{156103}{156210}The fingers are clenched,|indicating a struggle as she died.
{156211}{156295}Notice something, Inspector?
{156296}{156363}No.
{156364}{156451}No, go on.
{156530}{156577}Came in not long before dawn.
{156578}{156695}A bit of a rush.|Left this for ya.
{156835}{156887}I know you asked me to wait.
{156888}{157005}If I'm to be murdered,|I'd like at least to die in my village.
{157006}{157077}I'm going to the orphanage|to collect Baby Alice.
{157078}{157142}Here's an address where you can find us.
{157143}{157190}We'll wait for you eagerly.
{157191}{157250}I know... I know in my heart... 
{157251}{157312}we can be happy living by the sea... 
{157313}{157377}just as you saw.
{157378}{157444}I hope to be with you soon, dearest.
{157445}{157542}All my love, Mary.
{157790}{157793}We are deeply distressed, Lord Hallsham.
{157794}{157870}We are deeply distressed, Lord Hallsham.
{157871}{157994}We asked Sir William to remove a threat|to our family and to our throne... 
{157995}{158081}not to engage|in these ghastly rituals.
{158082}{158186}Oh, no, of course not, Your Majesty.|That was unexpected.
{158187}{158257}On the other hand,|he has fulfilled his duties.
{158258}{158318}The threat is passed, Your Majesty.
{158319}{158414}In his way Sir William has been loyal... 
{158415}{158478}and we are grateful for that.
{158479}{158542}The rest is in your hands,|Lord Hallsham.
{158543}{158654}We wish to hear nothing further of this.
{158655}{158712}Knight of the East... 
{158713}{158773}we are gathered here|beneath the God of love... 
{158774}{158872}and before the sight of|the Great Architect to judge this case.
{158873}{158996}You stand accused of mayhems that have|placed our brotherhood in jeopardy.
{158997}{159086}You stand before your peers...|Masons and doctors both.
{159087}{159193}- I have no peers present here.|- What?
{159194}{159282}No man amongst you|is fit to judge... 
{159283}{159357}the mighty art that I have wrought.
{159358}{159450}Your rituals are empty oaths|you neither understand... 
{159451}{159541}nor live by.
{159574}{159652}The Great Architect speaks to me.
{159653}{159788}He is the balance where my deeds|are weighed and judged... 
{159789}{159836}not you.
{159837}{159889}Knight of the East... 
{159890}{159988}hear our judgement.
{161161}{161284}Well, they're not watching you anymore.
{161331}{161413}I'm telling you, it's safe to go to her.
{161414}{161461}They think she's dead.
{161462}{161540}If I disappear or|change my routine suddenly... 
{161541}{161610}they might wonder why.
{161611}{161657}You know who you're gonna|turn into, don't you?
{161658}{161741}That boring old bugger in the pub|that nobody wants to sit beside.
{161742}{161793}'Cause as soon as he's had|a few drinks, he goes on and on... 
{161794}{161845}about the girl that got away.
{161846}{161970}Do you want to live|the rest of your life like a ghost?
{161971}{162049}No.
{162055}{162138}What I want is to go to her.
{162139}{162214}But at the slightest hint that she's|a live, they will spare no expense... 
{162215}{162289}no expense and no trouble.
{162290}{162400}So I stay... and watch them.
{163274}{163355}Alice! Alice!
{163356}{163452}Come in, darling.
{163519}{163612}Coming, Mother.
{164614}{164686}Get up.
{164687}{164782}Get up! Come on.
Bets around, bets around.
Let's go, Jameson.
Everybody in? Atkins, Atkins?
Oh, come on, man, let's go.
No, man, your sister didn't send me that check yet.
No, this is how you play the...
This is how you play Texas Hold 'em.
You just told us how to play it!
This is how you play Texas Hold ‘em.
Will you flip another card.
This is the fourth fucking...
- Four of a kind.
- What do you got, Melvin?
Yo, Melvin, man, what you gonna do, you gonna play the cards or you gonna hatch them?
I ain't gonna hatch them. I need to run out to the ATM real quick.
There's gotta be a...
Gotta be a 7-Eleven out there somewhere.
Let me get two.
So why don't we just go directly in.
Right up this route, straight in.
Yes, well, I see the captain enjoys the road less traveled.
No, the captain enjoys not going down the highway, dragging his ass so every Tom, Dick and Qaddafi can take a whack at it.
It's very bad here.
It's bad here, it's still bad here.
And I've heard it's bad right down here.
- Bad everywhere, huh?
- Yeah.
Mines?
Tricky. Swedish-made.
The man didn't say anything about mines to me.
Sergeant Shaw.
- Sergeant.
- Sir.
Rolling in two minutes.
Yes, sir.
You okay?
Yes, sir.
Two minutes.
Yo, give me two cards, man.
Captain says we're moving out.
So...
Hey, that cat needs a friend.
And a hug.
It was just before Desert Storm.
We were on a routine recon
inside Iraqi-controlled terrain,
assessing enemy troop strength
for what Saddam Hussein promised
would be the mother of all wars.
I'm in the lead vehicle
with Sergeant Shaw
and our guide, a civilian contractor.
The night is clear.
Stars, but no moon.
Ambush!
Hang on.
Exit the vehicle.
On me! On me!
Get a flare up, sergeant.
Enemy dismount! Go after, go after!
Stay left!
Covering, covering, covering!
Bear right!
Move it, move it, move it!
Captain Marco!
Sir?
Was you scared?
Scared? Well...
...there was really no time to be scared.
With complete disregard
for his own life,
Sergeant Raymond Shaw
engaged single-handedly
an entire company of the enemy.
Sergeant Shaw was awarded the Medal of Honor.
I signed the recommendation myself.
Yes, sir.
Were you wounded?
I was, I was injured.
Concussion, lost focus.
Sergeant Shaw, he took command.
Major?
- Yes.
- Did your unit sustain any casualties?
Yes. PFC Edward Ingram,
PFC Robert Baker III were killed.
Now, the Medal of Honor,
Congressional Medal of Honor, is the highest award that any soldier could aspire to.
What these brave men that I've talked about today did should never be forgotten.
Since 1917, there have only been
970 Medals awarded, out of a total of 30 million
Americans at arms.
Who knows.
Maybe one day, one of you fine young men will earn that medal in defense of this great nation.
Yes.
Major Marco, on behalf of Troops 1094 and 1128, just wanna thank you for coming to speak to us about the Medal of Honor and about your interesting experiences in the armed forces.
Thanks for listening.
Thank you very much.
You ever wish it had been you?
I'm sorry, excuse me?
Won the Medal.
Been... Been the hero.
Well, sir, I'm just...
I'm just proud that I was there.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
- Major Marco?
- Yes.
Al Melvin, sir.
Corporal Melvin.
From your unit, Desert Storm.
Corporal Melvin. How you doing?
I have these dreams, sir.
- Dreams?
- Yes, sir.
Kuwait. It's you and me,
Ingram and Baker and...
...Raymond Shaw.
Okay.
See, I remember it happened like you just said, and then...
...I don't.
Well...
...we had it pretty rough over there, Melvin.
That was a long time ago.
Memories shift.
Do you have dreams, sir?
Everybody has dreams, corporal.
No, not these.
No, I don't.
I write it all down.
You know, like, every night, right when I wake up,
I try to get it down.
It doesn't always come together, you know, not everything that I can remember.
Maybe you should go to the V.A. Hospital, talk to one of the doctors.
- I've been to doctors, man.
- Okay.
I'm just... I'm just...
I'm just a little stuck, sir.
Because I remember, okay, Shaw...
Shaw, okay...
Shaw saving us, right...
...but that doesn't make sense, because...
...that should've been you.
Okay, if Shaw is in the Hummer...
...the Toyota is here...
All right. Just get up, get up.
Listen, it's...
That's over with. That's done.
Okay? You gotta move on.
What I was hoping is that, you know, maybe...
You need some money or something?
- No, no, sir.
- Wait a minute.
I don't need your money, man.
All right. It was great to see you.
Paper or plastic, sir?
With public anxiety being rekindled
by the events of Bloody Friday,
with the war on terror continuing into
yet another year, no end in sight,
the worries just continue to grow.
Polls indicate that
more and more voters
are concerned with
personal family safety,
with economic security,
fearing more and more jobs
going overseas
or being taken by
illegal immigrants.
They're concerned with the quality
of air and our water,
the degradation caused by the
rollback in environmental regulations,
by religious and racial polarization,
with the drumbeat of body bags
coming from all over the globe.
The American people are ready
for a new agenda.
But because this party is so
divided on so many issues,
the choice of a vice presidential
nominee may very well be
the unifying factor for delegates
at this convention.
And if this respect propels me
toward the nomination
as your vice presidential candidate,
I will be greatly honored.
We need to look inward,
attend to our own house.
The danger to our country is not only
from some terrorists at large,
terrorists who, by the way,
we've helped engender
with 20 years
of failed foreign policy.
No, the real danger
is from suspending civil liberties,
gutting the Bill of Rights,
allowing our fear
to destroy our democratic ideals,
because once we start overturning
our constitutional protections,
our enemies have won.
Raymond?
- There he is.
- Darling.
What, were you gonna make me stand out there like room service?
I asked downstairs and Miss Freeman, your wrangler, helpful Miss Freeman, she said you were up here practicing your speech.
I don't honestly understand why you insist upon isolating yourself, Raymond.
People adore you, they crave your company, and yet here you are, holed up as if you were some sort of emotionally challenged individual like your father.
Shut up, Tom.
Instead of Raymond Prentiss Shaw, handsome, intelligent, people-loving war hero with a great deal to offer his party.
- No.
- And his country.
No.
- No, what?
- No.
I haven't even asked you a question yet.
No to the question you're going to ask.
No to all of the questions you pretend to want to ask.
Your hair is too flat.
And no, you may not engage in your usual backdoor
And that tie... political thuggery to shovel me onto the presidential ticket.
Tie's wrong. Something less busy.
Oh, you're not interested.
Of course I'm interested.
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.
But not if it means attacking the reputation of a statesman like Tom Jordan, which I am sure was part of your plan.
Excuse me, when have I ever attacked Senator Jordan, despite...
Despite what?
Despite the shameful way his daughter toyed with you that summer at the shore.
You chased her away, Mother, let's not have any illusions about...
She wasn't in your league, but if that's the way you choose to remember it...
You destroyed any possibility of us ever...
Honey, you are oversimplifying things a little bit, but it's okay.
I'll stay out of it.
You have my word.
Thank you. Thank you.
I think you all know my mother,
Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw.
And some of you, no doubt,
remember my father,
the late Senator John Shaw.
I've been honored to serve
my two terms in Congress.
But I also grew up on the Hill.
I've seen how the game is played
by professionals,
how deals are struck,
committees bullied,
agendas bought and sold.
And with apologies to my mother,
I wish to remain an amateur.
I believe democracy
is not negotiable.
I believe that freedom from fear
in the world at large and here at home
is not negotiable.
I know how much Americans
have to fear today.
But I can tell you
that I've been there.
I've faced the enemy firsthand
on the battlefront.
I know what it is to be afraid.
But I am living proof
that we can win.
We can prevail.
We must secure tomorrow today.
Thank you.
- Bluffing?
- That was the inference.
They should be down on their fat, white knees, thanking me for saving this party from committing political seppuku.
You gave them every opportunity to do the right thing, senator.
No. I gave them one opportunity and that was unusually generous of me.
See if you can get ahold of
Bob Arthur, because I'm gonna wanna meet with him.
Thank you very much for arranging this.
- I appreciate it.
- Sure.
- Mr. Secretary.
- Senator.
Thank you very much for taking this meeting.
- Good to see you again.
- Leona. So nice to see you, Leona.
Buddy. Gentlemen.
No, I thought we settled it this morning.
All right, I'll keep you posted.
The decision is final.
Thank you very much.
- How's Jeanine?
- Senator.
Tom Jordan's on the ticket.
Now, we don't need your blessing, but we'd like it.
Okay, so before we get started,
I'm just...
I'm dying to know...
...which genius hatched the idea of pairing a sound bite from Nebraska with a relic who thinks that keeping suicide bombers off our buses is unconstitutional.
Was it you, Gordy?
All the research indicates that an Arthur-Jordan ticket sits quite well with the American people.
"Sits quite well" translates into how many votes?
Your son is largely unknown outside of New York.
I mean, his public service, his congressional record, while commendable, is not the kind of thing...
My son is a war hero.
Governor Arthur has agreed to consider Raymond for a cabinet-level post.
We didn't come here to have a discussion.
Did we come here to have a discussion?
Ellie, you don't have the votes to block this.
Not even to push the nomination to a second ballot.
Oh, Jim, even running against this cut-and-fold vice president, with his party's record of abysmal failure at home and abroad,
Governor Arthur is still unelectable to the presidency...
...without help.
Consider, that our intrepid Arthur can hold on to his own home ground, and the Northeast, and even California, we are still dead across the South.
He's not dead completely in the South, senator...
And the Southwest, where they win by landslides.
I mean, you know this.
Your focus groups, your polls all tell you this.
They back me up, right?
Now, you're counting on
Tom Jordan to help you get the black vote, women and college kids.
My gut instinct says he won't, and on Arthur to somehow hold the centre, where he is soft at best.
We're confident this is a winning ticket, Ellie.
What's your margin of error, Vaughn?
Five points?
Three?
I can swing that, and you know it.
Oh, I could swing seven away from you.
That's more than enough to split the ticket.
And deny us the White House another four years? No.
No, not even you.
Not even you, senator, will do that, you are bluffing.
Oh, no, no, no, senator,
I would and I will and I will do whatever is necessary to protect America from anyone who opposes her.
I can't...
Am I the only person in this room who's been reading these NSA reports?
- I've read them.
- All right, then you know, you know we are on the brink of another cataclysm, probably nuclear, on our own soil.
Oh, Ellie, that's a bit extreme.
And it's not from random terrorists, but from covert alliances of disaffected nations who have all been made bold by this kind of Jordan one-worlder who believes that human beings are essentially good and that our power is somehow,
I don't know, shameful or evil or never to be used.
Make no mistake, the American people are terrified.
They know something's coming.
They can feel it.
And we can either shovel them the same old shit and call it sugar or we can arm them.
We can arm them with a young, vibrant vice president.
We can give them heat, energy, give them a war hero with heart, forged by enemy fire in the desert in the dark, when American lives hung in the balance.
Give us a few minutes.
Thank you.
Mr. Secretary, thank you for your time.
- Thank you.
- Really appreciate it.
- Leona, good evening.
- Thank you, Ellie.
Well, they're gonna have to make their own decisions.
I am proud...
... to offer into nomination
the name of the next vice president
of these United States:
Raymond Shaw!
A remarkable development.
Twenty-four hours ago,
New York Congressman
Raymond Prentiss Shaw
wasn't even being mentioned
as a possible candidate
for the vice presidential nomination
four years from now,
much less this current convention.
Some incredible news
from the convention floor tonight.
Like a long shot
catching the favorite
on the back stretch
of the Kentucky Derby,
Raymond Shaw has overtaken
Senator Thomas Jordan
to gain the vice presidential
nomination.
Raymond Shaw bears the lineage
of the fabled Prentiss family dynasty.
Grandson of legendary industrialist
and diplomat Tyler Prentiss,
son of controversial
Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw,
who took over the seat
vacated by her husband,
the esteemed John Shaw,
when he died tragically
over 20 years ago.
For many, Raymond Prentiss Shaw
is an enigma.
The millionaire
Harvard honors student
who enlisted in the infantry,
refusing the officer's commission
to which he was entitled.
Media-shy and reclusive,
Raymond Shaw's life
was forever changed
on the killing fields of Kuwait,
where he won the Congressional
Medal of Honor for combat bravery.
Two members of Sergeant Shaw's
famed "Lost Patrol,"
PFC Edward Ingram
and PFC Robert Baker III,
were killed.
Their guide, a civilian contractor,
disappeared in the ambush.
But Sergeant Shaw
heroically fought off the enemy
and guided the shell-shocked
survivors of the Lost Patrol
across hostile terrain to safety.
Raymond Shaw is probably
the kindest, bravest, warmest...
Most selfless human being
I've ever known.
The celebrated war hero,
who dedicated himself to
public service after Desert Storm.
The Medal of Honor winner, beloved
by the men of the Lost Patrol.
He quickly turned his energies
to public service
in his adopted state of New York.
- The revolutionary science
of biogenetics,
which has literally transformed...
Captain Marco!
The revolutionary science
of biogenetics.
The revolutionary science of biogenetics, which has literally transformed...
- Captain Marco!
- Raymond Shaw is the most selfless human being I've ever known.
Raymond Shaw is probably the kindest, bravest, warmest...
Yet note the complexity of the frontal lobe.
Nevertheless...
Captain.
Help me.
Sergeant Shaw.
Captain.
Suffocate Private Baker. Kill him.
Raymond Shaw is probably
the kindest, bravest, warmest,
most selfless human being
I've ever known.
Raymond Shaw...
Excellent, excellent.
Go on, Raymond.
Good, good, Raymond.
Raymond Shaw is probably
the kindest, bravest,
warmest, most selfless
human being I've ever known.
No offence, major...
...but it sort of chaps my ass that we have to have a babysitter.
I'm just here to make sure you don't get cornered by some Air Force general's unhappy wife.
Major Marco, we should be so lucky.
- So nice to meet you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Nice to meet you.
Raymond Shaw.
Major Marco, this army of two are gonna do some recon at the no-host bar.
- A failed foreign policy which has only served to galvanize our enemies.
Excuse me, please.
In fact, mobilizing an ersatz army of malcontents...
- General Sloan, you lead the charge.
- Absolutely.
William. Hi, how are you?
All right, good.
Have you met my wife, Pam?
- Hello, how are you?
- Hello, Bob Arthur.
I mean, isn't that supposed to be the point of this great country of ours, that everybody matters.
Not just the people at this party.
But perhaps more importantly, those who can't afford to be here.
- Raymond. Sorry to interrupt.
- Excuse me.
- Bob. You know my daughter.
- Tom, I can't believe it.
Of course.
Jocelyn, good to see you again.
- Mark.
- Eleanor.
Raymond, your granddad would be so goddamn proud of you.
Thank you, Mr. Whiting.
Raymond, this is J.B. Johnston, from Manchurian Global.
- Hi. How are you?
- Pleasure.
And David Donovan, their managing director.
And co-chair of the U.S. International Policy Caucus.
Strong supporters, congressman.
They're desperate to be of service to you, darling.
Thank you, Mother,
I think you've earned your fee.
Oh, no. My plucky idealist.
So, gentlemen, how's business?
Not bad, Raymond.
Business is not bad.
It could always be better.
Any better and you guys are gonna have more assets than the European Union.
Don't we already?
Every great society, every great civilization, always anchored by a great navy.
- Congressman Shaw.
- Thanks very much.
Nice to see you, Bob.
Thanks for coming.
Congressman.
Ben Marco.
I know. Hello, captain.
How you doing?
- I need to talk to you.
- Okay.
Oh, my God, Raymond, it's been so many years.
- And?
- And I've been married,
- I've been divorced.
- Yeah.
Well, you may have noticed
I've changed a bit myself.
No. No, that's not...
No, yes, I have noticed.
I see. It's great.
Congratulations.
My feelings haven't, though.
Changed, I mean.
What feelings? What?
Jocelyn, I have never stopped wondering how things might have turned out between us
- if my mother hadn't...
- Raymond.
Raymond, people can't just rewrite their lives.
I haven't had a relationship...
...of any consequence since we stopped seeing each other.
Doesn't that say something to you?
Yeah, that...
That you must be just about the loneliest person on this earth.
Raymond, we were kids then. It must have been, what, 15 years ago?
It was sweet, but...
Joce.
Yeah. I have to go.
- Yeah.
- Best of luck with the campaign.
Thank you.
Joce...
Sergeant Raymond Shaw.
I wanna talk to you too.
- Not now.
- Excuse me, sir.
I mean, I know you're busy, congressman...
- Don't touch me.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, it's just that, well...
Don't ever touch me.
Hello, major.
Have you tried the Pad Thai?
I'm told it rules.
What were you hoping
Congressman Shaw would say?
I don't know, sir.
It's not so much what he said or didn't say, it was more of his...
...attitude, his demeanor.
Are you taking your meds?
Lieutenant Colonel Howard, with all due respect,
I've had over a dozen years of experts telling me that I have Gulf War Syndrome,
I have post-traumatic stress disorder and every other mood disorder that you can name.
In those 12 years,
I've been a good soldier.
And I've denied what every nerve ending in my body is telling me is more real than not.
I've had one dream, not variations on a dream, the same dream.
Night after night...
No. No. I'm sorry.
You're saying that an entire squad of U.S. Army soldiers was hypnotized into believing that Raymond Shaw deserved the Medal of Honor.
And that somehow, thanks to your dream, you're the only one who knows the truth.
Major Marco, you will stay clear of Congressman Shaw.
And you are to resume your medication.
That is an order.
That will be all, major.
Somewhere right now, an
American soldier in the war on terror
is worried about his
family back home.
Somewhere right now,
in some small American town,
his grandmother is standing
in her kitchen.
She's got her medicine bottle
in one hand,
she's opening the refrigerator
with the other and she's thinking:
"I can pay for my medicine...
... or I can pay for my dinner.
I can't do both. "
I don't believe that our mothers
and grandmothers
should have to face that kind of
decision, not in this country.
I don't believe that the brave men
and women of our armed forces,
risking their lives overseas,
should have to worry
about their families back here
in America.
You see, there are some gaps
in this country...
... deep chasms
that we need to bridge.
The gap between rich and poor,
between government
and the people,
between true security
and the notion of feeling safe.
Second floor, room three, end of hall.
Between what is real...
Don't you just love this guy?
And what is not.
Tough choices are an unavoidable
element of leadership,
I would just urge the governor
to remember that
the primary responsibility
of government...
Al Melvin.
Al, it's Ben Marco.
Are you in there?
Fox is in the henhouse.
Weasel.
Weasel is...
The weasel is a weasel.
Sir, I'll be right outside.
What?
I'll be right outside, sir.
I know.
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.
- Shall I get that for you, sir?
- No.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.
You have 30 seconds, Mother.
Am I that predictable?
You have no idea.
I'm calling to compliment you,
Mr. Grumpy.
I thought you were magnificent tonight.
And so did all the network campaign experts.
And that compassionate
vigilance thing
is working quite well for you.
- I might have to convert.
- I happen to believe in it.
Oh, yes, of course you do.
- Now, Raymond...
- Good night, Mother.
Raymond? What? No, wait, wait.
- Hang on a second.
- What? Raymond?
Are you there?
Yes?
Sergeant Shaw?
Who is this?
- Sergeant Raymond Shaw?
- Yes.
Raymond Prentiss Shaw?
Yes.
Listen.
Go to the bedroom of your suite.
Enter the hallway there.
Go to the end and open the closet.
Yes, thank you.
- Hello, Raymond.
- Hello.
Do you remember me?
No, sir, I don't.
Brilliant. We've got 20 minutes for our little checkup from the neck up, gentlemen, so if we could take his jacket.
Please sit down.
No, Mr. Villalobos, I'm just...
The Army's got me gathering information on stress disorders, so I'm just...
...you know, just running statistics, trying to find out about my old team...
Well, listen. Mr. Wilson, when Nathan came home, was he preoccupied with Kuwait?
I mean, did he have nightmares or bad dreams about the firefight over there?
You'll feel a little cold as this anesthetic gel goes on.
Probe sheath...
...and probe.
Please relax.
Are you relaxed, Raymond?
Yes, sir.
Now, Raymond, I am going to drill a tiny hole in the skull, which will allow delivery of the new implant.
So, what you'll feel is a little discomfort in the form of pressure and also a loud vibrating noise in your head, all of which, of course, is completely normal.
Thank you.
Of course, as soon as this or any task is completed, you will already have forgotten that it ever actually took place.
Probe going in now.
Good.
Excellent.
Releasing implant.
There. That wasn't so bad, was it, Raymond?
No, sir.
That's good. No decay, no slippage.
Everything seems to be in flawless working condition.
Now, Raymond.
Can you remember the deaths of Private Baker and Private Ingram?
Yes, sir.
Good. Can you describe them for me, please?
We're on a routine recon
inside Iraqi-controlled terrain,
assessing troop strength.
"We're on a routine recon inside Iraqi-controlled terrain, assessing troop strength."
The mission ends without incident.
We're heading back...
"Toward the command.
The night is clear. Stars..."
The night is clear.
Stars, but no moon.
The patrol is ambushed.
We're engaged unexpectedly by
ground forces with helicopter support.
RPG incoming, mortar fire.
"Captain..."
Captain Marco is knocked unconscious.
In the ensuing firefight, Eddie Ingram gets himself separated to the left.
Baker goes after him.
An incoming mortar shell
kills them both instantly
before I am able to locate and
eliminate the source of the ordnance.
Captain. Captain Marco.
Help me.
Pardon me. Is this seat taken?
I see the captain enjoys the road less traveled.
Paper or plastic?
Oh, come on.
From the grocery store.
You know, at the checkout stand.
Paper or plastic girl, that's me.
"Paper or plastic, sir?"
I see you there all the time.
Bennett Marco.
Checks from First National Bank.
Romance novels, instant noodles,
NoDoz and tomatoes.
So anyway, I'm on vacation.
Holiday in the Big Apple and all of that.
And I saw you sitting here and I said, "Hey, why not reach out and touch someone?"
So, what, I suppose you're heading to New York City.
Yeah, yeah, I'm... Yeah.
Business? Pleasure? Both?
Well, I'm just... I got an old friend up there, an old Army friend that...
Well, he's in politics now and I'm just gonna catch up on old times with him.
I'm sorry, you said your name was?
Eugenie.
What do your friends call you?
My friends, they call me Rosie.
- Rosie?
- Yeah, see, my full name is
Eugenie Rose.
I like the Rosie part better.
Eugenie is, well...
...fragile.
Yeah, but still, when I asked you your name, you didn't say...
What did you say?
You said Eugenie.
Yeah, well...
...maybe I was feeling fragile at the time.
Are you okay?
Excuse me.
Hello, captain.
Do you remember me?
Ben.
Hey. I'm gonna get a cab.
You want me to drop you somewhere?
No, I'm okay.
Okay. So your friend's gonna meet you here, then?
No.
All right.
El Dorado 5-9970.
It's my cell phone number, in case you ever... You know.
I like to say it the old-fashioned way.
Can you remember or should I write it on your chest with a Sharpie?
- I'll remember.
- Okay.
Hey, you're kind of...
You need somewhere to go to freshen up?
Pentagon watchdogs
today accused
the private equity fund
Manchurian Global
of grossly overpricing plasma
and other critical medical supplies
during the recent
Indonesian incursion,
even as the company secured
a half-billion-dollar no-bid contract
to provide combat support services
to American soldiers
preparing to mobilize in Sri Lanka.
There you go.
Come on in.
This is my cousin's apartment.
- Is she here?
- No.
Be it ever so humble.
No place like home, right?
Believe it or not, there's a view.
Go to the fire escape and tilt your head up, you can almost see a tree.
- Can I get you something to drink?
- No, I'm fine.
I've got some dieter's tea.
It's great for your metabolism, if you're into that.
Or some tomato juice. No? All right.
Or...
...some water?
- No, thank you.
- I'm sorry.
I'm nervous.
I yak when I get nervous.
Where is she, your cousin?
She's on tour with Dreamgirls.
Hey, are you okay?
Yeah.
Look, I'm sorry about what happened earlier.
You don't have to apologize to me.
I'll make you some tea.
Jesus. Where's the lemon? Okay.
- You okay in there?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
You know, I left you some towels in there, did you see them?
- What was that?
- Dropped my bag.
Ben?
Are you okay in there?
Earth to Ben.
Yeah.
- You sure everything's all right?
- Yes.
Ben?
Ben?
Ben?
Ben.
Ben?
What are you doing?
Did you see that?
What I had in my hand.
I wasn't hallucinating, Delp.
I held it in my hand.
That's what they all say, Marco.
Some wicked shit got sprayed on you guys during Desert Storm.
Besides all the depleted uranium,
I mean.
I personally know of a couple of Rangers who swear that they see only in tertiary colors now,
- Delp.
- And can pick up sports talk radio in their cortical block if they get too close to a Con-Ed transformer.
It's not Gulf War Syndrome.
The Army did try this tiny, implantable ID thing.
You could imbed it under the skin, then scan it like a bar code for medical emergency information:
Blood type, DNA.
Well, the Army never put one in me.
That you know of, man.
That you know of.
U.S. Planes bombed selected sites
in Guinea today, acting on intelligence
that the African nation's military
regime had secretly resumed
its chemical weapons program.
The secretary of defense declined
to comment on the attack,
saying only that the mission
was successful,
targets acquired, that all American
personnel involved here
- were home safe and sound.
- Striking transportation workers...
My dreams seem more real to me than what I actually remember happening over there. It's like...
It's like somewhere along the line
I got brainwashed or something and...
I'm just, like, all scrambled up.
We have all been brainwashed, Marco.
As for somebody imbedding electric probes and computer chips in your brain to make you do things, it's horseshit, man.
A little electroshock...
...and sleep deprivation will do the trick for a fraction of the price.
Ask the Uzbeks.
What about my dreams?
What if all this is your dream...
...and you are really still back in Kuwait?
- Thanks for coming out. Thank you.
- Congressman!
- Congressman!
- Congressman!
Congressman! Congressman!
Why do you and Governor Arthur oppose deploying troops into Indonesia?
Well, Governor Arthur and I believe we can't clean up the world with dirty hands.
Sergeant Shaw!
Do you ever dream about Kuwait?
Captain Marco.
It's okay. It's okay.
Nice to see you, sir.
Good evening.
It's good to see you too.
Why did you ask me about Kuwait?
I didn't.
I asked you about your dreams.
- Thank you, Lily.
- Congressman Shaw, I'm sorry.
They wanna know if you can do an interview with Larry King at 6?
- No, no.
- No to the interview or no to 6?
No. He wants to talk about my mother. No.
- Everything under control, P. J?
- Hello, sir.
Good to see you.
So, captain, what can I do for you?
I just need a few minutes of your time.
Congressman Shaw, a moment, please?
Private time.
Unfortunately, this is as private as it gets for me now.
- I understand.
- He's all right, Will.
- Come on in.
- Thank you, thank you.
- Hey, George.
- There are these dreams that some of the men from our unit have been having.
Including you?
Well...
...it's more of a question of what actually happened the night that our patrol got attacked.
That's easy. We're on a routine recon inside Iraqi-controlled terrain.
The patrol is ambushed.
RPG incoming, mortar fire.
- You're knocked...
- Unconscious. Exactly the way...
Not to cut you off, but I mean, exactly the way that I remember it.
But I dreamed something else.
Am I in your dreams, captain?
Yes, you are, congressman.
Saving everybody?
It's a whole lot more complicated than that. Now, Corporal Melvin, he's been drawing these pictures and he wrote down what he dreams.
- Maybe if you just...
- I don't have dreams, captain.
At all? You don't dream at all?
Everybody dreams, right? I mean...
Look, captain, I'd like to help you,
I would, I really would, but I think you ought to see somebody.
- Somebody who specializes in...
- I've been to doctors.
Well, good, that's very good, because they can probably help you out a lot more than I can.
- I don't know, but...
- Take care, captain.
- Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
- Thanks for coming by.
I'm not crazy, Shaw.
Major.
- Ben. Are you hungry?
- Starving.
Well, it depends on the demographic.
Excuse me.
- I killed Baker?
- Well, it's a dream.
I mean, it could mean something else.
It could mean I'm supposed to think you did.
No, I killed the enemy.
I didn't know them either, so...
...it was okay.
And anyway, I remember what we did in Kuwait. I remember it perfectly.
I just...
...don't remember actually doing it.
Maybe you didn't do it.
No.
What a thought.
What?
Life is so bizarre, isn't it?
Which part?
I don't know.
What you saw downstairs.
This campaign. Politics.
My whole public life and persona.
I mean, posing and grinning like a goddamn sock puppet, shaking hands with total strangers who must be completely blind if they can't see what I am at the core.
What my mother has made me.
A Prentiss.
Ferociously a Prentiss.
- But not a Shaw. No, sir.
- I see.
No, you don't.
You can't.
I was 20 years old before I had a friend.
Worse, a girlfriend. Well, you know, from my point of view, anyway.
A friend outside of my mother's circle of approved encounters and she...
...my mother...
God only knows what she told
Jocelyn to chase her away.
Precipitating my sole act of rebellion:
Storming off...
...and enlisting in the Army.
But after the war...
...I came back to her.
Why did you come back?
What happened?
Weren't you listening?
Mother happened.
You know, the truth is I hate it.
I've always despised the Medal.
The cloying adulation of the little people.
It's certainly...
...nothing for you to be jealous of, major.
I'm not jealous.
I don't have the dreams, Ben.
How could you not remember saving our unit?
I do. I said I did.
No, no, you didn't. You said that you didn't remember doing it.
That's what you just said a couple minutes ago.
When I think about that night...
...it's as if I know what will happen.
The thing is, I never seem to get to the point where I feel that it actually does happen.
But I'm sure that's perfectly normal.
Okay. Well, have you discussed this with anyone? These discrepancies?
Who would I share that with?
My old Army buddies who love and adore me for saving their pathetically unimportant, present company excluded, asses?
You could discuss it with Army intelligence.
You could go down there.
I mean, I could go with you and discuss it and you can tell them what you remember, what you don't remember, and they could...
...run some tests.
Yeah, tests. Boy.
The press would have a field day with that.
Somebody put an implant inside me.
I found it this morning.
I've got the hole in my back if you wanna take a look at it.
And I got a good feeling they put one in you too.
Nobody has put anything in me, Ben.
Let's prove it.
Why don't, you know...
- We'll go get an x-ray...
- Look, Ben,
I wanna be supportive of you. I do.
But don't you think this could wait till after the election?
Why? For what?
- What are you scared of?
- I'm not afraid of anything.
- Then why don't we just prove it...
- Know what? I think you should leave.
- I'm sorry, I really...
- Listen.
Somebody got into our heads with big steel-toe boots, cable cutters and a chainsaw and they went to town.
Neurons got... Got...
Got exposed and circuits got rewired.
Our brain cells got obliterated, Raymond.
Please.
You need to get help, Ben.
What are you doing? Ben!
Stop! Stop!
Inside! Inside!
Congressman!
He bit him. He bit him.
Get him out of here.
Are you okay, sir?
- Leave me alone.
- Sir, we should...
Get out!
We fished him out of the Potomac River about 4:45 yesterday afternoon.
What were you doing in Al Melvin's apartment?
I went to talk to him.
He wasn't home.
Talk about what? Dreams?
Interesting stuff.
Yeah, there's hundreds of those in his place.
You should have your people check it out.
Oh, we'll get on that right away.
Colonel Garret was kind enough to show us the file on you, Marco.
You are the real deal, aren't you?
Special Forces. Rangers. Delta.
I wanted to talk to Corporal Melvin to ask him some unanswered questions about...
...our reconnaissance in Kuwait back in '91.
- He wasn't home.
- Right. He wasn't there.
So, what, you thought it was okay to just break in and wait for him?
I didn't kill him, if that's where you're headed.
Nobody said you did.
Maybe he committed suicide.
What's your obsession with Raymond Shaw?
I'm not obsessed with Raymond Shaw.
The man of his dreams.
You may want to ask your medical examiners to check Melvin's back.
It's under the skin just shy of the scapula.
They may find a implant.
Just under the skin, left side.
If they don't look real hard, they won't find it.
They could sing that while they're looking for it if they like.
- Implants.
- That's what I said.
I-M-plant.
Yeah, but judging from your file here, apparently, you don't know your shit from your oatmeal, my friend.
Excuse me. This is unnecessary.
You got a problem?
Psycho? You look a little angry.
Maybe you wanna hit me?
Go ahead, you can do it.
- Hey!
- For God's sake, Ben...
He hit me.
And you wanna help him?
No. That would be political suicide.
Of course not.
I want you to help him.
I can't even imagine why.
Mother, I can assure you, I am as uncomfortable asking you to do this as you are being asked.
My campaign people are getting a restraining order against him.
He's going on every security watch list, but I won't lock him up.
- I'm not pressing charges.
- What?
I don't know, it's just...
I don't wanna talk about this right now.
Can we get back to the campaign and focus on something...
Raymond, you don't actually believe his story?
No.
But he does.
And he's a fine soldier.
And if his slim hold on sanity requires that I tolerate his delusions until he can get help, I'll do it.
It doesn't diminish me.
I'm not afraid of him.
Raymond.
How much do you actually know about your friend?
Oh, that's sad.
Poor little tin soldier.
Mother, please.
Well, just imagine how terrified your people were yesterday when Major Marco showed up at campaign headquarters and you invite...
My God, you invited him in.
With all they know about him.
I know him.
I served under him.
He was a good man.
Well, that's what the neighbors always say about serial killers.
You're out of here.
Shaw won't press charges.
Someone from
Senator Eleanor Shaw's office called and intervened on your behalf.
Major, you've reached the terminal end of the Army's patience.
You're relieved of duty, effective immediately.
Yes, sir.
Ben, there is a young neurologist at Walter Reed. His name is Zahn.
He's had real success with Gulf War Syndrome.
You are instructed to get your affairs in order and report to him first thing Monday morning.
I thought you said you lost it.
I bit a guy. I found another one.
These are not supposed to exist.
These are only theoretical.
So, what does it do?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
I don't know.
I don't wanna know.
You don't wanna know.
Look, it's out of you and you are still alive.
That's the good news.
What's the bad news?
Maybe they know you're here.
You said the Army implants, they were for emergency medical data, right?
The ones they publicized were.
There was a parallel project for all kinds of scary implantables.
The Clinton watchdogs finally freaked out about it, closed down.
Parallel project?
How did you know about that?
Manchurian Global funded me to make some of their scary shit.
Heard of them?
Imagine not just a corporation, Marco, but a goddamn geopolitical extension of policy for every president since Nixon.
Cash is king, Marco.
Cash is king.
You sure you wanna do this?
Absolutely.
Because I don't.
I'll owe you one.
No.
I still owe you.
For getting me out of Albania.
Albania.
What are you doing?
In case I forget things
I wanna remember.
I'm putting you on a cocktail of methohexitol to take the edge off.
The edge off of what?
Getting clarity.
Or whatever you wanna call it.
ECT not being the precise science that, say, leeching is.
You don't think this is gonna work?
It's a desperation move, man.
But, hey, there is a school of thought that says a victim of induced abreaction...
Here it comes.
The night is clear.
Stars, but no moon.
The patrol is ambushed.
We were on a routine recon
inside Iraqi-controlled terrain,
assessing troop strength...
Captain Marco was
knocked unconscious.
In the ensuing firefight, Eddie Ingram
gets himself separated to the left.
Baker goes after him.
Hello, captain.
Before Sergeant Shaw is able to locate...
Eddie Ingram gets himself separated to the left.
Did you go blank on me again?
He said this would happen.
Who?
Your German friend.
Your friend.
Ben.
He said it'd be like a computer system crash.
That your brain would shut down, but it would reboot again and you'd forget all your RAM.
Or most of your RAM.
Do you remember me?
Do you remember me?
Ben?
Eugenie.
How did I get here?
You called me.
Where am I?
- Planning a suicide bombing.
The Mile High City has suffered
a series of brutal attacks
during the past several months.
Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw,
does it bother you at all
that your son repudiates
so many of your more
- controversial policies?
- No. He's his own person.
Raymond and I may disagree
on certain issues,
but I think we share
the same fundamental vision
of what this country can be.
- Which is?
- Better.
Better and better.
Safer, braver, stronger.
A beacon of freedom
in a world troubled by shadows.
America must prevail.
The future and survival
of modern civilization,
democracy, freedom,
all depend upon it.
So your son, Congressman Shaw...
Rosie.
I was in the park on Friday?
We were in the park on Monday.
Monday?
- Yep.
- Monday.
We were flying low.
It's, like, over the ocean, and just...
A field hospital.
And they took us up to this place.
- Where? Military?
- I don't know. I don't know.
Just state-of-the-art stuff everywhere.
Stainless steel and wires and tubes and monitors.
- Were you tortured?
- No. Yeah.
I mean, there was pain.
You know, it was like...
I don't know what they call it.
Invasive procedure.
For example?
Like what? What do you mean?
Invasive.
See, they were in my head...
...and they made me...
Well, Raymond Shaw, they made him kill somebody.
Like it was nothing.
Private Robert Baker.
That's who it was, it was a private.
One of my soldiers.
I think they made me kill somebody too.
A kid named Eddie Ingram.
Private Ingram, stand up.
Walk a few steps, please.
And if you could secure the door, please, Chris.
Captain Marco.
Stand up.
- Raymond.
- Yes, sir.
There's a gun on the cupboard.
Would you please take it and give it to Captain Marco.
Yes, sir.
Here.
Captain.
Captain Marco, please shoot Private Ingram.
Now, Raymond, suffocate Private Baker.
Kill him.
Keep going, Raymond.
I knew the...
A soldier knows the enemy.
I'm in command.
That's primary, I know.
I thought I knew...
...who the enemy was.
My men, they trusted me with their lives, you know?
Don't.
Don't touch me.
Ben, the person that did this, what was his name?
Can you remember?
Did he have a name?
Ben?
Smile if you like.
This will just take a minute.
I see you there all the time.
Bennett Marco.
Checks from First National Bank.
Romance novels, instant noodles,
NoDoz and tomatoes.
Old friend up there,
an old Army friend that...
Well, he's in politics now...
What else did we talk about?
What happened to you
after you were captured.
Black helicopters,
secret laboratories...
... mad scientist, mind drugs...
... shock torture
and Raymond Shaw.
- You don't believe any of it, do you?
- It's crazy.
- It sounds crazy, doesn't it?
- It sounds crazy.
That's what they wanted
me to think too.
It's exactly what they want
you to think.
What about the other guys
from your unit?
Where are they?
They're all gone.
So-called natural causes.
Owens died of cancer in '97.
Villalobos' car crashed.
Atkins committed suicide.
Jameson died 9/11, Pentagon.
- Ben?
- Yeah?
- Did he have a name?
- Who?
The person that did this, Ben.
What was his name?
Can you remember?
Ben.
- Yeah?
- Did he have a name?
You only have to look
at the enormous strides made
in the last decade
with the genetic reconfiguration
of the noble tomato.
What was happening was the tomato
was over-ripening in the process
and it was losing its flavor.
It's actually a very simple procedure
to deactivate the gene concerned.
And the same thing
can be applied to ourselves.
At a flick of a switch,
we can adjust character,
change personality.
And of course, more importantly...
... we can offset
the ravages of dementia
by implanting memory or adjusting
the synaptic connections.
We can free people
from the terrible burden
of an emotionally
compromised past.
- Watch where you're going!
- Sorry.
Watch where you're going!
Just back up! Just back up.
Watch it. Watch it. Shut up.
Take it easy, sir.
I called the Pentagon and they told me he's on medical leave.
Secret Service, they got him on a couple of their watch and observe lists.
I guess there's been some trouble with this guy involving Congressman Shaw.
Oh?
Among the shareholders in Manchurian Global, were they to ever publish a list, which they won't, you would find former presidents, deposed kings, trust fund terrorists, fallen Communist dictators, ayatollahs, African warlords and retired prime ministers.
- See what I mean?
- I get it. They're big. They're huge.
They're... They're...
They're gigantic.
I can't touch them. I get it.
I don't want to.
And you bring me rumors and conjecture.
I started with nightmares.
Rumors, conjectures, that's a giant leap forward.
Nightmares that you've interpreted using as primary resources
A, your spotty memory,
B, the Internet, sacred sanctuary of idiots and nutters.
That's how they're gonna look at this.
And C, a crazy man's notebook, along with evidence you chewed out of a man's back.
All neatly stitched together with a common thread of a supremely powerful, well-connected private equity fund, who, if you ever get anywhere near them, will plead ignorance and be shocked.
Shocked to learn what some of their subsidiary partners are engaged in.
I could give a rat's ass about Manchurian Global, sir.
I could give a rat's ass about them.
That is not why I'm here.
I looked you up too, senator.
Oh?
You were in the Army.
I was drafted.
Didn't make much of a soldier,
I'm afraid. Let me see this.
That's not what I saw in the record.
That's not what the record says, sir.
And you know how it works.
Wars are fought one battle at a time.
Battles, you win one bullet at a time.
And I'd be lying to you if I said that I didn't factor in, in a huge way, the fact that you have a vested, personal, political and patriotic interest in how all of this shakes out.
I'd be lying to you.
You're right, major.
I do.
A $5000-a-plate dinner honoring
the CEO of Votron Incorporated,
the nation's third-largest producer of
the controversial touch-screen units
that will be used in the forthcoming
election, was disrupted last night,
when protestors disguised as
waiters and kitchen staff
unleashed a blizzard
of symbolic chads from above,
resulting in a momentary panic.
The supporters of presidential hopeful
Vice President Edward Nelson
fled to exits and dove under tables.
Security personnel quickly subdued
the protestors, one of whom...
The man is insane, Tom.
Full-blown schizophrenia.
He's been stalking Raymond, the FBI is all over this already.
I've seen the files.
- Have you seen them?
- All over what?
Your bipolar war buddy has been sharing his dreams with Senator Jordan.
Hello, Raymond.
Hello, senator.
How's Jocelyn?
Have you fact-checked this with anyone, Tom?
Raymond.
Do you recognize this man?
No.
His name is Atticus Noyle.
He's a South African scientist and mercenary.
Someone our CIA turned to for covert mind warfare against the Soviets in Afghanistan.
Someone who has sold his technology and services to terrorists and rogue states.
And what does he have to do with me?
Major Bennett Marco claims that this man...
...brainwashed you.
In his dreams.
Contrived to have you win the Medal of Honor.
And has you poised to be the first privately owned and operated vice president of the United States.
Sir, I've already spoken with Ben Marco.
Unfortunately, he's not a well man.
He's delusional.
Nevertheless, he's pulled from his mad hat some remarkably lucid connections between his dreams of your exploits in Kuwait and this Dr. Noyle and the private equity fund
Manchurian Global, your mother's primary political benefactor for the past 15 years.
Oh, come on, Tom.
They contribute to half the Senate.
Both sides of the aisle.
What are you saying?
At the time of Desert Storm,
Dr. Atticus Noyle was working under a research grant from Manchurian Global, developing deep implant behavior modification.
Oh, my God.
Rogue scientists, mind control,
Manchurian Global.
- You.
- Tom.
Connect the dots, Raymond.
Where was your famous
Lost Patrol for those three missing days?
Eluding capture in the desert?
Or somewhere else, being microwaved by this Atticus Noyle?
- Oh, Tom.
- I'm sorry, senator, but what exactly are you suggesting I do?
Bow out gracefully.
Personal reasons, an obscure illness.
Yield your spot on the ticket and go into seclusion.
Oh, that's what this is about.
And then surrender yourself to federal authorities.
Help them trace this thing to its source and address whatever damage may have been done to you.
And I'll be waiting for your press announcement first thing in the morning.
- And then we'll talk.
- Tom.
If there's any inkling of truth in any of these charges, if anyone has ever harmed a hair on his head,
I will find out about it.
You have 12 hours, senator.
But if it's not true,
I will see you impeached on the floor of the Senate and bury you.
Good night.
It's preposterous.
Idiotic story.
Mother, there's something
I have to tell you.
What?
I've been having the dreams.
Ben said there were tests they could run to see if...
No. Where are you going?
Sergeant Shaw.
What?
Sergeant Raymond Shaw.
Mother, I...
Raymond Prentiss Shaw.
Yes.
Listen.
Good morning to you all,
and welcome to Amtrak's
northbound Acela,
making station stops
at Baltimore, Philadelphia,
Newark, New York's
Penn Station
and Boston as the last stop...
Who's that?
It's Raymond, sir.
Oh, don't do that.
You're gonna get soaking wet, Raymond.
Raymond.
I came to apologize, sir.
Raymond, what are you doing?
- I'm sorry.
- We'll get some help for you, son.
It's not your fault, Raymond.
It's not your fault.
- I'm sorry, sir.
- It's your mother...
Dad!
Help!
Oh, God. Daddy!
Help!
Raymond? What are you doing?!
What is going on?
What is happening?
Where's my father?
What are you doing?
Dad! Dad!
The five-term senator
and recent front-runner for his party's
vice presidential nomination
appears to have
accidentally drowned
when his kayak overturned near
his Chesapeake Bay weekend home.
Police say his daughter,
35-year-old Jocelyn,
may have been trying
to rescue Jordan
when she was herself overcome
by the icy water.
The bodies of Senator Jordan
and his daughter
were discovered this morning
by a crab fisherman
who spotted the capsized kayak
floating far offshore,
nearly a mile from
Senator Jordan's residence.
Neighbors say the senator was an
expert kayaker whose morning trips
were a familiar sight along
the western bank of the Bay.
Governor Arthur, do you have
any comment on this tragic event?
Senator Jordan was a statesman
of the highest integrity.
Tom Jordan was a friend.
A damn fine man.
Just a great American.
That's all for now. We'll have
something for you a little later.
They're the latest target of SEC
corruption probes,
but private equity fund
Manchurian Global confirmed today
it is continuing with plans to
finance privately owned combat units
to relieve beleaguered
U.S. Troop deployments worldwide.
It is a move that could save the
Defense Department billions of dollars.
How does Arthur die?
You know who I'm talking about, the new president.
If he dies, Raymond Shaw becomes the new president, doesn't he?
Chain of succession.
That's what you got in mind.
That's what you people wanna do.
You wanna really run the world, don't you, Susie? Rosie?
Whatever the hell your name is. I got my library card and I got your tapes.
I do my research too.
We're going to the feds, we're going to the police, the newspapers, whatever it takes.
I am the feds.
Now, get off me!
Get off of me!
We found...
...an implant device...
...in Al Melvin.
You found one in Melvin.
Just like you said.
I'm part of a shadow unit.
We've been watching you.
Trying to sort this thing out.
This isn't an election, this is a coup.
This is... In our own country, a regime change, in our own country.
Ben, don't. Ben.
This is rich people, Manchurian Global funding bad science to put a sleeper in the White House, and that's what's going on, Rosie.
- That's what's going on.
- I wanna believe you.
Well, then, believe me.
Help me. Help me.
Shoot me, then.
Help me or shoot me.
Make a decision.
Make a decision.
I made a decision when I met you, Ben.
Now, why don't you show me what you have in your file.
- Sir!
- Congressman!
Sir, do you have a statement for us tonight?
- Was exceptionally clear and simple.
A stronger, safer, more profitable world through uncorruptible top-level management.
We trust you with our technology and suddenly you turn him into a common hit man.
How fucking dare you.
I trusted you with my son.
You didn't even ask us...
Don't lecture me! You swore to me that this was fail-safe.
No leaks, no glitches, no...
No dreams.
Not even a shadow of what was done to Raymond...
You needed to ask before you acted.
This is not a...
Tom Jordan was going to destroy my son and everything I've worked for, and every one of us along with it.
And you wanted me to what?
- Call a meeting?
- Now, look, look, look.
In the larger course of history...
...there are key players...
...and role players, senator.
Bullshit! This is about my son and the future of this country.
I thought we understood each other.
I think we do. I think we really do.
- Your god is money.
- Oh, wait, wait, and yours is?
No, no. I'm a believer.
I am an optimist.
I believe in the future.
And people who do, the ones who make history instead of just sitting around watching it, no, they're willing to take the big risks.
Yes, I made a decision.
Oh, God! Where are all the men anymore?
My father, Tyler Prentiss, never asked,
"Is this okay? Is this okay?"
You know what I'm saying, Mark?
He just did what needed to be done.
Come on, rise and shine, New York.
It's a big day in the Big Apple.
That's right. All polls indicate
that New Yorkers will be turning out
in record numbers today
across the five boroughs
to select a new president.
At least, that's how the rulebook
says it's supposed to happen.
The polls open at 6 a.m.
And bars and taverns in Manhattan,
Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx,
and Staten Island will be
opening shortly thereafter.
That's right, New Yorkers. We are
free to drink and vote all day today.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thanks for coming out.
Congressman, good luck.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Hey. Thank you very much.
- The next vice president, sir.
I hope so.
- Let's have a win.
- We're with you. We're with you.
Thank you, Tony, take care.
Thank you.
Take care. Goodbye.
Thanks very much.
It's clean.
It's clean.
It's all right, Evan.
How's your back?
I've been having the dreams, Ben.
Oh, that's good.
They're inside my head.
We'll get them out. I got the proof.
I know what they did to us.
I just don't know why.
I dream things, Ben.
Terrible things that can't possibly have happened.
- I'm gone, Ben...
- No, you're not, you're right here.
Ben...
...there's something I want you to have.
I don't deserve this.
Jocelyn's dead.
I know.
And the senator.
Yeah.
Did I?
I think so, Raymond, yes.
I don't remember, Ben.
I don't remember.
Raymond...
...did they tell you what it is they want you to do?
That's what I gotta find out.
We gotta find out what's gonna happen, where it's gonna happen...
Are we friends, Ben?
I wanna believe we were friends.
We are connected and that's something nobody can take from us.
You could've had me locked up, but you didn't.
That's proof that there's something deep inside.
There's a part that they can't get to.
And it's deep inside of us.
And that's where the truth is.
That's our only hope. That's what you and me need to tap into, and that's what you and I are gonna use to take them out, Raymond.
We don't have much time. Please.
- I thought you were smarter than that.
- Raymond, please.
You don't think they saw this coming, Ben?
You don't think they factored you in?
I am the enemy, Major Marco.
What are you talking about?
Yes, Mother.
Yes, he's right here.
- She wants you.
- Me?
Yes, senator.
- Is this Captain Marco?
- Yeah.
Captain Bennett Marco?
Yes.
Bennett Ezekiel Marco.
Yes.
Listen.
Hurry up!
Major Marco?
Ben?
- People can get together whenever they want and not get in trouble.
People should be allowed to say what is on their mind...
The Bill of Rights gives people...
Thank you.
The candidates made ritual trips
to the voting booths today.
Governor Arthur,
casting his ballot in North Platte,
will spend election night in the Big Apple
with running mate Raymond Shaw
for their anticipated victory party.
The presidential rival,
incumbent Vice President Nelson
returned to his home
in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
He attended special church services
this morning...
- All clear.
- Raymond...
- Clear.
- ... listen.
The bullet will strike Bob Arthur
the moment you step forward
and arrive on your star beside him.
Because the assassin...
...the deranged, obsessed...
...tragically paranoid lone gunman...
...is trying to kill you.
Major Marco's an excellent marksman.
But you must stay very, very still and stand right where you're supposed to stand.
What happens to Ben?
The assassin always dies, baby.
It's necessary for the national healing.
I'm sure you will never entirely comprehend this, darling.
But I want you to know, Raymond...
...I did this for you.
So that you could have what I couldn't.
What your father threw away.
The opportunity to lead this nation.
- I know, Mother.
- And so I let them take you and change you a little bit.
Not so much that you would notice, but just enough to bring you back to who you really are.
And to what you will become.
Oh, and look at you.
Look at you.
Look what you've achieved, look how far we've come.
It's working, Raymond.
And you're going to save our country now.
In the hour of her greatest need.
Yes, Mother.
But...
But when you smile...
...oh, darling, when you smile, that's what I live for.
When you smile.
Well, it's official.
CBS News now projects
Robert Arthur and Raymond Shaw
to be the next president
and vice president
of the United States.
With at least 270 electoral votes
and support of almost 70 percent
of votes tallied tonight.
Arthur and running mate
Raymond Shaw are leading
in all but one remaining race,
in the sitting vice president's
home state of Louisiana.
Wait, Jimmy. Jimmy, wait.
Wait. Go back.
Can you go back?
Yeah.
- Stop.
- Sure.
Now, can you zoom in on that guy?
Yep.
No, no, Jimmy, the other one. The one in the back. The one in the shades.
- This one?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Never mind. Thanks, Jimmy.
Arthur! That's right!
Arthur! Arthur!
- We did it. Wow.
- Yeah!
All right! Yes!
- Yes.
- Hi.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
Let's have a good show, people.
Let's have a really good show, okay?
Arthur! Arthur! Arthur! Arthur!
Cue screens.
Very good.
Stand by with the first music cue.
Now, music.
Okay.
Damn it.
Shaw missed his first position.
AOP! AOP!
Up there!
Ben!
Ben!
All right. Bye.
The FBI has just released
security footage
of the assassin of Raymond
and Eleanor Prentiss Shaw
entering the hotel two hours
before the fatal shooting.
Authorities have identified
the gunman as Klaus Bachmann.
Bachmann was believed to have been
killed in a car bomb explosion
in Chechnya four years ago.
He was employed there as a
covert operation specialist
by Global Endeavors,
a U.K. Subsidiary of the equity fund
giant Manchurian Global.
A second former Manchurian Global
civilian contractor
was taken into custody
by federal agents
at Chicago's O'Hare Airport
early this morning.
Laurence Tokar made news
during the Gulf War
for his presence on Raymond Shaw's
famed Lost Patrol.
Tokar was missing in action after
the ambush that resulted in Shaw
being awarded the
Congressional Medal of Honor.
Authorities are exploring additional
connections between the two men.
Still reeling from the recent tragic loss
of Senator Thomas Jordan,
Congress has already announced
a far-reaching investigation
into Jordan's death,
in an effort to learn if it is in any way
related to the Shaw assassinations.
In a supercharged encounter
moments ago, president-elect Arthur...
I remember running.
I had to...
...get out...
...to where the sky was. And had to...
...get to the water.
Escape. Regroup.
Come back, get my men.
I thought that if I could just get to the water...
...everything would be okay.
If I could just get to the water.
Now, when you're rescued
and returned with your patrol
to command headquarters,
what will be among the first
of your duties that you'll undertake?
I'll recommend Sergeant Shaw
for the Medal of Honor, sir.
He saved our lives.
He terminated the enemy.
Led us across the desert to safety.
Excellent. And there were casualties?
There's always casualties in war, sir.
{3938}{3973}Ready to go?
{4108}{4134}Come on.
{5516}{5551}Marie, can you get the door?
{5913}{5942}Get up.
{6688}{6726}Should we build a fire?
{9039}{9076}Want some wine?
{9434}{9488}- More?|- Just a little.
{9578}{9603}That's good.
{9753}{9787}Want to go to the beach tomorrow?
{9794}{9837}If the weather's nice.
{9894}{9918}Which beach?
{9928}{9965}Where the Germans go?
{9970}{10013}Yes, that's a good one.
{10019}{10046}Not too crowded.
{10198}{10222}Where'd you find it?
{10255}{10312}It's an old bottle from last year.
{10322}{10350}How is it?
{10420}{10474}- It's drinkable.|- Not great!
{11655}{11698}We're finally on vacation.
{11816}{11843}Are you tired?
{11848}{11877}Yes.
{13913}{13949}That feels good.
{14472}{14512}Coming for a swim?
{14540}{14567}Not just yet.
{14576}{14626}I want to rest a little.
{17897}{17959}Excuse me,|have you seen my husband?
{17965}{18033}He's in his sixties, fairly tall?
{18041}{18091}No. We just got here.
{18097}{18120}Are you sure?
{18128}{18206}He's got gray hair,|blue swimming trunks...
{18215}{18274}He went swimming|and I've lost sight of him.
{18279}{18312}Sorry, we haven't seen him.
{18331}{18355}Thank you.
{19550}{19587}Excuse me...
{19612}{19672}My husband's disappeared,|I can't find him.
{19835}{19877}Excuse me, I've got a problem.
{19903}{19932}My husband is lost.
{19938}{19975}Calm down.|Did he go swimming?
{19988}{20040}- I think so.|- You think so or you're sure?
{20046}{20092}- I'm sure.|- He didn't go for a walk?
{20115}{20152}I'm telling you|he went in the water!
{20157}{20232}- On this beach?|- No, further down.
{20238}{20263}That's out of our sector.
{20269}{20340}I know, but please hurry,|something has to be done!
{20710}{20742}It was here.
{20750}{20810}He went swimming here.
{20816}{20842}Did anyone see him?
{20847}{20931}No. Can't you see|it's practically deserted?
{20943}{21005}We'll alert the police|and get a helicopter.
{22609}{22704}Did he have any personal or|professional reasons for disappearing?
{22710}{22733}No.
{22738}{22762}Or for suicide?
{22919}{22968}Did he seem depressed
{22974}{23042}or weary,|or mention a desire to end it?
{23047}{23071}No!
{23221}{23248}Very well.
{23260}{23321}For the investigation,|we're going to need
{23326}{23441}a very precise physical description|of the missing person, your husband.
{23449}{23523}Just in case you don't hear from him|in the next few days.
{23541}{23600}We'll also need medical information.
{23606}{23679}Whether he's had any surgery,|or fractured bones.
{25272}{25297}Jean...
{25338}{25364}Jean?
{25658}{25680}Is anyone there?
{29925}{30022}It's about lung capacity,|I'm not an old fossil yet!
{30032}{30098}No, you're just|in the process of fossilizing.
{30104}{30168}You should go to the gym with Marie.
{30174}{30220}Yes, come with me.|It'll do you good.
{30225}{30310}And jump around in loud tights|with a bunch of ladies?
{30315}{30362}Can you picture me, Vincent?
{30374}{30411}Not really, no.
{30423}{30537}You've got the wrong idea about gyms.|There's no need to wear tights.
{30543}{30599}You'd look cute in nice pair|of shorts.
{30614}{30658}You don't have to take a class.
{30682}{30723}There's always the weight room.
{30737}{30818}I should go,|I really need to build my muscles.
{30896}{30922}Where do you go?
{30943}{31038}A little gym a few stops|from my place, most mornings
{31067}{31107}before work.
{31133}{31232}My husband always says he's coming,|then backs out.
{31243}{31295}He's like you, Gérard,|not a big athlete.
{31304}{31356}But he promised me
{31362}{31423}he'd try to come|on Saturday mornings.
{31438}{31479}If you came with us, Gérard,
{31492}{31581}you wouldn't be alone.|You'd both be more comfortable.
{31589}{31689}With all the work you both have,|it's good to have a physical outlet.
{31763}{31808}Have you always been athletic?
{31813}{31864}When I was young, in England,
{31875}{31942}I was a competition swimmer.
{31948}{31989}Then I met my husband,
{31994}{32087}a real Frenchman|who loves good meals and fine wine.
{32093}{32149}More salad, Marie?
{32192}{32214}Sure.
{32235}{32312}It's delicious.|I wish I had your cooking talent.
{32320}{32378}But you have other talents,|don't you?
{32771}{32827}Thanks, but don't bother.|I've got it.
{32832}{32868}Let me help.
{33563}{33602}Would you call me a taxi?
{33843}{33916}- Do you like him?|- Why do you ask me that?
{33921}{33949}No reason.
{33955}{34037}I think you made|a big impression on him.
{34438}{34465}Been married long?
{34500}{34583}Over 25 years.|That's a fair bit of time, isn't it?
{34590}{34616}Yes.
{34671}{34740}- Do you have children?|- No.
{34754}{34793}You didn't want kids?
{34814}{34852}You're too nosy.
{34865}{34943}I know, but I'd like|to know you better.
{35030}{35086}Do you have time for a nightcap?
{35100}{35173}No, I've got class tomorrow, and...|Another time.
{37325}{37355}Not asleep yet?
{37385}{37432}I was waiting up for you.
{37761}{37794}Did you have a good time?
{37800}{37879}It was nice.|Gérard was funny.
{37960}{37994}Did you eat?
{38007}{38031}No.
{38069}{38127}Would you like me|to fix you something?
{38132}{38174}No, don't bother.
{38192}{38225}I'm not hungry.
{38249}{38323}Good. That way|you'll lose a little weight.
{39282}{39316}Goodnight, honey.
{39352}{39408}- Did you set the alarm?|- Yes.
{40505}{40530}Jean?
{40552}{40573}Yes?
{40601}{40642}Hold me tight.
{41498}{41559}I don't want to go to work|this morning.
{41638}{41693}- Did you sleep poorly?|- No.
{41813}{41854}What's the matter?
{41885}{41909}Nothing.
{41932}{41983}I feel like taking the day off.
{41988}{42037}I want to stay here with you.
{46856}{46890}I'm sorry.
{46919}{46979}We'll end class 10 minutes early.
{47231}{47278}- I'm going for a coffee.|- See you.
{47315}{47348}Hello, Madame.
{47369}{47438}Do you remember me?|Last summer, in the Landes...
{47444}{47458}No.
{47494}{47570}I was working there,|we helped you, you know,
{47576}{47610}for your husband?
{47630}{47698}You've got the wrong person.|I've never been there.
{48218}{48273}Are you trying to sell me on him?
{48298}{48321}Not at all.
{48387}{48423}I've got to go.
{48464}{48534}- Call me, as soon as possible.|- I promise.
{48845}{48881}It looks great on you.
{48890}{48967}- Isn't it a bit conservative?|- No, it's in style.
{48985}{49022}It shows off your figure.
{49077}{49132}- I'll take it.|- Great.
{49140}{49187}The two shirts, too.
{49386}{49431}Do you have this in blue?
{49465}{49509}- Which one?|- That one.
{49561}{49632}It's for my husband.|His eyes are blue.
{49650}{49674}There.
{49706}{49740}Your code, please.
{49946}{49992}I'm sorry, your card's been refused.
{49998}{50056}- How can that be?|- I don't know.
{50062}{50101}I've got my checkbook.
{50108}{50152}- Do you have ID?|- My passport.
{50258}{50312}I'll pass on the shirts and tie.
{50344}{50367}Very well.
{50546}{50599}I'm sorry, I'll keep the tie.
{50725}{50751}Hello Marie?
{50788}{50816}It's Vincent.
{50821}{50926}Amanda gave me your number.|I just wanted to apologize...
{50955}{51002}I mean, for kissing you.
{51031}{51088}I'd like to ask you to dinner.
{51094}{51193}Maybe if you're free tonight...|I'd like to see you, if you have time.
{51199}{51268}I know a nice little|Chinese restaurant.
{51276}{51365}I don't want you|to feel obligated...
{51379}{51437}I'm getting flustered,|just give me a call.
{51442}{51548}My number is: 0144253658.
{51554}{51582}Kisses.
{51588}{51646}I mean, excuse me,|scratch the kisses...
{51651}{51689}Sorry. Call soon.
{51786}{51828}Who is this Vincent?
{51860}{51900}You're already home.
{51914}{51953}I bought you a present.
{52164}{52194}Do you like it?
{52213}{52236}It's very nice.
{52382}{52416}How do I look?
{52422}{52448}Pretty.
{52500}{52537}So, who is he?
{52553}{52612}A friend of Amanda and Gérard's.
{52649}{52723}- What's he look like?|- I don't know, average.
{52752}{52787}Handsome?
{52813}{52882}Sure, not bad. But not my type.
{52888}{52916}Why not?
{52941}{52976}Too mannered.
{53035}{53072}Did he kiss you?
{53078}{53108}Yes.
{53193}{53236}But I pushed him away.
{53372}{53402}Why?
{53413}{53463}I had just spoken about you.
{53520}{53570}You want to have dinner with him?
{53590}{53621}I don't know.
{54034}{54114}To tell you the truth,|I didn't think you'd call me back.
{54120}{54146}Why not?
{54160}{54236}I don't know.|I was afraid you were mad at me.
{54254}{54311}Really? It was flattering.
{54411}{54477}When I started teaching,|I had lots of big plans.
{54483}{54558}Specialized research projects|on exciting subjects.
{54567}{54635}But with time, I let them all go.
{54641}{54669}Little by little.
{54675}{54697}Any regrets?
{54733}{54758}No.
{54795}{54889}My relationship with Jean|has always been my priority.
{54939}{54979}But I love teaching.
{54996}{55083}Right now we're working on|"The Waves" by Virginia Woolf.
{55113}{55165}I loved that book as a teenager.
{55180}{55251}It's a wonderful book.|The students like it.
{55257}{55326}Actually,|I don't really remember it.
{56047}{56065}That's...
{56071}{56150}The suicide note|she left to her loved ones.
{56155}{56249}Terrifying. She drowned herself|with rocks in her pockets.
{56257}{56313}I think it's a beautiful death.
{56322}{56342}I'm not surprised.
{56351}{56401}The English are fascinated|by things morbid.
{56926}{56948}Are you cold?
{56953}{57016}No, it's nice out.
{57208}{57268}Thank you.|I had a lovely evening.
{57274}{57303}Me too.
{57349}{57382}Come up for a drink?
{57388}{57459}No, thank you.|I start early tomorrow.
{57549}{57575}Good night.
{57616}{57647}Good night, Vincent.
{61162}{61210}LAW OFFICES
{61478}{61554}- Listen Marie. We need to talk.|- I'm listening.
{61662}{61745}Your banker informs me|you are way overdrawn,
{61750}{61801}and can't access Jean's account.
{61837}{61888}- He said that?|- Yes.
{61913}{61980}You need a power of attorney.
{61989}{62055}As long as he is still missing,
{62077}{62122}his account will remain frozen.
{62142}{62224}In such cases,|it is necessary to wait 10 years
{62243}{62286}before a will can be...
{62301}{62336}Don't worry about it.
{62346}{62379}I'll speak to him.
{62401}{62442}Speak to who?
{62508}{62539}To Jean.
{62548}{62589}Who else?
{62609}{62659}Just because he travels|and works a lot...
{62664}{62710}Marie, be reasonable.
{62715}{62806}I'm only asking you to be careful,|don't spend too much.
{62822}{62900}Try to live on less as long|as things...
{62905}{62992}I appreciate your concern,|but don't worry.
{62998}{63050}I will handle everything.
{63410}{63437}What are you doing here?
{63443}{63508}Waiting for you.|I wanted to see you.
{63513}{63544}Are you free?
{63554}{63617}Well, yes.|I just finished a class.
{63630}{63674}May I take you out?
{63686}{63747}- Where?|- Wherever you like.
{63785}{63809}Your place?
{63816}{63873}Really?|You don't want to have lunch?
{63878}{63932}No, I'm not hungry.
{64428}{64452}Thanks.
{65767}{65825}- What is it?|- I'm sorry.
{66003}{66059}You must know why you're laughing?
{66083}{66111}I don't know.
{66136}{66178}It's weird...
{66200}{66231}What's weird?
{66313}{66341}I'm sorry,
{66347}{66413}it's just... you're so light.
{66432}{66462}Light?
{66471}{66501}That's a new one.
{66515}{66601}It's not a bad thing.|I'm just not used to it.
{66748}{66787}Can we close the curtains?
{67416}{67450}Close your eyes.
{67676}{67724}Caress my hips...
{67902}{67933}My breasts.
{68975}{69010}Are you with anyone?
{69050}{69080}Not really.
{69130}{69164}Meaning?
{69225}{69311}I see a woman from time to time.|But we're not together.
{69363}{69405}Are you afraid of commitment?
{69411}{69438}No.
{69457}{69516}I'm just not in love with her.
{69565}{69597}And you?
{69629}{69660}What about me?
{69684}{69731}Have you had other lovers?
{69763}{69790}No.
{69839}{69889}I've never cheated on Jean.
{69924}{69958}This is the first time.
{69988}{70025}Why now?
{70070}{70098}I don't know.
{70138}{70182}You don't make love anymore?
{70213}{70238}We do.
{70572}{70616}Can I ask you a question?
{70636}{70664}Go ahead.
{70689}{70772}If we were married,|would you cheat on me?
{70816}{70880}No, certainly not.
{71153}{71186}I've got to go.
{71196}{71219}Already?
{71232}{71278}Yes, I'm in a hurry.
{71355}{71416}Just pull the door closed|when you leave.
{71470}{71530}Hurry, you're already late.
{71575}{71626}I'm glad you came over.
{73701}{73792}Never has a summer's end
{73801}{73878}seemed so magnificent
{73886}{73946}This season's vines will make
{73953}{74027}only the finest grapes
{74039}{74090}In the trees we can see
{74096}{74166}swallows are gathering
{74173}{74241}But we must leave each other
{74247}{74360}even though we loved each other
{74534}{74586}What a lovely time
{74598}{74676}for saying goodbye
{74696}{74751}What a lovely night
{74757}{74830}It feels like we're twenty again
{74850}{74969}Rising with the smoke|of a cigarette
{74983}{75047}Love trails away
{75063}{75128}My heart stops
{75490}{75567}This is a message for Mrs. Drillon,
{75573}{75633}from police headquarters|in Lit et Mix.
{75641}{75740}We found a body in the sea|that fits the description
{75746}{75792}of your husband's.
{75807}{75889}Please call us back urgently
{75895}{75987}at 0540342115.
{76002}{76045}Thank you.
{76524}{76548}Jean?
{76582}{76608}Are you home?
{77021}{77050}Are you home?
{81161}{81186}Hello?
{81234}{81272}I was asleep.
{81367}{81411}Listen, I don't know.
{81416}{81464}I need to think.
{81525}{81588}I'll call you back,|Vincent. Goodbye.
{82674}{82707}Please come in.
{82824}{82846}This way.
{82853}{82916}Let me show you the main rooms.
{82922}{82983}This is a living and dining room.
{83013}{83104}It's spacious and has lots of light.
{83125}{83217}It needs paint, but the walls|are in excellent condition.
{83223}{83318}The floors are perfect, too.|They have a mosaic motif.
{83339}{83390}Excuse me, I'll be right with you.
{84448}{84475}Don't you feel well?
{84536}{84575}I'm alright.
{84609}{84649}Just a bit tired.
{84654}{84678}You should see a doctor.
{84709}{84738}I know.
{84763}{84828}Do you like the apartment?
{84840}{84879}Yes, it's lovely.
{84895}{84942}Just what I'm looking for.
{84948}{85016}Pretty good, for a first visit!
{85060}{85091}It's perfect.
{85100}{85122}When can I sign?
{85146}{85226}Soon, but don't you want|your husband to see it?
{85257}{85307}It's not necessary.
{85313}{85352}He'll like it.
{85675}{85716}What's the matter?
{85738}{85773}I'm sorry...
{85814}{85872}I don't think it's going to work.
{85877}{85925}Really? Why not?
{85957}{85995}Can't you see?
{87588}{87620}Very good.
{87724}{87765}Are you under stress these days?
{87771}{87811}No, I'm alright.
{87860}{87938}Sometimes I think I hear noises|when there aren't any.
{87943}{87997}- What kind of noises?|- I don't know...
{88016}{88056}Everyday sounds,
{88074}{88154}kind of a humming or buzzing.
{88168}{88261}- Are your eardrums sensitive?|- Not particularly.
{88270}{88304}Let's have a look.
{88327}{88372}- Goodbye, Mrs. Drillon.|- Thank you.
{88485}{88532}That'll be 180 francs.
{88655}{88729}Maybe you could also|settle your husband's bill?
{88767}{88793}What bill?
{88799}{88863}He didn't have any money|on him last time.
{88867}{88935}It's been a long time|since we've seen him.
{89102}{89193}Can you tell me when he came last?
{89200}{89237}Yes, of course.
{89263}{89343}Mr. Drillon was last here on...
{89412}{89451}Here it is. June 26.
{89502}{89543}Just before our vacation.
{89592}{89671}- How much do I owe you?|- Two visits makes 360 francs.
{93087}{93119}Excuse me, Madame?
{93150}{93171}Hello, Madame.
{93176}{93282}My husband is away on business and|asked me to fill his prescription.
{93323}{93383}This prescription has expired.
{93401}{93471}I know, but he's in Africa...
{93483}{93567}And as these are hard to find there,|he asked me...
{93601}{93680}I can't do it|without a proper prescription.
{93715}{93787}Please, this is an exceptional case.
{93824}{93855}I'm sorry.
{93882}{93971}You should get a new prescription|from his doctor.
{94107}{94161}- Can I just ask you one thing?|- Yes?
{94166}{94208}Do you have a pharmaceuticals list?
{96429}{96471}Do you think Jean|is unhappy with me?
{96496}{96562}Marie, stop.|You've done nothing wrong.
{96585}{96624}Do you hear me?
{96663}{96694}Yes.
{96750}{96784}Let's order some wine.
{96801}{96849}The wine list, please.
{97868}{97894}Hello?
{97915}{97949}Yes, it's Marie.
{97963}{97999}Am I disturbing you?
{98048}{98098}Sorry about last time.
{98166}{98194}Yes, I'm fine.
{99162}{99220}There we are. Are you hungry?
{99229}{99251}A little, yes.
{99328}{99374}I didn't have time for lunch.
{99509}{99591}Tell me, where is your accent from?
{99608}{99654}A village in the Southwest.
{99683}{99723}Do you know the Landes?
{99757}{99791}A little.
{99854}{99908}Jean has a family house there.
{99966}{100002}Where, exactly?
{100013}{100056}Near Lit et Mix.
{100093}{100124}Don't know it.
{101052}{101078}What are you reading?
{101084}{101150}Just a book I found by the bed.
{101195}{101218}Good night.
{101238}{101267}Good night.
{101573}{101612}Did you set the alarm?
{101707}{101738}What alarm?
{105039}{105094}It's just me. Everything's fine.
{105279}{105354}- Why are you looking at me like that?|- I don't know.
{105359}{105439}I wake up alone and then find|you here. I'm worried.
{105447}{105480}Was I snoring?
{105494}{105518}No.
{105562}{105623}I just felt like sleeping here.
{105812}{105863}Was this your husband's office?
{105887}{105937}It is my husband's office.
{106055}{106109}What are you going|to do with it now?
{106183}{106248}Why "now"? I don't understand.
{106259}{106314}I've known about your husband|for a while.
{106319}{106393}I was waiting for you to tell me.|I know it's hard.
{106430}{106469}You don't know anything.
{106531}{106585}- I can help you, Marie.|- Help me?
{106600}{106645}Who the hell are you, to me?
{106650}{106678}Nobody!
{106692}{106751}So please, mind your own business.
{107125}{107188}- More coffee?|- No, thanks.
{107370}{107410}I thought...
{107452}{107486}you'd want to talk.
{107491}{107523}Really?
{107539}{107567}No.
{107599}{107653}I don't talk much in the morning.
{107658}{107696}I'm not a morning person.
{107701}{107760}Strange that you saw me that way.
{107902}{107973}I'm going to shower and get dressed.
{108008}{108055}Close the door when you leave.
{108060}{108099}- Look, that's enough.|- Let me go!
{108104}{108168}Tell me what you want,|what I mean to you.
{108173}{108230}You'll have to get over|him sometime.
{108274}{108316}You want the truth?
{108321}{108357}You don't measure up.
{109945}{109982}How are you doing?
{110005}{110035}Not too bad.
{110121}{110176}You haven't come for a while.
{110200}{110224}True.
{110250}{110284}Yes, I know.
{110471}{110518}I need to talk to you.
{110523}{110578}- About what?|- About Jean.
{110598}{110636}Good news?
{110644}{110677}Just the opposite.
{110698}{110744}What is it now?
{110844}{110895}I think Jean may have|killed himself.
{111051}{111107}My son, suicide?
{111149}{111213}There are no suicides|in the Drillon family.
{111373}{111452}I just wanted to tell you|Jean was depressed.
{111477}{111542}- He was taking medication...|- I knew that.
{111569}{111610}How did you know?
{111687}{111726}I'm his mother.
{111732}{111777}And I'm his wife.
{111794}{111882}But you didn't realize|he was suffering.
{111922}{112003}It's hard for me to believe|that Jean confided in you.
{112014}{112056}Well, you're wrong.
{112077}{112148}You underestimate our relationship.
{112154}{112200}Give me a break!
{112205}{112275}If you know something, tell me.|I can't stand it anymore.
{112437}{112500}I don't think for one second
{112512}{112565}that Jean killed himself.
{112577}{112612}Or even drowned.
{112668}{112716}The truth is more cruel.
{112762}{112821}He disappeared, quite simply
{112828}{112872}because he was bored.
{112910}{112971}Or more accurately, bored with you.
{112999}{113076}He wanted a new life.|To start over.
{113081}{113127}That's understandable, isn't it?
{113148}{113205}Many men dream of doing it.
{113432}{113514}Anyway, you weren't able|to give him a family.
{113921}{113976}I got a call from the morgue.
{114019}{114085}They found a body|in a fisherman's net.
{114090}{114151}It seems it might be Jean.
{114299}{114356}Jean always loved fishing.
{114421}{114507}You belong in an insane asylum,|not a rest home.
{114672}{114740}You'll be in one before I am.
{118232}{118276}Fine... Alright.
{118329}{118365}Thank you, see you later.
{119036}{119064}Excuse me, Madame...
{119069}{119089}Hello.
{119094}{119145}I'm here to see Officer Caron.
{119150}{119195}- Your name?|- Mrs. Drillon.
{119236}{119286}The last room to the left.
{119291}{119317}Thank you.
{119331}{119419}What you are about to hear|is very difficult.
{119425}{119496}You can stop us at any time.
{119535}{119594}No, I want to know everything.
{119615}{119720}According to my autopsy|the day after we recovered the body,
{119726}{119825}it seems your husband|drowned by simple submersion,
{119834}{119910}a drowning where the lungs|fill with water,
{119918}{119969}undoubtedly caused|by a strong undertow,
{119974}{120062}and the resulting muscle fatigue|as he tried to fight it.
{120083}{120124}As you can imagine,
{120132}{120203}we were unable to identify|the body from the photos
{120208}{120257}you gave us.
{120262}{120335}The body was submerged|for too long.
{120340}{120421}It is in a state|of advanced putrefaction.
{120454}{120476}Meaning?
{120537}{120618}Putrefaction causes|the skin to turn greenish,
{120623}{120719}and the body and head|of the cadaver to swell.
{120733}{120814}The process accelerates|when the body is exposed to air
{120819}{120895}after having been submerged|in water, as in this case.
{120904}{120970}Morphological identification|is thus impossible.
{121105}{121186}The test confirms|a genetic link between the body
{121191}{121263}and your mother-in-law,|Suzanne Drillon.
{121295}{121385}As for the odontological tests,|it appears that
{121390}{121443}the x-rays we've taken match up
{121451}{121527}with the dental records|provided by his dentist.
{121533}{121646}However, because your husband|has never had any fractured bones,
{121651}{121759}we can't draw any conclusions|from the state of the skeleton.
{121790}{121863}We also have the material evidence|you described:
{121876}{121913}The blue trunks and the watch.
{121918}{122008}They are in good condition|and should be easy to identify.
{122014}{122049}We'll show them to you.
{122058}{122084}No.
{122119}{122187}What's wrong?|You don't want to see them?
{122196}{122226}I do.
{122271}{122322}But I want to see the body first.
{122390}{122438}As I already explained to you,
{122443}{122519}we can't really call it|a body at this point.
{122529}{122588}The cadaver is partially mutilated,
{122593}{122643}and seeing such a sight
{122648}{122707}could be extremely traumatic|for you.
{122754}{122817}I'm perfectly capable|of handling it.
{122830}{122866}Are you sure?
{122919}{122967}It's very important for me.
{123493}{123546}Shall I just show you part|of the body?
{123553}{123604}No, I want to see all of it.
{124665}{124701}May I close it?
{125408}{125454}These are the trunks.
{125531}{125566}Do you recognize them?
{125651}{125701}I think they were blue, like these.
{125760}{125783}And the watch?
{126037}{126065}Is something wrong?
{126090}{126154}Not at all! This isn't his watch.
{126199}{126232}What do you mean?
{126246}{126334}It perfectly fits the description|you gave us.
{126349}{126441}But this isn't it.|I should know, I bought it for him.
{126455}{126509}Please, take a closer look.
{126524}{126614}I'm sure it isn't this one.|It's not Jean.
{126711}{126750}You just identified his trunks.
{126755}{126829}I'm his wife,|and I'm telling you it isn't him.

No.
No.
No.
Yeah.
He broke all my cups.
That's original.
Sugar?
Thanks. Yeah.
Thank you.
To us.
Leaving?
Yeah. I have to go to work.
I'm due at the hospital.
That's right.
You're a nurse.
I got a double shift.
You should stay.
You have a key?
Yeah.
Well, I should be back by 10:00.
Will I see you later?
Maybe.
Yeah.
- Bye.
- Bye.
You were at Bellucci's on Monday.
Yeah. I was.
Hello?
What happened to you?
Hang on.
Just a minute!
Look, could I stay at your place for a couple of days?
-Yeah. of course.
- Great.
Well, I've gotta call Daniel first, then I'll be right over.
- Okay.
- Bye.
Lisa!
Oh, shit. Get up.
You know. at the restaurant.
I would've bet anything you were this girl I used to know.
But now seeing you here. you don't really look that much like her at all.
Hi.
Come on, Lisa.
Let's just talk about this, all right?
Don't start shit like that.
Look, I don't have time--
I don't wanna talk about it anymore.
Stop acting like a goddamn child about this crap!
Stop screaming at me!
Lisa, what are you doing?
Jesus Christ. Be careful.
It's over. Get out of my house.
Stop! Enough!
Get back in here now!
- You're gonna kill yourself!
- Don't do it!
Lisa, stop this!
Is this how you deal with your problems?
Huh? You run away and act like a child?
Go home, and don't bother calling me, okay?
Hi.
- Goddamnit!
- Can I come in?
Of course.
I'm sorry.
I hate to bother you, but, um, my...ex-boyfriend just told me he's seeing someone else.
I took a chance.
I hope you don't mind.
No, not at all.
Lisa, this is stupid, all right?
Come on!
Go home!
Excuse me, are you leaving?
I'd like to park.
- Hey!
- Hey.
I'm sorry I didn't call.
I, um...
Don't worry.
I've just been thinking.
Are you okay?
I'm going to London.
Why?
A friend of mine started his own company.
He's asked me to choreograph.
Oh, my God.
That's amazing.
When do you leave?
Tomorrow afternoon.
Is it okay if I stay another night?
Of course.
No, it has to be tonight.
Well, then I'd say the 10:1 5 flight to Los Angeles would be your best bet.
You can catch the flight to Shanghai from there.
But there's only coach available; your ticket's for first.
It's okay.
I'll tell you what.
I think I can get you an upgrade.
Why don't you come back in a few hours. Around 4:00.
Something should've opened up by then.
Okay.
Thank you.
See you at 4:00.
The hotel thing was just stupid.
I knew Daniel would find me.
So...
Why don't you come with me?
Well, I've got great shifts at the hospital now, and, you know...
And the guy who gave you that.
Yeah.
Well, come on. Tell me!
Last night we did it on the sofa in the doctor's lounge.
You little slut.
I'm jealous!
The bad part is
I'm already seeing his best friend.
Another surgeon.
He's adorable and he adores me, but he's the clinging type.
So she had the same name, same perfume, same shoe size?
That's so hot.
Or--or maybe this is creepy.
I think it's a little bit of both, actually.
So, did you hit it?
No. Um...I slept on the couch, you know.
When I woke up in the morning, she was gone.
- But you wanted to hit it, didn't you?
- Come on.
Come on.
I'm going to China tonight, I'm practically engaged--do I need to remind you?
The lies we tell ourselves.
So, what about you and Alex-- how's that?
How was your date?
- It was great.
- Good.
I mean, what-- you wanna wanna hear about it?
I don't know. Sure.
Well. after I left you. I went to pick up Alex from the theater. right?
She has this director--the guy is such a cheese ball. Not that impressive.
I mean. she should be on Broadway or something. 'cause she was awesome.
It was super late by the time she got changed.
So we went out. had a couple drinks and a couple laughs.
On the way home. I told her the whole sordid story about you and Lisa.
So now, finally, he's found her.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
And did she explain why she disappeared?
No, not yet.
He just wrote her this note.
They haven't actually spoken, but they're supposed to speak soon.
You okay?
No, I'm not. You know, I don't...
I don't feel very well.
You're kidding me.
No.
Do you mind just taking me home?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Thanks.
So, I was thinking, maybe I could go upstairs with you and I'll make you a nice big cup of hot chocolate...
...put a bunch of little marshmallows up on top.
We'll watch TV and just hang out.
Do you love me?
I just wanna be alone.
- Well--
- I'll call you.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Alex.
Alex, wait a second.
You gotta be kidding me.
This girl's unbelievable.
You know what?
Don't call me, okay?
Don't call me until you figure out what you wanna do with your life,
'cause I can't deal with this.
Every time, it's a different story with you, all right?
Wait, l--I'm sorry.
I'll call you tomorrow.
God!
This girl is ridiculous.
Taxi!
And we had sex all night.
And the next morning.
I made her my dad's world-famous breakfast, and...
I don't know.
It was pretty perfect.
That sounds really good, man.
It was pretty good.
When do I get to meet her?
Tonight.
Yeah, tonight. Tonight is her-- she's got this play.
It's the big opening.
It's Shakespeare.
Shakespeare.
Shakespeare. I know.
But it's supposed to be good. Trust me.
I'm supposed to leave tonight.
Yeah, but it's early.
You can go to the play, then get on the plane.
Have you seen my compact?
You know, the silver one.
No, I haven't.
I hope I didn't leave it at the hotel.
It was a gift from my grandmother.
Where did you get this?
Um...it's surgeon number two's.
He left it here last week.
Oh, my God.
It's so much like...
What?
Matthew.
So you're not getting into too much trouble?
Thanks.
Take care of yourself, okay?
- Come on, let me film you.
- No. You first.
Come on, Alex. Are you shy? You can't be shy if you wanna be an actress.
Here.
- Shakespeare?
- This is your big break.
That's Shakespeare.
I can't do that. That's too hard.
Haply, when I shall wed. that lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry half my love with him, half my care and duty.
Surely I shall never marry like my sisters to love my father all.
So true, my lord.
In life--oh! I blew it.
I'm sorry. That was bad.
No, that was amazing.
You know, the thing with acting, Alex, is you just have to commit.
Otherwise, you're just a phony.
I can't hear anything.
I know.
That's weird.
- Is it hooked up right?
- Yeah.
Can you take it back?
I know a place
I can get it fixed, actually.
Do you believe in love at first sight?
Well, who is he?
Don't even try to lie about it.
I haven't met him yet.
I've just seen him.
I don't think he's got a girlfriend.
I can tell.
Don't wait.
The good ones go fast.
Well, I gotta go get the video camera, so I'll talk to you later.
All right.
Hey...promise you'll talk to him?
Yeah...I'll think about it.
Okay. Bye.
I'll be right back.
- Sorry.
- Matthew, where are you going?
Sorry.
My God. it's so much like...Matthew.
Don't be silly.
It belongs to one of the doctors at the hospital.
Why would you think of Matthew?
Could I borrow your car again tonight?
Oh, sure.
Thanks, Lisa.
Well, I better go.
I'll see you later.
Okay.
Hi, excuse me?
I was in here a couple of days ago.
I think I might have left a compact.
It's silver, engraved.
Um, let me ask.
Tony, did anyone turn in a silver compact?
No. Sorry.
Okay. Thank you.
Lisa?
Yeah?
A guy did come in here looking for you.
Said he found your keys. Oh! And...
He left you this.
- Thank you.
- Sure.
"Lisa. I've been trying to find you.
"I have your powder case.
"Call me.
Matthew. "
Hey, Luke, can I talk to you for a second?
Hey, Ellie, do me a favor.
Will you help her out?
Yeah, sure.
How's it goin'?
Hey. I just wanna say thanks for everything and, you know, you've been great.
What about the play?
I thought you were comin' to the play.
I don't wanna miss another flight, you know.
Listen, I'll make it up to you when I get back. I promise.
Hey, taxi!
You have fun tonight, though, all right?
Say hi to Alex for me, and, you know.
- You're a lucky guy.
- You got plenty of time.
It's the late flight. I really want you to come to the play. Please?
See, things, um...it's just not going that well with Alex.
I've been kind of exaggerating a little.
What do you mean?
Well...
Lying.
Uh! I've been lying!
It's 'cause my life's so pathetic.
No all-night marathon?
God, I'm lucky if I get a kiss at the end of the night.
So I was thinking that if you came to the play, I think that would really help.
I mean, I'd be so much more confident with you there.
And then I can go to the bathroom and you can tell her, you know, what a great guy I am and rumor has it I'm really good in the sack, and that, um...
I'm hung like a camel--
I don't know.
Please? I wouldn't ask if it didn't mean a lot to me.
- I'll be there.
- Oh, you're the best. Thanks, buddy.
7:30, all right?
- I got it.
- Good. There you go.
- See you, brother.
- Yeah.
You the man. Thanks, man.
Well, you're all set.
You're on flight 1 559. First class.
Have a good trip.
I will. Thanks a lot.
Um, I'm booked in a flight to London today.
I'd like to postpone it until tomorrow, please.
Those shoes.
The black ones with the red sole.
I'd like to try them on. please.
Oh, excuse me, dear. Could you tell me how to get to this museum from here?
I think it's...
I think it's back here.
- Let me show you. I'll walk you.
- Oh, thank you.
Alex, ten minutes!
This is it right up here.
- Here. Keep the change.
- Thanks.
Thanks.
How much better that man should fall before the lion than the wolf.
The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.
Be not afraid, good youth.
I will not have you.
And yet when wit and youth is come to harvest, your wife is like to reap a proper man.
I'm right here. Sorry.
There lies your way.
Due west.
Excuse me.
Then westward ho. Grace and good disposition attend your ladyship.
You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?
Stay!
I prithee, tell me what thou thinkst of me.
That you do--think...
Sit down.
- You are...
- Sorry.
Not what you are.
Is that her?
Yeah, that's my girl.
Then think you right.
I am not what I am.
I would you were as I would have you be.
Would it be better, madam, than I am?
I wish it might, for now I am your fool.
You're in love with this guy. and he is asking you to help him get another woman!
You're upset. you're confused. it's tearing you up inside!
You have been in love before. haven't you?
By my innocence, I swear, and by my youth,
I have one heart, one bosom, and one truth.
And no woman has, nor never none shall, mistress be of it to save I alone.
And so adieu, good madam.
Nevermore will I my master's tears to you deplore.
She's good.
Look, I should really get to the airport.
Yeah. Yeah.
If you have to go, go.
I'm sure Alex is gonna be disappointed she didn't get a chance to meet you.
Tell her she did a great job.
And I'll see you on Monday.
I will. Hey, Matt, thanks for everything.
It means a lot to me.
I'm sorry you didn't find Lisa.
Yeah, me, too.
- I'll see you around, huh?
- All right, man.
Hey, Alex.
Alex, it's me.
Please go away.
C'mon, baby. Open the door.
I don't want your friend to see me like this.
He won't. He left.
What? He left?
Did I scare him away?
Scare him away?
You blew him away.
You blew everyone away.
You were unbelievable.
He just had a plane to catch.
A slow one to China.
Open the door.
Did he find her?
What?
Your friend--did...
Did he find Lisa?
No, it just turned out to be some...psycho with the same name, same everything.
He slept on her couch and ran away as fast as he could.
Are you okay?
Alex. you've gotta help me.
What's wrong?
Well, I booked this job-- a European tour of Cabaret.
Oh, wow! That's fantastic!
I know. Some girl broke her ankle,
I'm taking over.
But listen, I can't find Matthew.
I've been looking all over for him, and my plane's leaving in two hours.
Did you leave him a message?
I can't really leave this on his machine, you know.
It's too complicated.
I wrote him a letter.
Do you mind giving it to him?
I've never even met him.
He doesn't knowwho I am.
It doesn't matter--just tell him you're my friend. It'll be fine.
You know what, and if he's not there... just let yourself in and leave it on his bed.
I really appreciate this.
Thank you so much.
Sure. Okay.
All right.
He asked me to move in with him.
Oh. What did you say?
I didn't really say anything.
I was late for a class, and I just sort of ran away.
I said I'd meet him tomorrow.
If I don't show up, you know, he'll go nuts.
Anyway, I have to go.
Thanks again, and I'll call you when I get there, okay?
Are you gonna do it?
Of course.
I love him.
Bye.
Bye.
Hey. this is Matthew.
Please leave a message.
Hey. It's me again.
Where are you?
Did you get my letter?
Anyway. I'm in Paris.
I'm at the hotel. You got the number in my last message.
Matt. please call me.
This is driving me crazy.
I need to speak to you.
Look. if you're angry at me. then don 't be.
Just call... please.
Bye.
I don 't know if I can stay with the show.
I feel like I have to come home and look for him.
No, l...
I wasn't gonna say anything before, but...
...when I brought him the letter...
...he wasn't expecting me, and...
...I found him in bed with another woman, Lisa.
I--I can't believe it.
Just...forget about him.
The best thing for you to do is stay with the show and... just forget him.
I really thought I knew him.
Just forget him.
He's not even worth it.
Luke, I'm so sorry.
No. Shh...it's okay.
I'm so sorry.
No. Please, don't apologize.
Please. God.
I know you're doing the best you can.
I just...
I just want you to know that l... that I love you.
All right? And I don't wanna play games anymore.
What's the point?
I'm just terrible at them anyway.
Do me a favor.
Grab that, would you?
Hello?
Hello?
- Who's this?
- Who's this?
This is Matthew.
Who is this?
Hello?
Hello?
Hey, what's up, kid?
I thought you left.
No, uh...
What are you still doing here?
I'm over at the... girl's apartment.
You went back to the crazy girl's house?
What the hell are you doing there?
I'm really starting to worry about you, man.
I'm starting to worry myself.
It's not just that.
I couldn't even get on the airplane.
The thing is...
...there's something about this apartment.
It's like Lisa's been here.
I know this sounds insane. but...
I think this is her place. man.
Well. maybe you're just hot for this crazy girl.
First thing you gotta do is get out of her apartment and get over here.
I'll tell you about some stuff. too.
I've had the most amazing night of my entire life last night.
Okay. I'll be over. Just give me a couple of minutes. okay?
All right. I'll wait.
Later.
- Hello?
- Hi. um...
May I speak to Matthew, please?
Who is this?
Um... this is Lisa.
I'm a friend of his.
I'm calling about my compact.
I think he might have found it.
Uh...which Lisa is this?
Pardon me?
Uh...I'll tell you what-- he's actually supposed to be here in a couple of minutes.
Hello?
Hello!
Hi.
Hi.
I'm sorry I didn't come back.
My, um...
...double shift turned into a triple, and I just couldn't get away.
That's okay.
Don't worry about it.
Are you mad?
No. Not at all.
I had a great time.
Where are you?
Well, I'm still at work but, um,
I'm just leaving now, so why don't you wait?
Yeah, I'll wait.
Okay. great.
I'll see you soon.
Let me. uh...
Iet me grab your phone number and I will have him call you when he gets in.
Um, you know...actually, could you just tell him to meet me at 3:00?
He'd know where.
Um, I'll be waiting for him.
3:00. Okay.
I--you know what, it can't be him already, but I'm expecting him.
Someone's at my front door. so maybe it is him.
So hold on a second.
Matthew, trust me, okay?
Meet me tomorrow in the park.
Same time.
Bye.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
It wasn't him. it was someone else.
But I promise you
I will give him your message. Okay?
Oh. Okay. Thank you.
I went to get cigarettes.
What's going on?
Matthew. He didn't leave.
He went back to that girl's house.
The crazy one.
Oh, the plot thickens.
Oh, yeah. It gets even better.
Listen to this.
So I hang up the phone, and five seconds later, Lisa called.
The real Lisa.
The one from two years ago.
She wants to see him.
You tell him?
No, not yet.
I'll wait till he gets here.
He's gonna be so happy, he's gonna hit the moon again.
I have to go!
- What do you mean?
- I'll call you later. I promise.
But I made breakfast.
My dad's famous potatoes.
Lisa called.
She wants to see him.
So, will you let me meet your friends?
Don't you have a store to run?
Oh, okay.
I can take a hint.
So we're going out tomorrow, right?
- Sure.
Okay.
Bye, and thanks for the lift.
Bye.
Matty. Hey.
Matty!
- Matty!
- Luke! Hey, man!
- How are you, man?
- I'm good. How are you?
Really good. Really good.
Oh, excuse me. Could I order an espresso while I wait for my friend?
Absolutely.
He's very impressed with what you've done. and he assures you that when you get to China...
... with much enthusiasm and support.
I'm sitting over here.
Excuse me. Champagne.
Excuse you.
No.
Uh, Miss Chin, this is my sister Rebecca.
Shit, shit, shit!
As you can see, uh...
Here, Sweetie...
Hello. Bellucci's.
May I help you?
Hello, may I speak to my friend Lisa, please?
She's the blonde.
She's sitting at a table behind the bar.
Yes. Just a minute. please.
Excuse me. are you Lisa?
Phone's for you.
It's a little noisy here. Why don't you take the house phone around the corner.
Okay. Thank you.
T o a long and prosperous marriage... of our two companies.
Excuse me. I'm gonna go make a phone call. I'll be right back.
No.
No.
- Hello?
- Hey, Lisa. It's me.
Hey. what happened to you?
I know. I'm so sorry.
I got stuck at work.
Look. Daniel's found me at the hotel.
Hang on.
Just a minute!
Look, could I stay at your place for a couple of days?
Yeah, of course. Um...
Go there right now.
I'll--I'll meet you there.
Hey.
Hey.
How are you, Lisa?
Good. How are you?
Good.
Thought you'd be in China by now.
That makes two of us.
Sit down.
- What's that?
- It's a present.
- For me?
- Yeah.
I saw that yours were-- yours were broken, so...
Uh, wanna try them on?
That's very sweet.
You didn't have to do that.
Oh, that's okay.
They're a little big.
What size shoe do you wear?
Seven.
These are 8 1/2.
I would've told you what size I was if l knew you were gonna get me some shoes.
It's okay.
I could exchange them.
You don't have to do that. I...
Anyway, I told a friend of mine l'd meet him for coffee before I left, so...
What? You're leaving?
Yeah.
Bye.
Hey, Luke. It's me.
Let's meet.
Jesus Christ.
What are you doin'?
I thought you were comin' by.
I, uh...I was comin' by.
I just lost track of the time.
I got good news for you.
Let's go have a drink.
I want you to meet someone.
Come on.
Come on.
Hey, babe. I came as soon as you called.
Look who I ran into. It's Matthew.
Matthew, Alex.
Alex, Matthew.
Finally you two meet.
Hi.
Hello.
Have a seat.
Hi.
Hello.
Want a cocktail?
Excuse me.
Hi, how can I help you?
What do you want?
A vodka rocks. Double.
Wow.
Baby?
You know what? I'll have, um,
I'll have a Seven and Seven.
Put it in a bucket. Not like a double, but more like a one and a half.
He knows how to do it.
Thanks.
You got it.
So what happened with your psycho?
You can say it in front of Alex.
She knows the whole story anyway.
Sometimes when you see someone from afar...
...you develop a fantasy.
Then when you see them up close, nine times out of ten, you wish you hadn't.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I was confused, so I went back to her apartment, and...
...thought I'd find what I was looking for, but I found something else.
Did you talk to her?
Just long enough for her to convince me that she's a liar.
No harm, no foul, though, right?
What do you think, Alex?
I mean, you know the whole story.
It's easy to stand back and judge.
You don't know anything about this woman.
I know that she has no conscience and no regard for anyone but herself.
I mean, what else do I need to know?
You make yourself into such a victim.
Nobody made you be with her. You can't even see what a hypocrite you're being.
I'm being a hypocrite?
How am I being a hypocrite?
- Yes, you are!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You guys. Hey, relax.
No, Luke. Hey, hold on.
Alex, I'd like you to explain to me how I'm being a hypocrite.
Who's to say this woman hasn't been in love with you for a really long time?
And now that she found you again, she wasn't about to let you go twice.
What?
Maybe... the first time she saw you, maybe she felt the way you did the first time you saw Lisa.
You remember that.
Love makes you do crazy things.
Insane things.
Things in a million years you never thought you'd see yourself do.
There you are doin' it.
Can't help it.
Jesus Christ.
Lighten up, you guys.
This woman--she's a nut.
She's psycho.
She's cuckoo-bananas, all right?
End of story.
Can we change the subject?
I actually have something to cheer you up.
Did you, uh, leave a note with the bartender here a few days ago?
Yeah, I did.
How do you know that?
'Cause Lisa called.
What?
Yeah! After you got off the phone.
She said to meet her at 3:00.
She couldn't wait long, 'cause she had to get on a plane to London.
W-where am l supposed to meet her?
She didn't say.
She said you'd know.
You don't know?
I think you know where.
It hasn't been that long, has it?
What?
You know, uh...
I'll ask Tony.
Maybe he'll know something.
You knew she was here the whole time?
This belongs to you.
It's from her.
"Matt. please don't think that I'm running away from you.
"I was so overwhelmed when you asked me to move in.
"I couldn't speak.
"My answer. of course. is yes.
I love you. and can't wait to come home. "
I'm not going to apologize for what I've done.
This is for me to live with now.
Now you see me for who I am.
Yes, I do.
Hey. Where you goin'?
Hey.
Where you goin'?
I knowwhere she is.
All right.
Tell me what happens.
That guy. He's um... more drama than a Mexican soap opera.
Luke! This...
This is over.
- What's over?
- Us.
How can it be over?
We haven't even started yet.
I'm not who you think I am.
I used you.
Taxi!
Come on.
Hey!
Hey, come on!
God!
Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Sorry.
Thanks.
- Goin' to Wicker Park.
- Yeah, right away.
Your attention. please.
Flight 862 service to London is now boarding.
Hi!
There you are!
Where've you been?
Your flight got in an hour ago.
I've been down to luggage claim and back.
- Rebecca.
- Hey.
I, um...
What's the matter?
Rough flight home?
Did you bring me back that little Chinese dress?
- Rebecca--
- You okay, Sweetie?
I didn't go to China.
What are you talking about?
Hi, Alex. You're never gonna believe what happened.
Matthew's back in town.
I can't marry you.
It would be a huge mistake.
You're gonna have to help me out, baby.
Did I do something wrong?
No, you didn't--
You didn't do anything wrong.
Rebecca, l...
I've been doing something wrong for the last two years.
I'm not...
I'm not this person.
I can't go back with you.
I can't do this.
I was gonna meet him in the park, but he didn't show up.
Yeah...I know.
What do you mean?
Lisa. I've been doing some really... horrible and selfish things.
What are you talking about?
I've been keeping you apart.
When we met two years ago,
I was in love with someone else.
And she just came back into my life.
She broke my heart-- and I'm sorry!
Oh, my God.
I--Rebecca, I know...
I know that I'm still in love with her.
I just--I needed you to know.
Knowwhat?
Know what, Matthew?
That I'm not the girl that can break your heart?
-AttackSecurity Agency.
- Chico, Guido's CarWash.
Benny, El Fresco High prom.
Nick, Newmark Mall.
And Alvin, missing Essex kid.
Trixie, army-navy store. Putyour name in there. Let's go to work, people!
- Alvin, that was my case!
- Ramon said you weren't interested.
I know what Ramon says to my backwhen I'm not here.
You're late again, Pedro.
You gotta find a very good reason to do that to me, Ramon... and even then you can't find it.
- Buzz off!. You don't sound sick.
- You promised me a case!
It's time to fish or get offthe pot.
What?
Well, you're not readyyet.
In uniform at the army-navy store oryou're fired!
Sounds good, don't it?
It sounds good. The thing is, is it gonna be good?
Come on. Come on.
- I got to go.
- All right.
Hey.
Hey, Trixie.
What?
Tasty morsel, ain't he?
More what?
You are interested in men, right?
C'est la vie.
" La vie."
- Everything cool?
- Yeah. Everything's fine.
Yeah, everything's fine.
You know what?
I was standing over there, and I saw you put that CD down your pants.
- You did?
- Yeah.
Where wereyou standing?
I didn't seeyou put a CD down your pants. Is that whatyou're telling me?
Okay, we can do this the easyway, orwe can-- Hey, where areyou--
He's got a knife!
Oh, my God! Help me.
Somebody get help!
You're gonna be fine.
Hey, Trixie, listen, we're taking up a collection for Ricardo... so, you know, ten, five bucks-- whateveryou got.
What, do you want change?
Forty bucks?
Trixie, a friend called last night.
They're looking for casino security up at Crescents Cove.
Pickpockets, mostly. The regular security handles the rough stuff.
You don't even need a piece.
No guns?
Foryou, maybe a little makeup.
They need an answer, like, now.
Good references.
Great physicals.
You know how to gamble, Miss Zurbo?
Blackjack? Craps?
Yes, ma'am. Back in Chicago my brother took me to a private club... for members and nonmembers only... and they showed me how they do it.
There's nobody else, Angie.
There is nobody else.
Miss Zurbo? Trixie?
You got the job.
Hours are 9:00 to 5:00.
P.M. to A.M.
Watching the late, late show
Don'tyou wishyou were there instead ofhere
Snuggled in an armchair with a bottle ofbeer
Anthony Newley!
On your TV when you're sitting at home
This is the biggest jackpot you've ever won!
Okay.
The strawberries.
That's where I had them.
I proved beyond a shadow of a doubt, and with perfect geometric logic... that an identical key to the icebox did exist... and I'd have produced that key ifthey hadn't pulled the Caine out of action.
Of course...
I can only recall these things from memory.
I'll be glad to answer any questions you may have.
- Can I get my soda, please?
- You got it.
One by one by one.
Would anyone care for a jawbreaker?
That's whatyousee whenyou're sitting at home
New lady bear, right?
" Lady bear?"
- You're under cover.
- Straw, no ice.
- Thanks.
- We both know that.
How'd you know we both know?
Ifyou knew, I wouldn't know.
And if I knew, you sure wouldn't know, either.
I was just saying you look real good out there.
Did you ever take a look at the superstars?
You know what their thing is?
It's hair.
You're gonna be a star, you gotta know how to fix your hair.
And I got plenty of it.
Cagneybelting Bogey
And Edward G. with his stogie
You see that guy right over there?
He wants you.
You're out ofyour rocker.
I don't even know him.
He wants every woman that walks into this place.
Come here.
He don't wear any drawers.
A real statue of Adonis.
But I still hate him.
Mae West,
"Oh, come up andsee me"
And Chevalier with his
"Mimi, Mimi"
How rude.
I'm Ruby Pearli.
Been coming here foryears.
It's Trixie, right?
Won'tyou come home, Bill Bailey
Won'tyou come home
And watch the late, late show
Listen, I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.
I watch the late, late show
Norman, look. The loons!
Watching that late, late show
We're coming up on 6:30 in the morning here in Crescents Cove.
Kind ofa chilly morning... about 50 degrees out there, but don'tyou folks worry.
I think we'll get to 70 degrees this afternoon when those clouds clear off... and it'll be a nice day down by the lake.
$ " Grizley's Motor Court"
Thank you for being such a wonderful audience.
There's a lot of love i n this room, ladies and gentlemen.
It's either that or carbon monoxide.
But, seriously, ifyou're driving tonight... please don't forgetyour car.
Mr. Stans, that was fantastic.
We sawyou in that community telethon you did with What's-his-name.
- You were so good.
- Thanks.
Ifyou're ever down in the McAllen-Brownsville area... we have a tractor pull in late August, and you are most welcome.
I won't miss it.
Thankyou.
The price offame.
So how goes the dawn patrol?
Job like that's gotta be tough.
I can handle it.
I'm sureyou can handle it.
Betyou don't spend even one second concerned... whether blood's bubbling from a guy's mouth or not.
You can't just sit there like a sore thumb. I'll tell you that much.
Exactly.
Right away, Mr. Stans.
You're very observant.
Drinking into oblivion is my second-favorite hobby.
Drinking into a stupor is my first.
I do it to remember.
Or forget, I'm never sure which.
So, Miss Trix... where areyou from?
I was born in Chicago.
Guess I'm from there.
My kind oftown, Chicago is.
- It's okay.
- Family there?
They died, mostly.
My mom died.
She had cancer from cigarettes.
My brother died too.
He was a cop.
He was a good cop.
My sister Gloria moved to Minnesota with her husband.
She's expecting a baby.
But I don't know if I'm gonna be an uncle or an auntyet.
I haven't met my father... so he may not be dead.
Though plenty of people around his age are dead now... so he could be dead.
I loved my brother.
Yeah.
Know what I love, Trixie?
No.
I love how we go on.
And we all somehow manage... to just keep going on.
Yeah.
I came up here 'cause I think that there were brighter clouds ahead for me.
Like this job.
And you're an expert at finding your man, aren'tyou, Trixie?
And keeping him ifyou want.
I haven't been on an actual caseyet... but I know that when I get on the trail of somebody...
I'm gonna get him by hook or by ladder.
See, a lot of guys out there think that it's about 50-50... between the evidence thatyou find and your own institution.
But I think that it's just the opposite.
I thinkyou gotta grab the bull by the tail... and look it in the eye.
And I guess I'm different in that way.
You're different, all right.
In a lot ofways.
Exceptyou're not a guy.
I'm a feminine--
I'm female.
You mean a woman.
Yeah. A woman.
And in your case, I'm sure that's just the tip ofthe iceberg.
But what about danger, Trixie?
- Danger?
- Yeah.
Can you handle it?
Notjust cops and robbers, but demons in the underbrush.
When it's a matter ofyou or them.
Like, doyou mean, do I have an ace up my hole?
No, I mean... could you pull the trigger?
Bang.
Okay.
Well... there's only one person besides me who could saywhat I'd do, and that's me.
I see.
Doctor, refill my prescription.
That guy smokes like a fish.
You mean Dex?
Mr. Dexterous?
He works for Red Rafferty.
Who's Red Rafferty?
Land developer, entrepreneur... and a vulgarian of the highest order.
You mean like the Shriners?
Let's just say... removing warts from his ass might be called brain surgery.
You know what I mean?
Hey, Robert Goulet!
Yes, Robert Goulet.
Uncanny, isn't it?
So what does Mr. Dexterous do?
Mr. Dexterous butters his own bread.
He's Red's deckhand, jack-of-all-trades... probably pokes Red's wife when Red's out of town.
Red's usually busy with his girlfriend Dawn.
Although I'm sure
Dawn does all the work.
But what do I know?
I like the accordion.
- Hey, that's my favorite music!
- How did I know that?
See, we're each tap dancers in the canoe oflife.
Whatyou must do, Trixie, is tip well.
That's what my mom taught me.
She was a waitress.
She said,
"Ifyou tip a better amount... you'll feel good aboutyourself, which helps your bone structure."
Of course it does.
It's certainly helped yours.
One simple glance tells me how generous you are.
I've seen that guy here before.
I don't trust him.
That woman's tongue is highly contagious.
Egads, listen to that.
I'm already starting to sound like her.
Okay, shooter coming out.
Lucky six.
Six is rolled.
The view from here is spectacular.
But always be up front with a lady.
You winning?
What?
No, I'm not winning.
Well, nowyou are.
I'm Dex.
Short for Dexter, Ambidextrous--
It's not my name at all, but that's what it's short for.
I missed yours.
A quiet girl.
Shoo.
What do I look like, a fly or something?
Yeah. You look like a fly.
Now go away.
Let me see whatyou got.
I've lived here 20 years.
Seen that water turn from blue to black.
It's the developers.
Says here that the government's gonna help save it from itself.
" Light at the end ofthe tunnel"?
More like an oncoming train.
This is my regular hangout.
This is my regulartable.
That's where I sit.
Not now.
Quiet girl.
Would you stop saying that?
I am not quiet.
Relax. It's a compliment.
Coffee, Dex?
- Yes.
- The usual?
- Yeah.
- Medium rare.
Right.
You wanna stay competitive, you should eat something more substantial...
Iike a nice, thickjuicy steak.
I wouldn't eat a steak ifitwas on a ten-foot pole.
Steak eaters are superior people.
You can eat steaks up the kazoo, but not me.
So how 'bout it?
You wanna make love with me tonight?
Okay.
Okay, but you can't blame a guy for asking.
See, I know what women want.
So I'm polite, and I ask 'em.
You do like guys, don'tyou?
I wish I had an answer for that question...
'cause I am really getting tired ofanswering it.
Why? Don'tyou know?
A virgin maybe?
No, too old.
I mean, you're probably not that active.
I could see how you might like girls.
But a virgin?
No, I don't think so.
Why do people always have to beat a dead horse to death?
Everybody talks about sex, so it ain't no big deal most ofthe time.
Butyou know why they talk about it so much, don'tyou?
You know?
Because they don't do it.
You see, I do it,
I talk about it... and I make no bones.
Except maybe the one.
So what doyou say, quiet girl?
You a virgin, orwhat?
No, I am not a virgin, okay?
Neither am I.
I didn't think so.
So how was it foryou?
See? This is what I'm talking about, and it burns my ass.
Ifyou're gonna be stingy, whywaste it on an amateur?
Most guys, they don't know how to touch a woman.
You have no idea.
Listen, I'm not a bad guy.
You should take some time to know me.
I don't have to knowyou,
'cause I already knowya.
Right.
The sleuth. Okay.
How's about doing a little sleuthing right now? See how closeyou come.
Pretty simple, I'm sure.
I dareyou.
Let me see, now.
You've been buttering up your own nest.
You've gone to the top ofthe tree... and you have caught the tip ofthe iceberg.
Doyou hearyourselftalking when you speak?
'Cause this is some lame shit.
You're disappointing me.
Oh, yeah? Okay.
Number one:
I'd sayyou're a Jekyll-of-all-trades for an ass named Red Rafferty.
Number two:
Your main job is when he's not in town, when he's some place else... so thatyou can guard the body ofhis wife... ifyou're not too busy posing for statues of Adidas.
How am I doing?
Medium rare.
We can sleep as late as we want.
Nothing to bother us.
Just the waves lapping against theyacht where I live.
Well, you already know that it's Red's charter boat... but I live there all by my lonesome.
Massage those tired feet ofyours.
Makeyou laugh.
When's the last time you had a really good laugh?
Don't monkey around.
I'm working.
First a fly, now a monkey?
That really hurts.
I'm not even human toyou.
I didn't say that.
Hey, I got 20/20 hearing.
I didn't mean it.
Most people condescend from monkeys anyways.
- Did you learn that in school?
- No.
I had to quit school in fifth grade to take care of my mom.
I hated school.
My old man wanted me to go to college, be a big success like him.
But I turned my back on all that.
Who needs all that money, anyway?
- I only need what I want.
- Dex.
So... you halfin love with meyet?
Hop aboard.
I don't know how.
Just come to the end and step across.
What ifit sinks?
Can't swim?
Of course I can swim, but not ifI'm on a boat.
I've never been on a boat before.
Just step across.
Watch the slippery part.
Okay.
Okay.
You're all right.
You're all right.
Okay?
Oh, shit.
I am totally naked without any clothes on.
Yeah.
Turn around.
Listen, I forgot about this cruise I got today.
You can handle it.
You'll have a ball.
- Stay right there. I'll be right back.
- Bring my clothes.
What cakeyou pop out of?
Loverboy's latest, eh?
I guess he's slippin'.
- Red, sorry. She's--
- I know what she is.
You just getyour ass up there and sprinkle roses for the Senator... and you get out some cashew nuts.
The good ones.
- Dex, I want my clothes.
- Now!
Yeah. Right. Okay.
He's an idiot.
What's your excuse?
Do you speak?
Let me see something.
Excuse me.
I'm Red Rafferty.
This is my boat.
I know this is your boat.
You're Red Rafferty.
That's what I said.
Hey, Red, Senator Avery's car's pulling up right now.
It's too bad foryou I got more important things to do right now.
Let's hope there's enough life jackets to go around.
That's all I got to say about it.
The loose fish is okay, loverboy.
She might even come in handy.
Ifyou can't keep quiet, shut up.
- Should be fun, huh?
- I want my clothes.
You look great. Really.
You may be a big clog in his wheels, but not in mine.
I just want to get off.
I knew that.
Go away.
What a life, huh?
Yeah, it's a party of doom and gloom.
I like to come out here and let my mind swing free.
You don't wanna letyour mind swing too free. You'd loseyour head.
Don'tyou worry about that with me, sir.
What is it going to be, Drummond?
- You want the usual?
- Yeah. Scotch, neat.
- Two?
- Two fingers.
'Cause I know what can happen to you.
Ifl start pouring these drinks, things can--
Walt, you know what the best audience is?
What's that?
Intelligent, a little educated, and damn drunk.
I'll keep that in mind.
Jesus, watch it!
You want me to crash or something?
Turn this boat right around now, oryou are dead meat in thewater.
I alreadyforgot about this goddamn cruise because ofyou.
I crash the boat, six people including the state senator drown.
And it's your fault.
Yesterday I didn't get to say something that needs repeatin'.
I don't wanna ever seeyou again.
And I don't wantyou ever to see me again, either.
Boy's got a new girlfriend, and he's turned into a maniac.
Kind ofinteresting, though.
Listen, Avery, I was just thinking ofsomething.
- Who's that?
- Red's partners.
Her.
Her?
Red's friend. A singer.
Dawn Sloane.
And you know her, don'tyou?
Even though she's older.
I got a good one foryou, Drummond.
Oh, yeah? What's that?
How can you tell a Polack at a cockfight?
- He's the one with the duck.
- One with the duck. That's not bad.
How doyou tell a wop at a cockfight?
He's the one bettin' on the duck.
- Bettin' on the duck, eh?
- How doyou tell the Mob's been there?
I don't know. I thinkwe gotta vote for some senators with breasts.
We've been voting for boobs long enough.
The duckwins.
The duckwins.
I don't get that one.
I'm absolutely ravishing.
Where's the food?
Well, the nuts are over there.
Happyyet?
Hey, no!
I'll go.
Check out Miss America here!
Hey, fish, how would you like to be in a movie?
You got any talent there?
Let me checkyou out.
Sid, when I wantyour opinion,
I'll give it toyou, okay?
Walter, exactlywhere is that property line ofyours?
- In your pocket?
- I'll showyou. Okay, fish.
What areyou doing?
You getyour hands off me.
Easy, Red. Take a look at her.
She ain't worth it.
You get this punch bunny off my boat... or I'm gonna toss you both over face first, you got it?
- You and what army?
- Okay, here we go!
- All right. All right.
- Hold it.
Wait a minute!
All right, hold it.
Hold it now.
- Hold it a second!
- I'm all right.
- Hold it.
- I'm all right.
Now listen to me.
I'm gonna say one thing... and I'm gonna say it once.
This is like a circus.
You people are behaving like clowns.
And it's embarrassing. I'm supposed to be out here enjoying myself!.
And, quite frankly, this behavior-- this clown behavior-- is a little scary for me.
As a child, my father took me to the circus... and a clown killed him.
Walter, I wantyou to apologize to this young lady.
I wantyou to behave a little more gentlemanly towards her.
I mean... this young lady right here might tearyou apart!
- She might just ripyou a new asshole.
- You might be right about that.
Yeah, come on.
Show me this property line ofyours.
Come on over here.
How much moneyyou got in the bank?
Let me see.
Okay, Trixie.
Come on.
All right.
That's it.
Happy now?
Huh, baby?
Baby's not happy.
Okay, I told you I'd get you here safe and sound, didn't I?
That's it.
I know whereyou live, Trixie.
I can makeyou talk to me.
You're not very hungry today, honey.
You get some sleep.
What a little shock!
You want a tampon or a lollipop?
Little goodies. Anything?
So what'd you do on your day off?
Spend it with all the wrong people, like Dex?
Did he takeyou on one ofthose floating orgies... with Red and that phony slut Dawn?
How old areyou, anyways?
Here, look foryourself.
I don't got two pair ofhands.
You read it to me.
I got one that says "29."
One says "22."
"Sixteen."
Jiggers, the heat!
Make that two jiggers.
So how's Trix?
What's wrong, sunshine?
Nobody to playwith?
- Tell me more about those guys.
- Which guys?
Red Rafferty and the DeFlore brothers.
They look like phonographers.
Don't go fishing in darkwaters.
Forget about them.
They're lethal.
You mean like they got good lawyers and stuff?
No. Lethal as in deadly.
For the DeFlores, it's always about fists.
Vince was 1 4 before he knew he had fingers.
Then again, inbreeding is how we get championship horses.
As for Red... to put it soyou might understand... the sword of Damocles is hanging over Pandora's Box.
Is that like cutting offyour nose in spite ofyour face?
Close.
Red can't afford to build overpriced condominiums... because schmoes like us can't afford to buy them.
You might say his limits are limitless.
And the politics guy?
Big fish in a small pond.
I'd love to be an eardropper on thewall when they're talking.
Kirk, anotherfive minutes.
Five minutes.
Towhat? I've left more people than this in bed.
What about Dawn Sloane?
I mean, she's no fried chicken.
Oh, baby, now
Yeah,yeah
All overyou
That's her.
Wow
What can I do
Oh, baby, now
Yeah,yeah
Want to complete 20 questions... and ask what
I think of Dex Lang?
No.
I quit Red tonight.
Unloaded on the sadistic son of a bitch.
He's being shitty to Dawn.
They're crazy.
You don't know the half ofit.
Goddamn crooked politician.
I did not like the way he was looking atyou.
I've neverwanted a woman the way I wantyou.
Wait. Shit.
- Wait. Hold on.
- Oh, yeah. Come on.
Wait a second.
Where's Dawn?
Where is she?
Where's the goddamn tape?
Come on, Sid.
He don't know nothin'.
Seeya later.
- Quit screwing around, Sid.
- All right, let's eat. I'm hungry.
- Chinese?
- Sure.
When I was a kid, I got hit on the head with a bowling ball... and I woke up unconscious.
My mom took me to the hospital forX-rays... but they didn't find nothing.
Quiet, girl.
I'm outgoing.
Quiet.
I don't care.
Inside I'm outgoing.
You started to make some noise there.
- Unplug these tubes and help me up.
- You can't move, Dex.
I can't stay here.
They'll find her.
This is your chance, Trixie.
You've gotta find Dawn first.
No matterwhere it leads.
Orwho it hurts.
What did he mean about a tape?
He's just a frightened little baby boy.
- He's okay, Ruby.
- No, he's not.
Let me go.
He's still in love with her.
Isn't he?
She's gonna get him killed, you know.
She's the devil.
Doyou know Dawn Sloane well enough to be acquainted with her?
Do I know Dawn Sloane?
First it was her, then it was me... now it's you?
Doyou know any family that she might be related to?
Mr. Slotnick--Jacob...
I need to talkwith you aboutyour sister's case...
'cause there's a lot of uncertainty that's not clear in my mind.
But could we go inside first?
It's probably not so cold there.
Doyou live here alone byyourself,Jacob?
Yup.
Does your sister Dawn ever come here?
Nope.
Why not?
Mostlywe'd just argue.
You've been arguing with Dawn?
Nope.
- You haven't been arguing with Dawn?
- No.
- No, you haven't been arguing?
- Yes.
- Yes.
- That's right.
Okay, so... when was the last time that you saw Dawn... with your own eyes?
Couple ofyears ago.
Christmas.
Did she ever say that she had some trouble?
Dorothy stays away from trouble.
- Dorothy?
- Stays away from trouble.
Do you have any idea where she'd go if she had some trouble... and she wanted to stay away from it?
Nope.
These questions are for clues to follow.
Ifyou don't have clues... the bread and butter can be cut right out from underyour feet... and then if anything bad happens, there's only one person to blame... and that's each other.
She calls.
- On the phone?
- Well, of course on the phone.
So... when was the last time that she called you on the phone around?
This morning.
Dawn Sloane called you this morning?
- Yup. On the phone.
- Well, why didn'tyou say so?
I just did.
- Can I helpyou?
- Who's in room 304?
Why?
We're old friends.
She'd be a parasite for sore eyes.
What's she look like?
Hair that men like... and looks like a lymphomaniac.
- Yeah, that's her.
- Is she alone?
I just bring the food.
Who is it?
It's the person who makes the room clean.
The maiden.
What doyou want?
I got towels.
What areyou doing?
I've seen you--
You get out.
How did you find me?
Nobody knows where I am.
Bring a black pot ofhot coffee right away.
- We've only got silver pots.
-Just do it.
It was so sick... what they made me do.
They didn't have to go that far.
But...
I got 'em good now.
I'm gonna get $1 00,000 from him.
Maybe, I don't know, 200,000.
Ifl can just get his secretary to give him the messages.
- What?
- We're gettin' out ofhere.
No. No, I've got to have a drink.
- No.
- Please give me the bottle.
You are not drinking yourself into Bolivia.
Where?
Who areyou?
I'm me.
You are goofy.
Nobody ever told you that before?
It's not irrelevant right now.
You're never gonna get a guy.
I mean, look.
This is what guys want, okay?
Let's get real.
You probably don't even like men.
Maybe you're lucky.
Doesn't matter.
Dex is the one.
He makes me feel special.
Okay.
You tell Avery the ball is in his court now.
I'm gonna make him a special deal.
Fifty thousand for the tape tonight.
Fifty thousand's good for both sides, right?
A sex scandal's gotta be worth that much, huh?
We'll split it. You and me.
I just--
I want to get away--
I want to get away from everybody.
I want to just--
I want mywhole life to be different.
Before it's too late for me.
Night and day
Day and night
I never do anything worthwhile.
God doesn't love me anymore.
That's not true.
- Forget it.
- I can't forget it.
I'm the worst person alive.
I make one mistake after another.
I've ruined my career.
Hey, nobody's human.
It's the way things are.
All right?
Now we gotta go.
I want to go to sleep.
Later. Come on. Put on some shoes,
'cause I am driving you back in my car.
No. No, no, no, they'll find me.
I'm staying right here, and there's nothing you can do about it.
Dawn, your life has gone to hell in a handbag.
I don't care.
You just--
You call Avery right now.
Oryou get out!
Room service.
It's only four bucks, lady.
I don't wantyou letting anybody into this room when I'm not here... unless I recognize them.
Or I'll beatyou up good.
Excuse me.
These offices are locked... but I need to talk to Senator Avery so that I can speakwith him.
The old boys usually go to the Forum Club around now... up on Capitol Drive, butyou'll need to wear a dress.
Yeah, I figured.
Hey, thanks.
No public servant can take money for favors.
- Doyou smell mothballs?
- I thought it was the dress.
Hey, Elly May.
Senator, sir?
Remember me, please?
Well, now.
I'm used to a little scratching on the doghouse... before sharing the bowl here.
No, thankyou.
I'm not thirsty.
Miss, I didn't askyou to sit down.
And I didn't hearyou ask me.
Sorry, sir.
Can I sit down, sir?
Sir...
I was on Red Rafferty's boat last weekend.
- Is that a fact?
- Yes, sir, it's a fact.
And it was stupid too.
Oh, I see.
It was a stupid fact, huh?
Well, then...
Iet me try and teach you about facts.
Especially around this place.
It's a fact that in my district we lose one farm every single month.
Now that's one entire family enterprise.
And doyou know what that does to me personally?
It just breaks my heart.
When I was a young boy, my pop--
The clown.
Anyway... he lost his farm.
It just ripped my guts out.
Now that's why I support this corporate vertical farming.
Now, it's an unpopular idea... butyou have to wearyour unpopularity as a badge ofhonor, don'tyou?
I thinkyou do, don'tyou?
Now, look.
You see those fellows over there-- sitting over there?
They have no badge ofhonor.
Those are the gutless wonders from across the aisle.
They preach hypocrisy and not democracy.
That, too, is a fact.
Don't you remember?
Me and Red almost got into an alteration... and you said that he should be more gentlemanlike 'cause I'd tear him apart.
Which is right, since I know
I could've kicked his ass.
And also, I'm a girl.
Awoman.
A woman. Oh, yes, you are indeed.
Very, very much indeed.
But I'm just flat-out sorry, miss.
I don't recall.
There were just so many people on that boat.
Oh, no, sir. There weren't.
There was... one, two, three... four, five, six, seven.
And then six, five... because number two had to drive the little boat for number one which is me.
So, back on the big boat there was five again.
Because he's still number two on my fingers.
I seem to be missing the point.
Senator, sir... it's time to swallow the bullet.
I know about the tape.
The tape.
You know about the tape.
What tape?
Areyou referring to the mother of all tapes?
People still go 'round and 'round about that.
I've stated on the record that Nixon's only crime was getting caught.
He'll still go down as the most effective modern president.
And he was a hell of a trapper.
Oh, boy.
Although most people think otherwise.
Did you ever hear about... this little luscious
Hong Kong tour guide?
He kept her hid at Bebe Rebozo's foryears.
I'm sorry. Poop.
This isn't whatyou came to talk about, is it, American history?
No, sir.
- I want to talk about the tape.
- Oh, yeah, the tape.
Well-- Areyou sure you're speaking to the right person?
Senator, I respect thatyou're a big wheel in a small pond... and I wouldn't botheryou otherwise.
But, sir, you are the right one.
I'm running for my eighth term.
Last elected by the largest plurality ever in my district.
I'm currently on nine legislative and culture committees.
Oh, I believe in culture.
I really do.
But just not too much culture.
Because too much culture just breeds a kind ofarrogance.
Eisenhower.
You know Eisenhower?
Well, he and that fashion model... that was just embarrassing.
His wife knew.
He should have stuckwith the double-breasted WAC... with her own built-in foxhole.
I find you very attractive.
Don't askwhy.
It's just freshness.
You're unspoiled.
I'm 52.
Divorced.
And a pretty fairjudge ofwomen.
I would sayyou're the genuine article, aren'tyou?
Why areyou getting so nervous?
I don't bite.
Sir, this is my first case and I'm still green behind the ears.
But... one person has already been beaten up good... and another is scared ofthe same thing, only better.
Pretty soon somebody could get killed here... and die!
Die?
Who the hell areyou?
And what in God's name areyou talking about?
My name is Trixie Zurbo.
I'm a private defective.
You mean detective?
Detective.
And I'm giving 1 00% to this case.
And what I got left, I'm giving to help people out oftrouble... because ofthe tape.
Now, I know it can't be the bad singing tape, so it's gotta be another one.
And I'm asking you sinceyour name has come up and been mentioned... yours and Red's... and the DeFlore brothers and their fists.
I need answers, sir.
Otherwise, it'd be like looking through a needle for a haystack, you know?
Sir... why is this tape worth so much money from you?
Does it involve the land deal and those luxury pandemoniums?
Is money the root canal of all the evil here?
Those are pretty serious allegations, young lady.
Slimy too.
There's a big, empty grave out there... where all the falsely accused politicians lie.
You just ask Newt.
And ifthis Red Rafferty is abusing my good name...
I'll have him punished.
And whateveryour involvement is in this... the same goes foryou.
You may be hearing that tape on TV.
And then everybody will know about it.
It's very easy to throw grenades... but it's very, very hard to catch them.
Sir, the ball is in your camp.
So, now, what is it?
Blackmail?
Is that what this is, is blackmail?
Well, I suppose that comes with life... in the old fishbowl.
- Areyou married?
- No, sir.
Why areyou asking me that?
Oh, it's just that a woman's... sexual temperature is... never lost on me.
Gals maybe, huh?
Threesomes?
Team creams?
Senator, I know life can't be easy for people likeyou in a bowl offish.
But I am not gonna sit back on my hunches about this.
I see.
Well, I am going to say one thing and one thing only.
So listen carefully and hearwhat I am saying.
I am one ofthe few-- one ofthe very few... who will admit that all politicians... are guilty ofsome misdemeanors.
It's just inherent in the office.
But we are sworn by oath... never to go beyond the bounds of reasonable dishonesty.
What kind oflame duck is that?
Doyou hearyourselftalking when you speak?
You hear this.
Nobody can influence me.
Not power mongers with short penises.
Nobody! Nobody at all!
And a woman?
Even less.
Now leave my table, immediately.
Can I have Dawn Sloane's room?
- That line's busy.
- It's busy?
- It can't be busy!
- Well, it is.
Okay, okay, bye.
Hey, easy.
But that machine took my money in return. And no gum.
The service guy don't get here till 9:00 and we can't refund. Station policy.
It's only 7:30.
You wanna hear a good joke?
Knock, knock.
Come in.
Is that it?
Where's the laboratory?
The lavatory?
It's inside around the corner.
It's ten bucks.
Listen to this. It's great.
Knock, knock.
- Who's that?
- No, it's "who's there?"
Can I help you?
She's registered as Dorothy Slotnick ofCrescents Cove.
Wristwatch stopped at 7:30.
Must've been when she jumped, orwas pushed.
Gravity is a bitch.
She called her a lymphomaniac, which I thought was rather crass.
She told me to get her a black pot of coffee. So I did that.
When I came to the door, she gave me five bucks to watch her room.
She sounded like a five-year-old child.
There's no Mr. Lang in our hospital.
He's checked out?
He couldn't walk on his legs to check out.
He wasn't discharged.
He'sjust gone.
He's escaped?
But seriously, ifyou're driving tonight, please--
Don't forget your car.
You took the words right out of my mouth. Good night.
Just keep bringing me these until I can't pronounce my name.
She was dressed like a nun with a sexy habit.
A habit that would make a bishop put his fist through a stained glass window.
- What's with the getup?
- I'm in a cognito.
And I need to talk to Dex.
Safer to swim with piranha.
Ask Dawn Sloane. Poor messed-up kid.
Finally got the front page.
Tell me ifyou've seen her.
Not for days.
Areyou okay?
Something's wrong.
It's bad wrong.
Pushing a lady six floors has rarely been considered virtuous.
Dex didn't do it!
I know he didn't do it.
Ifyou have thoughts you can think of,
I've moved to the Motel Embers Motel.
Trixie, old Arabian proverb:
Trust in Allah, but tieyour camel.
Thanks. I don't smoke.
How did you find out where I lived?
- Where's Dex?
- I don't know.
- Where is he?
- He's not here.
Hey, babe.
Mommywants you back in the bedroom.
Can you do that?
What else doyou want to know, Miss Dick?
Who the father is?
Maybe it's Dex.
Maybe not.
No, you don't know a thing about Dex... or me or about that bitch Dawn.
You're no better than any of us, not even Kirk.
Your little pal's an ex-con.
He murdered somebody once.
In cold blood.
But I fucked him anyways.
'Cause who cares?
Why don'tyou go home and chaseyour shadow for a while?
You're never gonna catch that man.
You're wrong.
Even ifl am between a rock and the deep blue sea...
I am gonna fix this thing.
It's Dex.
You escaped?
They made herjump.
They pushed her.
Doyou have a gun?
Yeah. So?
So I'm gonna blow their pinheads off.
Not with that.
Oh, I'll do it.
Don't worry.
You should know that about me.
Along with the other shit.
There's no bullets. How can you shoot somebodywithout any bullets?
I don't care.
It's brains, not bullets anyway.
What's that?
For the ticker.
Without these little babies, it'd be "Good-bye, cruel world."
- And now my parents are coming.
- My clues!
Wanna take me back.
Can you believe that? Backwhere?
To the rich life we used to lead?
Sorry. Too old for that.
I'm glad you're here.
I'm glad you're okay.
Areyou okay?
- Why are we doing this?
- Why not?
- We don't want him to see us.
- Why not?
Because then he'll see us.
Good.
Red, you in there?
Did you maybe run or something?
How far doyou wanna take this?
- Come on.
- How far doyou wanna go?
Come on. Listen.
Dawn told me she hid the tape in a secret place and didn't tell anybody.
Areyou one ofthe people she didn't tell?
I know a little bit about Dawn's secret place.
Take me there.
Wake up.
Go to sleep.
Go on stage.
Make love.
Clues.
Assholes!
Get inside. You missed!
Assholes!
You shot my brother.
You shot my brother.
Stop there right whereyou are on your tracks.
I hate hospitals.
You have some nerve, young lady.
That was not our boy.
Joe, please.
It's all right. We remember Charlie as healthy and happy-go-lucky.
- That wasn't Charlie.
- Here's Dr. Gold.
Mr. and Mrs. Lang.
I'm sureyou're aware your son's condition... is compounded by his enlarged heart.
We drove 500 miles last night becauseyou tell us our boy is here... and then you show us that.
He's conscious. Vital signs are stabilizing. Bullet went through him.
But it's early. Your HMO won't cover his preexisting conditions.
- God, I hate hospitals.
- Your secondary carrier is?
I want him out ofhere!
Well, I'll go to Admitting.
Get a few forms.
Just a mere clerical thing.
We gotta stop meeting like this.
- Get me out ofhere.
- You can't leave.
You got more tubes than you can shake a cat at.
Did you see my folks out there?
Not so rich, huh?
They got something better than money.
Better than me.
I gotta go.
You gotta go all the way now.
We can't do it here now, can we?
What?
You halfin love with meyet?
Let's jump offthat bridge when we come to it, okay?
The other half's better.
You can't be in a patient's room.
Areyou a patient?
- She's with me.
- I'm leaving.
Well, you're certainly feeling much better.
I don't understand this.
I thought that we had talked about this before.
I want my money, Red!
I've tried to teach you about patience.
I don't believe this!
I thought I'd been good toyou guys.
You don't know what real work is because--
Is this whatyou want?
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Come on and kill me, you stupid sons ofbitches! Please!
Kill me!
I don't even care!
Oh, God!
Listen, fellas.
I'm sorry.
Sons ofbitches!
Oh, God.
You?
What areyou doing here?
Oh, I see.
All right. I rememberyou.
Is this the wayyou want it?
What is wrong with you?
You killed Dawn Sloane, didn'tyou?
Areyou kidding me?
How dareyou.
I don't have time foryou.
Goddamn it! Leave me alone.
Did you push heryourself orwatch your pin cushions do it?
I loved Dawn!
Okay, maybe it wasn't love.
But it was something.
What areyou doing?
What doyou want from me?
She's dead now.
She's never gonna be the same again.
Nobody everwanted anybody the way I wanted Dawn.
Oh, God, it's bad now.
Everything is bad now.
It's a bad world we live in.
You did it.
Butyou're gonna make a 1 00-degree turn and confess.
Confess to what?
I loved her!
The very best I knew how.
Why doesn't anybody understand these things? They take time.
I even told mywife about her, for God's sake!
- That doesn't mean you didn't do it.
- I didn't kill Dawn.
You think I'd be lying now?
I came up here to join her. This is it.
Hang on.
Don't let go. Notyet.
Wait a minute.
I'm not readyyet.
Listen. She knew it was just business.
I don't use women like that.
Just this once.
All right, well, maybe just that one other time.
I swear, I'm not like Avery.
I never killed anybody.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Wait. Where areyou going?
Listen.
Just give me a hand here.
Wait a minute.
I'm not safeyet.
I loved her.
I loved her!
Goddamn it! I loved her!
That's why I'm tellin'ya
I'm gonna getyou
Andgetyou, getyou
Shut up, Dawn.
Something inyour loving
Makes everything all right
Wow.
How do you sing Acapulco like that?
Good foryou.
Keep our humor going during these dark moments.
What's the matter?
I just wanna get going.
All in good time.
You can take myword on matters of patience.
You do trust me, don'tyou?
I assume that means yes.
Yeah. I mean, you can use your own discrepancy on that.
All right.
What aren'tyou saying?
Did you really go to jail?
Oh, I see.
Soyou wanna get going away from me.
- No.
- That's whatyou're thinking.
I don't have to believe what I think.
Seven years, minimum time.
Astoundingly good behavior.
Best reviews of my life.
Better than when I opened forTrini Lopez.
Butyou killed somebody dead.
- Murder.
- I didn't murder anyone.
I did, however, slaughter a man... in my own defense.
I am not by nature... an offensive person.
I know.
I meantyou no harm, Miss Trix.
Lucy, you can't be in the show.
Oh, why, Ricky?
Just turn the big old lights on little old me and let me loose.
Like a real star.
Right?
Yeah. You look like a star.
Dress like that tomorrow.
In full regatta.
It's me.
Areyou all right?
Does the pain really hurt?
My old man hates hospitals as much as much as I do.
I'm going homewith them, try and get healed.
You're going home?
Soyou're okaythen?
Can you comewith me?
Averywould just make out like a banshee then.
I got a good plan. Honest.
- I can't go back to square zero.
- Oh, shit.
Maybeyou still need a doctor.
No, I need something else.
Please don't ask me to quit.
Please don't.
I'm proud ofyou.
Quiet girl bucking the odds.
Except I can't helpyou now.
You did help me.
- Did I?
- Yeah.
Not like I could on a good day.
Look at them.
Standing there in spite of everything.
Can't buy that, can you?
See, I'm rich after all.
You too.
So bet big for both of us.
The less you bet the more you lose when you win.
I know that.
I will.
We got a long way to go, son.
Got a long way to go.
Beatrice.
Good-bye.
It's just for now, though, okay?
It's not the real good-bye.
What's real, Beatrice?
- I got to pee-pee real bad.
- Not in my caryou're not.
Oh, easy foryou to say.
It hurts.
I hate stakeouts.
What ifhe didn't do it?
What areyou talking about?
Of course he did it.
Besides, he's guilty ofso much shit, whatever comes to him he deserves.
You know what they say about lies.
A lie gets halfway around the world before truth can get its pants on.
There he is. That's him.
Where?
You didn't tell me he was cute.
Knuckleheads.
Ifwe win, we win.
Ifwe lose, we spare ourselves untold agony.
Leave it here, will you?
How's thatyoung wife?
Fine, sir.
- Takeyourjacket off.
- What aboutyours?
I'm saving mine for later.
Hey, Al, ifyou wanna avoid a train wreck on this thing... call us in to conference.
Ifyou don't, when I get a chance to wreck that train, I'll wreck it.
Bullshit.
When you get tired ofbeing stupid, we'll talk.
- Walk in halfmoons.
- Halfmoons.
Keepyour shoulders back and sparkle, peanut.
Good. Own it.
And pose. You look great.
Own it.
Okay, dazzle them.
We stole it fair and square, Bob.
Al's really spooked.
He's got a cob up his ass.
There he is.
Hello.
I wouldn't piss down his throat... ifhis heart was on fire.
I gotta pee-pee really bad. Would you order me a peach daiquiri, frozen?
Honey, where's the ladies' lounge?
-Just around the corner, miss.
- Thankyou.
Could I have a peach potpourri?
I'll try.
Tell the guys we did a good job.
I'll do that, Drummond.
Don't make me hurtyou.
Let go!
Come back here! Shit!
Mister, you okay?
Damn it!
Watch the language you use around me!
- Doyou know whatyou're messing with?
- Get in the trunk in back.
Come on.
Don'tyou know the score?
- Yeah, two-zip to me. Do it.
- Very cute.
I'll lose my damn job.
I'll tell you what else.
I'm not paying for this car.
I'm a government employee.
I work for a state senator.
What's up?
Can I have the bag, please?
Give me the fuckin' bag!
Okay, bend your legs and knees, all ofyou, over there.
Wait. Get naked out ofyour clothes.
- What?
- Do it. Naked. Take them off.
Kiss your lips to the ground.
Do it!
- Now sayyou're sorry.
- Sorry.
- Where have you been?
- Don't even ask.
You're out ofbreath.
Okay, let's do it.
- Now?
- Yeah.
I mean, snowmobiling is a very big business.
Now, we've put together this pamphlet thatyou can look at in your own time.
Mother Nature is sometimes a neglectful mother... as it were, and doesn't always provide for her children.
And it's snowmobiles that help create the tracks--
This table is reserved for senators.
Senator Avery, sir?
Theyoung lady can join us, ifyou would like.
- How kind.
- You're lovely. Thankyou.
Well, come on over.
You people don't mind?
No, not at all.
That's fine.
- There we go.
-James, get my coat.
There we are.
I'm Ruby.
What's your name?
Drummond.
Senator Drummond.
They love it.
The tracks make tracks for nature.
- What wereyou saying?
- Wild animals love snowmobiling.
The truth about snowmobiling.
You folks seem just ready for a slam dunk.
Can't just let nature run wild, can we, young lady?
Yes, well, that's really quite something.
I hadn't thought ofit that way.
It's-- You know--
Well, you know, some of my colleagues... theywould toss you to the alligators just to watch them peel that... whole salami.
I'm sorry. It gets hotter than high school love in some ofthese sessions.
You know, even
Rough RiderTeddy, he had-- he had a condom named after him.
Oh, I tell you... sometimes after a session all you can do-- all you can really say is...
"Wham, bam, thankyou, ma'am."
You're welcome.
We realize it's gonna take a concentrated effort.
We're so glad that you're on board with us, Senator.
Another round, Senator?
Yes. Round and firm.
Silly me. I completely forgot to give them my I D at the bar.
You don't have to do that.
Sixteen?
- Let me see that. I'll handle this.
- Very good, sir.
I suppose I probably shouldn't have any drinks then.
Who the hell areyou?
Well, it seems like this young lady is trying to get me... to leave the table with my head between my knees.
Verywell, Senator.
We'll be in touch with your office.
This is a devastating situation ifyou're on the wrong side.
Senator Avery, Mr. Ladies Man.
Where's the videotape?
Wouldn'tyou like to know?
You're blackmailing me, you little whore!
Lady, what are you doi ng?
Leave the stereo alone.
Put your hands down.
Shut up, comprende?
I want my money, Avery!
After whatyou made me do,
I want plenty!
I'm not sure I know what this is.
I'm throwingyou out the goddamn window ifyou don't give me that tape!
That would make you a murderer, Senator.
No two-dollar whore is gonna ruin my career, slut!
Thanks.
- What have we got here?
- You.
You are disgusting!
A disgusting pig!
You're a rotten mackerel!
- Disgusting!
- Shut up! Get her out ofhere!
- Help me! He's insane!
- She's underage! Get her out!
What's on that recording?
Seems like somebody's trying to convince--
- Not out the front. Out the back.
- He's the killer!
He's the killer!
He's the fuckin' killer!
He killed Dawn Sloane the singer.
Senator, what areyou listening to?
So this is that tape.
You did it. Get her!
Get her! There she is!
Oh, shit.
What's the matterwith you, huh, boy?
Get out of myway!
That's it! I quit.
Get out of myway!
Senator, can you tell us what's going on?
Sure I can tell you what's going on.
Certain people are only at peace when they're causing war on other people.
They come out here with airs up theiryou-know-whats... and they have no respect whatsoever for the finest climate under the sun.
Excuse me, folks.
- But, Senator--
- Now, wait. Wait.
Now you folks put 'em on the news and they claim the climate's ruined them.
I would be ashamed to haveyourjob.
You're two-faced.
Senator,just one question-- just one question about the tape.
Doyou wanna make a statement about what just happened?
What's your position on it?
The truth is... in terms of size and shape... and direction... we're all normal men.
And one word sums up... the responsibility of each of us.
And that one word is...
"to be prepared."
Everybody out!
Come on. Let's go.
Clear it out.
Move!
Clear it out, people. nothing was ever achieved by perfect people... because you can't find 'em anywhere!
For Christ's sake, FDRwas poking his secretary for 30 years!
And what happened?
Did the world fall apart? No.
Did the bottom drop out? No.
Nothing happened.
Nothing changed.
But the critics, those little demented bastard bag ladies... they keep digging it up.
They are the ones that would be enormously improved by death.
Maybe we should hang 'em all.
Your comments are a little vague.
What exactly areyou admitting to, sir?
After my pop died--
Well, you folks know that story.
I've told it toyou before.
But I was raised by my grandmother and some of my aunts.
And they shaped my life.
They convinced me, as a young boy... that there was always a cookie available.
And even today, deep down,
I'm that little four-year-old.
And when I wake up, the first thought
I have is, "Where's the cookie?"
And that means... when you go to the cupboard... and there's no cookie...
I don't say,
"Geez, there's no cookie."
I say...
" I wonderwhere the cookie is."
Ifyou people are gonna tear down monuments... at least save the pedestals.
Because they come in very handy later on.
You know, I feel like
I've been raped byyou people.
I think this rape's just gone on long enough.
Eddie, get 'em offthe street.
News hour's over.
Oh,Jesus.
Let's clear the area.
There'll be no more questions.
Isn't life just a big bag oftricks these days?
Go ahead. I'm ready.
You sure?
I'm ready.
All right.
Maybe it's the beginning.
Or maybe it's the end.
I don't know.
Let's do it.
Come on.
Pull that thing.
Come on. Pull it.
For me!
Senator?
It's brains, not bullets.
Vote for the Sadomasochistic Party!
Vote for the Get Ahead and Die Party!
Come here.
I had that weasel in the palm of my hand and you just threw it out the window.
I don't understand. I had to crawl down a fire escape to get here.
I've got bruises covering mywhole entire body.
How could you concoct a plan and muck up the entire thing?
You should probably take up a deskjob.
What?
Where did you get that earring?
The store.
Where's the other one?
I'm losing my earrings all the time. I don't know.
You should be a lot more concerned about Avery than my goddamn earrings.
It's you, isn't it?
You just ruined another life...
Miss Dick.
This time, your own.
Did you push her?
How could you not even think aboutyour baby?
How dareyou mention my baby!
How dareyou mention him!
You don't know anything about me.
You don't know anything!
You killed her now!
You're going down, baby!
The killer is you now!
The killer's over there!
She did it!
The killer's right there!
It's her! She's in disguise in the white coat!
Hold that woman!
I booked Ruby Pearli on a foot chase.
Then I saw a female, kind oftall.
Excuse me, sir.
There she is. That's her.
Who areyou and what doyou know about this?
Look, the crutch ofthe matter is... you get that earring from Ruby Pearli's ear.
Ruby Pearli, right.
Match it to the same one you found at the crime scenery... maybe even test iffor D and A... and you'll have clues coming out ofthe wormwood.
The wormwood?
Ruby Pearli killed Dawn Sloane... because she was jealous over Dex and his love.
Dex who?
I might know how she feels... but I would never show it that way.
It wouldn't be love anymore... not the way that I wanna love.
Lady, what the hell are you talking about?
I'm telling you the truth... the whole and the truth... and nothing but the truth.
Akelei. Akelei.
Claire?
- Move up.
- Thank you.
Roast mules go topsy-turvy.
Ten letters ending in "T."
- I'm hopeless at this.
- Me too.
"Somersault. "
Bletchley.
It's a walk.
I know.
I've been here before.
This bus for Yardley...
This bus for...
Hello? Yes.
I'll try that extension for you.
Please hold the line.
I'm just putting you through.
Yes, you're through.
- Mr Skynner?
- Come in.
It's been a pleasure, sir.
I never wanted you back.
Logie says he needs you.
Well... he's got you.
Conference in half an hour.
And keep your mouth shut.
You're only there for show.
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.
You do look bloody terrible.
- We missed you, Tom.
- I know why you want me back, Guy.
You've lost the crown jewels, haven't you? You've lost Shark.
We got a call from one of the intercept stations in Scarborough.
And they started picking up a single word broadcast on the hour, every hour... coming out of U-boat headquarters in Sainte-Assise.
- In Morse?
- No, it was a human voice.
- "Akelei. "
- Meaning what?
- It's a flower.
- I know it's a bloody flower, Guy.
Aquilegia. Columbine.
But what did it mean?
It meant,
"Change the weather code. "
The Germans have switched their U-boats to a new code book, and we're blacked out again.
Is that why the Yanks are here?
Skynner's in a panic.
They want to take over his empire.
Here comes our team.
- You! You!
- Hello.
- You in the Royal Navy?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Only for a day or two. I mean, actually on a ship.
- What was your ship?
Look, I can't be expected to remember every little thing.
Sorry.
Welcome to Bletchley Park, sir.
Three convoys left New York in the past week... and are presently at sea.
Convoy SC 122.
Fifty merchant ships carrying fuel oil, tanks... iron ore, bauxite, also meat, sugar and wheat.
Convoy HX 229 departed
New York on Monday.
Forty merchant vessels carrying explosives, manganese... timber, powdered milk.
Convoy 229-A left New York on Tuesday... carrying steel, timber, powdered milk.
I don't want a shopping list.
What's the total?
One hundred and forty-one merchant ships, gross tonnage just under a million tons.
- Plus cargo of another million.
- And where are the U-boats?
A submarine tracking rumour had three U-boat packs operational... in the North Atlantic as of OO hundred Thursday... here, here and here.
Midnight Wednesday?
- So where are the U-boats now?
- I'm afraid I have no idea.
I thought that was why we were here.
Our intelligence has been shut off.
You're telling us that the largest assembly of merchant shipping... we've ever sent across the North Atlantic... is now steaming towards the largest concentration of U-boats... the Germans have ever put in the North Atlantic... and you don't know where the hell the goddam U-boats are?
- Gentlemen, if I may...
- Shut up.
What are our convoys making, hmm?
Something over 220 miles a day.
Well, I'd say we have four days, maximum... before the convoys come in operational range of where you last had the enemy.
So, Leonard, this blackout... will it be over in four days?
Uh, it's possible.
Yes, well, all things are possible,
Leonard, but is it likely?
Is it likely that you can break this code, this, um... What'd you call this?
This Shark? Before our convoys come in range of the U-boats.
- We'll give it every priority.
- Yes, I know damn well you'll give it every priority, Leonard.
- That's not the question.
- Well, sir, as you press me, yes, I think we may be able to do it.
Is that what you all believe?
Um, well, I suppose you could say we know more about Shark now than we did the last time.
If Guy thinks we can do it,
I would certainly respect his opinion.
And you?
You don't seem to have much to say.
Tom Jericho. He's the one who got us into reading Shark. If there's anyone alive...
Can you break Shark again in four days?
Have you any idea what you're talking about?
Tom's been on sick leave for the last month, so I don't think he's fully in the picture...
Enigma is a very sophisticated enciphering machine... and Shark is its ultimate refinement...
so we're not talking about The Times' crossword.
It weighs 26 pounds, battery included... and goes anywhere.
The Enigma machine.
The Germans have thousands of them.
What's it do?
It turns plain-text messages into gobbledygook.
Then the gobbledygook gets transmitted in Morse.
At the receiving end, there's another Enigma machine to turn it back into the original message.
Press the same key any number of times, it will always come out different.
- And you have one of your own.
- Courtesy of the Polish Cipher Bureau.
So what's the problem?
Problem?
The problem is the machine has 115 million million million ways of doing it... according to how you set these three rotors and how you connect these plugs.
And that's Shark.
No. No, no, no.
This is the one we can break.
Shark is enciphered on a machine with a fourth rotor specially developed for U-boats... which gives it about 4,OOO million billion different starting positions.
And, uh, we've never seen one.
Holy shit!
I haven't understood a word.
Can somebody give me a straight answer to a straight question?
- Will this blackout definitely be over in...
- Nobody can say definitely, sir.
Yes or no?
- No.
- Thank you.
So it isn't over in four days.
When will it be over, hmm?
Hmm? Hmm? You.
Well, all I have to measure it by is how long it took last time when Shark first came in.
- And how long did it take?
- Ten months.
Well, this is a great day for Adolf Hitler.
Ten months?
But you did break it?
Yes.
- How?
- I'm afraid I can't tell you that.
I think it's time we...
I think it's time
I got back to London.
It's not just a million tons of shipping.
It's a million tons of shipping every week!
It's our capability to supply Russia, to support the army in North Africa... to invade Europe and drive the Germans out.
- It's the whole fucking war.
- Sir.
Satisfied? Now, send the stupid bugger back to where he came from.
Don't waste a match.
Back to Mayfair?
No.
How many people knew about the German weather code... how important it was to us?
A dozen, maybe. Why?
Make me a little list?
What are you doing here,
Mr Wigram?
You think there's a spy in Bletchley Park?
I'm Cave.
Naval Intelligence.
I'll be liaising with the admiralty.
They've given me an office in your hut.
I'm ultra-cleared.
- What does that mean?
- That means I know how you broke Shark, in principle.
You used a captured copy of the German Navy's weather code book.
Gave you a pretty good idea of what their weather signals were supposed to be saying.
Can I see it?
Midnight, two days ago, the Germans changed to a new book.
- So we lost that crib.
- Well, why do you think they did that just then?
Don't know.
And the other one?
Short signal code book.
The U-boats employ it for reporting their position, course and speed.
Unfortunately, if you don't know where the U-boat is or what it's doing... the short signal code book isn't much help as a crib.
Two men died saving those little books... from a sinking submarine.
Fasson and Grazier.
We caught the U-boat on the surface in the eastern Med.
The sub went down when they were inside trying to bring out its four-rotor Enigma.
November '42.
I was in destroyers.
It was my last ship.
Bletchley is the lucky number in this war.
- One and six, please.
- One and six.
Here you are.
Girls, guess I'm off.
- See you later.
- Yes, I'll see you later.
Miss Wallace?
Mr Jericho.
When did you get back?
Just today.
How, uh... How are you?
How am I?
Yeah, all right.
How is she?
She's... She's Claire.
- Well, will you tell her?
- If I see her.
She hasn't been sleeping at home the last two nights.
Sorry.
Good morning, sir.
- Worrying about your babies?
- Puck.
Thomas.
So, they say you're not crazy any more.
- It thinks it's found a possible.
- "It thinks"?
- Why not?
- Been in the hut?
- Come on. Get it over with.
- No, I'm fine, Puck.
Sure, you are.
Hey, Betty, wait for me!
Gentlemen, we have a ghost.
Tom, how the hell are you?
- Well. Very well.
- Have you escaped, or what?
- I thought this was the asylum.
- How are you?
- Good.
- Bloody hell!
- How's the revolution, Alec?
- Coming along, comrade. Coming along.
- T... T... T...
- Yes, it's me.
I, uh... I want to see all the Shark traffic we haven't been able to break.
- In at the deep end.
- Why not?
- Yes, why not?
- Have you got yesterday's Porpoises?
Open the file.
Besides, it wasn't really Shark that made you crazy.
Was it, Tom?
I suppose you all know.
You think I made a fool of myself?
Forget about it.
You're among friends.
So, what about the code breakers?
Kingcome, De Brooke,
Upjohn, Pukowski.
- Spot the odd one out.
- Puck lost his parents when Poland was invaded.
His kid brother is missing in action.
He hates the Germans.
Pinker?
Bit of an arty, isn't he?
He writes detective stories.
Baxter. They say he sleeps with a picture of Stalin under his pillow.
Perhaps you haven't heard.
Stalirs on our side now.
- And Jericho. The famous Mr Jericho.
- Mathematician.
Went off his trolley, didn't he?
About some girl.
We took him out of Cambridge on the first day of the war.
He worked himself into a breakdown, so we shipped him back to Cambridge to get well.
And that's all there is to it.
It's never all there is to anything.
Shift's not over yet, ladies!
The 3:OO's from Beaumanor all need blisting.
You know, without your glasses, you don't look half bad.
Do you know, without my glasses, nor do you?
Claire?
I'm here.
Sorry it took an age.
Well, now you know where I am.
It's, um, off the beaten track.
Yes, well, it's better than being snooped on by landladies.
Welfare found out I had a spare room, so I had to share.
But Hester's a sweetie, really. Oh, there's no sugar, I'm afraid, but it's lapsang.
And I always think sugar would rather spoil lapsang, don't you?
Don't know.
You're my first lapsang.
I knew you'd ask me out.
- I thought you asked me out.
- Well, I had to get you started. Arert there any pretty girls in Hut 8?
- How do you know where I work?
- We've got an interesting men tracking room in Hut 3.
- You're not supposed to tell me where you...
- Besides, you're rumoured to have done something very clever... and I want to know what it is.
Oh, my God.
Where did they find you?
Oh, where did they find any of us?
I'm the lucky one.
You know, they've got perfectly clever girls working like post office clerks.
Not like me on the German book.
I want that for my scrapbook.
- Can I see it?
- If you want. It's upstairs.
That's Hester.
And this is me.
You've been busy.
- Where is this?
- Loch Feochan, in Scotland, where I'd like to be old.
If I'm ever old.
Do you think it's beautiful?
Why are you a mathematician?
Do you like sums?
I like numbers.
Because with numbers, truth and beauty are the same thing.
You know you're getting somewhere when the equations start looking... beautiful.
And you know the numbers are taking you closer to the secret of how things are.
A rose is just plain text.
My God.
What have you done?
What has she done?
- Mr Jericho?
- Miss Wallace.
I came looking for Claire.
I was worried about her.
I could fill a bus with men who are worried about Claire Romilly... but that's no reason why
I shouldn't go to the police.
She'd be the first person they'd arrest.
Miss Wallace, please put that poker down.
And if you know where she is, for God's sake, tell me.
She's gone missing.
What are those, exactly?
Intercepts. German signals.
Yes, I know that much.
Five-letter groups. German Navy signals are sent in four-letter groups.
So this must be army or Luftwaffe.
Picked up by the radio scanners at Beaumanor.
All sent between 9:30 and midnight on April 17, nine days ago.
- But never deciphered.
- How do you know that?
Well, if it'd gone through the machine, then plain text would be stuck on the back.
All from the same source.
"ADU. ADU."
Does the call sign ADU mean anything to you, Miss Wallace?
Miss Wallace?
"Angels Dance Upwards. "
- What?
- Well, that's how we'd reference it.
- Who is it? Who is ADU?
- I don't know.
But you could find out.
Do you have any idea what you're saying?
We can't just go digging through Bletchley looking for information about missing cryptograms.
If we want to find Claire, then we need to find out what she was hiding.
- You think Claire is a traitor.
- Would it matter if she were?
Of course it matters.
Look... she was probably flirting with an officer and forgot to file those intercepts... so she hid them rather than get told off.
Or she stole them and then she ran away.
You really are mad, aren't you?
And I would have to be even madder to have any part in this little amateur sleuthing adventure.
Miss Wallace.
Miss Wallace!
You said yourself that she was missing.
Now, is that normal?
Is that her habit?
Well, she does always come home to change her clothes.
Well, there you are.
Is she seeing anyone, do you know?
What exactly is your interest here?
You can reach me at Armstrong's
Guest House in Albion Street.
ADU, Miss Wallace.
Angels Dance Upwards.
They call it Black Bottom the new twister
It's sure got 'em and, oh, sister
They clap their hands and do a raggedy flop and a hop
Old fellows with lumbago
And high yellow
The waves they go
They jump right in and give us all that they've got
They say that when that river bottom's covered with ooze
You silly, silly girl.
These people keep such funny hours.
I haven't heard...
Oh, Mr Jericho!
You have a visitor.
You can have the parlour.
We don't have guests in the bedrooms after 1 O: OO.
Oh, Mrs Armstrong, it's perfectly sweet of you to worry... but I don't mind taking the risk just this once.
Well, I suppose it's all right if you're from the park.
Mr Wigram, would you care for a cup of Ovaltine?
Ovaltine?
I haven't had Ovaltine since... no, no...
Ovaltine. Thank you.
I don't think my system could take it.
What a charming house.
And hunting prints.
Do you hunt?
Where are you based?
Here?
Bliss.
What can I do for you,
Mr, um, Wigram?
There's something
I've been wondering about.
You're the man who broke the U-boat code.
Hmm?
Champagne all around.
Happy days are here again, all right?
Then you fell out of your pram.
So what happened?
It was personal.
I can keep a secret.
Wonderful thing about war...
Peacetime is about keeping the people in their place.
But then war breaks out, and life was never so glorious.
The toiling masses turn into heroes... and their little women start dropping their drawers like debutantes.
- Well, if that's all you...
- And best of all, the swots.
Dragged out in a cloud of dandruff from some dim backwater... and invited to the ball.
At Bletchley, you're as glamorous as fighter pilots.
Girls you couldn't even hope to meet go weak at the knees... at the thought of the size of your brain, isn't that right?
If talking through your arse is what they teach you in spy school...
I'm talking about you and a girl called Claire Romilly.
We're rather worried about her.
Officially been missing for 14 hours, give or take. When in fact, it's more like 48 hours.
She hasn't been seen since she went off-duty on Thursday.
Rather a good friend of yours, I gather.
L- I haven't seen her since befo... since before I...
Quite.
Heard from her?
- No.
- Apart from the postcard.
Let's try to remember everything.
It saves misunderstandings.
Did you go to the cottage tonight?
Don't think about it.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Yes.
Mind if I sit down?
I've been away for a month.
I wanted to look her up.
You ever discuss your work with her?
- Of course not.
- Um, how about a gun?
- Any guns?
- A gun?
A gun from that museum of yours... liberated from a captured U-boat along with the code books, the captairs teddy bear and what have you.
All very improper and unsigned for, but I turned a blind eye.
But no reason why you should know, a chap like you.
Mind if I check the coat?
While we're at it...
- You sure you don't mind?
- I'm beginning to.
You see my point, though, don't you?
One day the Germans black us out in the North Atlantic.
Next day, girlfriend of crack code breaker disappears... vanishes.
- Code breaker returns, shiny new shooter goes missing.
- She's not my girlfriend.
Hmm? What is she, then?
We were... I suppose the phrase is
"seeing each other"... for about a month.
Is that what happened to you?
What?
Is Claire Romilly what happened to you?
There was a concert.
I went on my own.
Oh, it's you.
You found my slipper.
Afterwards, Claire, Hester...
Miss Wallace, who shares the cottage... and I, we came out together.
Next week was going to be Bach.
Oh, we must go.
Oh, I can't.
I'm on the night shift.
Oh, Hester. Poor you.
"Poor you," she said.
That's one of her phrases.
So, I asked her.
I say, I hope you don't think it fresh of me, but should we go together?
Of course you did.
And, uh, after that?
After that?
I had the happiest month of my whole life.
Not happiest. Something.
- You can! You can.
- I can't.
You can. Yes.
Ready? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
- Sorry.
- No, you can't.
- Claire!
- Aaron!
- May I?
- Do you mind?
No.
It's my favourite club.
- Mine too.
- Oh, yes, I'm sure.
How do you get the petrol coupons to go zipping up and down to London?
Secret, darling.
I know a chap.
- No, but how?
- It's not what you think.
Do you have to know everything?
I don't know why you want me.
Let's get married before it stops.
- Tom, don't.
- I love you!
They say you shouldn't fall in love in a war. You never know what's coming.
I love you.
I really love you.
No cottage.
- Is that code, darling?
- Yes.
- I want to see where you sleep.
- Landlady has rules.
So have I.
Hester's at home.
Oh.
I'll be quiet as a mouse.
Promise.
Shh. Shh.
Sleep with her?
I'll take that as a yes.
And then you quarrelled?
Quarrelled? No.
Claire? Darling?
Sorry, darling.
Go back to sleep.
- What are you doing?
- I'm just looking through your things.
No photographs?
You've never given me a photograph.
You're all secrets, aren't you?
I've no secrets from you.
Please come back to bed.
What's this? What's the entscheidungsproblem when it's at home?
That's just something
I was working on at Cambridge.
It's a... It's a theoretical machine that...
- Theoretical. So it doesn't exist?
- Please, come back to bed.
Well, this will do.
I want something of yours to keep.
Give it back.
- Why?
- Because it means nothing to you and a lot to me.
- Arert I clever enough, darling?
- Please, Claire!
No!
Give it back.
Give it back.
It's not funny, Claire!
Claire, I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.
I'm really, really sorry.
Claire...
She moved on.
Why won't you answer my letters?
Are you seeing someone else?
I'm always seeing someone else.
Yes.
She moved on.
Not right, Mr Jericho.
Can't quite put my finger on it... but definitely not right.
Were you surprised when they told you that Admiral Doenitz... had changed the German Navy weather code?
Any bells go off?
Germans were always nervous about Enigma.
Well, the Germans are supposed to think that Enigma's an unbreakable system... because it would take thousands of years to go through every setting... to find the one that turns the code back into the plain text.
Next day, it's different again. Using human beings, Enigma is safe forever... but we don't use human beings for that.
Do we...
Mr Jericho?
- No.
- No.
And that is the secret inside the secret.
All they know thus far is that the weather code opened a crack in the system... because somebody told them.
But what if somebody tells them just how we do do it?
Your thinking machine.
Clackety-clack, day and night.
Programmed with a menu, thanks to your big brain... that reduces the odds to just a few million to one... till it locks on to the winning combination.
There goes the war.
Oh.
I've got a little list.
You're on it.
Communists, foreign nationals... geniuses just this side of barking mad.
Altogether, a security nightmare.
But of all these names, Mr Jericho, you are the only one... who got himself fucked into a nervous breakdown by a missing blonde.
You live quietly from now on.
Where does one pee around here?
To the right.
Good night, Mrs Armstrong.
Talk to me!
What do you want to know?
Do you want to know about Shark?
Do you want to know about Shark?
Any secret. Ask me.
Ask me! I'll tell you!
Poor you. I really got under your skin, didn't I?
Good morning.
- Good morning.
- You look tired, sir.
Morning!
- Have you heard the latest?
- No.
Utility knickers... one Yank, and they're off.
Naughty, naughty.
- Came through the door for you.
- If there is some other way
To prove that I love you
I swear I don't know how
Preserve my body and soul into everlasting peace.
Take and eat this in remembrance that Christ died for you.
Thank you for your note.
I take it it's about Claire.
Have you heard anything?
She hasn't turned up, if that's what you mean.
- But you've got something.
- Take this and eat this in remembrance that Christ died for you.
I don't know why I'm doing this.
The body of our Lord,
Jesus Christ, which was given freely.
Preserve my body and soul...
ADU is the call sign of Nachtrichten, Regiment 537... a motorized German
Army signals unit based... in the Ukraine.
Its messages are encoded in the standard cipher for the Russian campaign.
- We call it Kestrel.
- Kestrel.
Seven messages with the call sign ADU... were intercepted in March and April... not counting the last four on April the 17th, which you found.
I've written down the dates and times of interception.
A spy doesn't steal the enemy's signals.
And anyway, they were never de...
They were never decoded. Why would she steal four messages she can't read?
She must have stolen them to read them.
She stole them to read them.
But there's no way she could have.
- Why not?
- She couldn't. It just...
Just take my word for it.
God preserve me.
Another one.
I seem to move, Mr Jericho, in an endless round... from one patronizing male to another... forever being told what I am and what I am not allowed to know.
Well, that ends here.
So, what would she need to read them?
I'm sorry.
You can't ask me that.
But you can ask me to sneak into the Index
Room and risk getting hung up by my thumbs.
- Good morning.
- Cheerio, then.
Oh, Chr... Miss Wallace.
Miss Wallace!
She'd need...
She'd need a Typex machine.
Every day, our Typex machines have to be set... the same way the Germans set their Enigmas.
Otherwise, you just get nonsense from nonsense.
And working out each day's settings is the hard part.
That's where the code breakers come in.
- How?
- Well, you... you need a crib.
- I'll see you later, then.
- Suppose that gravestone was in code.
If I knew who was buried here, more or less, I'd know what the code meant.
That's a crib.
And when you've set the machine, you type in the coded message.
If it comes out nonsense, the settings are wrong.
If it comes out
"Mary Jane Hawkins"... you've broken Enigma for that day.
Why would Claire get hold of the
Kestrel settings for April the 17th?
She couldn't have, unless she had help.
Kestrel would be filed in Hut 6.
It's your hut.
So now I'm a traitor too.
Well, maybe she got access to one of the Typex machines from you.
Typex girls work around the clock.
Sorry.
Stuck.
Look.
The first seven ADUs were decoded.
Now, what happens to decoded messages?
They get written into the German book.
That's Claire's job.
Then what?
Well, then they get filed with everything else in the main registry.
- Ever been in there?
- Once or twice to check some...
No. No, no, no, no.
Oh, dear, would you like some tea?
- Reference or loan?
- Reference.
- Section?
- Hut 6. Control.
- What are they?
- Kestrel intercepts, March and April.
- He's been a dark horse, hasn't he?
- Hmm. Surprise a minute.
But there are complications.
Sorry to have been so long.
I've never come across this before.
- The file was empty?
- There was a typewritten note... dated April the 17th... referring all inquiries to the Office of the Director General.
And that night, four final ADU messages got in under the wire... never deciphered, never filed... taken home by Claire and hidden.
Who is the Director General?
Chief of the Special
Intelligence Service.
And he gets his orders straight from the prime minister.
We're stuck again.
Maybe. Maybe not.
I've got the hang of this detective work.
But I've been told that everything's okay
You're out of bounds!
- Mr Mermagen.
- What are you doing?
Can you help me?
Machine Room needs the Kestrel settings for the last couple of weeks.
They've found a batch of intercepts fallen behind a desk.
- They've done what?
- I know.
But please don't tell.
It was actually a friend of mine.
Ah, you girls.
You know, I should really report you for this... but...
One good turn deserves another, hmm?
Why, Mr Mermagen.
What will your wife say?
The Kestrel settings for the whole of March and April.
Christ.
So, at least there's still a chance we can read the ones you found in Claire's bedroom.
- I've burnt them.
- You what?
Hello, Tom.
Mind if we join you?
- You can't m-m-m-mean it.
- Well, of course I mean it.
Drowning herself was Virginia Woolf's greatest contribution to English literature.
- Actually, we were just leaving.
- Waste not, want not.
Whale meat.
Brain food, Tom.
- You burned them!
- I had a close call with that lounge lizard Wigram from Special Intelligence.
I panicked. But the worst of it is,
I could have read them.
- How?
- I didn't need a Typex machine.
We've got a real Enigma in the museum.
- Well, when did you find that out?
- Well, I knew. I just... I just forgot.
You forgot?
And you're the genius.
You know, I won a newspaper crossword competition.
I beat two men. All three of us were recruited for Bletchley.
They're cryptanalysts now.
And I'm a glorified file clerk.
'Course, if I'd been a daddy's girl from some posh finishing school...
God, look, it's time to go back on shift.
- You?
- Not for a bit.
Right.
Did she ever say anything about me?
Well, she must like you.
The way she talks about the others...
A bus load, you said?
The Romilly effect.
One look, and they're "Romillied. "
Who was she seeing?
I only mean it might be a way forward.
- I know what you think about me.
- No, you don't.
Well, I feel like an idiot.
And you aren't the one standing here with the
Kestrel settings stuffed into your knickers.
Look, I don't know who she was seeing... and I really think we'd better call this a day.
Don't you?
Bye, then.
Miss Wallace.
I haven't been lookir to the right or left... so there's something
I didn't see clearly.
What's that?
That you're a remarkable...
I think you're simply wonderful.
Tom, nice of you to turn up.
- Look, I don't know what Skynner's been saying.
- Shut the door.
He wants you out.
"Send him back to Cambridge, and this time make the bugger walk. "
I got you the rail pass.
- Not now!
- No, you can't do that, Guy. Tell them you want to give me a couple of days.
- Why?
- To see if I can find a way back into Shark.
Tom, it was you that announced that it couldn't be done in four days.
It was you that made Skynner look a fool in front of his clients.
Now you want me to go back and tell him... Piss off, for God's sake!
Sorry, Guy. Hello, Thomas.
You'd better come and hear this.
Two long signals from U-boat headquarters in the last 12 hours.
One just before midnight, one just after. Rebroadcast twice.
- Then nothing. U- boat fleet is on radio silence. - Christ.
They're on battle stations.
Say 12 U-boats 20 miles apart... possibly two lines, possibly three.
An ambush covering hundreds of miles of ocean.
And this time, we don't know where.
And one golden rule... absolute radio silence.
- And wh... wh...
- What then?
Either the convoy is lucky and misses the ambush, or it isn't lucky.
And the first U-boat to make contact with the convoy breaks radio silence.
- How?
- Minimally, using the short signal book.
It compresses the necessary information to a few letters... sighting of convoy, position, course and speed.
That's repeated every two hours. As it's picked up by the other U
- boats in the line... they start to converge on the convoy and send a contact signal in their turn.
Contact signal.
They'll shadow the convoy till nightfall.
They prefer to attack in the dark.
We haven't got as much time as we'd thought.
I'd say, a day, a day and a half at the outside.
- Mary Jane Hawkins.
- The oracle has spoken.
They changed the weather code, but they didn't change the short signal code book.
It's our way back into Shark, so long as the U-boats find our convoy.
Don't you see?
It's our convoy.
We know what the U-boats are sending.
It's the crib that we've been looking for.
- Would you get enough material?
- How many signals do you need?
One group of letters for the convoy sighted... two groups for grid reference, one group for course, one group for speed.
Five groups of letters per contact signal every two hours.
Shadowing the convoy for maybe 1 O hours,
12... that's 25 groups of letters.
And how many U-boats joining in?
Eight, ten?
Each one a contact signal every two hours.
My God, he's right.
He's found us a crib.
- Brilliant.
- A-A-Appalling.
We've never had an operation on this scale. The contact signals could easily build up to give us a crib... of 1 OO group of letters and we've got the short signal code book in the museum.
He's right, Guy.
Where are the keys to the museum?
Good Christ, Tom. We have to protect the convoys, not sacrifice them.
You know what it's like out there.
The success of this plan depends on arranging a massacre.
No. No, we are not arranging anything.
What happens is going to happen.
But if we can use it to our advantage, we'll be able to decipher every signal... sent by every U-boat on the high seas for 24 hours!
- Including the weather reports.
- Yeah. We'll have the plain text.
We can make a start on reconstructing the new weather code.
- This puts us back in the fight.
- And there will be many more convoys to protect.
You're back in business, old thing.
Garbled text from Beaumanor.
Somebody get on the blower.
Miss Chamberlain, would you?
Get them to check their file copy.
Pam, does Beaumanor keep copies of everything they send us?
- Yes. It's all there on file.
- Thank you.
Hello. Could I have Beaumanor 392?
Miss Wallace!
No female visitors upstairs.
That's the rule!
Mr Jericho, wake up.
It's not over.
- We need to borrow your Enigma machine.
- Didrt you hear?
Top copy goes straight to your people by teleprinter... or by dispatch rider, depending on priority.
The second copy we keep, in case of garbles.
Can we see?
Well, if you want.
There's not much to it.
It's a treat for us, you know, a visit from head office to the country cousins.
It's good of you to say so, but, um... a fat lot of use we'd be without your intercepts, Major.
We keep them a couple of months, filed chronologically.
These sets are tuned to the
Eastern Front... Kestrel, Buzzard, Kite.
- And you're intercepting everything?
- Absolutely.
Except that time the other week, of course.
Kestrel, wasn't it?
Yes, your Miles Mermagen came on the blower in a frightful panic.
"No more ADU, thank you very much.
Not now, not ever. "
- What's that about?
- Orders from above.
We'd just sent him four good, clean signals.
It was Kay here who handled our mystery station.
Carry on.
Yeah, he has a good fist, ADU.
Touch like a concert pianist.
He's still transmitting?
Of course, I don't take him down any more, but he was awful busy last week.
Oh, excuse me, sir.
What was it you said you did again, Mr...
- Jericho.
- Jericho.
Can't say, I'm afraid.
Catch you up.
- Major, how many machines did you say you have here?
- We have 48 here.
Excuse me.
He's on now, if you're interested, sir.
Thank you.
I don't mean to bother you, sir... but it is important, isn't it?
I know I shouldn't ask.
I mean, no one ever tells us.
You are making sense of it?
It is important?
Yes.
This is our only war, you see, in here... beep, beep, bloody beep.
And it's always nonsense, nonsense, nonsense.
Yes, we are making sense of it... and it is important.
Eleven ADU signals and launchings.
That's the car.
Man, woman, two-seater roadster.
Invite him to stop, shall we?
Take him, man! Take him!
Mr Jericho, stop! Stop! Stop!
Look out!
Shit.
Bravo, Mr Jericho.
Reckon, given the circumstances,
Miss Wallace... we might now risk first names.
Hester.
Tom.
This might be good.
It looks deserted enough.
Well spotted.
Bliss.
- What would they do to us if they knew?
- Feed us to the dogs.
Charming.
Right.
March and April
Beaumanor log sheets... and the intercepts from March 28th...
April 3rd, April 9th,
15th, 16th, 17th... and Kestrel settings... last one first.
Might tell us why Claire disappeared.
Right. April 17, rotor order.
R- X-O.
- Plug board settings.
- A-O-E-M.
The current passes from the keyboard... to the lamps by way of the rotors and the plugs.
And every time you press a key, it changes the path of the current.
Press the same key ten times, it comes out ten different ways on the lamp board.
You never know which letters will light up. Simply brilliant.
Message key X-A-T.
- Ready?
- Ready.
- "Y."
- "K."
- "E."
- "A."
"W."
"C."
- "U."
- Zed.
"M."
"V."
- "Q"
- "X."
It's not right, is it?
This isn't German.
Keep going. Sometimes the operator pads out with nonsense.
Keep going.
- Um, "K."
- Zed.
- "E."
- "R."
- "O."
- "A."
- "F."
- "D."
Isn't German.
Come on, genius!
I'm sorry. It's double coded, or the settings must be wrong.
It's all been for nothing.
I'm afraid I have to ask you to hurry up.
Search the barn.
This is Mr Leveret.
Detective Inspector Leveret.
He wants to know what you've been up to.
But first things first.
You've been here before?
And you?
Line up in the street and search the area.
Have a look at this, sir.
It's down there.
- Right, sir.
- There?
Drag the river.
Please talk to me! What do you want to know? I'll tell you anything you want.
Give me your hand.
Do you wanna know about Shark?
Any secret. Ask me!
Come this way.
I've got something to show you.
Get your notebook out.
Miss Wallace first.
I am showing the witness one ladies' coat, colour grey... trimmed with black velvet.
Label: Hunters, Burlington Arcade.
- And the witness responded...
- Yes. It's hers.
Yes.
Next, one ladies' shoe... black high heel.
Uh, heel snapped off.
And the witness responded...
Yes.
It's an old quarry.
They built the town with what they dug out.
That makes sense, making one hole out of another.
- How deep is it?
- Sixty, seventy foot in the middle.
Christ, we'll need a submarine.
I would very much like to arrest you... but we don't have a body.
It's a quarter to 8:OO.
Mr Leveret will take you back.
I believe your day is just beginning.
Chaps.
Easy, everyone.
Just stopped by to wish you luck.
I'm sure you're all aware, as I am, what's at stake here.
I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say... this could be one of the decisive nights of the war.
- So shut up, then.
- A mighty battle.
Probably... the greatest convoy battle of all time is about to start.
Three hours ago, convoys HX 229A...
229 and SC 122... had entered the presumed operational area... of the U-boat packs.
Now, in our long island history... we have picked up the gauntlet more than a few times.
Shakespeare coming up.
"Out of this nettle, danger, may we pluck this flower, safety. "
So, gentlemen, go to it.
Come and dance.
Boop-boop
Come on. Come and dance.
- No, I can't.
- Yes, you can. It's easy.
- No, really, you do it.
- Right, left.
Left, left.
Ah! You're getting the hang of it.
C- Can someone remind me?
A- Are w-we hoping for the U-boats to find the convoys, o-o-or not?
- Not.
- I am.
- Yes, well, you would, Baxter.
- Y-You'd sacrifice o-o-our...
Sacrifice a convoy to get back into Shark? Of course.
How many men has Stalin had to sacrifice so far? Five million?
It's called the greater good.
Spoken, of course, by someone who doesn't happen to be in the North Atlantic at the moment.
You can only fight your own war.
What do you think, Tom?
About what?
So, Claire, what were you doing?
What were you hiding?
Right.
Start at the beginning.
Kestrel settings, March.
Atlantic time is two hours behind.
It's still dark.
Here, mate,
I got a lighter.
Thanks.
"Urgent. "
Mary Jane Hawkins.
It is German.
Signal 7-3-6-9-K-C-S.
We're in business.
Direction finders have a fix.
Scarborough, 2-5-9 degrees.
Witt, 2-4-6, 30 degrees.
Flowerdown, 2-6-8 degrees.
There she is...
She's shadowing convoy HX 229.
No air cover. Sitting ducks.
Grid square?
B- D-1491.
- Convoy course?
- Seventy degrees.
- Convoy speed.
- Ten knots.
- From the code book, we have C-K-S-A for convoy sighted. - First message?
K- A-F-B-N-W-Zed-Jacob for position.
Q- K-D-X for course, Q-R-Zed-A for speed.
That's five four-letter groups.
Message setting, B-H-B.
"A-V, V-K, A-K."
Check.
Yeah, me too.
- "M-S, S-M."
- Check.
Two loops. Confirmed?
And no clashes.
O4.
One down.
Now the wolves will be gathering.
Still nonsense. Why?
Can you fix B-D-1611?
Convoy speed and direction same.
New position:
K- A-F-V, N-C-L-A.
Skynner's offered a bottle of Scotch to the first man to come up with a menu.
- Does he know I'm still here?
- He didn't ask.
Oh, Puck, there's a message left for you at the switchboard.
It's Adelphi 4-2-4-3.
There's no name, and I'm not your social secretary.
- Message key: R-M-U.
- Sorry, Guy.
How much more material do you need?
We've got 9 signals.
Another 20, 25 would be better.
Suppose it starts before you have them.
Naval grid square B-D-1386.
Course: 70 degrees.
Speed of convoy: 1 O knots.
I'm pretty sure there's enough for a stab at a menu. Let's try it.
- You have 17 contacts, Mr Jericho.
- It's not enough.
Well, why the hell not?
When I'm done, we'll be looking for a needle in a haystack... but if we stop now it'll be a hundred thousand haystacks.
You know that.
Full moon.
Ten U-boats, somewhere.
Thirty-seven merchants, five escorts, one of which has lost contact with the convoy.
No rescue ship and no air cover.
Eighteen.
- Flowerdown, 2-6-8 degrees.
- It's what you might call a bitch.
- Twenty-three.
- Not enough.
- What have you got?
- I need one more link.
I can't see it.
Names. They're names.
- You?
- No.
Getting a very bad feeling now.
Polish names.
- There.
- Yes.
- Menu.
- Let's hope to God it works.
It's started. Bastards.
Don't you have homes to go to?
- How's it going?
- Four hits so far.
Probably 300 men lost.
A Dutch cargo and a Norwegian freighter went straight to the bottom.
And an American liberty ship's on fire.
Half the crew are drowning.
The other half are trying to save them.
Tom. Unfinished business.
Congratulations.
It's a half bottle, as it turns out.
Typical Skynner.
That should go back.
Where's the museum key?
Oh, sorry, Guy.
I've still got it.
Tsk, tsk.
Security around here.
Then get off home, old thing.
- Havert you got a girl waiting for you?
- She's dead.
Tom.
Oh, my God. Come on.
- What?
- Come on.
It's Polish.
Polish names, all of them.
The Germans found a mass grave.
Look, doesn't it say
4,OOO corpses?
"Polish officers buried in the forest at Katyn in 1940...
"during the Soviet occupation.
Shot in the back of the head. "
Murdered by the Russians.
By our Russian allies.
They were comrades-in-arms against the Nazis.
My God.
That's why the file was empty... on the orders of Secret Intelligence.
And that's why Beaumanor was ordered to stop intercepting the signals.
It was too big a secret.
Just knowing that can get you killed.
And Claire discovered it.
Copied it into the German book, and she had to tell... someone.
- Adam Pukowski.
- What?
Missing in action.
Kid brother of Jozef Pukowski.
Claire stole those intercepts for Puck... because he was looking for his brother's name.
- Puck!
- Wait! Please!
This Puck killed her. Why?
Because he had a secret, too, and she could've given him away.
- What secret?
- I can't tell you that!
Tom!
Hello. Could you get me
London Adelphi 4-2-4-3, please?
I'm sorry. That number is not in service.
What the hell is this about, you and some skirt waltzing around Beaumanor?
Leonard, unless you're asking me to dance, let go of my arm!
I should've cooked your goose when you made a fool of yourself over that blonde... who fucked half the park.
What?
Stand away! Stand away!
What the bloody hell do you think you're doing?
He's two carriages up.
Snug as a bug in a rug.
Morning, sir.
You knew?
About Pukowski?
We had no proof, but when Miss Romilly went missing...
- Puck and Claire were having an...
- Were seeing each other, as you like to put it.
Seeing each other's brains out.
Jozef Pukowski, who'd been wondering what could have happened... to all those Polish officers who hadrt been heard from since the first year of the war... and Claire Romilly...
who was reading the Wermacht traffic from the Eastern Front.
They were made for each other.
And lo, mass graves.
Polish uniforms, names.
- We've been bracing ourselves for the Nazi propaganda.
- Propaganda?
Four thousand Poles murdered by Stalin?
It's what Hitler would give his last ball for.
Think of all those Polish names in the U.S. Of A.
Think of our convoys full of American goods... some of them in American ships... running the U-boat gauntlet so our supplies can keep Stalin in business.
- But it's true, isn't it?
- The Katyn massacre?
Oh, really, do shut up. There's a war to win, and Stalirs helping us win it.
And they hate the Russians, you know.
They've hated them for centuries.
So what's Pukowski going to do to get back at them?
Help the enemy. That's what.
His enemy's enemy.
And he's got a big piece of knowledge that can help the Germans... Shark.
- The weather code.
- Claire couldn't have known what he'd do. She wasn't a traitor.
I'm sure you're right.
But then Pukowski heard that you were coming back.
Jericho, the lover who wouldn't let go, who'd cracked once before.
The swot who was invited to the ball, found Cinderella's slipper... and went so crazy he would've told her anything.
And you would have, wouldn't you?
About how we lost Shark.
And the rumour that there was a mole in the park, probably in your hut.
How long would it have taken Claire to work out that the traitor was Puck? About a minute.
So he killed her.
One-way to Manchester, according to the ticket collector.
Change the watch.
Well, let's see where and to whom he will lead us, hmm?
Train approaching, platform three.
It's the 3:15 to Manchester.
How do you get the petrol coupons to go zipping up and down to London?
Secret, darling. I know a chap.
Train standing, platform three.
3:15 for Manchester only.
Manchester, next stop.
That's it for you.
Go home, keep your head down... and I might try and forget about you and your moll breaking the Highway Code... and the Official Secrets Act on the same day.
Train standing, platform three.
3:15 to Manchester only.
You've been trying to frighten me into keeping my head down right from the start. Why?
Because somehow
I frighten you. Why?
Because of Claire.
My connection with Claire.
Be careful now.
The night you came to my room, you already had Pukowski in your sights... yet you went out of your way to play the heavy with me.
And then you were more concerned about
Claire Romilly than you were about Shark.
- A girl who'd missed her shift? Why?
- Why? She was his girlfriend.
Oh, no. She was more than that.
She was working for you.
Claire was your agent.
She told you everything, even how I found her shoe.
As you said, Bletchley was a security nightmare, so you put a girl in the park to do your dirty work.
Surely you mean her patriotic duty.
Everything that she did, she did because you told her. You had her fucking for England.
And then when she got to Pukowski, it went wrong. She took pity on him... and she told him what she was writing in the German book.
No wonder you were frightened.
You'd made a terrible mistake, and your agent paid for it with her life. Claire.
He's jumped!
He's gone!
Come on! Back it up!
Back the train up!
What are they doing?
Sir, please. The statiors clear.
Roadblocks are in place.
- Search the train again.
- He's not on the train!
- We'll have to let it go.
- Please be patient.
Oh, Puck, there's a message left for you at the switchboard. It's Adelphi 4-2-4-3.
- Keep the change.
- Thank you very much.
- To the station, rather fast, please.
- Ma'am.
You bloody idiot.
This time I can't save you.
You broke Skynner's cheekbone.
Tom. Well, weather code is, uh, c-c-cracking open.
Where's Puck?
- Check our weather report...
- How bad is it?
It's bad.
But we are reading Shark, thanks to you lot.
- What's this? - Grid square A-M-2-9.
We think it's a garbled signal.
- Signal to a U-boat?
- Mmm. U-617.
Ordered out of battle to proceed immedi...
Yes?
Where is this?
Loch Feochan, in Scotland, where
I'd like to be old. If I'm ever old.
So, it's the real thing.
U-671, rendezvous in 24 hours.
Our turn to find a sitting duck.
My God.
- Be careful.
- I will.
Damn it.
- I'm on the chosen frequency.
- Sir.
- There's probably interference.
- Swing around. I'll fine-tune it.
Perfect.
Just in time to bugger up the whole operation.
- Do you want to abort?
- Are you serious?
- I didn't kill her.
- I know.
Do you think
I'm here for that?
- That's right, my darling.
- They're ready.
Up you come.
What about the rest of it?
The real secret you want to tell the
Germans, about how we really broke the code?
- About my machines!
- Thomas, Thomas.
- You can have your enemy. Let me have mine.
- No.
Well, shoot me, then.
- It's your show, but your man...
- He is not my man.
Serve it up.
- Go ahead.
- Tell Auntie Mae the package is ready.
Dinner's ready.
Bullseye!
- Run out a couple of yards there.
- You're looking in the wrong place.
Oh, it's Mr Jericho.
Come home again with his batteries dried out.
You turned out to be some swot.
- I tip my hat to you.
- She's not there. Didrt you hear me?
She's moved on.
The murder scene was like a pile of clothes left on a beach.
Sometimes it means somebody's dead.
Sometimes it means somebody wanted to disappear.
Like an agent who'd been turned by her target.
It was you who saw it before I did.
What makes you think that?
Pukowski was on the train, and you were letting him run.
He knew the secret that could lose us the war. Remember? The thinking machine.
You were holding back to see who he would lead you to.
Who the hell could it be to make you take that risk?
Only Claire.
Well, I was wrong, wasn't I?
She wasn't with Pukowski.
She was waiting for him up the line to take him to her little Scottish hideaway... where a couple of runaway lovers could sit out the rest of the war.
Do you think I didn't check?
She loved him, and Pukowski brought her all the way to the brink... but then he had to tell her what she didn't know... about the U-boat coming to pick him up, and why.
If they got caught, they'd both hang.
But there was no going back.
Only forward, to Germany.
But then, he didn't know Claire.
She was no traitor.
She's out there, somewhere... like a sword hanging over your head.
In different ways, she fooled us all.
She was unreadable.
- Stick to sums.
- I think I've got something! Easy does it!
What have you got there?
Steady.
- We're losing her, lads.
- Do you want it to be her?
Steady, now.
False alarm!
Shut up.
Keep looking.
Oh, I will.
I will.
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's all right.
I was getting worried about you two.
What does "broccoli" mean?
Depends on the context.
Pubic hair or marijuana. It's a noun.
And "Virginia"?
Vagina. As in, "He penetrated her Virginia with a hammer."
- Yikes!
- Slang is either sexual or violent.
Or both.
When it's witty,
I think it's really witty.
Yeah.
Hello, how are you?
How are you?
Hi, how are you?
Why didn't you say hi?
I nodded.
Are you happy when you wake up?
No.
Hey, there was a petal storm out here this morning.
I saw that.
I thought it was a snowstorm.
I thought I was dreaming.
No, there's two stores we should go to in Soho.
It would not take very much for me to make you look very good.
You're sabotaging a fucking incredible figure, baby.
Yo!
Is that your student?
It looks like he wants to eat you.
They all flirt. It's part of the ritual.
- Miss Avery, you're late.
- Am I?
- What, you trying to be ironic?
- Hello.
- What's happening?
- I'm Pauline.
We talked this morning on the phone.
- Yeah.
- You look different than I thought.
Thank you for sharing your bed.
Bye.
Bye.
I got a new word for you.
"Meow."
Is this your usual?
Are you gonna write that down?
You should be paying me for this.
- You think so?
- Yeah.
This is valuable shit.
Aren't you afraid your book on slang is like a dis?
A dis on whom?
People like you think the brothers are guinea pigs...
...the way we talk and shit.
Cornelius, are you trying to tell me that you need an extension?
No. Look, I came to tell you
I made a discovery.
See, I discovered I can call
John Wayne Gacy...
...and hear him talk himself,
Miss Avery.
Really? Dead murderers have their own phone lines?
He wasn't no murderer.
Look, there be a website for serial killers...
...you know, past and present.
He recorded and explained himself...
...how he didn't kill no 33 boys.
I got radar for the truth...
...and I'm gonna write how I know that.
This paper's not supposed to be about you.
- That's the point of the assignment.
- You said every word a writer writes...
...even the commas and shit, gotta be a reflection of him or her.
That we be doing this writing shit to express our vision.
You know I got vision.
You know, I got Africa vision.
You know, I got bitch vision.
I got...
Yeah. Excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom.
Come on, you guys, you were supposed to wait for me.
Hey, miss.
Hey, miss. Hey!
You forgot something.
The check.
Stream of consciousness,
I'd like to point out, is not the same...
...as stream of conscience...
...for which some of you have mistaken it.
A logical error in some ways.
Okay, your assignment for today is to utilize...
- Nothing happens.
...style in To the Lighthouse.
Yeah, one old lady dies.
How many ladies have to die to make it good?
At least three.
- What's this?
- From the bar...
...my half of the check.
Yo, man, where you go?
I waited a long time.
- Couldn't find the bathroom.
- Is that all?
- Is what all?
- All I owe you.
I can't pass you unless you show up to class.
The still waters of the water under a frond of stars
The still water of your mouth under a thicket of kisses
The still waters of the water under a frond of stars
The still water of your mouth under a thicket of kisses
Under a thicket of kisses
- How you doing?
- Do I know you?
Detective Malloy.
Are you Francis Avery?
I'm canvassing your apartment building. I wanna talk to you.
How do I know that's real?
It's still busy.
Why don't you come back.
I'll wait, thanks.
Can I smoke?
Not in my apartment.
You got someplace
I could put it out?
Thanks.
Miss Avery, there was a homicide in your neighborhood on the 15th.
That'd be Saturday the 15th, last Saturday...
...between 12 and 2 a.m.
Her body, or part of her body, to be exact...
...was found in the garden outside your window.
That's why I wanted to talk to you, in case you saw or heard anything.
No. No, nothing unusual.
Frannie, it's John Graham.
Are you by yourself?
I don't think you're there by yourself.
Why did you lie to me?
Doesn't it mean anything to you that we slept together twice?
Yes, I do count that time in the shower. Quiet!
Come on, pick up the phone.
Pick up.
Pick up. Pick up.
Pick up. Come on, pick up the phone.
Are you a writer?
What's all this?
Words, quotes that I like, poetry.
Is it, like, a job or a hobby?
A passion.
"I want to do with you what spring does with the cherry trees."
Is this you?
It's my sister.
My ex-wife had long hair, then she cut it.
So you don't remember seeing anything?
Hearing anything?
Oh, my pen?
It's fake. It's a cop thing.
You don't remember anything? Didn't see anything? Didn't hear anything?
No cries in the night?
No. I don't remember seeing or hearing anything unusual.
- And I sleep with the windows open.
- Yeah?
You do that a lot?
Can you tell me how it happened?
Her throat was cut.
And then she was disarticulated.
Here's my card.
My number's there. If you remember anything, give me a call, all right?
Do I know you from someplace?
I don't know.
Thanks.
Oh, shit.
- Don't bullshit me. Look me in the eye.
- I'm not.
Now, you think about it, all right?
Now, take a walk. Miss?
Oh, miss? Miss?
How you doing? Excuse me.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Am I supposed to get in?
You want to talk on the street?
Never think it's a good idea, putting your business on the street.
I'll get it.
This is my partner,
Detective Rodriguez.
Hi. How you doing?
- How do you do?
- What the fuck is this?
- It's coffee.
- It's half a cup.
- Take it back.
- He gives me a half a cup.
What, does he expect you to fill...?
How long is this gonna take?
- I'm sorry?
- How long is this gonna take?
- Are you in a hurry?
- Where you going?
- My friend's. Half sister's.
- We'll give you a lift.
- So, what do you do?
- I teach.
- You teach what?
- You get a chance to run those prints?
- Teach what?
- English.
You know what an isthmus is? isthmus be my lucky fucking day.
- What the fuck? You ran the prints?
- Yeah.
- And?
- Nada, nothing.
Look, the reason we thought you might be able to help...
...is the bartender...
Luther Wilker?
- Yeah.
- At the Red...
- Turtle.
- Well, he said...
...you were there on the night in question.
- He's got a good memory.
- No, we have your credit-card receipt.
Does that look familiar?
That's right.
I was at the Red Turtle with one of my students.
- One of your students?
- Cornelius Webb.
But it was early. It was 3:30.
I was there for a short time, then I went home.
Cornelius Webb?
Is that with two B's or not two B's?
W-E-B-B.
You were in the front room the whole time?
- Yes.
- Are you sure?
Didn't I just say so?
You didn't happen to see a Caucasian girl, mid-20s?
Not too tall.
Good-looking, wouldn't you say?
- What?
- She was good-looking?
- She wasn't bad-looking.
- Yeah, but she...
Well, did you?
- What is this about, exactly?
- Listen, Miss Avery...
...the deceased was seen in the Red
Turtle the same night you were there.
Seeing how you were there...
...maybe you wouldn't mind taking a look at a few pictures.
Sometimes you see something you don't remember.
Take a deep breath.
This one's kind of graphic.
Well, do you recognize her?
No.
Thank you.
Hey. Can't figure you out.
What do you mean?
Am I a murder suspect?
Look, I was wondering if you want to go for a beer or something.
I got a cousin who works in a bar in Sheridan Square...
...and says a lot of writers go in there.
- Now?
No, not now. I'm working now.
- Two hours from now.
- Where?
Here.
What the fuck?
You're a fucking wise guy?
We got nice girls and nicer drinks.
Oh, excuse me, baby.
- Hey, Papi.
- Hey.
- Good to see you. Look at you.
- You are looking good.
Is Pauline home?
- Sorry.
- Oh, baby.
She could be up.
She could be down.
You know, go check the bar, baby, okay? Hey, hey, hey, look.
That's cute. Is it real?
Of course it be real.
What, you crazy?
I don't let no psycho killer mess with my girls.
He'd be dead. Bye, baby.
I make sure no one fuck with my goddamn girls.
What is it?
What's wrong?
It's so humiliating.
Is it the doctor?
Do you want to go up?
Okay.
Thanks, guys.
- Good luck.
- Feel better.
- What happened?
- His receptionist called me...
...with a referral to another doctor.
He canceled our appointment.
- Was this after you had sex?
- He's right.
He shouldn't have had sex with me.
I mean, of course he's right.
Do you ever think about just imagining sex?
- What do you mean?
- Just thinking about the doctor...
...not making appointments.
Just...
Just not really trying to have sex with him in reality.
That's kind of boring.
I mean, I do. I do restrain myself.
You know, I just...
I got so enthusiastic...
...when I thought about him, and it confused me...
...because I think enthusiasm is a good thing, you know.
I mean, I think about...
How many appointments did you make?
Last week?
Eleven.
How about I put on some music?
I waited outside his apartment.
I saw him and his wife...
...and I followed her to the dry cleaner.
She left a tan suit.
Did you pick it up?
- What are you gonna do with it?
- I don't know.
I feel like such a freak.
This is what I do to get a dick inside me.
You're not a freak.
I admire you.
You live out of your unconscious.
You're a poet of love.
The lovelorn man who
Sick in soul and of this
Busy human heart aweary
Worships the spirit
Of unconscious life
In tree or wildflower
Gentle lunatic
"Gentle lunatic." That's me.
I have something for you.
It's like a belated birthday thing.
I got it when I was styling that commercial that got canceled.
Oh, God, that's beautiful.
- What is it?
- It's a courtship fantasy.
See, there's a little wedding bell and a little house.
Open the baby carriage.
Oh, God.
Oh, no, am I gonna have to feed this thing?
You should have a baby.
This is the closest I'll get.
And a man. You should have a man too.
Somebody asked me out.
Good.
Who?
A police detective.
He's investigating a girl's murder.
You know the one who got cut up?
Oh, my God. Yeah.
Part of her body was found in my garden.
Yuck.
So is this detective good-looking?
He seems young.
He's got a mustache.
They've all got that.
You didn't say no, Frannie?
Frannie?
You gotta go. Just for the exercise, you should go.
You wanna borrow some decent clothing?
- Can we look?
- I think you should.
Can you come with me?
Come on.
Get the woman a gin and tonic, and I'll have a bourbon and Coke.
You got it.
You know, I'm wondering if maybe you saw something at that bar.
I'm still wondering.
Maybe something you don't know you saw.
Your colored boyfriend, did he leave with you?
Cornelius? He's not my boyfriend.
And he left before me.
You saw him leave?
Actually, no.
He's not into popping arms off of ladies' bodies, is he?
Not that I know about.
What, my hands?
Well, yeah, I know,
I got faggot hands.
They're soft.
Actually, I was wondering about your tattoo.
Oh, that?
I'm in a secret club.
Are there many members?
Hey, listen...
...I can be whatever you want me to be.
You want me to romance you, take you to a classy restaurant, no problem.
You want me to be your best friend and fuck you...
...treat you good, lick your pussy...
...no problem.
Ain't much I haven't done.
The only thing I won't do is beat you up.
Why does your partner carry a water pistol?
- They took his gun away.
- Why did they take his gun away?
Because...
...his wife caught him fucking a fat chick.
When she found out she ran upstairs and tosses...
...his Hispanic Society trophy out the window.
And you know, that's pretty much when he tried to kill her.
That's a good reason to kill your wife, of all the reasons that I can think of.
He wasn't gonna kill her, lady.
He was just trying to scare her.
That was his San Juan
Man of the Year Award, you know?
Ritchie takes that stuff seriously.
So those fat-fucking-fucks from IA, they got ahold of him...
...they take his gun, take his badge...
...they put him on modified duty and now he's a house mouse.
What are house mouses?
The guys who don't want to be on the streets no more...
...or they're on modified duty like him.
You stare back at them.
That's how you flirt with black girls.
Hey, Ritchie, what the fuck?
They let you out?
What am I gonna do?
What can I do?
Nothing. You can't do nothing.
Come here, bro.
If loving you is wrong,
I don't want to be right.
- Don't be. You want a drink?
- Yeah.
Hi.
- How you doing?
- Hey, barkeep...
...two shots of bourbon and two bourbon and Cokes.
I had to park on Christopher Street.
Must have been 100 faggots looking to suck my dick.
- I'm jealous.
- Are all cops homophobic?
What are you, one of them feminists?
I thought you might be one as well, detective.
- Why?
- Malloy says that you like fat women.
- You told her that?
- Yeah, why not?
Made me think you had a generous, even a sympathetic, view.
- You like fat girls?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, why?
- I like fat chicks.
- That chick.
- Yeah. What's up?
That chick wants to suck your dick.
All you need are tits, a hole and a heartbeat.
You don't even need the tits.
You don't even need the heartbeat, pal.
You going fishing?
- Want me to clock you out?
- No, I'll stay for a while.
Miss?
I didn't hit you.
I'm not... It's not my fault.
- Are you okay, miss?
- Yeah.
- Are you okay?
- Yes.
- I give you a ride.
- Okay.
Are...?
Okay.
- You okay?
- Do you have a phone?
I give you.
Malloy?
It's me.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it looked a lot worse than it is.
You'll be all right. It's just a scrape.
Did you get a look at him?
No, he was wearing a mask.
Anything stand out? Like...
...a smell, rings on his fingers, watch, shoes, anything?
How was that girl killed?
- Who?
- The girl killed at the Red Turtle.
Angela Sands?
She wasn't killed at the Red Turtle.
You're getting confused.
What is "disarticulation" exactly?
Listen, it's not likely that your assailant's the murderer, babe.
It's much more likely he's after your wallet.
So you won't tell me how she was killed?
You really want to know?
Her throat was slit with a straight razor.
He was trying to take her head, maybe for a souvenir.
We found another dismembered female body last June along the river.
I think it's the same killer.
Ritchie don't, but I do.
Go over it again.
No. Show me.
Come here. Show me.
- He came from behind you?
- I don't know.
Did you turn?
He just grabbed my head in his arm.
He had his arm around my neck.
So he must have come up from behind you, then.
Was it his right arm?
Or his left?
It was his right.
All right.
What's that?
Take those off.
No.
What? Yeah.
That's it.
That's it.
- I've been wondering about you.
- Yeah? Don't.
- I want to know.
- Know what?
How you did that to me.
Somebody taught you.
- Who was that?
- Get the fuck out of here.
You can tell me.
An older woman.
An older woman, huh?
The chicken lady.
- The chicken lady?
- Oh, you know her?
When I was 15, I was delivering chickens for a butcher...
...to housewives for a buck a chicken.
The first time I show up there, it was fucking hot, and...
I came to the door, she offered me a glass of water.
So we're in the kitchen talking about the weather or some shit...
...and she just reaches out, she grabs ahold of my joint.
She asks me:
"Does that feel good?"
I said, "Yeah."
And she asks me,
"You ever been with a woman?"
And I said, "Yeah. No."
So she takes me into the bedroom.
She takes her clothes off, and she's a real woman.
I mean, she's got pubic hair from here to here.
It's black and curly like those Spanish girls.
And I want to get the fuck out of there, so she grabs me...
...and says, "Have you ever kissed a girl down there?"
I said, "No."
So she wets her fingers.
She touches herself real soft.
She touches her clit and tells me to lick there.
Tells me to put my tongue there, take my time, lick in a slow circle.
And after a while she came.
She asked me to give her...
Get on top of her and look her in the eyes.
- Why did you go back?
- My kids. I missed my kids.
I didn't know you had kids.
How would you?
My oldest boy wants to be a teacher.
I don't know what happened to him.
It's like Martians landed and took over his brain.
- What does he want to teach?
- Schmoogs. Can you believe it?
Hey, I'm missing one of my...
I'm missing one of the charms on my bracelet.
Maybe on West Broadway.
Hey...
...there's something
I really do have to tell you.
Oh, yeah?
You've seen me before.
I've seen you at the Red Turtle.
This whole time, I'm thinking,
"I've seen this girl before."
And now you're telling me
I met you at the Red Turtle.
- I don't think so, babe.
- It was dark...
...and I had on my glasses.
And there was a man...
...and a girl, and she was giving him a blowjob.
A blowjob?
- And I watched.
- Oh, you did, did you?
You like that sort of thing?
You like watching?
You don't remember a girl with blue fingernails with diamonds in them?
What did you say? Blue fingernails?
- She had brown hair?
- Yes.
Yeah, what about her?
I think that's Angela Sands.
That's the girl that was murdered.
But I wasn't with her.
I think you saw something.
You should come to the station and look at some pictures...
...as soon as possible.
- Swear you weren't there.
- Swear to God.
I never seen you or her before in my entire fucking life.
I gotta get out of here.
Hey, I had a nice time.
Thanks.
Oh, God, I could have lost you.
- Then you let the detective fuck you.
- I didn't let him, I wanted to.
- Have you ordered?
- Double latte, no foam.
Yeah.
It's sore, huh?
So the detective guy's sexy?
You like him?
You gonna see him again?
Would you trust a guy who gets blowjobs in bars?
Yes.
I think he's a liar.
You think he's a liar, or he is a liar?
Because, of course, we never lie, so...
I saw him in a bar with a girl.
Wait.
- A bar?
- Yeah.
I thought you just met him.
I thought that he rescued you.
- Lf you don't want him, I'll take him.
- Forget it, Pauline. Forget it.
No, arrange an introduction with your lying detective.
Who's that?
John Graham.
I thought you said he looked like a movie star?
He played a doctor on a soap.
Now he's studying to be one.
Hi.
- You look terrible.
- Excuse me, sir. No dogs in here.
I know that.
- Will you be long?
- I just ordered a coffee.
- You're very tan.
- Hi, John Graham.
- Pauline.
- How are you?
Take your time. I'll wait.
Don't look out there, because he's watching you.
Oh, he's so intense.
I remember every guy
I ever fucked...
...by how he liked to do it, not how I wanted to do it.
Sometimes I think it's just me.
I mean, are other women able to say:
"Suck my dick, pinch my nipples, bend over"?
Probably not "suck my dick."
Here's what I think.
I think you can come over to my place and sleep there for a few nights...
...maybe even a week.
It would make me really happy.
And the mugger has your wallet, so he's gonna know where you live.
You know, you really have to see this detective again.
I ordered a coffee.
Miss, we ordered a latte.
- No foam.
- No foam, very, very dry. Thank you.
He's still there.
Whose car did you get into yesterday?
It looked like it'd just come from Beirut.
Whose car did you get into yesterday?
It looked like it'd just come from Beirut.
I don't know how people can drive around in filthy cars.
- Maybe one of my students.
- Are you dating a student?
Pardon?
You went to the Red Turtle Bar with a black student.
- Are you dating him?
- No.
I saw you last Saturday.
- What were you doing?
- Is that the point? I don't think so.
The point is that he could get the wrong idea.
You don't know how guys think.
Are you all right, John?
Not really. I've...
I've been having these panic attacks lately.
- I don't know. They're pretty bad.
- What happens?
Do you ever get these funny images...
...from the past, like you saw something or you knew something?
Weird memories from childhood?
I just wish I didn't keep having these funny attacks. My brain...
Well, my brain practically explodes.
I'm gonna go on antidepressants.
I need to ask you a favor.
Do you think you could take care of Patrick?
He's barking all the time. Probably because my hours are so long.
John, I can't take care of a dog.
Especially not my dog, right?
You'd rather cut his head off.
No, not especially your dog.
Why don't you put up a notice or something.
Put up a notice? Where am I?
I'm in the hospital 18 hours out of 24.
You don't get it, do you?
Well, okay. Come here.
Say goodbye.
John, are you gonna put him down?
Maybe. I don't know, maybe I will.
I could do it myself.
I could shave his little arm...
I don't think it's a good idea that we see each other.
Fuck!
Fuck.
Well...
Fuck.
Well, this is out of the blue.
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna have to think about this.
Midway along the journey of our life
I woke to find myself in a dark wood...
...for I had wandered off from the straight path.
Thanks.
Thank you.
I fell over.
- Truly?
- Yours truly.
You don't never talk.
- It's always just jive.
- Well, I like to be ironic.
I'm looking for Miss Avery,
Francis Avery?
- She's gone. Her class is finished.
- It's over?
- Which one is it? This one down here?
- She might still be in the staff lounge.
I've been thinking on Gacy, you know?
Pogo the Clown?
I've been thinking that it wasn't his fault, you know?
Like, he were the victim.
What do you know about Cornelius Webb?
Of what?
Desire.
- Aren't you gonna help carry my bag?
- No.
You're an Amazon, Miss Avery.
That's like an insult.
- So we're here?
- Yeah.
- Hey, Papi.
- Hey, baby.
- I'm gonna help you upstairs.
- No, I got it. Thank you.
- No, let me help you upstairs.
- I really don't... Okay, bye.
Good night.
- Let me get this for you.
- I got it. Thank you, Cornelius.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
You sure?
Oh, that was very smooth, Daddy.
Oh, that turned me on.
That was nice. Give me a kiss.
- Go away, man!
- Don't do that. Come here.
- Don't do that.
- Sit right here. Oh, you are so sexy.
Help me put my earring back in.
Come here.
In 1978, Mr. John Wayne Gacy was in trouble...
...when the police dug up a dead body under his cellar.
When the police were done, they had 27 dead bodies.
Most of them from under the house.
He said he was innocent of the crime...
...and sometimes he said that he loved those boys.
He never said he was sorry.
Not even at the end, when they gave him his lethal injection.
"He was chatty, " his guard said.
He wanted to discuss the Chicago
Cubs and eat fried chicken.
I'm gonna take a sleeping pill.
Two, in fact.
Do you want one?
No.
It's so fucking noisy I can't sleep.
I have to move.
I mean, clearly, I have got to move.
Why don't you see him again.
You're brave in so many ways.
You're thinking about him, right?
- About sex.
- So?
You wouldn't be thinking about the sex if you didn't like him.
Well, at least call him.
He doesn't know where you are.
I go to court tomorrow...
...because of the tan suit.
They're trying to get a restraining order against me.
Probably won't be allowed within 500 miles of Dr. Cass' office.
Yeah, laugh it up.
- You know what I'm thinking?
- What to wear.
No, I'm imagining that when he sees me...
...he's gonna realize that he's in love with me, and, you know...
...one thing will lead to another, and after a love child or two...
...we'll get married.
Have I ever told you how our father proposed to my mother?
No. Tell me.
Well, when he was very young, he was...
...very handsome and an excellent skater.
And she was the new girl in town, barely able to skate.
She was very, very innocent.
Very beautiful.
Of course.
And he was already engaged, but he couldn't stop watching my mother.
This is my song.
And finally...
...his fiancee got very jealous and...
I would too.
And threw that engagement ring right back at him.
- Whoa.
- And that very same day...
...he took my mother by the hand...
...he danced her out to the middle of the forest-fringed lake...
...he got down on one knee...
...and offered her the very same engagement ring.
Oh, that's nice.
And at that precise moment, which is the thing my mother always added...
...it started to snow.
That's very romantic.
I don't quite believe it.
But that's my mother's story.
That's the way she always told it, you know.
He killed her.
When he left, she just went crazy with grief.
You know, she didn't understand it.
She just couldn't believe it.
How many times has Dad been married?
- Four.
- Four? He never married my mother.
Yeah, he was already plotting the fifth.
I want to get married once...
...just for my mom.
Is a husband too much for me to ask for?
It's too hot.
Even Angela Sands had a fiance.
Yeah. Well, he probably cut her head off.
That's sad.
- I'll see you later on, doc.
- Sure.
I'm gonna start opening up the machine.
Open her slightly, let some fluid out, and we'll catch it at the catch basin.
On three. One, two, three.
I'm taking out the first article of clothing. I've got...
It appears to be a woman's left hand, and on it is...
...a ring with a white stone in it.
Do me a favor. Get a close-up of that.
It appears to be...
Possibly a serrated blade.
Come over here with me, and what
I'd like to do is get another shot.
Over here, give me a close-up on that.
Thank you. You got the close-up on the ring, correct?
- Got it.
- Okay.
- We're gonna start taking out...
- Detective Malloy.
- Hi.
- Frannie, hey. Hold on a second.
- I'm stepping out.
- All right, no problem.
Hey, where you been?
I've been calling you all week.
You know, you're supposed to look at some photos, remember?
- I've been staying with Pauline.
- Yeah, where she's staying?
She has a place above the Baby Doll Lounge.
So... Hey, I must have called you like 10 times.
Do you think you can make it to the precinct tomorrow? It's important.
Why?
Well, another girl's been murdered.
A med student.
Oh, no.
- What happened?
- She was cut up. Can't find her head.
The fucking press is all over us.
It's a megillah.
We're all doing overtime. Even the house mouses are on the street.
Do you think it's the same guy who killed Angela Sands?
If you're asking me, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
- I'm getting out of here.
- I came to look for her.
- What time?
- I don't know.
Hold on a second.
I'm not gonna sleep tonight.
Do something for me, will you?
- Are you standing?
- Why?
Are you alone?
Where's your sister?
Sit down.
Are you sitting?
Put your hand between your legs.
Inside your panties.
That pussy that I like.
And you slip your middle finger in.
It's deep. It's soaking wet.
You run your finger up, and your clit's right there.
It comes down to meet you.
It jumps in your hand.
When you touch a woman and her clit's like that...
...you know she knows about sex like you.
I gotta go.
It's off in the distance
It came into the room
It's here in the circle
- Hold on one second. Can I help you?
- I'm here to see Detective Malloy.
- Malloy!
- Yeah.
- Your visitor's out here, man.
- Who the hell?
It's my sister.
How you doing?
Why don't you take a hike.
- Yeah.
- You sleep all right? I missed you.
Come on. Over here.
Look at this. We got leaks in the ceiling.
They shoot down on us with
.22 caliber rifles from the rooftops.
Detective Rodriguez, you remember Miss...
Avery.
Yeah, I know your name.
- Hey, how you doing?
- Fine. Thank you.
- Hey, you got anything on that ViCAP?
- Nothing.
Detective Malloy.
Stand by, please. Malloy.
- Malloy!
- Yeah.
I'm glad I got a chance to talk to you.
I want to apologize.
The other night, I was drunk.
I was out of line.
- I hope you didn't get the wrong idea.
- No. I didn't get the wrong idea.
We're square, then?
Malloy wants me to look at pictures.
He said you'd have them.
Pictures?
I was mugged the other night on West Broadway.
Oh, yeah, pictures.
No problem.
Who's that?
- Really?
- I thought the guy was wearing a mask.
- You couldn't see his face?
- No, I couldn't.
Why does Malloy want you to look at pictures?
Perhaps I'll recognize somebody who was at the Red Turtle Bar.
That don't mean shit.
- Hey Ritchie, what's up?
- What's up, Halloran? How's the diet?
Hey, pato, kiss my ass.
I got those phone numbers. It took me all fucking day. You owe me bigtime.
Look through there.
If he's in there, he'll jump out at you.
You got a good memory?
If you see him, you gonna be able to pick him out?
I don't think that memory is very reliable.
Well, it better be.
You're a school teacher, right?
- People count on your memory.
- Detective Rodriguez bothering you?
- Telling you about fish in the Hudson?
- I was telling her about the time...
...the cat ate the DOA's balls on 123rd Street.
- That's a good one.
- Malloy.
Malloy. What am I, your maid or something?
Your food is ready.
Your curry tofu.
I gotta get something to eat.
You hungry? You like calamari?
- There's this place on Arthur Ave...
- Ritchie.
When did you start liking white women?
About the same time as you.
See you later.
Let's get the fuck out of here.
This place is too fucking busy.
Come on. Let's go somewhere quiet.
How did you get to be a homicide detective so young?
- Me?
- Yeah.
- In a word?
- Yeah.
Compassion. I took the desk no one else wanted.
What desk was that?
The desk next to the holding cell.
You know, so I talked to the perps.
Gave them cigarettes, gum, so they start to trust you.
You know, start telling you things you want to know.
After a while, you pull down a big confession. I got some bumps up.
Hey.
How long do you think...?
How long you suppose a woman needs to know a guy...
...before she'll get engaged to him?
- Shortest amount of time.
- Come on, Malloy.
- How long?
- Oh, I don't know. I guess it depends.
- It took my mother about a half-hour.
- You're kidding me?
No.
What'd your father do? Romance her to fall in love? Put a gun to her head?
- How'd that happen?
- Yeah. Yeah.
O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms
Alone and palely loitering?
The sedge has withered
From the lake, and no birds sing
- What's "sedge"?
- Ferns.
This looks like a place where they dump bodies.
What's in these bags?
Garbage.
Go on, try it.
- No. I'm frightened of guns.
- Why don't you learn to use one.
Go on.
Go on.
How do you hold this thing?
Do you...? One hand or two?
Hold it any way you want.
Just don't hold it this way.
Again.
- You have to hold it with two hands.
- Yeah. Try aiming this time.
Try. Go on. Try.
Cheap piece of shit.
Let's see what good kissers we are.
- We already kissed.
- No, not really.
Come on, Miss Isthmus.
You used to do this when you were a kid?
I went to boarding school.
You're here for the sex, right?
You don't go nowhere with me,
I didn't fuck you.
Yeah, all right.
Would you get engaged to me?
- Is this about the murder?
- No.
Yeah, I can't get the sick fuck out of my head.
- While we were kissing?
- All the fucking time.
So do you want to stop by my place?
Yeah.
I gotta tell you,
I'm going away for a while.
Probably not gonna be able to talk to you for a little bit.
- Where are you going?
- Florida.
It's all paid for so I could have some time with my kids.
- Is your wife going?
- My ex-wife? Yeah.
- No, your wife.
- Get the fuck out of here.
I sleep on the fucking couch.
All right?
It's complicated.
I didn't have money to get an apartment...
...so I went to live with my mother.
She's worse than my wife.
Three years ago I moved back.
We don't sleep together.
I moved back for my kids, okay?
She can't control my kids.
Do you ever tell the truth?
Where you going?
I'll give you a ride home.
Hey!
Something wrong?
How did you get in?
I hope you don't mind.
I took a shower.
You know, you might want to check your messages.
That student of yours has been taken in for questioning.
The police found his term paper illustrated in blood.
That's a little weird, isn't it?
You want some tea?
I have to go out.
Actually, the real reason that I'm here is because...
...I thought I should tell you that I'm gonna call Pauline and ask her out.
Really?
Did I ever tell you that my mother...
...used to dress me in girls' blouses?
Yes, I think you did.
- So do you think it's a good idea?
- What?
About Pauline. I think it's a good idea, but, you know...
Then again,
I hardly know her at all.
I don't think Pauline will sleep with you, if that's what you're thinking.
You're right.
You're right. What...?
What am I thinking?
She's worse than you are.
Have sex with me?
I must be out of my fucking mind.
Will you have sex with me?
Shit! I'm out of my fucking mind.
Will you have sex with me?
Now
Thinking back on the course
Of my passion
I was like one blind
Unafraid of the dark
- Have you seen Pauline?
- No.
- She hasn't come in tonight?
- No, she hasn't, but...
...just let me check, okay?
Have you seen Pauline?
No.
Myself, I hate to drink alone.
Pauline?
Pauline?
Are you alone?
Frannie.
Frannie.
Frannie, it's Malloy.
Hon, I gotta take that bag away from you.
I gotta take the bag. Come on.
I know. I know. I gotta take it.
- Hey, Jackie.
- Yeah.
- Can you get her to 622 on 6th Street?
- No problem.
I was at the morgue.
I'm sorry they made you wait.
I told them to let you go home.
I need to ask you some questions about Pauline, Frannie.
Let's go.
When I was 13...
...my father left me in Geneva.
He was called away to Washington for five days.
He said later that it never occurred to him that I wouldn't be all right.
Pauline said that I failed to take advantage of the situation.
That I should have ordered...
...hundreds of boxes of chocolate, that I should have made a snowman.
- Was Pauline engaged?
- No.
You recognize this?
We found it on her left third finger.
No. Is that it?
Is that his signature?
Yeah, it's his signature.
I want to know what happened.
I want to know if it was quick.
Why do you think knowing's gonna make a difference, Frannie?
- I thought that all my life.
- You're wrong.
- Knowing don't mean shit.
- "Doesn't" mean shit.
This guy must have known her.
He strangled her...
...till she lost consciousness, probably in the bedroom...
...then dragged her into the bathroom and cut her throat.
Cut through the windpipe, the jugular, the epiglottis, the hyoid, the tongue.
He held her by her hair and cut all around.
This guy likes blood.
When he got to the vertebrae...
...he needed a bigger knife to cut through that, and he had one.
He pulled the drain in the sinks before he left...
...so he left us nothing that could help us.
It scares me that this guy knows about drains.
I'm gonna go back to the apartment.
There's something I know, but I don't know it yet.
- Sometimes it helps just to sit there...
- How will you get in?
I got a key.
- You have a key?
- Yeah.
You have her key?
- I guess so. I have a key.
- Did you kill her?
Sgt. Lawrence, can you give
Miss Avery a drive home?
- Yes.
- Get the fuck out of here.
Who is it? Malloy?
It's me. Cornelius.
I heard about your friend.
It's all over the TV.
My sister.
Why are you wearing one shoe?
The other shoe's holding the door open, upstairs in my...
You got a...
You got a petal.
What happened?
Fuck that man, all right.
- Fuck who?
- Fuck him! That cop.
- What cop?
- Fuck him!
What cop? Malloy?
You all right?
I don't...
I don't want to do this.
Why? You don't like it?
No, I like it. I like it. I just don't want to do this. I'm drunk.
I didn't want to fuck you anyways.
What you want, huh?
- What, girl?
- Let me go.
- What?
- Let me go.
You been looking to fuck my head up since day one!
- You've been looking to fuck with me.
- Cornelius.
You don't know me, man.
- What?
- Malloy wanted me to check.
- Make sure you got home all right.
- Where is he?
You okay?
- You tell him not to bother me.
- Sure.
Frannie, it's Malloy. Open the door.
Frannie!
Frannie, open the door.
Frannie, come on, wake up.
Open the door.
Frannie!
Frannie, come on!
You look all right to me.
Ritchie said you were screaming half-naked out the window.
- You were a long time.
- Yeah, I was working.
Getting a blowjob?
Isn't that your line of work?
What is it?
No such thing as a bad blowjob.
Well, you're wrong there.
Some women give terrible blowjobs.
No rhythm at all.
No sense of cock whatsoever.
Good phrase,
"no sense of cock."
Yes, that must be terrible.
Frannie, we got a problem here.
I'm standing in your sister's apartment, trying to put this case together. I can't.
You want to know why?
I'm worrying about you.
Let's get you cleaned up, come on.
Give you a bath.
Let's go.
Good cop.
I'm a good detective.
It's the only thing I'm good at.
I'm not good at this.
Want me to go, I'll go. Want me to stay, I'll stay. Gotta want something.
You're smarter than me.
I'm running to keep up.
- I'm scared of what I want.
- Why? Is it a lot?
Yeah, it's a lot.
That's the problem with women.
You can never be satisfied.
I'm sorry.
- Why? You didn't do nothing.
- I'm sorry you feel that way.
Your problem is, you're fucking exhausting.
Fuck this. I was doing just fine before I met you. Just fine.
What's this?
You'll see.
- Will I like it?
- I don't know.
I think so.
You're not sure.
You're not sure.
- You think I'm obsessed with you?
- Maybe.
No.
No. No.
Go on, fuck yourself.
I wanna watch you fuck yourself.
- Go on.
- You like to watch?
Yeah, I like it in the cut.
That's it. Fuck yourself.
That's it. Go on.
You're so beautiful. If I keep looking at you, I'll have to quit being a cop.
Frannie. Oh, Frannie.
All right.
Get me out of these things.
Get me out of this.
Makes me very nervous, being in handcuffs.
Hurry up! I'm starting to fucking feel like a chick here.
- Get over there.
- Where is it?
In my jacket pocket.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Yeah.
Inside left pocket.
Hurry up!
Oh, yeah.
- The charm from my bracelet.
- I meant to give it to you. I forgot.
Where did you get this?
On West Broadway.
I went back there the same night...
...to see if I had missed something, and I found it.
It was you.
What the fuck is the matter with you?
I saw you. I saw your tattoo.
I never thought that you killed her.
I just never thought that.
Frannie, get me out of these fucking things now!
Enough of this shit, Frannie.
Give me the key.
Get me out of here.
I'm not kidding, Frannie.
Get me out of this fucking thing.
Unlock these fucking things now!
Give me the fucking keys!
Mother...
Damn it!
Fuck!
Get your fucking ass out the goddamn street, bitch!
Whoa!
- Are you okay?
- Is she all right?
She's fine. Thanks, Dad.
Take it easy.
- I didn't know.
- Take it easy.
I can't go with you, because he'll know.
- What?
- He killed Pauline.
- Who?
- Malloy.
I saw him with Angela Sands.
I saw his tattoo.
I saw the three of spades.
Jesus. We'd better talk about this.
- We'll go someplace.
- I can't go to the police.
- You tell me what happened.
- Frannie!
- Did he hurt you?
- No.
Frannie!
Fuck! Fuck! No!
Where are we going?
To the lighthouse.
You ever been there?
To the Lighthouse.
I teach that book.
Yeah? I fish there.
Look at the G.W.
That's something.
It's my little fishing lodge.
Wanna see inside?
Yeah, me and Malloy, we got them together after our first big bust.
He's a good cop.
Best partner I ever had.
You want wine?
I got wine.
I'm gonna have to leave you here a couple of days.
I'm sorry.
People saw us together on the street.
You wanna hang up his jacket?
Are you cold?
Don't cry.
Hey, hey.
Don't cry.
Don't cry.
You ever been in love?
See, I met this girl.
I've been thinking about her my whole life.
You know, dreaming about her.
But the thing is...
...I don't know if she loves me.
I mean, all women want love, right?
What about you?
You want love?
Wanna be kissed?
My guess is, you want it so bad it hurts.
I'm right.
Will you marry me, Frannie?
Put on the ring.
Put on the fucking...
Jesus-fucking-Christ!
What are you, crazy?
[Woman screaming]
[Indistinct voices]
[Woman shouting]
How about I drive, huh?
[Indistinct talking on police radio]
Oh.
[Exhales deeply]
There we go.
[Exhales deeply]
About time you showed up.
Some couples like to talk.
Did they see anything?
They don't know the girls, didn't see the car. Nothing.
How many more miles do we have left to cover?
SARA: We're on Stone Hollow, and we need to check these two roads and circle back around.
Harris wants us back to base by midnight, so...
Maybe the perimeter's not wide enough. Maybe...
This guy's a traveler.
Maybe the first body is throwing us off.
Your turn.
[Mumbling]
[Swing creaking]
[Brahms' "Lullaby" plays]
[Clanging]
New paint, new plates.
It's our guy.
- He's here.
- Shit. Back in the car.
Let him think we're leaving.
We'll get tactical.
All units, this is Predator 5 requesting backup.
We're on Stone Hollow Road.
- We have the UNSUB's vehicle...
- [Women screaming]
They're still alive.
Come on.
FBI!
[Flies buzzing]
[Door closes]
["Lullaby" continues]
[Cooing]
[Screaming, gunshots]
- Oh, God.
- Check the girls.
Sara!
Talk to me, Sara.
Predator 5 to base.
Over.
We have the situation secure.
Repeat... situation is secure.
Suspect is dead.
So are the girls.
There were three shots fired.
[Gasps]
Hey!
Sara!
Sara, drop!
Get rid of the line!
Get down! Down!
Drop! Drop!
[Beeping]
Ohh.
[Broken dishes clinking]
Man. Thought you guys were never gonna get here.
Hey, Harris,
I'm fucking starving!
[Flies buzzing]
[Buzzing stops]
[Engine turns over]
So, tomorrow...
I have a senior staff meeting with the director,
A Q4 performance review, and an academy course to prep.
But now, instead, I get to waste my whole day at your funerals.
Special Agent Moore, when is the situation secure?
- On the drive home.
- On the drive home.
That's right.
On the drive home.
- Sir, we didn't...
- Shut up.
Cigarettes on the table.
More at the door.
Different brands.
Two cars out front.
4 place settings, not 3.
All should have alerted you to the possibility that there might be another suspect.
- I think...
- I'm sorry? What?
What did you say?
I think you enjoy watching us fail, sir.
Better in here than out there.
You know this really happened?
The UNSUB was apprehended in under 2 minutes without a shot fired.
It took you guys 7 minutes, and you killed your partner.
Have some cake.
The majority of murders are committed by someone known to the victim.
Those that are not solved within the first 48 hours seldom are.
Not so with serial killers.
One advantage in this line of work is knowing that as long as the UNSUB is out there, you'll always have another chance.
With each new killing comes a resetting of the clock.
Time is on your side.
The model for this exercise was a missing-persons search in Buffalo, 1982.
The dead man was an accomplice who was killed the day before.
The killer staged a suicide in order to try, in effect, an escape.
As you can see, some of you responded better than others.
Well, exactly how many times has a profiler been in a kill-or-capture situation since 1982?
Are you suggesting I'm preparing you for something you may never experience?
Success comes when you understand that your most lethal weapon isn't your firearm, but your brain.
A lot of the old guard don't believe in my methods.
A lot of them think I'm crazy.
You're a privileged group.
You're all smart or you wouldn't be here.
I just want you to be smarter.
Our final exercise will be on the island of Oneiga.
This simulation will be a test primarily of your teamwork.
I hope you're ready.
Then how could we have saved the girls at the old hotel?
You couldn't. They were dead no matter what you did.
What's the point if we couldn't have saved them?
The point is to get used to it.
? There, you've seen it, my behavior's unacceptable ?
Good evening, my fine, young FBI friends.
I am a pretty little thing just out of lit class at GMU.
Please note the Jimmy Joyce in my Kate Spade.
My parents are loaded as per my expensive ensemble.
And that "J"...Where is it?
On my key ring... means I'm either a Jill or a Jennifer.
Those being the favorite "J" names of Beltway parents circa 1981.
I like to hang with my friends and have a good time, but I'm really just a mature woman looking for a mature man.
And I recently quit smoking.
[English accent]
Why do you say that?
You see the way she keeps eyeing the guy next to her?
It's not him.
It's his cigarette.
Spoken like a woman who knows.
How long has it been, Nicole?
3 days?
The lovely Nicole and her personal demons.
I'm surprised there's enough room at the table for all of us.
Take me 5 minutes to get her number.
Take me 2.
- You're on.
- Money's coming out.
- $20 works.
- Whoo!
Whoa, big money.
Hi. I think I know you, don't I?
You're, um, uh...
Jill, right?
Jen.
Jen, Jen. Yes.
Yes, Jen, of course.
Okay, obviously you don't remember me.
My name's Bobby.
Bobby Whitman.
Rafe, you're up.
Profile.
Okay.
Black suit, blond hair,
Martini.
I'm the sophisticated type on the prowl for pretty, young things.
Preferably blond.
Preferably a cheerleader with great big...
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
Enough.
Right about the blond.
You're on fire.
You're projecting.
I don't know. It was 2 seconds at a lecture last semester.
GMU Lit Department, right?
The Moody lecture?
Yeah, yeah, Moody.
Heck of a writer.
Um...
I'm actually not even a student myself.
Um...
I work in finance.
Oh. Finance?
- Oh! Right. Bobby.
- Yeah.
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi. I'm good.
He's got 15 seconds.
Thank you.
Lucas, looks like tonight wasrt your night.
I know her. Her name's Jen.
I told her to play along.
You're full of shit.
You never know.
ALL: Ooh.
Ooh.
[Laughter]
So, what is going on in that head?
We're professionals.
We shouldn't have to put up with Harris' shit.
All right, what's up?
I'm not making profiler.
I was alone in his office.
His recommends were on the desk, and I read them.
We still have the weekend at Oneiga.
He says I'm unfocused.
He says I'm not capable of the psychological commitment necessary for profiling work.
How do you like that?
Commitment. Like,
"Fucking look at me, man."
Vince, I think...
You're not making profiler either, Sara.
Sorry.
I read it.
Don't work too hard out there, okay?
We've got a late addition.
This is Detective Gabe Jenson.
He's from the Philadelphia P.D.
Good morning.
How you doir?
He's their resident profiler, and somehow he got on D.O.J.'s good side and convinced the attorney general he could sit in on some exercises and see how I work.
Do I have the politics about right?
Something like that.
He's joining the team?
He's just here to observe, not to participate.
Now, be nice to him or it's my ass.
No offense, Detective.
None taken. It's an honor to meet all of you.
You want to do hostage rescue, a smallpox outbreak, this is the place.
Navy Seas built it for war-game practice.
Once a year, they turn it over to me for the weekend.
Okay, get your rappelling lines and prepare to drop.
That's a joke.
Here we are.
Crimetown, USA.
Where all the residents are dead.
Or about to be.
Now, the idea here, people, is to only kill the bad guys.
[Beeping]
But nobody's perfect.
It's nice to hear you say that, sir.
RAFE: It's like Beirut meets Belfast.
Sir, I thought they didn't let foreign nationals in the FBI.
Don't worry. On the inside he's 100% American, right?
As American as the death penalty.
HARRIS:
That's my boy.
I think I'm in love.
Oh, there is one other person.
They'll be coming along shortly.
Who's that?
He's called a puppeteer.
He's killed two people on these streets, and he's about to kill a third.
Tomorrow you'll find the crime scene and receive your background dossiers.
By 0800 on Monday, I want a full profile of this suspect.
I want to know who he is, what he does, and where he's gonna do it next.
I'm asking Special Agent Reston to be team leader unless you'd like to defer.
No, Harris.
I will solve whatever sick, twisted crime scenario you come up with.
I hope so.
What's the tank for?
The Navy uses it to simulate Arctic regions.
That's what the nitrogers for.
In general, if it says
"military," don't touch it.
Oh.
Great.
Navy humor.
The computers are loaded with ViCAP, but they're fully firewalled.
Don't do any research offsite.
If you want to do any blood samples on the autorad, analyze fibers... scout samples...
- [Buzzing]
- It's all here.
You'll rest up here till the morning.
Downstairs, there's a fully stocked freezer, bunks, and your showers.
Don't forget.
You're 50 miles offshore.
If you run out of toilet paper, you are shit out of luck.
So, what's the point?
Sorry, Detective?
The island, the middle of nowhere, they're professionals.
What's the point?
The point is that they're isolated, alone, and forgotten.
That's what it's like to be inside the mind of a sociopath.
Have you noticed it's a really bad feeling here?
Good luck on your profile.
Go!

What?
He said dress for an island.
J. D:
So, Detective, what exactly did you do to earn this island paradise?
Recommended for it.
Same as you.
Why, though?
Did you catch some killer in Philly or something?
What's the deal?
You don't want to know my war stories.
Well, actually, I do.
I mean, right now, what do we know about you for real?
We know he's got resentments toward his parents, as per the overload on tattoos he's got there.
We know he's just out of a bad relationship.
He's barely looked twice at me and Sara.
Maybe you're not my type,
Nicole.
We're alone on an island.
Trust me, I'm your type.
We also know he watches his words.
So that crossword's either a sign of honing a talent or correcting a deficiency.
What you say about me doesn't tell you about me.
It tells me about you.
Now, I could say your little gambling means you have an addictive personality.
I could say I know you're sleeping with one of the guys in this room.
I could say you take charge of your team because you never had a leader in your own life.
And you.
When push comes to shove, you crack under pressure.
Your partners can't depend on you.
You don't belong here.
But that's all surface.
Psych 101 bullshit.
That's not who you are.
All for killing him in his sleep?
# It's gettir hot #
Bad for you... 1:45.
Damn!
[Waves crashing]
You push me in,
I'll have your badge.
I, uh, came out here to feed the ducks.
I see you're feeding the ducks.
Maybe we could feed the ducks together.
Leave you alone?
No, no.
It's all right.
I don't smoke.
I know.
It's a gesture.
Goodwill, sympathy.
You know, the usual.
In lieu of knowing what's going on.
He's not gonna let me make profiler.
He thinks I can't get past it.
Is he right?
When I was a kid,
I lost both my parents.
Freak thing.
10 years old.
Bang. Mortality.
So I grew up living real hard.
Racing cars, smoking, drinking, sleeping with any girl
I could find.
Real stupid, dangerous lifestyle.
Then I turned 11, and...
All I know is this.
You don't confront your demons and defeat them.
You confront them.
Then you confront them.
Then you confront them some more.
Every single day.
[Water running]
[Crackling]
[Both grunting]
You are seriously fucked up, you know that?
You know what I hate about you, J.D.?
What?
You only want me for my mind.
[Breathing heavily]
[Yowling]
[Grunting]
[Yowling]
[Groans]
[Bell clanging]
[Screams]
NICOLE:
What happened?
I'd like to know how Harris got it here.
I'd say the issue is "why?"
Here, kitty kitty.
What kind of simulation is this?
Ah. Oh!
Ugh.
That supposed to mean something?
So, what, is this supposed to be some kind of warning sign?
Well, if I know Harris, it's a sign of something.
It's 9:30 A.M.,
Saturday morning.
We're in search of an unknown crime scene.
We'll split into pairs.
The first one who finds it wins my eternal love and devotion.
And a dead cat.
[Cat yowls]
And a dead cat.
[Bell rings]
Now, this place must remind you of home.
Ha.
Happytown, USA.
Sst!
Look.
It's little Bobby.
Little Bobby's gonna grow up to be big and strong and pursue a career in buried children and dismembered mummies.
Now, that will make
Happytown proud.
I think you're in the wrong line of work.
No, mate.
Not me.
Hey!
Dinner at Harris' house.
Pass the nuts.
Charming.
Great.
A cigarette machine.
Temptation is everywhere.
Hey, Agent, we searching together or what?
Suit yourself.
I'm on vacation.
Hey, Vince!
Check out the other side of town.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Huh.
Hey, everybody!
Harris, you are one sick son of a bitch.
Stay on my 6.
Okay, everybody, it's about that time to look alive.
We have victim.
Or victims?
We got a single victim.
Caucasian female.
The puppeteer.
That's a hell of a signature.
Why don't you check the employee logs, receipts?
See who shopped here, who worked here. That sort of thing.
Let me run forensic, work the timeline.
Sara, why don't you check the carcass?
Sara!
Sure.
Oh.
There's splatter behind the counter.
The girl was definitely moved.
Any venture as to weapon?
- You want to take point on M.O.?
- Absolutely.
Nic, not to step on your toes, but I'm gonna bet the guy's a trophy taker.
What are you smiling about?
If the taxpayers only knew...
I think I'll go see if the
UNSUB's still in the building.
Sweetheart, it's just a simulation, yeah?
Where we're from, a site search is called procedure.
Yeah?
We should have been allowed to bring our guns.
It doesn't feel real without my gun.
Hell, Vince, how real do you want it?
# Welcome to puppet... #
Don't move.
Don't move! Sara.
# Pull my strings, it's time to play #
Let's see what freak show
Harris has in mind.
# Surprises at puppet playtime #
It's no fun unless it's a challenge, right?
# Hope you all enjoy your stay #
# Welcome to puppet... #
[Music stops]
Move!
Aah.
Aah!
My legs!
No!
Don't touch it!
Help!
It'll burn you!
- They're frozen!
- Help him!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Stop!
[Cracking]
[Breathing heavily]
This is a joke, right?
That was just a simulation.
[Crying]
I'm sorry, Nic.
- Were they working before?
- No signal, nothing.
What if it was some kind of accident?
Someone killed J.D.
Don't you get it?
Someone is here on this island.
That wasrt there last night either.
It's an hour and a half.
It's a message.
What about the boat?
We saw that pier with the boat when we flew in.
Watch your backs and everyone else's.
Hit the boat and find the radio.
The simulatiors over.
Now is not the time for fear, people.
- Now is the ti...
- [Beeping]
Shit.
- Sara!
- Ohh!
Sara!
Get her out of the water!
[Both gasping]
Help me get her out of the water!
Get her out of the water!
Ugh!
It's okay.
You're okay.
Aah!
I'll handle it.
I'll handle it.
I've got her.
Back the fuck off!
I'll handle it!
It's okay.
You're out of the water, all right? You're out.
Aah!
All right.
You're out of the water.
- You're okay.
- What's her thing with water?
I think I lost my smokes.
Harris brought us to this island.
Now we're not allowed to leave.
- Let's talk about this Harris.
- [Coughing]
Harris wouldn't do this.
You can say what you want, but Harris is a company man.
Did anyone actually see him get back in that chopper?
Oh, tell me somebody witnessed that.
Maybe he got tired of the simulations.
Missed the taste of the real thing.
I'll give him a taste of the real thing.
Did he just pull that gun out of his arse?
We werert supposed to bring weapons.
My gun goes where I go.
If you get shot sometime, maybe you'll understand.
You shouldn't have brought your weapon, Vince.
You're gonna be glad I did.
Two square miles at most.
Hey.
Check this out.
Who wants to play some hide-and-seek?
Anyone else is on this island,
Harris or worse, we're gonna find them.
How's about your Navy?
They don't muck around, do they?
GABE:
Damn cats.
[Thunder crashes]
Aah! Aah!
Oh, for the love of God, just take the arm.
There. There.
That's the Lucas I know.
You want to get up and do it all over again.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
I told you I'm fine.
Yeah, you told me, but...
As long as people aren't asking me if I'm all right,
I'm all right.
So can I ask you something else, then?
Anything else.
Well, since the end may be near here, have you kind of always sort of had a thing for me?
Aah!
[Laughs]
Is that a no?
20 minutes of 12:00.
So at 12:00 someone else is killed?
Somebody left those watches.
And left them after Harris had gone.
Where is this killer?
We searched the island.
Somebody set that trap.
Somebody rigged that boat.
So what are we saying?
This is some kind of game?
Eeny, meeny, miney, mo.
Who's the next motherfucker to go?
It's 12:00.
It's 12:00, and we're still here!
We're still here, and it's 12:00, and...
Shut up, Vince.
All right. Look.
We know that there is a killer on the island.
Someone who knows what we're here for, someone who knows where we'd be.
There's just one problem.
There's no one on the island but us.
Now, hold on.
Real slow.
Real easy like.
Let's all move our hands away from our weapons.
- You get on the ground.
- Lucas.
I'm checking the rooms.
I find this... by his bed.
It's maps of the island, the building, everything here.
Been doing some research on the place?
- I can goddamn explain.
- You can get on the ground!
This is a military facility!
No one has access to this stuff!
- [Guns cocking]
- Whoa.
You got me all wrong.
Oh, yeah, Detective?
They your maps?
I want to see your hands up. Up!
You believe me.
- No one leaves this room.
- Since when is this room safe?
Since we're all in it.
On your knees now.
Now! Down!
Sara, can you feel your face?
Because I can't feel your face...
Coffee.
Huh?
There's something in the coffee.
- Ohh!
- [Cup shatters]
Ohh.
[Cup shatters]
Ohh!
SARA:
Hey, Nic...
Stay... away from...
[Speaking indistinctly]
[Cup shatters]
[Beeps]
[Meows]
- [Grunts]
- You going somewhere?
Come here.
Sit down.
- Hey, man, I can explain.
- Shut up.
- Listen, I can explain.
- I said shut up!
You don't know what you're doing.
You don't know who I am.
I know you killed J.D.
That's what I know.
Is everybody all right?
Sara.
Sara.
Hey. Hey.
Sara.
Sara? Hey.
[Breathing heavily]
I just had the worst dream ever.
Come on.
Look.
If I'm the killer, why didn't I run?
You were all lying here.
How come so am I?
Maybe it's a trick so you can finish what you started!
Look, I'll tell you why the maps were in the bedroom.
No! You tell us what you put in the coffee!
- That's what you tell us.
- Hey! Who made it?
Did I make the coffee?
Sherlock Holmes over there made it.
The man is calling you a killer.
Personally, I think you might want to defend yourself.
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Oh, fuck!
Ohh!
[Whimpers]
Oh, fuck!
There's...
There's no blood.
Somebody... drained his blood.
LUCAS:
Two watches.
Two watches means two victims?
We got 20 minutes.
All right.
[Grunting]
Right. I want to know what the next trap is.
And I want to know now.
I can't tell you because I don't know!
You've been lying to us since we got here.
That doesn't make me the killer.
The dead people does.
How about the Ioner mentality?
How about the issues with the FBI?
I'm not a cop.
I'm an investigator with the Department of Justice.
I was sent to investigate Harris.
The attorney general was hearing rumors about his methods.
There was talk he was pushing trainees too far.
The FBI investigates the FBI.
Not if you want it done right.
Look, they took him out of the field for a reason.
Justice was talking maybe that wasrt enough.
They sent me to see how he works you.
The maps were prep.
It's a job!
Oh, this is not happening.
You want to hook me up to a polygraph, hook me up!
Yeah, we know how to beat a polygraph, too.
He's lying.
Watch his eyes.
I'm not lying.
I just don't like you.
Okay.
You got 15 minutes.
So tell us where the trap is, or you never leave this room, and I mean never.
Don't take your eyes off of him.
Okay.
[Door closes]
Now, start talking.
It's a nine-number sequence repeating itself.
Nine permutations.
What? A code?
A combination?
It has something to do with time!
He has an obsession with time!
Forget the numbers.
We need to find the trap.
The numbers are the message.
What if it tells us where the trap might be?
Fine. Bobby, help her work the numbers.
I'm searching the building.
I'm searching with you.
[Sighs]
10 minutes.
Phone number, Social Security number, coordinates.
- Talk to me!
- Seven minutes.
Between you and me...
I'm not a violent person.
The thing I've learned in my life is this.
Sometimes if you find yourself feeling deep anger and frustration about where you find yourself, what has happened to you...
The healthy thing to do is to find an outlet and let it all fucking go.
One of us dies, my outlet is you.
[Beeps]
I am not your guy.
You don't want to do this, man.
You'll have to live with what you don't know.
I think we're clear on this level.
The obsession is time.
It has to do with time.
I know it.
What is it?
Sara, it's no use.
- What is that?
- Sara...
It's a number!
It's a fucking number!
They're all just fucking numbers!
Anybody? Anyone?
What are we thinking here?
What about a rate?
When you factor in time, an amount becomes a rate.
Or a speed!
Yes. What kind of speed do you measure in the millions?
Atoms? Electrons?
How the hell should I know?
Light.
299 million... meters per second.
This is the original measurement for light!
And you know that?
It's the basic principle of physics.
Along with "Shit happens."
Turn them off.
The lights.
Turn them off.
- What if that's the trap?
- It's about the light.
[Buzzing]
BOBB Y:
What is that?
What?
The back of your coat.
It's on yours, too.
He's marked us.
Letters.
It's like a powder.
Put on us while we slept.
"A"...
"O"...
"R"...
"T."
Tora? Rota? Roat?
Otra?
First it's numbers, now it's letters.
It's 6:00.
It just turned 6:00.
[Beeps]
[Objects crash]
Hey, who's out there?
Anybody hear me?
You're a dead man.
You guys!
Down here!
[Pipes creaking]
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
[Grunts]
GABE:
Vince!
Vince, listen to me.
We've got to shut off the power.
Fuck you!
It's your trap!
Oh, yeah, I'm so clever,
I'm about to kill myself.
Man, there are circuit breakers in that storeroom.
Can you get there?
Can you reach it?
Can you reach it?
Look, I can, but you got to give me your gun.
I ain't giving you shit!
Are you gonna hang on forever, or throw me your gun?
I'm gonna watch you die.
Watch me die, and then what?
And then what?
[Grunts]
Come on! Please!
Throw it!
[Electricity crackling]
[Grunts]
[Gunshot]
[Gunshots]
[Gunshot]
[Grunts]
I'm losing my grip, Gabe.
Ohh!
[Electricity crackles]
Stairs.
Oh, fuck.
I'm losing my grip!
Come on, Gabe.
[Electricity crackles]
Come on, Gabe!
[Whimpers]
Come on!
[Grunts]
Vince, what's happening in there?!
Stay out of the water!
Stay out of the water!
Where's that cop?!
Vince!
Aah!
Lights out.
[Electricity whirs, stops]
I'm alive!
Vince, what's going on?
Talk to me.
I'm alive!
Oh!
[Panting]
Yes!
You okay?
[Laughing]
I'm alive! I'm alive!
He saved my life, Lucas.
Still think you know me, Agent?
Still think you know who I am?
All right.
How do we turn off the water?
Look, whoever did this really knows his engineering.
Remotes, timers.
They teach this in first-year with siege tactics.
But to set this up fast, you got to know what you're doing.
Pressure plates, radio detonators.
It's all private-sector sold.
The wiring's the tricky part.
People take specialty courses in this sort of thing for years.
Right.
Thank you.
You can all go to hell.
[Screams]
Bobby!
Look at me, look at me, look at me!
[Whimpering]
Two watches, two traps.
Son of a bitch.
So how about me, huh?
How about me?!
Is it my fucking time?!
Right here, right now!
Who fucking wants it?!
It was you who said to turn off the water.
Yeah, whatever makes you feel better.
[Crying]
[Faucet turns off]
Sara?
I don't think any of us should be alone right now.
Okay?
Nic found another watch.
We've got an hour and a half.
VINCE:
So what's with the jackets?
If it's a message, what's the order?
The order we're dying in?
J.D., Rafe, Bobby.
Which letters were theirs?
That wouldn't work.
These were traps.
They could've killed any one of us.
How about the order we signed up with the bureau?
Who here had seniority?
J.D., then Bobby.
- Then me.
- Then me.
LUCAS:
Cro...
Atone?
Crotone?
Crotone, Croato, Croa...
Might as well pick them at random.
VINCE:
Croatoan.
Like the island, the colony.
Do you know where we are?
Near the Outer Banks of North Carolina?
It's one of the first sites settled by the Europeans in the New World.
In the 16th century, there was a ship of settlers who landed right around here, sent to colonize the place for England.
They built their town on Roanoke Island.
Over 100 people.
Two years later, a supply ship sailed in... only to find that the colony had vanished without a trace.
No bodies, no papers, no evidence of anything.
Over 100 people.
Gone.
And the only thing left was a single word found carved in a tree.
Croatoan.
What was Croatoan?
Some said a body of water.
Others said an Indian tribe.
Point is, is 500 years later, we still don't know where those people have gone.
That's the message.
An island full of people vanish forever.
And it happened here.
The killer isn't after the FBI.
He's after infamy.
It troubles me that you know this story.
It'd trouble you more if I didn't.
All right, we know method, we know motive.
All that's missing now is where he made his mistake.
Got something.
We've got blood.
Under Rafe's nails.
He struggled with the killer.
We got to run it past autorad.
What are you staring at?
Time.
GABE:
Somebody know how this works?
NICOLE: I do. We can have a DNA match in under an hour.
We've only got less than an hour.
We'll need blood comparisons from each of us... unless anyone has a problem with that.
God, I want a cigarette.
You and me both.
You're a gambling man, aren't you, Lucas?
Who would you put your money on now?
Not sure my money would go anywhere different.
We just about died down there.
You didn't know you'd be down there.
What do you do?
Not help Vince?
We're gonna trust you then?
I'll trust you when you're dead.
Well, let me enlighten you. You know there's a bomb on a boat.
You don't run toward it first in line.
I don't.
Maybe you do.
Enough!
[Computer beeping rapidly]
Guns on the table.
Everybody.
I'm not giving up my gun.
I think I speak for the group when I say, "That would be bad."
I don't go anywhere without my gun.
I'll give up my wheels first.
I'll give up my chair.
I'm not giving up my gun.
You got it!
Hit the damn thing.
Hit it!
[Gasps]
On the ground.
Nic, wait.
Nic, it's not me.
It's a mistake.
On the ground, damn it!
I will waste you, Sara.
You want to kill me, huh?
You want to kill me?
- Situation secure, Nic.
- That's what Harris says, right?
The situation is secure on the drive home.
Ugh! [Panting]
[Gun cocks]
Lower your weapon, Agent.
Lucas, Lucas.
It's not me, Lucas.
Tell them.
It's not me.
It don't make sense.
Why her?
Because she wasrt gonna make it.
She wasrt gonna make profiler.
Saw the recommends myself.
Neither were you, Vince.
But I never had someone in my family get murdered.
No kid sister of mine ever got drowned and raped, drowned and raped over and over and over.
Who knows what that would do to my head?
You don't know.
VINCE: The FBI didn't save your sister, Sara.
And they didn't catch her killer.
So why should they be able to catch you... when you're so much smarter than everyone?
I swear.
It's not me.
It's not me.
She wouldn't.
Not Sara.
That's why she planned it for the island.
She wanted us dead and underwater, so we'd suffer.
You ever see the pictures?
Fucking brutal.
I swear on my life it's not me.
Well, we can stay in here and debate.
But there's 10 minutes till the trap.
What is the trap?
Where is the trap?
I don't know.
What is the trap?
Where is the trap?
I don't know.
What is the trap?
Where is the trap?
I don't know.
What is the trap, Sara?!
- You tell me.
- No, you tell me!
What if she's telling the truth,
Nic? Think about it.
This is what the killer wants.
Suspecting each other, fighting each other.
This is what makes it fun.
You in the killer's mind again?
We were all knocked out.
He could've taken blood from any of us.
- You could've taken blood...
- I'll take blood from you!
Come off that!
Nicole...
Nicole...
Nobody else is gonna get killed.
You want to protect her?
She's been playing you from the start, Lucas.
You come after me,
I will shoot you on sight.
Nicole... we need to stay together.
If I am by myself,
I know who to trust.
- You go out there running...
- Back!
Okay.
You go out that door, you don't come back in.
Why would I?
[Thunder rumbles]
Do your job.
Put a bullet in her.
Sara, put yourself in our position.
You're a professional.
You have a prime suspect.
There are still lives at risk.
What do you do?
I don't fit the profile.
Wouldrt you know what not to fit?
You say I kill for revenge.
For my personal pain.
That's not this killer.
This killer is impersonal.
Deadlines, rules.
They're ways of proving superiority.
She's right, Gabe.
You know what else is right?
They don't let killers in the FBI.
Playing hurt, playing wounded.
Maybe that's her skill.
We all have skills.
Well, I say where there's a skill, there's a weakness.
We all have skills.
Wait.
Let's think here.
All along we've been assuming the deaths have been random, that anybody could walk into any trap.
But look at the traps.
J.D. Dies because he was out front, leading us.
He was always out front.
And Rafe.
Rafe's a coffee junkie.
And Bobby. Who do we go to to get something to work?
Who's our Mr. Fix-it?
You're saying he knew who died, when?
Knew it, planned it through our characteristics, our skills, our weaknesses.
All this time the killer's been profiling us.
[Clicking]
[Gun cocks]
Vince, who are you?
What makes you different from the rest?
I don't know.
I mean, I know history.
I do mazes.
I'm in a goddamn chair.
Lucas, how does he kill you?
Think.
I'm our best shooter, best driver. Those are my skills.
And your weaknesses?
I say I'm fearless, and I'm not.
That leaves you, Sara.
My sister was murdered.
I haven't been in the water since.
I see her there.
That's his signature.
Oh, my God.
Nicole.
[Sizzling]
[Coughing]
LUCAS:
Nicole!
[Choking]
Jesus!
No!
She found herself some cigarettes.
They were laced with some type of acid.
- It's not her, Vince.
- Why?
She figured out the pattern!
So she saves herself.
Wouldrt you?
I don't trust her.
I don't trust any of you.
Island fever. You got it.
He's got it. She's got it.
And we're gonna ride it out nice and friendly until somebody finds another motherfucking watch.
[Feedback]
HARRIS:
Are you having fun yet?
I'm having fun.
Harris. He's been watching us all along.
Did he know you were from Justice?
What if he figured out he was being watched?
No way!
What if he knew they were gonna take away his program?
HARRIS:
Is this what you wanted?
I'm letting her go.
HARRIS: Too bad you won't get a chance to graduate.
You're all so weak.
Pathetic, powerless.
You said you searched the island!
- Every corner of it!
- Every corner you could see?!
You'll never be in control no matter how hard you try.
All right, he's out there.
Who's with me?
Out there?
What do you think this is?
This is a fucking trap. What do you mean who's with you?
I'll tell you who's with you.
- I'm with you.
- Are you having fun yet?
I'm having fun.
Are you having fun?
You're all going out there?
Look, I'm not going anywhere.
You're right.
You stay put.
What the fuck?
What are you doing?
Still think that you're better than me?
Hide.
Don't tell me where.
Don't tell them where.
Just do it till Monday.
It's for the best.
My fucking gurs empty!
HARRIS:
Is this real enough for you?
You can't escape it.
You can't stop it.
[Thunder rumbles]
You can't turn it off.
[Dings]
[Grunting]
[Hinges creaking]
[Feedback]
HARRIS: We can do this all night long.
[Screeches]
I have all the time in the world.
Still think you are better than me?
Still think you are better than me?
Still think that the pupil bests the teacher?
Is this what you wanted?
Is this what you expected?
Is this real enough for you?
You're all so weak.
Pathetic.
Too bad you won't get a chance to graduate.
You'll never be in control no matter how hard you try.
You always lose.
If you could only see yourselves the way I see you.
Afraid, powerless.
- Let me tell you what I think.
- [Panting]
You look like you're having fun.
I'm having fun.
I don't want the fun to end.
I think they'll find you.
I don't want the fun to end.
Because I trained them.
You think you're smarter than the rest of them?
Let me tell you what I think.
I think you don't stand a chance.
You don't know who you're dealing with, do you?
You don't know... who you're dealing with, do you?
Come on, finish it.
Finish it, you selfish child.
Come on.
- [Knife slashing]
- [Grunting in pain]
He never left.
He stayed to watch.
And the killer knew.
He's wearing watches.
Three watches.
What time are they set for?
They're set for now.
Aaah!
# Farewell to puppet playtime... #
#... To puppet playtime #
# Hope you all enjoyed the show #
Shut it off!
[Tempo increases]
[Music stops]
If it wasrt him...
No, wait!
That's a clever story.
Sent to spy on the program, spy on Harris.
You're the one who's telling stories.
I know it's not me.
And I know it's not me.
So it's not you.
It's not me. It's not her.
Who's that leave, mister?
That leaves the last man standing.
Jesus Christ, Sara!
Watch out!
Watch out for fucking who?!
[Gunshots]
Stop shooting!
Stop shooting!
Sara! Sara, stay right where you are!
[Crying softly]
That's the price you pay for being fearless.
Sara?
Sara?
[Hinges creaking]
[Grunting]
[Footsteps approaching rapidly]
[Footsteps departing]
[Elevator whirring]
[Dings]
Close, God damn it.
Who wants off this island?!
You.
[Dings]
[Elevator whirring]
[Dings]
Never anywhere without a gun.
Back on schedule.
Guess we have answers now, don't we, Sara?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
You gonna panic now, Sara?
You gonna panic when you've been so cool?
[Gun cocks]
Oh.
What are you trying to prove?
What am I trying to prove?
How's a fucked-up girl like you get into the FBI... anyway?
How did I get in?
How did I get in?
Did you not get in, Gabe?
Did you try, and they turned you away?
What did they tell you?
You're not sharp enough, smart enough, sane enough?
Panic.
Watch her panic.
Get your hands up.
I want to see your hands!
Boo.
You call yourself a profiler?
Show me your hands.
I'm the profiler.
I want to see your hands.
You're the victim.
Un!
[Gun clicking]
Aah!
Aah!
Aaah!
Aah!
[Grunts]
Watch your head.
Oh, thank God.
I thought...
Bulletproof vest.
I just need a little "R" and "R," huh?
Surf and sand.
Just stay still.
- Just stay still.
- Uh-huh.
Hey, you, uh...
You think they're ever gonna believe us?
They won't have to.
We can prove it.
After Bobby died...
I changed the clock back
15 minutes.
What are you talking about?
What did Harris always tell us?
Know the mind, then anticipate.
The killer was into deadlines, precision, timing, so I set that clock
15 minutes back.
The clock?
Oh, yeah.
He wanted us to know exactly when he was going to strike, wanted to watch us squirm as precious seconds were ticking away.
It was all part of his fun.
His weakness.
I was betting he'd change it back.
I was right.
But how are you gonna prove it was Gabe who changed it back?
Remember the phosphorescent powder from the jackets?
That's what I put on the clock.
It was my turn to set a trap.
So when he touched it...
Mm-hmm.
His hands are going to glow.
Watch.
[Gasps]
This is awkward.
You know, uh...
All these things, they worked pretty good, you know.
Timers, triggers.
Remotes.
But at the end of the day, building a better mousetrap is just pure mechanics.
It's knowing how to bait a particular mouse.
That's the fun part.
[Gasps]
Ah, ah, ah-ah.
So there I was.
Sitting next to the bodies of my parents.
Just waiting for someone to ask me why I killed them, you know?
And this detective comes up to me, right?
And he says...
"Want some gum?"
Gum.
No one asks.
It never even occurs to them.
And like after every first high... it's harder and harder to get to that place.
And finally you get so good, there's no feeling at all.
It's easy.
Finding a won'thy prey.
A challenge.
That's hard.
You joined the FBI for this?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So while you were studying tired old hacks like Bundy, Gacy, and Dahmer,
I was studying you.
Your habits, your hang-ups, your weaknesses.
It was so simple to set you all on edge.
You know?
I had to push here... pull there... but once I did...
LUCAS: Hey, Vince, check out the other side of town.
I knew each of you would play your part.
The key to effective illusion is misdirection.
You know there's a bomb on the boat.
You don't run toward it first in line.
You know?
All I needed was opportunity.
The coffee break gave me the chance I needed to rig a few little surprises.
The answer was in front of your eyes.
You still couldn't see it.
It was you who said to turn off the water.
The rest was easy.
You're all so fucking predictable.
Nicole with her cigarettes.
Can't she even read the warning label on the box?
Vince...
"I'm never without my gun."
Bobby the Magnificent couldn't resist.
And Harris just had to stay and watch.
Party crasher here was more of a problem than I thought, but why am I gonna work so hard to kill him when I knew you'd do it for me?
You see, the water ain't your only weakness, Sara.
[Shuddering]
Your other weakness... is me.
In truth, I couldn't have done it without you.
As a sign of my appreciation,
I'm gonna grant you your deepest desire.
I'm gonna get you closer to your sister than you ever imagined.
One Mississippi, two Mississippi.
- Are we having fun yet?
- [Gasping]
Whoa.
[Chuckling]
[Gasps]
[Gasps]
Drop it!
Go ahead, Sara.
Arrest me.
We have your blood under Rafe's fingernails.
Your fingerprints on the fire extinguisher.
And your bullet in my neck.
That don't look good.
You're fucked.
[Ticking]
- [Gasps]
- Time's up, asshole.
Good thing you hit like a girl.
I guess we found out his weakness.
Bullets.
[Helicopter blades whirring]
Do you think they'll let me make profiler?
That depends.
One last question.
Whers the situation secure,
Agent?
On the drive home.
Yeah.
On the drive home.

KK
Josh!
I'm Kurt Loderwith MTV news.
The Film is The BlairWitch Project.
One ofthe scariestFilms of alltime...
- I was terrified.
- Oh, it scared me to death... armed with a 16mm camera and a video camcorder head into the Black Hills forests of Maryland to make a movie about a legendary witch
..and they're never heard from again
There's no doubt about the box-office success.
What's not clear is whetherthe legend is true.
Fans are not only flocking to the multiplex,
People have started coming to Burkittsville as if itwere Charles Manson's
The Spahn Ranch, or Ed Gein the serial Killer's house, to visit a haunted place.
'Burkittsville isn't a haunted place.
'it's a place that a fictional movie was set in.'
I wasn't able to see the movei when it came out, because I was... in the hospital.
But as soon as they let me out,
I was atthe movie theatre seventeen times in a rom.
The web-site sold me.
The web-site, you know... has allthese police photos, and official police things, all this information, you really believe it.
Our stick men sold so well on the internet that we started selling them in the yard.
Somebody came by to buy them and they wanted rocks.
So we got rocks out of my rock garden, but I didn't want to get rid of them so he offered me $10 after he started booting it up more.
His wife really wanted them, so we sold them to him.
We sold some on the internet but not many.
It costs too much to ship a rock.
Everybody that comes is like this.
I'm so used to being videoed.
I make sure, if I go to my car, or to get the paper, that I at least have full makeup on, and a great night-gown.
I wish that they'd used a fictitious town, and possibly thought ahead toward what type of repercussions could come from using the word documentary in their advertising, and on their web-site.
Get out of these woods, and go home!
There was no goddamn Blair Witch!
You know, there are a lot of naysayers who come and say nay, but then there is supporters who come up to my town, come up to me.
They run up to me, they stop...
Hey, Selena!
They come over to me, they hug me, and say, "Dude, I know it's real," and they squeeze me, and I say,
"I know it's real, too," and we have a bond.
I say, "I know, and they go,
I know, man," and I go, "I know".
You think you're a wise ass?
I didn't do anything wrong!
Enough!
# And I'm a black rainbow and I'm ape of God
# I got a face that's made for violence upon

Could you turn that down?
I'm just trying to set the mood for the mission.
That's sweet, but I feel like I'm gonna toss.
- She's been feeling queasy.
- No need to explain.
Your comfort is my concern.
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it for Stephen Ryan Parker, who has three names, so he must be from Boston.
Apparently he's here researching a book with his girlfriend.
- The book's title is...
- Blair Witch History Or Hysteria.
Hysteria Or History.
Why is it you guys can't get on the same page about the witch?
We've always been misunderstood.
We embrace nature, not evil.
Thank you, Erica.
Not only a hottie, but a real witch!
Blessed be.
Wiccan... Wicc it good.
Wait, why are we slowing down?
This is where your other tour mate wants to meet. She's a little weird.
She thinks she's psychic or some shit.
- When did you last talk to her?
- E-mail, two days ago.
- Are you sure she'll be here?
- Yeah.
- Kim!
- Kim?
Yo.
Is that her?
Kim?
- Yeah.
- I'm Jeff.
I figured.
- What are you doing there?
- Trying to find the energy.
Inside the grave?
To stand up. I'm exhausted.
I've been on the road two days.
- Want a hand?
- I want amphetamines.
Weed is what I've got, beer I'm gonna get.
Both - now.
That's right, friends.
For two luxurious days and nights, my friends, you will walk the same path the witch herself once walked, sleep on the same soil where her victims' blood was spilled.
Possibly losing your own souls in the process.
I want to thank you all for coming on the inaugural tour of the Blair Witch-Hunt.
- Inaugural?
- You've never done this?
- Never.
- That's not what your web-site said.
"Over 10,000 satisfied customers."
No, that's my web-store.
Stick men, t-shirts, official Blair dirt.
Tours?
We're all virgins on this bus!
# Hang on
# I lost control
# Anyway
# I lost control

Here? You drove by a huge Safeway two miles back.
That was in Burkittsville. I don't shop there. I don't even piss there.
Hell of a town you got here.
What century are they living in?
The gene pool's a little shallow here.
Dive in, you'll crack your skull open.
OK.
- Where are we going first?
- The ruins of Rustin Parr's house.
That guy who heard the voices to kill, right?
Yeah, seven little kids.
I hear voices all the time.
Do we need all this shit for a walk in the woods?
The Blair Witch-Hunt provides all amenities while you risk certain death and dismemberment.
- Give it up.
- What's with all this camera stuff?
To record all occult phenomena that may manifest itself in the course of the tour.
Damn, you're really running
Bullshit Central, aren't you?
If you don't believe in the witch, why the hell did you bother to come?
I thought the movie was cool.
How much further?
- Couple more miles.
- Jesus!
- So how far along are you?
- What do you mean?
The baby. How many weeks?
- Six.
- You don't want to keep it, do you?
No.
- But Stephen wants the baby.
- Yes. How do you know?
I don't know.
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.
Welcome to the Parr ruins, ladies and gentlemen.
It's supposed to be where they found Heather's footage.
These markings are incredible.
Ancient witches' alphabet.
Looks like recent graffiti.
They're so realistic.
It's a little scary.
Actually, some of these symbols are positive.
Only those who don't understand witchcraft would be afraid of them.
And remember, fear... is the forerunner of failure.
OK.
What's the story with this tree?
What tree?
Look behind you.
Where the fuck did this come from?
This was never here before.
Nice try, dude.
What does that mean?
Maybe you should drop the tree bit from your next tour.
No, no, I'm not making this up.
- I need a beer.
- Me, too.
Hey, geniuses, explain to me why a house built in 1826 was built around a tree.
This would have been sticking straight through the living room.
Jeff, nobody's scared.
Evil intent in the ground, may a release soon be found.
In peace, release the energy that be from my magic.
Are you casting some kind of evil spell?
Widdershins - Reversing the evil.
The first law of wicca is 'Harm none'.
Cos whatever you do is going to come back threefold.
The karma's a bitch.
- What are you really doing?
- Communing with Elly Kedward.
The Blair Witch? I thought you embraced nature, not evil.
You don't understand.
Elly... was a good witch.
She was an earth child, like me.
She's gonna be my mentor.
- You've spoken with her?
- Not yet... but I will.
That's why I'm here.
To shed my mortal coil... and commune with Elly.
Have you ever seen her picture?
I don't think there are any.
Stephen and I found one.
Check it out.
We think it was drawn before they banished her from Blair.
Banished, my ass.
They dragged her into the woods in the middle of winter, and tied her to a fucking tree to die.
You make her sound helpless. Can't witches summon powerful energy?
We can... but we still have to eat, shit, and die like the rest of you.
We just look good doing it.
Why do you need all these cameras?
I'm personally hoping for an Elly Kedward sighting.
I've got a big beta for a quality master.
I got a night vision, an infrared, a cute little mini dv, handhelds for everyone... and this baby can even do frame-a-second time lapse.
If anything comes in for a visit, we're gonna catch it.
May I have permission to take this leaf?
Thank you.
Evil intent in the ground, may your release soon be found.
And peace release the energy that be from my magic.
So mote it be.
Evil intent in the ground, may your release soon be found.
And peace release the energy that be from my magic.
So mote it be.
OK, wait... How many Heather Donahues does it take to screw in a light bulb?
- How many?
- Just one!
Just one of them!
Do you know what I could never figure out?
- What's that?
- Blair Witch Project, OK?
Two guys and a girl, sleeping in the same tent night after night, and no sex?
- It makes no sense.
- You're so right.
I mean, they were scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever right at their fingertips... and nothing.
I'm a little stressed.
Try some more weed.
OK.
The Bermuda Triangle.
It's a place in the world that's been created by hysteria, by people's own psychology, by their own ideas of the place.
We were already a persecuted minority.
This whole Blair Witch thing set us back 300 years.
We're back in the burning times.
It fucked up our image.
Erica, people fear what they don't understand. You must realise that.
No shit. People think that I drink blood, that I sacrifice children - that I worship the devil just because I'm a wiccan.
Where I come from, people think because I dress in black,
I'm some kind of sick killer or something.
I don't even believe in the devil.
OK?
That's a Christian concept.
I believe in nature.
I hate nature.
Myth, for me... right?
..is just myth.
It's not history, it's not metaphor and it's definitely not the truth...
Stephen, stories like this happen because they exist in a place of truth because there's historical evidence, there's fact.
That's what you don't understand.
I want to make a film.
Wicca... A Way Of Life.
- Nice.
- Yeah.
Wait, wait... Check this out.
Look at everyone.
Everyone is obsessed with the Blair Witch for their own reasons, including us.
Goth... A Way Of Life.
A documentary on you.
All real, all video.
Video never lies, Kim.
Film does, though.
Everyone wants to see something.
I'm telling you, hysteria and delusions, they breed in situations like this.
Why are you applying rational thought to mythology?
Because if people believe something enough, isn't it real?
Perception is reality.
You're not listening to me.
Babe, I know what you're saying,
I just think it's bullshit.
I think you're being a monomaniacal reductionist.
What the hell was that?
I heard that, too.
Burkittsville's funniest home videos!
You scared the shit out of me, man!
It answered every single one of your wet dreams.
What are you guys doing here?
We've got a tour group, the Blair Witch Walk.
- What's your excuse?
- Tour group, the Blair Witch-Hunt.
You're supposed to look out for stuff like this. This is so not happening!
We have jurisdiction.
We have permits.
Yeah? From Cravens? Let me see 'em.
- They're in the car.
- Bullshit!
Let's put it this way, one of us is staying - it's us or you, and it looks like us, bitch!
It's gonna come back at you threefold.
- What?
- In the wiccan...
Shut up!
Your balls will fall off in three days.
Yo, guys, guys,
I think I can settle this.
Just give us till dawn, then we're out of here.
We're cold, we're tired... and we're a little shook up.
We saw something up at Coffin Rock today.
Yeah... Yeah, up at Coffin Rock.
It scared the shit out of us.
Guys, stop talking about it, because I'm gonna freak.
I just want to go home.
Can we see this thing...
- Coffin Rock?
- Blair Witch? Go to Coffin Rock.
It's your money, Greta.
Next time, take the Blair Witch Walk.
Next time, take the Blair Witch-Hunt.
Here's my card. Call. I'm on the web.
They were never seen again.
Their footage was found a year later... underexposed, and useless.
I don't trust that these assholes aren't coming back.
They're going to be pissed that we took the foundation.
I don't think it's anything to worry about.
Besides... we're gonna be up all night, baby!
Giddy-up!
We'll just keep our eyes open.
They're not coming back.
Why do you think that?
I just do.
I'll be back in a minute.
Up all night!
How do your parents feel... about having a witch for a daughter?
My father is an Episcopal minister, in a one-church-town back in Munnsville, Illinois.
Yeah.
That's a bummer.
How many beers is that for you?
I'm serious!
You're drinking like a fish.
I just think you should take care of yourself.
Jesus! We've already gone through this once today already.

What the fuck...?
This is my work.
This is all my research.
Our work.
Every word.
Where the fuck are my cameras?
This is all of our goddamn work!
How the hell are we gonna make the deadline?
- We backed it up on computer.
- No, Tristen, that was just notes.
Half this shit is original documents.
Where the hell was everybody?
We were all supposed to be awake.
Guys, where's Erica?
I'm right here.
We must have fallen asleep.
Asleep? It's like we must have blacked out!
The last thing I remember was that other group.
Yeah... those fucking dickweeds!
Who else could it have been, huh?
They came back from Coffin Rock, and ripped us off!
Ripped? These things look like they were bit off.
I-I-I... What am I gonna do?
At least the tapes are still here.
- What?
- The tapes. They're here.
Where? Do you see them?
In my mind, I see them.
Oh, Jesus.
You fuck.
They're there!
Where they found the Blair Witch tapes?
You've got to be kidding me.
Come on! Why would they be in there?
Newsflash, everybody...
That was just a movie.
I don't know why, Stephen.
They're under the rocks.
There's nothing in there.
Reach inside.
- Well...?
- I don't feel so hot.
Jeff, is there anything in there?
Jesus Christ.
How did those get in there?
Are they yours?
I think we should leave.
How did you know?
- I don't know.
- Are they yours?
Did you put them there? Did you?!
- Jeff, are they your tapes?
- Yeah, they're my tapes!
Then, why are they still here?
Why is the equipment trashed, the cameras are gone, but not the tapes?
She's right. Wouldn't those guys want to fuck up your tour footage?
Stephen, I want to leave.
How did this happen?
Oh, fuck!
Jesus Christ, the baby.
We found blood in the van.
Tristen had a miscarriage.
You know that, Cravens.
'She bled in the van on the way to the hospital.'
This girl's hypothermic.
Get me heating blankets and a lamp.
It's like she's been sitting in ice water.
We were just camping.
'The doctor thinks it's hypothermia.'
Course, the way I see it you brought her out here, you took her into those woods.
She's your responsibility.
Are you charging me with something?
You have been... a pain in this town's ass since you were 10.
You need to learn to stay out of trouble, boy.
It makes you defensive...
Anxious.
Last thing you need is to end up back in the loony bin.
How is she?
She lost the baby.
The doctor will keep you here till your temperature stabilises.
You lost a lot of blood.
More than usual.
It's for the best.
Your body is telling you something was wrong.
Something was wrong.
How are you feeling?
I'm not staying here.
Five hours of our lives are unaccounted for.
I want to see those tapes.
I want to know what happened.
I've got some editing equipment at my house.
We should be able to come up with some answers.
We're still in the Black Hills, aren't we?
Yeah, right up there.
Let's get Tristen inside.
We can take care of the bags later.
I thought we were going to your house.
RFD 431... Jericho Mills, home.
What did it used to be?
It was a factory after the war.
They were going to destroy it, so I got them to sell it to me for a buck.
Cool.
Sorry about the bridge.
It's the only way in or out.
It's pretty safe... don't lean on the railings.
I am not a gambling man.
But...
I would bet my entire... retirement pension... that the blood in the van... is gonna match those tourists.
You've been looking to pin something on me since I was a kid.
Come on, get in, quick. Before they eat you. Quick, quick. Let's go.
Burkitt County's cheapest alarm.
And what's that do? Squirt water?
No, that actually works. Wave.
It's recording you right now.
I got 'em hooked up through the building.
- I'm a little paranoid.
- Hah! a little?
I heard that.
But with good reason.
I got a lot of valuable stuff here.
Oh, my God!
Yeah! You wouldn't want somebody to come in here, and steal stuff that you've already stolen.
Where it comes from is not my business, nor should it be yours.
I just like to pass the savings on to others.
- Really? And how do you do that?
- E-bay.
Buying, selling, trading, swapping.
I'm a major player.
I thought all your cameras got trashed.
Well, you can never have too many.
Jeff, I think we've had enough videotaping for one weekend.
Yeah, dude. Tour's over.
Maybe the tour has just begun, cos you're walking into the official Blair store.
Come in, everybody.
This is where it begins.
This is the epicentre of the Blair Witch-Hunt web-site.
I got my sticks... You can touch these, they're for the stick men.
Don't touch those, those are drying.
Did you collect these in the Black hills?
Yeah, every twig.
Here is a rock...
Oh, my God, who made that?!
Oh, I did, earlier.
We've got Parr ruins foundation dirt, that's a big item. I sell that.
T-shirts and sweat shirts, and hats.
Here you go, Tristen.
That's for you, gratis.
I feel better.
You're as big an asshole as the rest of them.
What are you talking about, Erica?
This stuff is hot.
This is what the wiccan religion needs, more capitalism based on fear and lies.
Do you really think it's fair to exploit our culture, just to sell stick-figure key chains?
- I think this place is cool, Jeff.
- Thanks.
Jeff, we're tired.
I should get her to bed.
Oh, yeah. Sorry.
Let's see...
The stairs by the kitchen lead to my editing loft.
The bedroom on the right is mine.
It's got the biggest bed and it's own john. You guys take it.
- Thanks, brother.
- Sure.
Sleep well.
The rest of the bedrooms are down the hallway.
Hey...
I really appreciate the hospitality, but take me off your mailing list.
OK.
They should have never let you out.
You're a long way from sane.
I saw something at the hospital.
What?
It was just like the picture in the Blair Witch black bible.
The same clothes, that same face, like... she'd been drowned.
Who?
The little girl.
Eileen Treacle.
Sweetie...
Why don't we talk about this after you get some sleep?
I want to talk about it now.
You need to sleep. You're in shock.
This is so... intense.
Chill out, Erica.
We've watched half of one tape.
We've got four angles, we've got our handhelds, we've got hours of tapes we haven't seen.
Last night, when we were camping,
I dreamt I hurt the baby.
That's just because we've been fighting about it so much.
- You've been through a lot.
- I know how much you wanted a baby.
I'm sorry I didn't want it.
I'm sorry that I lost it.
Guys, something just occurred to me.
- Where's that tree?
- What?
That big tree that was right there.
Now there's just this tiny twig.
See, guys, I told you there was something up with that tree.
Hand me another of those dv cassettes maybe there's another angle.
Whoa, whoa... what is up with that?
I don't know. I think it's chafing from the backpack.
Does it hurt?
Not really. It just kind of itches.
It's nothing. Here.
- What was that?
- What?
Rewind it.
What did you see?
I'm not sure. A flash, or something.
Coffin Rock.
- What?
- Coffin Rock.
How the hell do you see Coffin Rock?
Can you see in other dimensions?
I don't know.
That's what it reminds me of.
Those guys that were murdered there in 1886 - after they were gutted, their heads were arranged in the shape of a pentagram... like that.
A great American pastime - blame it on a witch.
Let me see if I can get that image back.
Stephen!
Is she gonna be OK?
I don't know.
Stephen!
Tristen?
Tristen?
Shut up.
'You brought it back with you.'
What was all that?
That was Jeff's stupid dog alarm.
The crying.
You heard that, too?
In my dreams.
I thought I was having this horrible nightmare.
About what?
Children... looking up my skirt as I twirled round and round.
So I hurt them.
Stephen, what the hell is wrong with me?
Nothing. Nothing. You're just...
Look, there are... rational explanations behind this.
Behind everything that's going on.
I think we need to go home.
- I'll get someone to drive us...
- Not yet!
Why?
Just not yet.
I need to understand what happened.
You can understand it on the plane ride home.
Here.
Take these.
Take them.
They'll help you sleep.
Come on, take them!
You're not making a believer out of me, son.
It was an accident.
I swear to Christ, it was an accident.
- Jesus.
- What the hell was that?
I'm not sure.
See that? Whoa, wait. Look.
Time code goes from 1:32 a.m.... to 3:57 a.m.... back to 1:32 a.m.
In the middle of the footage?
How does that happen?
I don't know. But those were the hours that we fell asleep.
Can you make it bigger, or slow it down?
Let me try slowing it down.
Ladies and gentlemen, that is a naked woman.
What is a naked woman doing swinging around a tree?
Are we sure these are our tapes?
I'm not sure of anything in the last 24 hours.
I'll re-digitise this at a higher resolution so I can blow it up.
This will take a few minutes.
I need alcohol.
Caffeine.
Caffeine!
Sure. I live to serve.
Ugh... great.
Stale coffee, no beer, some old take-out chicken... but plenty of batteries.
Hey...
- What's going on?
- We're leaving in the morning.
Really?
It's... It's Tristen.
She's in bad shape.
This whole thing has really fucked her up.
How come you're the one who looks like he's having a breakdown?
Look! I'm a little tense, all right?
Sorry.
No, I am... sorry.
I just feel like my whole life's been turned upside down the past two days.
I know.
It's been really crazy for you, but it's gonna be OK.
I promise.
That feels good.
You ARE tense.
- Like that?
- Yeah.
Lower?
Yeah, lower.
- How does that feel?
- Good.
Lower?
How does that feel?
Do they hurt?
No. They're just a little warm.
Don't worry.
I have them, too.
Guys... want to come up here?
You're out of beer, if that's what you want to know.
Jeff found a better angle on this naked chick.
- What naked chick?
- Cool. How?
I blew up the image.
It's a bit weird to watch...
Like watching a hold-up on a bank security camera.
You get the gist.
Where is this?
The foundation.
- This was last night?
- Yeah. During the big blackout.
Can you let us see her face?
Sure can.
If this is a joke... it ain't funny.
No joke. It's serious, Erica.
While I was gone, you messed with things.
No.
- It doesn't make any sense.
- I know.
- We were hoping you could explain.
- I don't have a clue.
- You have no memory of doing this?
- No.
If it's some wicca thing, you can tell us.
Try and help us understand.
We're just trying to put together what happened last night.
- Find out who trashed my equipment.
- That wasn't me. I didn't do that.
Erica, that's you there on the screen.
Leave me the hell alone, all of you!
Believe her?
I don't know.
Jeff, give me your keys to the van.
- Where you going?
- I have to get out. I need a beer.
Hey, see if we need more coffee.
..earth and fire, water and smoke...
I am going to the store.
You want to come...?
Erica?
Erica!
We brought something back with us.
What are you talking about?
I can sense it... like someone's choking me... and squeezing the air out of me.
Look, we're just tired, OK?
We're all really tired. That is it.
I want to show you something.
I have got the same thing.
It's nothing, it's like poison oak.
But, Kim...
They're growing.
Ancient pagan alphabet.
They say it means you've been touched by a witch.
That you're next chosen to die.
There's something here!
There's something here!
Sweet.
Yo, Morticia.
Hey, Elvira, I got something you can suck the blood out of.
Oh, yeah? Whip it out.
Excuse me, sorry.
I'm finished now.
What the...?!
What is your problem?
- You're with the witch people.
- Lady...
I'm just here to buy groceries.
Witch!
Freak.
Am I gonna have a problem with you, too?
No problem.
Good. Let's go.
OK, look...
Either you ring this stuff up... or I call your manager.
I am the manager.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Well, then, Peggy... could you tell the bitch at the front register to do her goddamn job?!
Get the hell out of here!
Not until I've completed my purchase.
We don't want people like you around here.
You know what? I am gonna make this so easy on you, Peggy.
I told you to get the hell out of here.
You touch me again... and I will rip out your goddamn throat!
Keep your motherfucking change!
Persephone, do I invoke... by earth and fire, and water and smoke
Persephone, do I invoke... by earth and fire, and water and smoke
Persephone, do I invoke... by earth and fire, and water and smoke
Persephone, I invoke... by earth and fire, and water and smoke
Persephone, I invoke... by earth and fire, and water and smoke,
Persephone, I invoke... by earth and fire, and water and smoke
Persephone, I invoke... by earth and fire, and water and smoke
Persephone, I invoke... by earth and fire, and water and smoke,
Persephone, I invoke...
- Stone the witch!
- Stone the bitch!
Fucking rednecks!
Ow!
Kim?
Make me a pot of coffee on your way up.
You're welcome.
Look, I fucked up your front fender.
I had to swerve to avoid hitting these little kids.
They were dressed funny, like from another time. Seven of them.
Jeff!
I know this is crazy, but I know those are the kids
Rustin Parr killed!
Coffee.
Next to your arm.
- Morning.
- Hey. Did you sleep OK?
- Yeah, I slept OK. You?
- Yeah.
- You ready to go?
- Yeah. Are you guys ready?
Yeah.
I... appreciate your driving us.
Yeah. I'll get the keys from Jeff.
Come on, Tristen, wake up.
- Come on, let's go.
- Not yet...
Tristen, we're going home.
Erica?
Erica!
Erica?
- Erica!
- Not up here.
Not up there? You sure?
She was just here.
Didn't you hear me?
I just said she's not up here.
Why don't you go check out the v...
What the hell happened to the van?
Jesus Christ.
We are never gonna get out of here...
Kim, what the hell did you do?
You said you just busted up the front end!
How the hell did you drive it back?
I swear it was just the front fender.
What the fuck is going on?!
They dip their hands in your blood then press them on your body.
- What are you talking about?
- The children.
Something I dreamt.
Jeff dreamt it, too. Look.
Look!
Oh, Jesus! What the hell is this?
Something from the woods.
We've all got them. Me, her, Erica...
Where is Erica?
Erica?
Erica?
Erica!
What the...?
Erica!
Erica!
ERICA!
We would've heard the dog alarm when she went outside.
It's like she fucking vanished.
- Evaporated is more like it.
- Yeah, right, Kim.
You were the one who found her clothes and those candles.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
A prank. Two little bitches trying to freak us out.
- You paranoid fuck!
- Come on!
We'd never do something like that!
Where is she, Kim? Where is she?
Why are her clothes and shit still here?
How would I know?
Can't you see her, Kimmy, in your mind's eye?
Very funny, asshole!
I think something really bad has happened to her.
Maybe she called somebody.
I'd like to speak to Minister Geerson, please.
'He's in a meeting.
Could he return your call?'
- No. It's urgent.
- 'Could I tell him what it's about?'
Yeah. His daughter, Erica.
We wanna know if he's heard from her.
The minister and Mrs Geerson have no daughter.
No, I know, like, they disowned her or something because she's a witch...
'They've never had any children.'
So she made up a story.
She gave us a fake name.
It doesn't have to mean anything.
She lied to us.
Why are we seeing all this shit?
Why is all this happening?
I don't know. Collective delusion.
Group hysteria.
It's what my book is about. You get a bunch of people scared enough...
Dude, spare us the bullshit. Please.
It's real. Dude
It happens.
They teach it at junior colleges
I bet that even you could get into.
How did you get into yours?
You have to brush your teeth?
Jeff, the screen.
Roll it back, rewind it.
No, more.
Oh, shit.
I knew they'd come back and mess with my stuff.
Fuck off. No one's home.
- It's Cravens.
- 'Sheriff?'
Funny. I just found out who trashed my cameras. I was about to call you.
Turn on your TV.
'I don't give a shit.
I want you to see something.'
Me, too. News at 11:00.
Shit. Will you just turn that on?
Humour him.
- You watching?
- Like a hawk.
Listen, I'm trying to tell you what I found out on Friday night.
'This is a special report.
'A brutal murder in the Black Hills discovered today
'the bodies of five hikers found dead
'atop the landmark known as Coffin Rock.'
Disembowelled, Jeffrey.
'A re-creation of the infamous Coffin Rock massacre
'popularised by the movie
The Blair...'
Bodies were laid out in the shape of a pentagram.
Sound familiar?
'We've received word that the victims include two Chinese tourists
'and one German, as well as two unidentified white males.
'Recently, the Black Hills has been overrun with fans
'wanting to get a glimpse of where the movie was filmed.'
- 'You looking at me?'
- What?
'Over here.'
There.
- Yeah?
- 'I didn't find your cameras.
'Don't guess that's a surprise, is it?'
- What do you want from me?
- I got five corpses here!
I had nothing to do with that.
You might not have been in charge but you were involved, so you and your little friends had best just sit tight.
'And that means... you don't leave this county till I say it's OK.'
I don't know you, Stephen.
I don't know a thing about you.
I don't know how much to believe about any of you people...
But from now on... know this: you are not leaving me here alone to take the fall for this shit.
Nobody is going out of my sight.
We brought something back with us.
For Christ's sake, Kim...
I'll tell you what's going on here.
It's Erica... or whoever the fuck she is.
Erica has got nothing to do with this.
She's a witch, man!
She's one big pissed-off witch!
She's casting fucking spells, making herself appear, making herself fucking disappear.
It's been her since day one!
Smoke it up, cos you're not totally psycho yet!
- Where are you going?
- The fuck away from you!
You're a dick.
Kim!
Jeff, you've got to have friends, somebody with a car...
What did I tell you?!
You're not going anywhere!
Wipe that shit off your face.
You think that your makeup and black clothes give you power, but you're just a scared, cowardly little girl underneath all that.
You don't understand.
Something happened to us in the woods.
Something evil.
Why are you so mad at me?
Calm down. I'm not that pissed.
Just stop badmouthing Erica.
- She's outside.
- Where?
Right there.
There's nothing out there.
Tristen, let's get you back to bed.
- You just got to look, Stephen.
- Let's go to the bedroom.
Look again.
She's out there!
Erica.
What happened to you?
Don't be afraid.
You know who it is.
- What?
- And you know what you have to do.
Erica!
You know who it is.
Erica?
Tristen, help me. Help me!
Tristen!
Aw, Tristen...
Stephen! I got you, grab my hand.
Come on, hold on.
They did it, the little Buster Boys.
They did it! They hanged her!
The little Buster Boys!
Tristen! Shh! Shh!
It's only a dream. It's only a dream!
They're Elly Kedward's dreams!
I don't know why I'm having them.
Why do you think they're Elly Kedward's?
Cos I was seeing them through her eyes - tied to the tree where they banished her to.
And the bad little boys from Blair village sneaking out to the woods to see if she was still alive... and... and they let their big dogs bite her and they poked her with sticks and then when the blood came out of her, they put their palms in it and pressed it on her flesh!
And then, when they found she was still alive, they untied her... and they put the ropes around her neck and they hanged her from the big tree!
Stephen, I think I'm going fucking crazy!
No! No, you are not going crazy.
Do you hear me?
You are not going crazy.
It's OK.
It's OK.
It's all right.
Jeff? Listen, I'm really worried about Tristen.
Do you know the name of the doctor she was with?
No, no, I don't.
Then I think you need to call the hospital.
OK. I think there's a phone book in the desk drawer.
What is this?
What the fuck is this?
- What?
- These!
I don't know. Where did you get 'em?
In your desk!
What, are you spying on us?
What the hell are you talking about?
No, I'm not!
I've no idea where this came from!
Where'd you get this? Answer me!
She found 'em.
Maybe she put 'em in there!
- I wanna know where you got these!
- I've no idea!
We've been looking into your background, Stephen.
You've been such a good little boy all your life.
How did you get mixed up in all this?
What?
'It's Cravens, you little shit!'
Sheriff, I'm a little preoccupied right now.
'I need to talk to you.
Get your butt down here.'
My van is trashed. And you know mommy doesn't let me out after dark.
'I'm right at your front door, you little twerp! Get down here!'
How can he be out there?
The bridge is gone.
This is too weird.
Here!
Jeffrey!
It's Cravens!
We got a few things to talk about, boy!
You were a punk as a kid, and you're still a punk!
Open up, Jeff!
Open the goddamn door!
If you know what's good for you, you'll open the damn door!
You open up this goddamn door right now!
I told you to stay out of those woods.
They're not gonna just send you back to the loony bin this time.
Open the goddamn door!
Jeff!
What the fuck, dude?
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down!
Erica.
What are you doing?
Erica.
That's gross!
She... she's...! Oh, God!
You were the last one to see her still alive.
The last time I saw her, she was heading up here to see you.
I didn't kill her, Stephen.
- Don't even think it.
- Kim was up here with me!
Well, let me clue you in to something, all right?
She didn't commit fucking suicide!
- One of you...
- Oh, wait!
What about you?
What gets you off the goddamn hook?
- My word!
- Which is worth exactly shit to me!
Where was your little girlfriend this whole time?
Oh, for Christ's sake!
She can barely get out of bed...
It's backwards.
Go back to bed, Tristen.
The little girl backwards.
Erica dancing... backwards.
Everything backwards.
What are you talking about?
Widdershins.
Undo the evil.
What the fuck is a widdershin?
All right, she's lost her fucking mind.
That's it.
Backwards.
- Backwards!
- What?
We need to run the tapes backwards.
- Why?
- I don't know.
I think it'll help us find out what happened to Erica.
This makes no sense!
I know it doesn't. Just please do it!
See? Nothing.
Try the-the-the keystrokes backwards.
You know, the fucking commands.
You see? You guys happy?
There's nothing!
There's your missing hours.
This must be when we blacked out.
Tristen...
What is this?
What did you make us do?
You're leading us, aren't you?
Weren't you watching the fucking screen?
No.
- Get back here!
- Grab her!
Get your hands off me.
What did you do, Tristen?
Stephen, please tell them to stop.
Why aren't you marked like this?
Like the rest of us, like Erica?
What did you do to Erica?
Stephen, why are you letting them do this?
You killed Erica!
- You two are crazy!
- Shh, shh, shh! Listen.
Just admit it to the camera.
We're not gonna take the fall for Erica.
OK? Just admit it. Don't worry, sweetie. We're not gonna hurt you.
Not like you hurt the baby.
What? I didn't have anything to do with the baby.
The witch kills children!
I... haven't killed anybody!
Bullshit!
- Oh, God, Stephen.
- Tristen, just say the words!
Just say the words...
You're all gonna fucking die.
- You wanna kill me?
- No.
No, I just want to understand.
But you can't understand because you're so afraid!
Just like the pathetic children of Blair village, so frightened!
- Aren't you, little girl?
- Who are you?
She's the witch, man!
Is that what you think... crazy boy?
Tristen! Tristen, talk to me!
- Stephen...
- What is it, baby, what is it?
- Tristen's gone.
- Get away from him!
That's not... how you do it.
This is what you want.
Tristen, whatever you're doing... don't!
I'm not doing anything, honey.
It's all up to you!
Witch bitch.
Why did you kill Erica?
I can smell the fear on you.
Stay away from me.
You wanna kill me?
You can't, can you, Kimmy?
I will rip your fucking head off!
- Then fucking do it!
- Stop it!
Stop it.
Aw, isn't that what your book's about, Stephen?
People just want to see something?
You have no balls.
You can't do it, you weak, little pathetic...
Oh, you were the last fucking one with the balls, you little bitch.
No!
'I'm standing in front of an abandoned broom factory
'in Jericho Mills, a few miles from the town of Burkittsville,
'where, just hours ago, police arrested three obsessed movie fans
'who allegedly committed a series of ritualistic murders
'after watching last summer's blockbuster,
'the Blair Witch Project.'
'This vehicle, which you see behind me
'is owned by one of the suspects,
'and there is blood evidence linking the suspects to these murders.
'Sadly, as has happened so many times before in this country,
'violent art has inspired real-life violence.
'In this case, it's the Blair Witch Project.'
I ain't no documentary film-maker, but I had your videotapes slapped together over at Montgomery College.
Sorta tells the whole story.
Great.
You could see how fucking insane
Tristen was.
She practically begged Stephen to push her.
Gutting those tourists...
How'd you have the stomach for that?
Yeah...
I don't remember doing that.
Let's talk about... Peggy.
What?
'Apparently one woman was hanged, and the other victim,
'the cause of death has yet to be determined.
'Ironically, both women were murdered by their friends
'after allegedly participating in a vicious killing spree
'in the Black Hills.'
'The police have not offered a motive,
'but apparently the two slain female killers were involved in witchcraft.'
And, um... what about the redhead?
She was a real pretty girl.
She wouldn't put out or something?
No, we just found her in the closet.
It was Tristen.
The witch got into her... fucked with her mind or something.
And your girlfriend? Killing her because she had a miscarriage.
Whoo-whee! Now, that's harsh.
She wrapped the rope around her neck.
She was taunting me... begging me to push her.
You're not making a believer out of me.
It was an accident!
I swear to Christ it was an accident!
'Local officials are urging calm
'and trying to keep curiosity seekers at bay.
'And as has happened in the past,
'rumours about a...
'supernatural presence causing these murders
'are spreading like wildfire over the internet.'
W-wait... wait.
Wait a... wait a second.
Jeff...
Jeff...
He...
He videotaped the whole thing.
Watch the tapes. You'll see.
Look at the goddamn tapes!
Yes, sir.
Too much trouble to pay for your beer?
I didn't do that.
Oh, yeah?
Then, um... who's this?
I didn't do that.
I didn't do that.
That's not how it happened.
I didn't do that.
That's not how it happened.
Stop it.
'Just... just do it!
Just admit it to the camera.
'We're not gonna take the fall for Erica.
'Don't worry, we're not gonna hurt you.'
'Not like you hurt the baby.'
'What? I didn't have anything to do with the baby.'
'The witch kills children!'
'I... haven't killed anybody!'
- 'Bullshit!'
- 'No!'
'Tell us the truth.
Tell us the truth.
- 'Confess.'
- 'God!
'Stephen, this is me.
What are you talking about?'
'Stop it!'
- 'Tristen!'
- 'No! No!
'Stop! Oh...'
'She's the witch, man!'
'Jeff, what are you saying?
I'm not the witch.'
- 'Yeah, you are.'
- 'What are you saying?'
You know what I'm saying, god damn it!
'Stephen, please.'
'Did you kill Erica?
Confess, confess.'
- 'Stop it.'
- 'Say the words.'
'Oh, God, Stephen, don't! Please!'
'No!'
'Fucking witch!'
This is wrong.
This is wrong.
Somebody fucked with this tape!
Somebody fucked with that tape!
That tape is wrong!
That's fucking bullshit!
That's fucking shit!
# Come here
# Pretty please
# Can you tell me where I am?
# You...
# Won't you say something?
# I need to get my bearings
# I'm lost...
# And the shadows keep on changing
# And I'm haunted
# By the lives that I have loved
# And actions I have hated
# I'm haunted
# By the lives that wove the web
# Inside my haunted head
# Don't cry
# There's always a way
# Here in November
# In this house of leaves we'll pray
# Please
# I know it's hard to believe
# To see a perfect forest
# Through so many splintered trees
# You and me
# And these shadows keep on changing
# And I'm haunted
# By the lives that I have loved
# And actions I have hated
# I'm...
# Haunted
# By the promises I made
# And others I have broken... #
# I'll take you down
# To a hole where
# You will always be alone
# I'll turn you out
# On a world that doesn't care if you belong
# I'll push you off
# Of that throne that you erected for yourself
# You will be tossed
# On a pile of all the filth that you created

If you don't believe in the Blair
Witch, why did you come?
I thought the movie was cool.
'The Blair Witch legend refuses to die,
'as strange and compelling new evidence
'continues to mount,
'at least three sequences intended for the motion picture,
'were left on the cutting room floor.'
How did this happen?
'You are now about to unlock the secret of Esrever,
'where you will discover mysterious and haunting ghost-like images.
'Here is an example:
'Watch this scene carefully.
'It is an outtake being shown for the very first time.
'It all looks normal enough
'until you look again from the beginning of the scene.
'The cast member walks around the bed,
'but look at the lockers against the wall -
'here the locks are arranged in the shape of a pentagram -
'but here, they are not.
'A second scene omitted from the film is even more disturbing.
'Look carefully at the glass window.
'Is it the face of a victim?
'Here is a third outtake. Look at the portrait in the background.
'It is horribly sinister one second, and harmless, the next.'
We brought something back with us.
'Additional ghost images are hidden in the feature itself.
'At the conclusion of the segment, without pressing "stop,"
'press "reverse" on your remote control
'and watch the piece in its entirety, backwards.
'At the lower right hand corner of your screen, you will see letters.
'As you play the tape backwards, these letters will form words
'and these words will lead you back to the scenes
'that contain hidden words or images.'
Roll it back... rewind it.
'Are they a message from the Blair Witch?
'Is it your imagination?
'And, are there more?
'What you find will surprise you.'
There's just nothing down there.
I haven't seen a building in, like, 20 minutes.
- Look at that.
- We're not on vacation, Hap.
Cheer up, will you?
Tell that to her, partner.
Better hang on, guys.
It's gonna get rough.
- Ooh.
- There goes my lunch.
Detective Eckhart,
I'm Detective Ellie Burr.
- Hi.
Nice to meet you.
How are you doing?
Good.
"Halibut fishing capital of the world. " Okay.
Detective Dormer, it's an honor to meet you.
Welcome to Nightmute.
I got the car right here.
It's so incredible to be working with you.
I've followed all of your cases:
Theodore Dineli, Frank Prud'homme...
...the Ocean Park shootings and especially the Leland Street murders.
Is that where Ronald Langley cut you, at 325 Leland Street?
You did your homework.
The Leland Street murders was my case study at the academy.
- I'll take you to the Lodge and...
- No, take us to the station.
Right. We need to get started.
Most homicides are solved in the first 72 hours.
Well, it's 48 hours.
We're a day behind.
But who's counting?
Yeah, come in.
They got you behind a desk, huh?
Charlie Bubbles. How you doing?
- I haven't seen you since when?
- Hey, Charlie.
- Seven years?
- Eight.
Seven years! I am old.
Ellie, get everyone in the bullpen.
- Nice kid.
- Loves the job. Heh.
When I called Buck for advice on this,
I never expected he'd send you up here.
- Something about Internal Affairs?
- They're moving in.
It's nothing. It's the usual crap.
Buck figured you could use some help...
They got Finn and Kentor on Narcotics.
The fuckers are looking for headlines...
- It's gonna blow over.
- Got a message from Warfield.
I.A.'s pit bull.
He wants to be posted on your movements.
You'll find us more straightforward.
Good guys, bad guys, but a lot less public relations. It's simple.
Except for this.
Ahem. Okay, listen up.
Detectives Dormer and Eckhart...
...on loan from Buck Lundgard,
L.A. Homicide.
- They'll help with the Connell case.
- Help?
Anything they want to see, show them.
Anyplace they want to go, take them.
This is Fred Duggar.
- He's heading the investigation.
Hello, Fred.
A pleasure.
- Want to get on it?
- Seen what we got?
- Let's start with the body.
- You got the report?
- I want to see the body for myself.
Okay.
Herniation of the brain stem due to intracerebral hemorrhage.
- Beaten to death.
- These contusions?
Superficial. Most of the trauma was to her face and neck.
Any signs of rape?
No.
- This one covers an older bruise.
- There's an older one here.
- They're both in the report.
- He washed her hair.
Scrubbed her nails.
It's all in the report.
- Doesn't say he clipped them.
- She could have clipped them.
Nope. No polish on the ends of the nails. See?
She painted them herself.
Someone else cut them. Toes too.
Naked when found?
Yeah. Last seen wearing a red dress.
No fibers, flakes, hairs?
We know about forensics work here.
The body gave us nothing.
She gave us plenty.
All this trouble, all this care. Why?
He knew her.
- He knows we can connect him to her.
This isn't a random psycho?
Crime of passion?
Maybe. But whatever happened, his reaction wasn't passionate.
He didn't panic.
Didn't chop her up or burn her.
He just thought about what we would be looking for...
...and then calmly removed all those traces.
No haste. No rush.
Why clip the nails after scrubbing them?
Manipulating the body.
Prolonging the moment.
No mutilation.
Not this time.
- You think there's been others?
- No.
But there's gonna be. This guy...
...he crossed the line and he didn't even blink.
You don't come back from that.
Okay. Let's go find out who Kay was.
Fred said not to touch anything, so I haven't tidied up.
She hates it when I go into her room anyway.
Thank you, Mrs. Connell.
So she went to a party Friday night.
Not exactly a party. It's a local dive where the kids hang out.
No diary?
We didn't find one.
Her mom said she has a journal.
Friends said she argued with her boyfriend Friday.
She stormed offjust after midnight.
She did, huh?
This is interesting.
Who is this?
Tanya Francke, Kay's best friend.
I want to talk to her.
Who is Kay Connell? Who is she?
Is she popular or is she a loner?
Did she like this town?
She want to bolt first chance she got?
Did she have dreams?
She knew this guy.
We know her, maybe we can know him.
This is designer. This is expensive.
- The boyfriend, Randy.
- Randy Stetz.
- He could afford this?
- He's in school.
- Mom didn't buy it.
- What are we thinking?
I don't know, stepfather?
Any rich uncles?
No.
An admirer.
Yeah.
- Tsk. I want the boyfriend.
- I'll get him to the station.
I want to go to the school.
Pull him out in front of friends.
Catch him off guard.
It will get people talking.
So how far away is the school?
- It's 10:00, Detective Dormer.
- You bet.
At night.
Oh. So when does it get dark here?
It doesn't. Heh.
Not this time of year.
Yeah, I heard about that.
How come you didn't know that, Hap?
- Lower 48.
- Lower 48?
Not from here.
Can tell by your walk.
- How's that?
- Unsure.
- Ah.
- Dormer and Eckhart.
We have a reservation.
Don't be fooled by my friend's frivolous demeanor. He's all business.
- Your restaurant still serving?
- Kitchen's about to close.
We'll be quick. Thank you.
Thanks.
We got the Halibut Calabrese, got the Halibut Olympian.
- Keep going.
- Halibut Cajun style.
I can't wait to see what they got for dessert.
Natives are getting restless.
- We gotta talk.
- No, we don't.
- Just sit tight?
- Nothing's changed.
Nothing's changed?
What do you think we're doing in the halibut capital of the world?
Buck figured Charlie needed help.
Buck figured I.A. would be coming to me next, and he was right.
Warfield had me in his office for three hours yesterday.
Hap, he's rattling your cage, pal.
That's all.
Me and Trish talked it through, and I'm sorry, I gotta cut a deal.
- Don't say this shit to me.
- You won't be involved.
I'm not? Of course I will.
With your reputation, he can't touch you.
My reputation's the whole problem.
You think Warfield gives a fuck about you shaking down drug dealers?
You think that will get him his headlines? He needs the big fish.
He's putting the squeeze on you to get to me.
- But you're clean, Will.
- I'm a good cop, yeah.
But there's always something they could use to get at your credibility.
Have you any idea what this is gonna do?
Think about all my cases. All the cases dependent on my word, my judgment.
Those fuckers on the street.
That's what you're doing.
They got nothing on you because there's nothing to get.
Dobbs.
- What about Dobbs?
- That's different.
It's different?
Warfield doesn't want
Dobbs on the street.
It's a house of cards. Once it starts, it's just gonna tumble. All of it.
That's a chance I gotta take, pal.
- I got family.
- Don't give me that.
Warfield made it clear.
I get probation.
We're cops, man.
This is not about us.
This is about all the people who depend on us. People with families.
I spent my life doing this. My life.
You're gonna destroy it like that.
Why? Why?
So some I.A. prick gets closer to being chief of police?
Or playing golf with the mayor or whatever the fuck else he's after?
You finished?
Sorry, I gotta cut a deal.
So, make any decisions?
Uh... You do everything around here?
After 11, pretty much.
Over to you, Will.
What are you having?
I lost my appetite.
Excuse me.
Morning.
Hi.
- What kind of calls you get here?
- Mostly drinking-related problems.
Domestic abuse, bar fights, that sort of stuff.
People here come to live the way they want to...
...so most people keep to themselves.
Chief won't let me handle anything over a misdemeanor.
Don't knock misdemeanors.
No, but it's such small stuff.
It's so boring.
It's all about small stuff.
You know, small lies, small mistakes.
People give themselves away same in misdemeanors as in murder cases.
It's just human nature.
Aren't you gonna write that down?
Friends making you nervous?
They think you did it?
You killed her?
- No smoking on the school premises.
- Did you love her?
- Randy, did you love her?
- Sure, she was nice.
She was nice. Wow.
That makes me all soft inside.
Did it occur to you she didn't love you?
She loved me.
- Wanted me every night.
- Oh. Probably to pass the time.
Girl like Kay Connell, she was looking for more than some loser. Right?
What can I say? Love is blind.
- Live on your own?
- His grandpa's.
- No alibi for Friday?
- Didn't know I'd need one.
- At the party what'd you fight about?
- Stuff. No big deal.
- I heard it was a loud fight.
- I guess.
- I heard it was pretty rough.
- It wasn't rough.
Not like the other times.
Those times she wouldn't listen to you.
Couldn't keep her mouth shut.
- Keep fishing, man.
We saw the bruises.
They said she was beaten.
Not those bruises. Come on.
The old bruises. Your bruises.
I'm sick of this.
I haven't done anything wrong.
You haven't?
Fuck you!
You're a prick in a leather jacket.
What the fuck do you know?
Randy...
...this whole thing you're doing, this fuck-the-world act.
It might work with your mom.
It might even work with local cops...
...who know you enough to figure you're too dumb to kill...
...without leaving witnesses and a signed confession.
It ain't gonna work with me.
Because I know things. You understand?
I know you beat your girlfriend.
I know she was seeing somebody else.
Someone she might have gone to see after she walked out on you Friday.
Now are you gonna tell us who that somebody might be?
Or are you so fucking stupid...
...you're gonna leave yourself as the last person to see Kay Connell alive?
I don't know.
You don't know.
I couldn't get her to tell me.
How hard did you try?
Pretty hard.
- You think he...
- No.
How'd it go?
Find where this is from.
Mrs. Connell and her friends don't know.
You try the jewelry stores?
Small things, remember?
The second you're about to dismiss something, think about it.
Look at it again.
Want me to write that down?
No, I'll remember it.
Ellie Burr.
- Where was it?
In a cabin on the beach.
- It's definitely Kay's?
Her books are in it.
Kids found it.
- Cabin secured?
Francis is headed there.
Stop him.
- Tell him to stay clear.
Rich.
Biology and Algebra.
Let's find out who she studied with, where she bought this.
"Otherwise Engaged.
A J. Brody mystery. "
- Who reads this crap?
- I do.
Read it. After it's dusted.
Find anything that strikes you, plot-wise, underlined passages.
There it is. The diary.
Every word.
That's it.
- I'll put it in evidence.
- No.
Why?
Call every radio station from here to Anchorage.
Tell them we're looking for the bag Kay left the party with.
- Get it on the air in the next hour.
- You got it.
Fill that bag up with books and put it back.
Gonna eat this son of a bitch alive, knowing he missed this.
You know something, Charlie?
Maybe this isn't such a hot idea.
A guy picks up a bag, don't make him guilty.
Will, it's solid.
I don't know. This kind of thing.
Maybe we do this by the numbers.
- Come on.
- I.A.'s gonna be on my ass.
I don't want this turning up in some court when my rep's in the shit...
...and they're pulling apart my cases.
- Bullshit.
What the fuck you care?!
Someone beat a girl to death.
Your job is to find him.
You're a cop, not a lawyer.
Don't let I.A. cut your balls off.
Charlie's right, Will.
OP 1, this is OP 2.
We still got nothing.
Yeah, it's nice. Light.
All plastic except for the barrel.
Never rusts.
What do you carry down in L.A.?
- Smith & Wesson. 45.
- Excellent.
Anything?
No.
- Maybe he doesn't listen to the radio.
- He prefers the voices in his head.
Hey, Will?
We have somebody moving towards the cabin.
Okay, fan out. Nice and easy.
Come on, go!
Police!
Police! Come out!
Fuck!
Down there, huh?
Down to the water. Spread out!
Go!
Fuck it.
Dormer!
Hold it! Who's there?
You okay?
- I'm okay.
- Will?
- Don't talk.
- Will.
- Don't talk. Don't talk.
- Here.
- You sh...
You...
You shot...
I know. I couldn't see, Hap.
I couldn't see in the fog.
You tried to...
You tried to kill me? Fuck you.
No, listen, Hap.
- Listen to me now. No, no.
- Get away, get away!
No, I couldn't see you in the fog.
I couldn't. I...
I couldn't see you, Hap.
Don't go. Come on.
- Man down!
Who's down?
- Man down here!
Spread out!
Dormer! Where'd he go? Which way?
Dormer! Which way?
That way.
Fuck.
Farrell went down.
You gave chase.
After you left Farrell, you heard the killer's second shot.
You ran down to the water.
You found Hap.
Will?
Is that what happened?
- Did Hap say anything?
- Damn it!
Why didn't I know about the goddamn tunnel?
You don't move on a suspect without knowing his exits.
There's a bunch of those tunnels out there.
Closed years ago when they were mines.
- I don't even know most of them myself.
- I had him, Charlie.
As close as you are now.
I could smell the son of a bitch.
- And I blew it.
- There's no point in blaming yourself.
- I fucked up everything.
- Don't come apart on me, understand?
I need you to find this bastard.
Yeah.
You wanted to see me?
- You're on Eckhart's shooting.
But we know what happened, and I'm on the Connell case.
Anchorage wants to send someone.
I told them we can do it. Can't we?
- Sure.
- Write it up. No Shakespeare.
Just enough to fry this son of a bitch longer. Right?
Hello?
Uh... Jenny, it's Will.
Can you put your mother on?
Hello?
Trish, it's Will.
What's happened?
They won't tell me anything.
It's Hap...
Is he okay?
No, he's gone, Trish.
He's dead.
What?
Trish, I can't tell you how sorry I am.
What was he doing, Will?
This guy killed a girl, and, so we...
We had him...
We found him and we had him cornered.
And then he ran and...
Hap...
I'm so sorry.
- I'm just so sorry.
- Did he suffer?
- No, I don't...
- Did he say anything?
Well, when I found him he...
He was peaceful.
- Did you get him?
- No, no. Not yet.
You find him.
And when you do, don't arrest him.
You understand me, Will Dormer?
Don't you dare fucking arrest him!
- Okay, Trish.
- You understand?
Okay.
Trish, listen. I'm...
- was shot and killed this evening...
...in an attempt to apprehend a suspect in the murder...
...of 17-year-old local girl, Kay Connell.
I'm sorry. It's been on the radio for hours.
We're not used to this kind of stuff up here.
He was standing right there.
Last night.
I hope I was nice to him.
He liked you.
Detective? I'm sorry to bother you, but could you just point...
...to where you were when you heard the second shot?
Sorry to make you do this right now.
That's all right.
You're doing your job.
Where was I?
- There.
Thank you.
No sign of Farrell's bullet yet, huh?
No, we'll have the other one for ballistics after...
...the autopsy.
I'm really sorry.
How are you doing?
- Clean through, huh?
- Yeah.
No souvenir.
Bullet got lost in the rocks, I guess.
Well, better luck next time.
You ever been shot?
Yeah, I have.
Kind of itches, don't it?
We gotta catch him.
Did you get a look at him?
- When?
- When I left you.
- You see anything?
- I was in a lot of pain...
...and when I heard that second shot,
I kept my goddamn head down.
Hey, I'm...
...sorry about Detective Eckhart.
Sorry about that megaphone.
- Maybe if I hadn't...
- Farrell, listen.
What were we doing running around in the fog?
We doing it for our health?
We were chasing someone.
So anything that happened on that beach is not your fault.
That's the fault of one man and one man only.
And that's the man who beat
Kay Connell to death.
At this point, Dormer encountered Brooks.
The suspect, obscured by fog, shot Officer Brooks...
...in the vastus externus of the left thigh.
Francis, you're Farrell.
You were shot in the leg.
Come on, Ellie.
When you get this, get the cone.
- This his blood?
- Ketchup maybe.
Was he eating a hot dog?
Anything he dropped or stepped on...
...you put in a bag.
Cigarette butts, gum wrappers, coins, anything.
Suspect will often leave something behind.
Detective Dormer gave chase...
...lost the suspect in the fog then heard a shot...
...coming from a northeasterly direction.
- He wasn't that way.
How do you know?
Because I saw him.
- Turn this way.
Are we almost done here?
My nads are freezing off.
Ellie! I think I found something.
Should they start further over?
- No. Waste of time
He stayed by the water far as he could.
I saw him over the rocks.
He knew he'd lose us down there.
Duggar.
Where'd he find it?
Okay.
Yeah, well, just let me know.
Okay.
I will.
Dormer?
They found Farrell's bullet.
Looks like a. 38.
We'll get both bullets to the lab.
See if we can get a fix on the weapon.
If it's okay with you.
A guy came by.
Said he was your new partner.
- Did he leave a name?
- No.
Can I borrow this? Thank you.
- Pioneer Lodge.
Warfield for Dormer.
John Warfield.
He's called a couple times.
Want me to lie?
No, I'll take it.
Thank you.
Dormer here.
I was shocked to hear about your partner. I was getting to know him...
What do you want?
You know what I want,
Eckhart was gonna give it to me.
You got something to say, just say it.
- He told you about our conversation?
- Say it.
Let's just say I'm interested to see your report on what happened.
Don't presume to know what happened.
You weren't here.
But then, you never are, are you?
You're always safe behind some desk, reading your bullshit reports.
And that is why I have nothing but contempt for you.
You and all the assholes like you...
...risk nothing, spend all day sucking the marrow out of real cops...
...when you never had the balls to be one yourself.
Detective, you came yourself.
- Yeah.
Sign here.
He didn't suffer too much.
- What's the caliber?
- Don't know.
The gunshot victims I see are from rifles. Wasn't one of those.
- Had any sleep, detective?
- Yeah.
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Sorry.
No problem.
- Bullet. I want results by tomorrow.
Aye, aye, cap'n.
We should check Randy's whereabouts.
Think it was Randy out there?
He still doesn't have an alibi.
You said he beat Kay.
- You check it out, then.
- I will.
Detective Dormer?
My report. I finished.
I need you to look it over and sign it.
It's self-explanatory. I look forward to getting back to work with you.
We have more important things to do than paperwork.
A man died, Ellie. This is important.
Of course. I didn't mean to imply that that wasn't...
Be sure of your facts before you file this.
It's your name on the report.
He couldn't have come from there.
Dormer here.
- Hello?
Can't sleep, Will?
Me neither.
Who's this?
I got a nap this afternoon, but I guess you had to work.
Who am I speaking to?
Get rid of your clock yet?
Won't help.
When I moved here, I went five nights. You believe that?
- This crazy light.
A name or I'm gonna hang up.
No, you're not. You need the company.
Nothing as lonely as not sleeping.
Feels like the whole fucking planet is deserted. Just you and me.
So...
...tell me who I'm talking to, and we can chat a while.
- I can't do that.
- Why not?
- Not till you understand some things.
- Like what?
I saw.
- Saw what?
- Saw you shoot your partner.
Saw him die in your arms on that beach.
I thought you'd blame me.
That's why I dropped my gun.
- My uncle's old. 38.
- Yeah.
- You get it? What about ballistics?
- Listen to me now.
I don't know what you think you saw.
We should discuss this, don't you think? Face to face.
This situation isn't yours to control. I saw you.
I'll control this situation, pal.
Because you don't hide from me in a town this small. Get it?
No, not for long.
I need your help.
I'm not telling anyone anything.
We're partners on this.
- but to be remembered as the Kay we knew and loved.
Swimming, hiking through the Kebaughs...
...meeting at Darrow's after school...
...and always, always with a smile on her face.
Detective Dormer?
I want to check something. I was going over my report last night...
...and I have a question about where that second shot came from.
You said you heard it from the waterline...
...but from the way
Detective Eckhart's body fell...
...it couldn't have come from the rocks further up from the water.
Do you think it's possible you heard the shot before you hit the waterline?
- Detective Dormer?
- Yeah, it's possible.
Yeah.
Why don't I give her a ride?
Thought I smelled something.
- How you doing? Coping?
- You're that cop.
- Yeah.
- Are you coming or not?
- Not.
You want a stick of gum?
I love chewing gum.
It keeps me awake.
- I never met anyone from L.A. before.
- Not missing much.
- So how do you like our shithole town?
- It's not bad.
- Were you good friends with Kay?
- Best friends. Since grade school.
- That's a long time.
- Yeah, we were like sisters.
Like sisters? Must be tough for you what happened, then.
Everyone keeps telling me
I'm doing great, considering.
But they're all real worried about me.
They don't even care if I show up for school or not.
Worried I haven't cried yet.
But ain't no law says you gotta cry, right?
No, there ain't.
What about her other friends?
Do we have to talk about
Kay right now? God.
I don't want to think about all that. Just drive.
I understand.
- Want me to take you somewhere?
- As long as it's fun.
Young, impressionable girl...
...left alone with older Los Angeles cop. Who knows where we might go?
Well, I know a place.
Hmm. Let's just drift a while.
Look at this.
Who does he think he is?
What does he think he's doing?
- Move over.
- Let him move over.
Come on! Move over!
What are you doing?
Move over, you crazy fuck!
- Oh, my...
- I moved over.
Just a little visit to the dump!
- You should feel at home.
- You just about killed us! Get off me!
- What is this?
- You and Kay were like sisters?
- Yes. I told you.
- Why are her pictures of you torn?
Why was her boyfriend's hands all over your ass at her funeral?
Randy doesn't have an alibi because he was with you.
You were out fucking your best friend's boyfriend.
- That what best friends do?
- She never really loved Randy, okay?
- She didn't love him?
- No.
How do you figure that?
She have someone else?
- I don't know.
- Someone bought her dresses, jewelry?
Hey, look around.
I want to show you something.
You'll understand why I brought you.
This is the spot where your best friend's naked body was dumped.
Wrapped up in garbage bags!
Tanya...
...I know you don't want anyone knowing you betrayed your best friend.
That's why you won't give Randy an alibi for Friday night. I know.
Tell me who Kay was seeing.
And we can forget the whole thing.
It'd be our secret. Our little secret, but I need a name.
She wouldn't tell me, okay?
She wouldn't tell you?
You're her best friend.
- It was her big fucking secret!
- Why a secret?
I don't... Because she thought she was special...
...and she kept saying he'd help her get out of here.
- Who is "he"?
- I don't know.
- She talked about him?
- Yeah.
- She talked to you?
- Yeah.
And what did she call him?
- She called him something, right?
- Yes!
What? What'd she call him?
Brody.
She called him Brody. That's not his name, so what's the difference?
Jesus! You happy now, you fucking asshole?
Okay. You did good. Come on.
I'll let you drive.
You wanna drive?
It's just poetry.
I read it line by line.
It's nothing specific. Verses on nature, love. That sort of stuff.
Detective Dormer. Line one.
- Dormer here.
How're you holding up?
Can't be easy to keep working after three days of no sleep.
And hard to keep focus.
Are you seeing things yet?
You know, those little flashes?
Tricks of light?
See your partner?
- I see Kay sometimes.
- What can I do for you, sir?
Why couldn't you tell anyone you shot him?
I mean, it was an accident, right?
I hope so. For your sake.
You know what I'm saying?
No need for threats.
I'm trying to make you understand my situation.
You thought no one would believe you because of the trouble in L.A.
- I know what that's like, Will.
Uh-huh.
- I got the same problem.
- You do?
Mm-hm. I'm not who you think I am.
You're not?
- No.
- I'm not a murderer any more than you.
- Why don't we get together?
Talk, have a beer, whatever?
- Throw a little gas on the fire?
- Yeah...
I gotta go check some things.
Why don't you...
...put this stuff back into evidence and tell...
- What's that guy?
Fred.
Tell him I'll see him in the morning.
Can we return this?
Her mother might like it.
Sure.
That's right.
Here.
This is Walter.
Leave a message, wait for the beep.
Will, you there?
Where else can you go in that state?
You must've been freezing.
If you want, take a shower.
There are clean towels in the bathroom.
This is Walter.
Leave a message, wait for the beep.
Will, pick up.
I'm not dumb enough to come back...
- Walter Finch.
- Will.
Will Dormer, what are you doing?
I try to help and you're running around like a maniac.
Were you gonna kill me?
How would you explain that?
No one gets too upset when child murderers are brought in feet first.
There's no evidence I killed Kay.
You know because I told you.
- Come on. What's wrong with you?
- Guess I'm a little cranky.
- Lack of sleep.
- Get some rest, will you?
Got some pills, and my bed's nice and comfy.
Another night up and you'll lose it.
Hallucinating, babbling.
Tomorrow when you feel better, we'll meet in public. We'll sort it out.
There's a ferry north of Nightmute.
I'll be on the 11:00.
And before you leave, could you feed the dogs? They're on a diet.
Dormer? Fax from the lab.
Weapon was a. 38 Smith & Wesson.
- We found something that might...
- I found this. At the Connells'.
And?
It's the author of the book we found in Kay's bag.
It's signed by the author.
He's a local.
Kay had all his books.
We should check it out.
- Small stuff, right?
- Yeah. Sure, sure.
Nice work, Ellie.
She's got sharp eyes, huh?
You bet your ass she does.
Good stuff.
What a view.
- I'm not who you think I am.
- No?
Walter Finch:
Lousy writer. Lonely freak.
Murderer. No?
When I was 7, my grandmother took me to Portland.
We were walking along and two guys snatched her purse.
A police officer came to ask questions.
He stood the whole time.
Uniform looked brand-new.
Shoes, badge were polished.
It was like a soldier, only better.
I respect your profession.
I write about it.
I wanted to become a cop after school.
I couldn't pass all the tests.
You should've tried Internal Affairs.
They'd have taken you.
What do you want from me?
After Kay died, I knew everyone would think I meant to do it.
So I cleaned the body, removed all evidence connecting it to me.
Except for your fucking novel. Heh.
Under pressure. You don't always see the wood for the trees.
You, for one, should have figured that out by now.
When I heard they had brought somebody from L.A., I panicked.
I knew the locals would connect me to Kay eventually.
I could handle them. They never look in the eyes of a killer.
Killing changes you. You know that.
It's not guilt.
I never meant to do it.
It's like awareness.
Life is so important.
How could it be so fucking fragile?
You'd see it right away, wouldn't you?
You trying to impress me?
Because you got the wrong guy.
Killing that girl made you feel special.
But you're not.
You're the same pathetic freak
I've been dealing with for 30 years.
Know how many of you
I caught with your pants down?
I never touched her like that.
You wanted to. Now you wish you had.
Best you could do is clip her nails.
Now you're so different.
You don't get it, do you?
You're my job.
You're what I'm paid to do.
You're about as mysterious to me as a toilet is to a plumber.
Reasons for doing what you did?
Who gives a fuck?
Motivations are everything, Will.
What did you see through the fog?
I saw pretty clearly, didn't I?
I saw you take aim...
- Forget it.
... shoot your partner in the chest.
Oh, well.
I heard him say,
"Get away from me!" Why?
Anything to do with
Internal Affairs investigation?
All that tension in your department?
- You think I'm that easy?
- I'm saying that's how it looks.
Maybe even how it feels.
How did it feel when you found out it was Hap? Guilt? Relieñ
Suddenly, you're free and clear. Did you think about it before that moment?
What would it be like if he wasn't there anymore?
Doesn't mean you did it on purpose.
You figure if you got something on me, then I'll just roll over?
- Protect my reputation?
- No.
Protect your life's work.
The scumbags you put away will be back on the street before you go on trial.
With Hap gone, you're free and clear.
Why mess with that?
Kay Connell. Remember her?
It's your choice.
Think of all the other Kay Connells.
Do the math. You're a pragmatist.
You have to be because of your job.
This isn't easy, but I want you to understand...
...we're in the same situation here.
You didn't mean to kill Hap any more than I meant to kill Kay.
But that's hard for them to believe, so that's why we need each other.
We gotta find a patsy for the
Connell case and make it stick.
Do that. Then you go back to Los Angeles and I can go back to living my life.
So, what do you need from me?
What do they know about me?
Uh... They found a signed copy of one of your books at Kay's house.
- So you'll be brought in for questioning.
- At the station?
That's what they usually do.
Brought in for questioning.
I can write that easily.
Calm down. It's no big thing.
It's preliminary inquiry, so...
...just tell the truth.
- Tell them about Randy...
- Why are you talking about Randy?
Talk about your relationship with Kay.
You can't hide it, so just say it.
Randy is none of your business.
It's not your affair.
Shouldn't I tell them she was unhappy...
Tell them she was unhappy, but let them find Randy themselves.
That way, they'll make it stick.
Understand?
We need a wild card.
- A wild card?
- Yeah. Something that's there.
Something we can use.
It's in every good detective novel.
You still have the. 38?
No.
Really? That's a shame.
We could use that.
That'd be very convincing for them.
This is my stop.
Dormer!
Wild card!
Night, everyone.
- Night, Francis.
Working some overtime?
- Nice.
- Cracking some big cases?
Night.
- Night, guys.
This is always the worst time of night for me.
Too late for yesterday, too early for tomorrow.
Sorry about the tape.
I had to make sure you'd follow through.
I'll follow through.
I've been thinking it over.
I should tell them about Randy.
- I think that's a bad idea.
- But he's the patsy. He deserves it.
You should have heard the shit Kay told me. How he abused her.
But these are cops.
They're not children.
You don't throw things like that in their lap.
I'll push them toward Randy.
When the time is right.
We don't have the gun.
How will we convince them he's guilty?
Did you keep the dress?
The dress?
Kay's dress, nail clippings.
What did you do with those?
That's great. The dress. We could use that. Even better than the gun.
- Where could he have taken her?
- Where'd you take her?
- She died in the cabin, right?
- Yeah.
Where'd you take her to clean her up?
Don't think about that.
This is tough enough for you.
- It was an accident.
- Yeah.
- I didn't mean to kill her, you know.
- I know, but what happened?
She called and said that she and Randy had had a fight.
She wanted to come over and talk, and I said, "Meet me at our place. "
That's the cabin at the beach.
She comes over.
She's distraught and a little drunk.
She starts telling me about how Randy and Tanya were carrying on.
I only wanted to comfort her.
Hold her.
I kissed her, and got a little excited...
...and she started laughing at me.
She wouldn't stop laughing.
Ever had someone laugh at you when you're like that? Vulnerable.
Laughing their ass off?
Someone you thought respected you?
You ever have that happen?
I just wanted to stop her laughing.
And then, you know...
...I hit her.
Couple of times, to stop her.
Get a little respect.
Randy did it all the time.
She liked it when he did it.
She never blamed him.
Never wanted to leave him.
I do it, she starts screaming.
She wouldn't stop.
She's screaming.
I put my hand over her mouth.
Then I'm really scared.
I'm scared shitless.
More scared than I've ever been.
I'm more scared than her.
And then...
...everything was clear.
There was no turning back.
And after that, I was calm.
Real calm.
You and I share a secret.
We know how easy it is to kill somebody.
That ultimate taboo.
It doesn't exist outside our minds.
I didn't murder her.
I killed her, but it just ended up that way.
So where'd you take the body?
Thanks for listening to me.
Feels good to talk about that stuff.
I'll be able to sleep now.
You wanna talk about Hap?
- Morning.
- Your phone isn't working.
I turned it off.
I needed to sleep. Sorry.
Fred called that author.
He was happy to cooperate.
He'll be in first thing, so we need to get to the office.
I forgot to tell you they sell these in stores in Anchorage.
- No way of finding out who bought it.
- Okay.
Bet you're looking forward to getting back to L.A.
Back to robbery homicide, or...
...maybe not.
- What are you saying to me, Ellie?
- Nothing.
Are you doing okay?
You haven't been sleeping much.
No, I haven't. No.
A good cop can't sleep because a piece of the puzzle's missing.
A bad cop, because his conscience won't let him.
- You said that once.
- I did?
Sounds like something
I'd say, don't it?
I'll see you back there.
You were acquainted with the deceased, Kay Connell?
Yes, I was.
In what regard were you and her familiar?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- How did you know her?
- She was an avid reader of my novels.
When did you meet her first?
A year ago. She came to a signing in Nightmute.
She hung around afterwards.
We chatted about my writing...
...and how she wanted to write...
...then she asked if she could visit me and talk about books, things like that.
- And she did?
- Yeah, we became very close.
She got comfortable enough to show me her writing.
- What does she write?
- Poetry, actually.
- Any good?
- No, not really.
- You tell her that?
- Why would I?
Exactly what was the nature of your relationship to this girl, Finch?
I was someone she could talk to.
Someone outside of her everyday life.
That's why she needed me and approached me.
Why'd she need you for that?
- Well, her boyfriend, Randy...
- Randy Stetz?
- Abusive little prick. He hit her.
- We know all this already.
- It was getting worse.
- So?
A lot worse. Really.
Why all this eagerness to talk about Randy?
You're right. I'm sorry.
That's probably all hearsay.
I don't want anything I say taken the wrong way.
Anything you say to us at this stage is in confidence.
Secondly, we're not a bunch of hotheads who'll draw crazy conclusions.
- Okay.
Please, continue.
One more thing. Probably doesn't mean much, but I think Kay was scared.
- I have myself to blame for that.
- Why is that?
Randy knew who I was.
He knew that she had a friend...
...someone she confided in.
It made him furious.
She wrote about being scared.
Her letters were getting desperate.
You still have these letters, by any chance?
I probably do.
Do you think it might help?
They might.
Okay. Anything else?
The thing that worried her the most was the gun.
He had this old handgun.
He showed it to her.
I don't know where he got it, probably wasn't even his...
...but he said he'd use it if he found out who she was seeing.
He kept it hidden in a heating vent.
You know, in the skirting boards?
It might be the. 38.
- Get me Judge Biggs.
- What?
I'm getting a search warrant to Randy's.
- Get Judge Biggs on the phone.
- I should get over there.
- No!
- No?
You're the guy he's talking to.
So we're waiting for the warrant. Okay?
Do you know when Randy showed her the gun?
February?
No, probably January.
Why didn't you come forward when she died?
- She didn't want anybody to know.
- Even when she was dead?
Beaten to death. Her body dumped on a pile of garbage!
- I was her friend.
- You weren't her friend.
- Acquaintance. We were close...
- Close?
She was attractive.
Did you have sex with her?
- She was 17.
- Seventeen? She was attractive.
I suppose.
Suppose? She was.
So did you have sex with her?
- No, I was her mentor.
- You bought her things. Gifts.
- Yes.
- What kind of gifts?
- Books, mostly, that's what she loved.
- Books? What about this?
- You give her this?
- Yes.
Why?
- To see how she looked with it on?
- No.
- No? Why jewelry?
- It was just a present.
- Bought a lot of presents? Dresses?
- What's wrong with that?
Nothing. I'm figuring out what kind of mentor you were.
I gave her things she couldn't have.
You wanted to fuck her, didn't you?
Sick son of a bitch!
Cool off.
- Sick bastard.
You have to cool down. Okay?
Cool down.
All right. I need a break.
I have to apologize on behalf of my colleague.
Ahem. He's been under a lot of pressure lately. But he's a good cop.
I'd hate to see the bad cop.
Search and seizure warrant.
Yes, sir.
Randy Stetz. We'll fill in the rest later.
- We got our warrant!
- Thank you. We appreciate it.
Francis, come with me. Let's go!
You're not going?
No.
Are you not on the Connell case?
I'm covering the shooting of Detective Dormer's partner.
Heard about that. It's tragic.
Should I call about Kay's letters?
- Yeah. I'll pick them up.
- Okay.
Stetz! We're coming in!
Turn the place over.
Look there! Try over there!
Rich, look here now.
I got it! Hey, Fred!
- Just in time, Dormer.
Had it in the motor oil.
What the fuck is this?
He says he was with Tanya when Kay was killed.
- That's what she told me.
- When?
- When I questioned her.
- Were you planning on telling us?
That's what I'm doing now.
Randy and Tanya were screwing around.
She's trying to protect him.
And the gun?
Says it isn't his.
If we get the ballistics match, he'll be forthcoming.
- So you leaving us?
First thing tomorrow.
If Spencer can remember where he parked the plane.
I thought you wanted to kill me in the interview room.
- I did. Randy is in jail.
- Said I'd write an ending they'd like.
You were wrapped up in details.
- The details? He's innocent.
- No, he isn't.
He beat Kay.
One day he'd do something worse.
You knew I planted the gun?
You wanted to help me before the tape recorder.
You had to have a wild card.
You're a good man. I know that, even if you've forgotten it.
When were you gonna point them at me? When you found Kay's dress?
Where I took the body?
If you have a gun and forensics...
...wouldn't matter what I said about you killing your partner.
May I have the tape?
- Did you make any other copies?
- Why would I?
Stop me from turning you in.
Or killing you.
I don't have a hold over you.
You made your own choices.
Like I wasn't here. Why kill me?
It won't help Randy.
After your scene at the department, it won't do you good if I'm dead.
- A lot of ways a man can die.
- Like an accident? Like Hap.
Like Kay.
It took you 10 minutes to beat
Kay Connell to death.
Ten fucking minutes.
You calling that an accident?
It took you a fraction of a second to kill your partner.
Is that more of an accident?
Is this an accident?
If you want it to be.
It's over, Walt.
It's over. I'm telling them everything.
Tell them about Hap, you, everything.
- What good would that do?
- It'll end this thing.
It won't end it.
You're not thinking straight.
Will you tell the truth? You shot your partner and lied about it.
To them, you're a liar and a killer.
You're tainted. Forever!
You don't get to pick when you tell the truth. The truth is beyond that.
That tape was the only proof we had a conversation outside of that room.
To them, I'm a writer that Kay admired.
Randy is the killer, and you're a hero cop. Your life's work is intact.
Another abusive scumbag is in jail.
Everything is as it should be.
Go back to Los Angeles.
The case against Randy is pretty solid.
I can take care of everything here.
I got it worked out. Go home.
Midnight of your sixth night.
You broke my record, Will.
Randy Stetz. He was an asshole.
You knew him as a kid?
- Dads were on the same boat.
- Bad seed.
How do you like our beer?
What Dormer needs is a little shuteye.
- White nights getting to you?
- Hasn't been easy.
Better than winter.
Got that right.
- Sun barely comes up for five months.
Like being sucked into a black hole.
Hi, guys.
- Hey, Nancy Drew. You hear? We got him.
- Yeah. I heard.
- Rich found the gun.
- Something's on her mind.
- I found this on the beach.
What is it?
Shell casing, 9mm.
The murder weapon was a. 38.
None of us carries a 9mm.
Or backup weapon, right?
Get a hobby, would you?
It's a legitimate point, isn't it, detective?
This case is closed, Ellie. Hold the fort, boys. I'll go find a men's room.
Relieve myself of your fine Alaskan beer.
Do you want a beer or something?
No, thanks.
He's good people, right?
Don't get carried away.
What has two thumbs and loves blowjobs?
I don't know.
- This guy.
Sorry.
It's been something, Dormer.
It's been really great working with you.
- Run Will to the airport?
I gotta pick up the letters.
In Umkumiut...
At his lake house. Dormer will have to leave my car at the dock.
- If that's okay with you?
- Yeah, it's fine.
It's been a pleasure.
Get some sleep.
Detective Dormer.
What is it?
Someone's complaining about the noise.
Says he can't sleep.
Something wrong?
Well, uh...
It's so fucking bright in here.
No, it's dark in here.
Will you please...?
There's this guy, Wayne Dobbs, 24.
Works part time at a copy store.
Every day he watches this 8-year-old boy...
...waiting for his carpool across the street.
- This is one of your cases?
- Yeah. Hap and me.
A year and a half ago.
For six months, he watches this kid.
Finally gets up the nerve.
He goes down, grabs that boy before the carpool comes...
...takes him back to his apartment...
...and keeps him there for three days.
He tortures him...
...and makes him do things.
And, finally, he's had enough.
He gets a rope.
He hangs the boy in a storage space in the basement of the building.
But he didn't do it right.
Little boy's neck didn't break, so he dangled there for a while...
...and then died finally from the shock.
Landlord found the body five days later.
The second I met this guy, Dobbs,
I knew he was guilty.
That's what I do. That's my job.
I assign guilt.
You find the evidence...
...figure out who did it, and then you go get them and put them away.
This time there wasn't enough evidence.
And it's reasonable doubt to a jury...
...because a jury never met a child murderer before.
But I have.
Anyway...
I went and took some blood samples from the boy's dead body...
...and I planted them...
...in Dobbs' apartment.
I could feel it right there.
This is gonna catch up with me.
- I don't do things like that.
- So how did it catch up with you?
Internal Affairs is coming down on our department.
Hap, he was gonna cut a deal...
...and bring me straight into it.
They would've reopened Dobbs' case, he would've walked.
Now that won't happen.
And I don't know...
...how I feel about that.
But Dobbs was guilty.
Dobbs needed to be convicted.
So the end justifies the means.
Right?
- I'm in no position to judge.
- Why not?
Two kinds of people live in Alaska.
The ones who are born here, and the ones who come here to escape something.
I wasn't born here.
Why don't you tell me what you think?
Here. Now. In this room. You and me.
Please.
I guess it's about what you thought was right at the time.
Then, what you're willing to live with.
Nightmute Police Department.
Detective Burr.
She's not here. She left town about 20 minutes ago to go pick up...
Mr. Finch.
Detective Burr.
- Are they friendly?
- Yeah.
Didn't expect to see you this soon.
- Sorry about the mess, doing some work.
Oh, no problem.
Could Kay's letters strengthen the case against Randy?
Possibly.
Watch your head here.
I've done it 1000 times.
Sorry about all the clutter.
I am a pack-rat.
I keep everything.
I got them. Just don't know where.
- They've gotta be here somewhere.
- Working on a new book?
- Have you read any of my books?
- I haven't.
- She knows, Will.
- Where is she?
She knows you killed Hap. You would've realized if you weren't strung out.
- The way she looks at you...
- Where is she?
- Calm down. It's under control.
- If anything happened to her...
She's okay.
If she talks, you're fucked. Everything you've worked for is destroyed.
- Now give me...
- Show me where she is. Now.
She's okay.
Listen. I mean, it's all fine.
- Let's search this place. For the dress.
- What are we looking for?
- What dress? Ellie's?
- Ellie's...
- Kay's!
- You're rambling.
Ellie's here.
- I'm taking care of us.
- Us?
- She saw the dress.
- Us?
Where'd you get us?
Don't talk about us.
She's alive, Will. Ellie!
Hold it!
Don't move!
You shot Detective Eckhart.
And Finch saw you do it.
Did you mean to shoot Hap?
I don't know anymore.
I, uh...
I don't know.
I couldn't see him through the fog, but when I got up close...
...he was afraid of me...
...and he thought I meant to do it, so maybe I did.
I just don't know anymore.
- Where's your gun?
- He took it.
Keep your head down.
I got seven rounds in this clip.
Make it last. Head down.
Okay, go! Go!
You forgot the wild card, Will.
Detective Dormer!
I called for backup. They'll be here soon. Dormer, just hold on.
Hold on.
Nobody needs to know.
You didn't mean to do it.
I know that even if you don't.
No, don't. Don't.
What?
Why?
Don't lose your way.
Hang on.
Dormer.
Let me sleep.
No.
Just let me sleep.
Whenever a good child dies...
...an angel of God comes down from Heaven...
...and takes the dead child in his arms.
And spreads out his great white wings...
...and flies with her...
...over all the places that she loved in her life.
And what do you feel is represented here?
Well, the porcupine giant:
Ginny told her friends. . .
. . .that she'd meet with a giant in the forest. . .
. . .and that he gave her little porcupines.
-What do you mean?
-You see these--
What do you mean by ''porcupines''? l don't know exactly. . .
. . .those are the words of a 7-year-old girl.
Ginny's friends. Friend, sorry.
And this is in the imagination of a
7-year-old girl. Correct?
You could be right. But. . .
. . .on the other hand, the car is very well depicted. . .
-. . .and the giant is--
-Giants are imaginary.
Yes?
A tall, heavyset man could appear. . .
. . .to be a giant to a little girl.
And the lndian man, was he a tall man?
Not a giant. But tall, yes.
Why did you bring this to me,
Mr. Black?
Sorry?
Why did you bring this to me,
Mr. Black? l need to know who l'm looking for. l'm like a layman looking at an x-ray. l don't know how to read it. l need help interpreting it.
This drawing can tell you nothing about. . .
. . .the murderer. lt only tells you about the child who drew it.
Without more information, l don't think l can be of any value to you.
Humor me, doc.
Consider this a working hypothesis and assume for the moment. . .
. . .that this is a drawing of the murderer.
Well.
Your giant certainly looks tall, massive. . .
. . .very imposing. lf this depicts the relationship between the giant and the girl. . .
. . .then these things you call ''porcupines'' . . .
. . .appear to be gifts that she's accepting.
That's implying a trust.
Was the girl in Monash killed the same way?
Exactly the same.
Do the victims resemble one another?
Yes, a lot.
What were the time intervals between the murders?
The Monash County case was eight years ago.
The little girl missing, three.
And Ginny was just. . . .
Just last winter.
So the intervals are getting shorter. lf that's the case, then yes, you could--
Remember, this is a hypothetical case.
But yes, you could expect another incident within. . .
. . .a matter of months.
Maybe a year, if the opportunity arose.
But this could just be a product. . .
. . .of a 7-year-old child's imagination.
Right.
You came to me for help.
-Yes.
-Mind if l ask you some questions?
Shoot.
You recently retired, right?
Yes.
Have you always been a chainsmoker?
Impossible.
There can 't be such a devil.
-You always been a chainsmoker?
-Yes, there are such devils.
Recent. Recent.
-Do you swear...
-Are you still sexually active?
...by your soul's salvation....
Are you still sexually active?
Are you still sexually active?
-Yes, by my soul's salvation....
-Does that embarrass you?
Experienced any. . . .
Have you experienced any sudden fevers, perspiration?
-No.
-Get ahold of yourself, Jerry!
Or voices.
Do you hear voices?
-I kill the girl. I kill the girl.
-No, goddamn it! No!
--Lucky West's prescription is that with the predatory fish...

Here you see Kwan Lee, who 's gone from worms...
... to the little fishies.
Where are those pancakes?
-Don't forget your orange juice, baby.
-Can l get a touchup, please?
-Thanks, doll.
-l could use a little fresh-up too.
Boy. Nice picture.
Thank you.
Aren't you gonna finish your orange juice?
Mommy.
Hi, officer. lt's okay, honey, he's a friend.
Pack up, 'cause the bus is coming.
Any coffee?
Yes, please.
What name would a pretty little girl like you have?
Chrissy.
That's a nice name.
Okay, love bug, this is it.
Come on, let's go.
Bye. Can l have a hug?
Have a good day.
-Beautiful little girl.
-Thank you.
How old is she?
She'll be 8 next month.
First day of school's always a biggie.
-Oh, l forgot your coffee.
-Thank you.
Thank you very much.
-There you go.
-Thank you.
-Want some breakfast?
-Yeah. l'd like bacon and eggs and--
-How do you like your eggs?
-Over easy. And rye toast.
-Okay.
-l got a question for you.
Fire away.
Where would an old bachelor like me find some used furniture?
Nothing too fancy, you know.
A couch, dinette set. . .
. . .something between not-too-expensive and poverty-stricken range.
My range.
There's a flea market up--
You go right up Old Pass Road.
Go north about 25 miles up here. . .
. . .and you're gonna hit a T-junction. lt's gonna fork into two roads, two dirt roads. There's no sign--
Do you like shopping?
-Mommy, can l have a balloon?
-Yeah.
-What color?
-Here, l got it.
Orange.
-Orange. There you go.
-Well, you got pink.
-That's okay.
-Pink? l like pink too.
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much. l'm looking for Formica here.
-lt wipes easy.
-That won't be a problem.
-What about this one right here?
-lt gives a room a very warm feeling.
-This one's oak veneer.
-Veneer, huh?
-l can take $5 off the top.
-What would that bring the total to?
Where's Chrissy?
-Chrissy?
-Where is she?
-She was just right here.
-Chrissy! l'll come back.
Chrissy!
Chrissy!
She's on the swing.
-Bye.
-Chrissy!
-Don't leave me like that.
-Mommy, that girl gave this to me. lsn't it cute?
-What is it?
-A boot cleaner. . .
. . .in the shape of a porcupine. lt's made by a local craft artist.
She makes doormats too.
You want to come see?
Fifteen apiece for the little fellas,
25 for the big.
The mats are 10 bucks even.
You don't run this whole place yourself, do you?
Are you a religious man, Mr. Black?
Baptized. But l'm not churchgoing.
You got a wife?
Two-time loser.
What about you, ma'am?
My son, Gary, is the true gift of the Lord.
He dotes on me hand and foot, he does.
Hardest working boy you ever saw.
Works construction all summer. . .
. . .runs a snowplow for the county in the winter. . .
. . .and ministers at our church.
What about him?
Does he have a family, kids?
No wife, no kids. No little ones.
I pray, every day...
...he'll find a woman good enough for him.
The Lord hasn 't come through yet.
God bless.
Closed! l'm closed!
Yeah, all right, all right.
Closed.
Lori?
Woman, what has happened to you?
Come in.
Sorry. . . .
My ex-- l was just so scared.
He was gonna kill me! lt's all right.
-And you being a cop!
-Where's Chrissy?
-She's in the car!
-No, no, l got it.
She's okay, he didn't touch her.
He didn't touch her, he didn't. . . .
With a restraining order, he's still gonna beat me up.
They put him in jail and he can't pay child support payments.
That's why he's beating me up to begin with.
Ow.
Just hold still.
All right, this might. . . .
All right, that's okay now.
Hold still for a minute because this one might sting a little, okay?
Just hold still.
Right here, that's it.
All right, all right, okay.
Yeah.
The eye looks okay.
You might want to think about getting a stitch on that lip. l'm gonna miss that half-tooth of yours. l'll drink out of this side for a while.
Listen.
All things considered. . .
. . .l think it might be best if you and your girl. . .
. . .stayed out here with me for a while.
-lt's not why l came.
-Hear me out.
No strings attached, no obligations.
But l've seen these things go from bad to worse. l've got more rooms out here than l know what to do with. l wouldn't ask anything of you.
Except maybe help out around the station. . .
. . .every once in a while, when you're feeling better.
Just think about it.
Just think about it.
Mine's up here at the top. . . .
Mommy, this house is so big!
-You got a whole new one, right?
-Yeah-- ls it real?
-lt's not real. lt's called a cap.
-Oh.
--in front! It appears that they're playing very cautiously.
-Is that because it's a big game?
-The last time these two teams--
Pass to Murphy, in the net!
Backhand deflected by Jackson.
Another backhand--
Nice snowman you got going there.
Does he have a name?
Should l guess? lf l guess, will you tell me yours?
He looks cold.
Want to put my hat on him?
Goal!
Has your mommy talked to you about the Word?
Do you know what l mean?
-Merry Christmas, Chrissy.
-Merry Christmas.
There she is!
Yeah!
-How was it?
-Good.
Good!
''She knew the mole would never permit her to leave his side.
She wept as she felt the warmth upon her face. . .
. . .and made ready to go back. . . .
Then suddenly, above the hill, she heard a shower of notes. . .
. . .a glorious morning song.
She looked up. . .
. . .and there was the swallow.
She told the bird how she disliked. . .
. . .having to marry the ugly mole and live deep down under the earth. . .
. . .where the sun never shone.
She couldn't help crying at the thought.
'The cold winter will soon be here,' said the swallow.
'l'm going far away to the warm countries. Will you come with me?
You can sit on my back.
Just tie yourself on with your sash. . .
. . .and we'll fly from the ugly mole and his dingy house. . .
. . .far away, across the mountains. . .
. . .to the warm countries. . .
. . .where the sun shines more brightly than it does here. . .
. . .and it's always summer, with its lovely flowers. . .
. . .dear little Thumbelina.' ''
Lori?
Are you all right?
Here, hon.
Chrissy is gonna go nuts when she sees this. This is so neat, Jerry.
Yeah. She'll like it.
She'll love it.
You sure you want it here, so close to the road?
We got all that space back behind the house.
Well, we can see her right from the station. . .
. . .keep our eye on her, you know?
Out back. . .
. . .there's all that space, you know. l mean, she could just disappear.
No, you're right.
You think?
You're probably right. l'll get that.
Yeah, she's gonna love it.
Mommy, l like this one.
Yeah?
Well, it's nice.
Jerry, what do you think of this?
Well, uh. . .
. . .real nice. lt's not really your taste, sugar. lt is her color.
-You like it?
-l like it.
-Let's see how this looks to you.
-You like-- Oh, no.
Come on, Tex.
-You only have chocolate?
-Thank you.
Let's have three of them.
Did you see that? lsn't he at your school?
''Thump, thump, thump. ''
''They heard the giant's footsteps.
As guick as a wink, the lad once again hid in the oven.
In came the giant for the second time and he bellowed, Fe.... ''
-''Fi. ''
-''Fo. ''
-''Fum. ''
-''l. . .
. . .smell the blood of an Englishman.
Be he alive or be he dead. . .
. . .l'll grind his bones. . .
... to make my bread. ''
Here you are, $ 1.50 is your change.
Here's your receipt.
Thanks for stopping by.
Jerry!
Look what Gary gave me! lt's glow-in-the-dark so Jesus can always be with me.
Can you push me on the swings?
Yeah. What did Mr. Jackson want, Chrissy?
He invited me to his church.
You think Mommy will let me go?
Well, honey, you know. . .
. . .a lot of people believe a lot of different things.
Some people believe that the stories in the Bible are real. . .
. . .and some think they're like fairy tales where the giants aren't real.
Chrissy, l want you to promise me something.
When anybody tries to talk to you, any man. . .
. . .whether it's Mr. Jackson or not. . .
. . .especially if it's a big, tall man. . .
. . .l want you to tell me, all right?
Promise me that you'll tell. l promise.
All right, honey.
Could you push me on the swings now?
Yeah. All right.
Give me your tootsies.
Here we go.
Lori.
Oh, wow!
Hold the roast. Let's eat these.
-Let me clean the sink for you.
-Where's Chrissy? l want her to see--
Oh, she's not here. The Jacksons came over to take her to church.
-Who?
-Put those in there.
-You know, that Bless the Children--
-You let Jackson-- Oh, Jesus.
What?
-What? Jerry!
-No, l-- l told her l'd go to church with her. l'm gonna try to find them.
For God's sakes, it's just church.
You're gonna give yourself a heart attack!
Come on!
Oh, God, no!
Welcome to the House of Our Lord.
May Jesus be with you.
May Jesus be with you.
Jerry!
Jerry!
Yes, hon. What is it? l can't sleep.
Could you read me a story?
Another story?
Please?
Well, all right.
But just a short one. Scoot over.
Let's see what we got here.
We've got. . .
. . . ''The Elves and the Shoemaker. ''
-We've got--
-l met The Wizard today.
What? l had to promise not to tell my parents. So you can't. . .
. . .tell Mommy or he'll be very angry at me and never come back again.
Well, Chrissy, l. . .
. . .l don't believe you.
Wizards don't exist.
No, Jerry, you're wrong.
And l can prove it.
You can, huh?
He gave me these.
They're yummy.
But you can't have them, Jerry.
He said he'd give me more tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Where?
At the picnic grounds.
Aren't they cute?
My itty-bitty, baby porcupines.
The Wizard said they come from a land far, far away.
Jerry, can l go see
The Wizard tomorrow?
Well, he seems like such a nice wizard. l don't see why not.
But let's keep this our secret.
Thank you, Jerry.
Strom, how is your position? l'm in position across the river.
We have a clear view of the girl at the picnic ground.
You're out of position.
-What?
-You should be over closer.
Jerry, we got a whole SWAT team out here doing you a big favor.
Just stay where you are.
Snipers, recheck your fields of fire.
-Jerry?
-He's coming.
What's the matter? l'm fine, Stan.
Want some tea?
You're very thirsty today, aren't you?
Oliver!
Oliver!
Where did you hide them chocolates?
Oh, there's some porcupines. l'm just gonna go down to the water for a minute. ls this guy really coming?
Jerry's coming towards you now.
-l got him. What the hell's he doing?
-Jesus Christ, l have no idea.
This may have been a mistake.
Hold him, l'll be right there.
He had big, big eggs and. . . .
So he went up to the eggs, and it started shaking. l don't know.
What's going on?
-Jerry?
-Okay, guys. Hold your positions.
We're out of position.
Jerry, l got eight guys out here, hung up, doing you a big favor.
You don't know what you're fucking dealing with here.
You understand? You don't know what you're dealing with here.
This guy is real, and l know it.
There's no Wizard, Jerry.
We got our man a year and a half ago.
Toby Wadenah.
You're making this real difficult for me.
What, Stan?
We're calling it quits.
We're out of here. lt's over. That's it.
Okay, Stan.
You do what you gotta do. l'll do what l gotta do.
Just when you leave, don't compromise this operation.
You understand me?
Come on.
He's staying, so do your best not to engage the girl.
Okay, guys. We are pulling out. l want you to know l have to tell the mother.
You should've known Jerry 20 years ago.
He was a good cop.
He was a great cop.
Just, it's. . . . lt's just sad.
He's become a drunk and a clown.
Fucking clown.
Chrissy!
Oh, my God, baby!
Oh, my God!
-Mommy, no.
-No, let's go. No!
No, Mommy.
Chrissy, stop it! Let's go.
Jerry!
-Get in the car.
-l want my doll--
Damn it, go!
Get in the car, now. l want my bike!
Get in the car!
You fucking bastard, Jerry.
How could you do it to Chrissy?
Why would you do it to her?
She's 8 years old, Jerry!
She's only 8 years old!
She could have been killed!
Fucking. . .
. . .bastard!
Fucking crazy.
Why were you pretending. . .
. . .that you loved her and we were starting this life together?
Fucking bastard.
You're fucking crazy.
Oh, boy. This was a bad one.
Jesus!
Poor bastard.
He's coming.
He's coming.
He's coming.
He's coming.
I know it.
I know it.
She said it.
She said it.
She did.
Don't just stand there, give me a hand with the canopy.
-Mary? Merriman? Are you ready?
-Mary?
Yes, Mr. Burkett.
Everything's ready, my Lady.
-I think she's knocking.
-Well, see what she wants.
I can't open this wretched thing.
I suppose we'd better stop.
I can't get this top off.
Is everything all right?
Are you okay?
-Am I what?
-We're all right, thank you.
Is that Lady Trentham?
Lady Trentham.
I'm William McCordle's cousin, Ivor.
Ivor Novello.
Yes, of course.
May I introduce a friend of mine
-from California, Morris Weissman.
-Hello.
We were wondering if we were headed in the same direction.
I dare say we might be.
If everything seems to be all right...
Bye.
Could we get on before I freeze to death?
-Was that really Ivor Novello?
-Yes. Could we get on?
Hello. Nice house.
I like your house.
Hello, Ivor.
Welcome back, Your Ladyship.
Constance, welcome.
Hello, dear.
If he uses my Christian name, why not make it "Aunt Constance"?
I'm not the upstairs maid.
He's still got
-that vile little dog.
-The ones we hate last forever.
-Did you have a horrid journey?
-Yes, fairly horrid.
Take the car round back to unload it.
Follow him. Mrs. Wilson will look after you.
Your Ladyship.
Your Lordship.
-Louisa.
-William.
-Raymond.
-William.
-Lots of good shooting coming.
-That's what we're here for.
Leave everything in one pile.
Make sure it's labelled.
It'll go up in the luggage lift.
-Where's the gun room?
-Down there on the right.
The keeper'll show you what to do.
-I know what to do.
-Ellen.
What are you doing over there?
Take that rain off the cases.
Those are Mr. Novello's bags.
-Who are you?
-I'm Mr. Weissman's man.
-The Countess of Trentham.
-Make sure they're labelled.
-Where am I?
-ln the stable block.
Her Ladyship is in the Chinese Room.
Elsie.
You share with the head housemaid.
She'll show you where things are.
This is Miss Trentham.
Take care of her.
My name's Mary Maceachran.
Not here. It's Trentham.
-Lord Stockbridge. Guns.
-Down there on the right.
-The name's Robert Parks.
-Mr. Parks, below stairs you're Mr. Stockbridge.
-ls that so?
-I knew a Mr. Parks in Norwich.
-ls he any relation?
-No. London born and bred.
-And Her Ladyship's jewels?
-lt's this way.
George is in charge of the safe.
Watch where he puts his hands.
Have you got the ones for tonight?
Sorry.
Always bring a separate box for the first night.
-Freddie, do wait.
-What is it this time?
-Does my hair look all right?
-lt looks fine.
Why are we...?
We're not late.
Please stop going on.
Isobel?
-Hello.
-Hello.
See you in there. There's something
I've been meaning to say to you.
Have you spoken to your father?
No.
"No"? You promised.
I said I'd do my best.
You're beautiful when you resist.
-Stop it. I'll ask him tonight.
-You bloody well better.
-Don't sneak up on people.
-Don't worry, it's nobody.
Sorry, Miss Isobel.
Will you have a chance to speak
-to him tonight?
-Stop going on about it.
That's all very well...
I think it's ridiculous.
I'm here to shoot.
It's a relief to sit next to someone who isn't deaf in one ear.
I'm sorry?
-I have a dog.
-What's his name?
Sam.
Darling, what do you mean
"leave it"?
Let it come naturally.
Don't try and steer the conversation.
-Makes you sound desperate.
-I am fucking desperate.
My brother-in-law, Lord Stockbridge.
-Hello. I'm Morris Weissman.
-Who?
-Morris Weissman.
-Weissman.
Yes.
You can go and sit down now.
Elsie, this is
Lord Stockbridge's valet.
He's new here, so show him around.
-You share with Mr. Weissman's man.
-Has His Lordship's luggage gone up?
Supposedly. He's in the
Tapestry Room.
Oh well, here we go again.
That's just it.
I've never done a house party.
Not properly.
How come you got taken on if you've got no experience?
She wants to train me.
-She didn't care about experience.
-She didn't want to pay for it.
-lt's cold here.
-You should pack your woollies.
Here we are.
-Everything all right, Elsie?
-Fine, Miss Lewis. Thanks.
That's your bed there.
That good? Yeah, very nice.
I shall go in the library.
Here you are, Pip.
Pardon, sir. I thought I'd take
The Times up in case you wanted to
-read it while dressing.
-Thank you, Robert. Look after Pip.
-Of course, sir.
-There's a good boy.
I have to call California and I can't find...
There's a phone on the left.
Thank you. Of course
I'll reverse the charges.
Yes.
There's a new restaurant on the Strand.
It's open 24 hours a day.
You can go in day or night.
Who's the funny little American?
Morris Weissman.
He's a friend of Ivor.
He makes films in Hollywood.
Ivor asked if he could bring him.
Didn't see why not.
He might be interested in guns and shooting.
Never mind. He adds glamour to the gathering.
I didn't expect anything half as exotic. Not for me.
-You know I hate whisky.
-Drink it. Do you good.
Really, Bill.
You're such a bad influence.
Don't blame me if I misbehave.
I don't know how your husband is impressed with Hollywood folk.
You know Raymond.
He only feels safe with his own kind.
Bill!
-Ladies' maids never wear aprons.
-Her Ladyship used to have a French one who wore a black one like this.
-She thinks it's got style.
-I bet she does.
I bet she took it out of your wages, too.
She likes everything just so.
Don't they all.
-That's him.
-Who?
Ivor Novello.
He passed us on his way here and he spoke to me.
He spoke to Her Ladyship but I answered.
I cut it out for Garbo. I prefer
American stars. More oomph.
Go on!
-ls he really Sir William's cousin?
-Yeah.
A film star in the family.
Lady Sylvia must be thrilled.
-I don't think.
-Why wouldn't she be?
Because she's a snobbish cow.
She looks down on those who got to the top with hard work.
She looks down on her husband, except when it's time to pay, then she's got her hand out.
What was her family, then?
What you'd expect really.
Toffee-nosed and useless.
Her father was the Earl of Carton.
Didn't have a pot to piss in.
What's she like to work for?
She's horrible, but he's... he's okay. Come on, we better get cracking.
-Hello. I'm Ivor.
-I know who you are.
-Mabel Nesbitt.
-Hello, Mabel.
-How are you?
-Very well, thank you.
I don't smoke. Thank you.
Mrs. Nesbitt's only got one dress with her.
She says her husband rushed her when she was packing.
-Do you look after visitors?
-Sometimes Dorothy helps.
Why Mrs. Wilson make the still room do it beats me.
I think she only does it to annoy Mrs. Croft.
-Which one does Dorothy answer to?
-Both. That's the problem.
She's rushed off her feet.
-Nearly done there?
-Here's Miss Bossy.
Here, this is you.
What was Greta Garbo really like?
-Did you get to know her?
-Yes, I did, actually.
She's staying with me next month.
Tell me, how much longer are you going to make films?
Depends on how much longer the public wants to see me in them.
It must be hard to know when it's time to throw in the towel.
What a pity about that last one of yours.
What was it called?
"The Dodger"?
"The Lodger".
"The Lodger".
It must be disappointing when something flops like that.
Yes, it is.
Rather disappointing.
Look at this.
Machine made lace.
-Hark at her.
-I hate cheap clothes.
They're twice the work and never look as good.
I'll murder that dog one day.
Look, all over his waistcoat.
What do you expect from a woman with her own maid?
Lady Lavinia says a woman travelling with no maid has no self-respect.
She calls it 'giving in'.
I haven't 'given in'.
-That's different.
-Why?
What's your name?
I think here I'm called Trentham.
No, I meant your real name.
Mary. Mary Maceachran.
Blimey. What does
Your Ladyship call you?
She should call me Maceachran now I'm a lady's maid.
That's what my mother says.
But she can't pronounce it so she calls me Mary.
I don't blame her.
Sylvia.
There mustn't be any more nonsense.
I don't know what you mean.
Done much shooting this year?
Quite a lot.
-Does Louisa go out with you?
-Usually.
It's very good of her.
Don't do that. It's bad for him. Put him down.
Bores me stiff.
All right, Pip.
William's a bad shot. I duck out, particularly in Scotland.
I'm rather fond of Scotland.
Get on with your work.
-Mr. Weissman.
-I'm dealing with this.
What is it, Mr. Weissman?
To start with, my name is Denton. Henry Denton.
You're valet to Mr. Weissman.
You'll be known as Mr. Weissman below stairs.
We stick to old customs here.
It saves confusion.
It's about Mr. Weissman's diet.
He's a vegetarian.
-A what?
-A vegetarian.
He doesn't eat meat.
He eats fish, but not meat.
Well, I never.
Doesn't eat meat.
He's come for a shooting party and he doesn't eat meat.
He doesn't intend to shoot, but walk out for a bit of air.
A bit of air?
Thank you. We'll make arrangements.
I suggest one of the servants takes you upstairs.
Mr. Weissman is in the Green Bedroom. You'll share with Lord Stockbridge's valet,
Robert Parks.
He's full of himself.
"Doesn't eat meat".
We don't want to be thought of as unsophisticated, do we?
Mr. Weissman's an American.
They do things differently there.
Now give Louisa a kiss from me.
Sorry, I should have
-made it clear Morris doesn't shoot.
-Don't worry.
William thinks Americans sleep with guns under their pillows.
They do, but more for each other than for killing birds.
Remind me. How are you related to William exactly?
Our mothers were first cousins.
I don't believe I ever met
William's mother.
Didn't she do something original?
She was a teacher.
So was mine.
-That's marvellous, isn't it?
-Yes.
Sylvia is so clever.
She finds wonderful servants.
I don't know how she manages.
I'm breaking in a new maid.
I'm worn out with it.
Nothing more exhausting, is there?
I don't have a lady's maid.
Hello. I was just telling
Mabel about my new maid.
The amount of work I have to do, she should be paying me.
-She does seem rather young.
-She is, my dear, is wonderfully cheap.
Where are you going?
The room's this way.
Why did you have to mention you don't have a maid?
It's easier to clean them if you put the trees in first.
I was just about to do that.
-Are these Mr. Novello's shoes?
-Yes.
-Do you really live in Hollywood?
-I do.
How did you get there?
Where did you start from?
Where do you think? Scotland.
Were you always in service?
Did you ever think of getting into films?
I wanted to be an actor, when I was little.
I suppose old mother Trentham will have her begging bowl out while she's here.
She won't bother your employers.
Why not?
Because Lady Lavinia
-hasn't got a penny.
-And whose fault is that?
The commander has just been a bit unfortunate.
-I'll say. I think he's pathetic.
-Then hand in your notice.
The other two sisters fell on their feet. They're good-looking.
-Lady Sylvia's lovely.
-You think so?
She might have done a bit better for herself.
Lord Carton wanted Sir William for either of the two eldest.
-Why was Lord Carton so keen?
-Why do you think?
Who pays for him to swan around
Biarritz six months a year?
Who keeps Ma Trentham in stockings and gin?
Old money-bags, that's who.
It's disgusting the way they all use him.
The rest haven't the brains to make the price of a packet of tea.
-Have you finished, Elsie?
-Yes, Mrs. Wilson.
-Just this hem to do.
-What's Lord Stockbridge like?
He thinks he's God Almighty.
They all do.
Why does this fork go on the right?
They eat the fish with two of them.
One in each hand.
Why is that then?
Search me.
What are you doing here?
-Just looking around.
-Mr. Jennings will be up soon.
If I were you, I'd look around somewhere else.
-ls that what you'd do?
-Exactly what I would do.
Then that's what I'll do.
Something funny about that bloke.
His accent for a start.
What is his game?
Are you finished?
What about Lord Rupert Standish and Mr. Blond?
Ladyship said not to lay for them.
It's ready if they turn up.
We'll stick on two extra places.
When they arrive, you'll be dressing Mr. Blond, Arthur.
-Mr. Blond?
-Yes, Mr. Blond.
George, you'll have Lord Rupert.
If they're very late, they can change by themselves and you can tidy up when they're downstairs.
Is Mr. Nesbitt settled?
I'll finish him off now, sir.
And Mr. Novello?
Mr. Weissman's man will attend to him.
Right.
After you finish, join me in the drawing room with the drinks.
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.
I thought I'd be doing
Mr. Novello.
You won't see him in his underdrawers. Never mind.
Better luck next time.
They're rather a mixed bunch.
Mr. Weissman's very odd.
Apparently he produces motion pictures.
"The Charlie Chan Mysteries".
Or does he direct them?
I never know the difference.
Really? I enjoy those, my Lady.
Mary.
It's fun having a film star here.
There's so little to talk about after the first flush of recognition.
Why has Nesbitt brought that awful, common wife of his?
Isabel only asked him because a gun dropped out.
That's no excuse to inflict her on us all. Mary.
What's the gossip in the servants' hall?
Nothing, my Lady.
Nonsense.
Come on, out with it.
Well...
Is it true that Sir William could've married Lady Stockbridge?
Is that what they're saying?
Only that Lord Carton was after
Sir William for one of them, but he didn't care which.
What would you say if I told you they cut cards for him?
Lewis said you wanted me.
-Who's next to me at dinner?
-Aunt Constance and Lavina.
Why do I have that bloody old trout all the time? I want Louisa.
-Do I explain the precedence again?
-I don't give a shit about that.
You complain people look down on you and then behave like a peasant.
Tomorrow, I'll breakfast in bed, and then get into the tweeds.
What shirt have you brought?
-The green with the pink stripe.
-No, dear, that's quite wrong.
Something plain for country sports.
The one I had on today will do.
-But it's soiled.
-You can wash it, can't you?
God.
I hate shooting.
Why does one have to do these things?
Has Constance asked for money yet?
-No.
-Raymond says she's been complaining that her allowance isn't big enough.
Good mind to stop it completely.
I thought it was for her lifetime.
No, no.
Will that be all, sir?
I wish Anthony wasn't here.
Make sure I'm not
-left alone with him.
-Why?
I'm pulling out of his scheme.
-Have you told him?
-No, and I'm not going to either.
Louisa says I should leave it till next week. Let him sob in private.
Say hello to your mummy. Go on.
Far be it from me to contradict Louisa.
-Anything else, sir?
-Pip. He might fall down the stairs.
Come here, you.
Thank you Elsie. Keep hold of him.
Is everything all right?
Cheap dress, wrong shoes.
I'm making bricks without straw.
-Do have any spare hairpins?
-Yes.
I'm trying to get back to the room and I can't find it.
-Staircase at the end of the corridor.
-Thank you.
Pip. Thank you, Elsie.
-You've got hair on your dress.
-Thank you, sir.
There is nothing going on between me and Isobel.
Can't you just tell me the truth?
You are a liar!
Don't call me a liar!
-I found some pins, madam.
-Right.
-We're supposed to be downstairs.
-You go on.
I'll be down in a minute.
Try and make her look respectable.
Thank you.
Well... there's no harm in trying.
Thank you very much, Mr. Jennings.
-Just Jennings, sir.
-All right, just Jennings.
By the way. I booked a call to California and I'd appreciate it if you'd would get me when it comes through.
-Very good, sir.
-Thank you, Jennings.
You're providing entertainment?
That's how you got your invitation.
Don't get up. Go on, please.
You look lovely in that dress.
What is it?
I don't recognise it.
Just something I'm working on.
I can't imagine how one goes about inventing a tune.
Where do you start?
Rather difficult to say.
You're too clever for words.
-Good evening.
-Hello.
-Lovely dress.
-Thank you.
How do you manage to put up with these people?
You forget I earn my living by impersonating them.
-Can I help you?
-You know...
I really enjoy the way you do things, Mr. Jennings.
I beg you pardon!
-What is it, Henry?
-Nothing.
I just wanted to be sure you had everything you need.
Yes, I do. Thank you.
It's wonderful to find a servant who really shows an interest.
Sir.
-Come on. We've got 20 minutes.
-Did you put salt on the table?
Shuffle along. Here he comes.
-Satisfactory, Mr. Jennings?
-Yes, thank you, Dorothy.
They have their drinks. We can all take our leisure for half an hour.
What's this?
I believe this is my place.
Since when did a baroness outrank a countess?
Miss Trentham, would you take the place of honour.
Miss Trentham?
I'm right here, thank you.
Go on. Don't keep him waiting.
Miss Meredith,
-would you come and sit on my left?
-I'm nothing when there are visitors in the house.
I'm used to it.
-Good evening.
-Good evening.
For what we are about to receive may the Lord make us truly thankful.
Start when you get it.
No time for loitering.
I'm not serving tonight, am I?
Not tonight, but probably tomorrow.
-Where is Mrs. Croft?
-Always eats with her own staff.
Does she take her pudding to Mrs. Wilson? Our cook does that.
Fat chance.
They hate each other.
-Can I ask a question?
-Certainly, Mr. Weissman.
How can we help you?
I wondered how many people here had parents in service?
And was that why they chose to go into it?
An interesting question to which
I cannot provide the answer.
All of you whose parents were in service raise your hand.
-My father was.
-Both. Nanny and groom.
-Not you, Dorothy?
-My father was a farmer.
A tenant of Lord Carton's.
-Mr. Meredith?
-Factory hands, both of them.
And if you ask me, they were better off.
What about you, Mr. Stockbridge?
What's the matter? Don't you know?
Yeah, I know what they did.
But it didn't have any effect on me or my choice of work.
-And why's that?
-Because I grew up in an orphanage.
Thank you, Mr. Weissman for giving us something to think about.
Her Ladyship.
I'm so sorry to disturb you.
Please do sit down and finish your supper.
A major crisis has arisen.
Mr. Weissman won't eat meat.
I can't tell Mrs. Croft.
I don't dare.
Everything under control.
Mr. Weissman's valet informed us, so we've prepared a special version of the soup.
He can eat fish, hors-d'oeuvres and we'll have a Welsh rabbit for the game course. I don't know about the entree.
Thank you.
Ten steps ahead as usual!
Which one of you is Mr. Weissman's valet?
I am. Your Ladyship.
Are you, indeed? Heavens.
Thank you for your... efficiency.
You're all set, then.
-Yes, George?
-Nothing, sir.
I should hope not.
Very hungry.
Good boy.
I wondered if I could have a word with you alone after dinner.
I can't leave my guests, can I?
You'll make that dog sick.
Isobel,
William and I are going into business together in Sudan.
-No. I didn't know that.
-lt's quite exciting.
There are hundreds of Sudanese native soldiers, entire regiments, wandering around the desert willy-nilly without anything on their feet, which causes some hardship, I imagine.
No, I grew up in Leicester.
-My father had a glove factory.
-Really?
-I do know how a glove should fit.
-Really, darling, you're boring poor
Mr. Novello to death.
No!
He's going to explain it to me and show me how it all works.
There's going to be a pheasant hunt in my picture.
...modernising armies in the Sudan, providing them with boots.
Aren't you cold?
It's better than that kitchen.
I though you could do with this.
That's kind, love.
Elsie, hello.
-Good evening. Your Lordship.
-We've got bags, guns and no man.
Will you sort it out?
-Of course, Your Lordship.
-Thank you.
-We'll get your bags, sir.
-Thank you. It's very kind of you.
In the boot, is it?
Can I trouble you for a light?
-You got that bag?
-Yeah.
-I've got the gun.
-Thank you.
You think he's losing interest in that sort of thing?
Not just that, the whole Empire.
He said the steam's gone out of it.
William, you think the Empire's finished?
I've been what?
The Empire finished after the War, because of the War.
It changed everything.
Empire, Leicester Square?
I don't care what's changed or not as long as our sons are spared what you all went through.
Oh, not all.
You didn't fight, did you, William?
I did my bit.
Well, you made a lot of money, but it's not the same as charging into the cannon's mouth, is it?
Thanks to Raymond the family had one representative in the front line.
Raymond, tell them how many times you were mentioned in the despatches.
-I forget.
-No you don't. Come on.
-ls he being modest?
-Yes.
What are you doing?
The others have arrived.
If they're frightened of you then they sense your fear.
Lord Standish and Mr. Blond
-are here.
-They can have a tray in the billiard room.
They can join us later.
Very good, my Lady.
-ls Rupert here?
-Yes.
Shall I go and say hello?
I don't think so.
Face it. You're a younger son with the tastes of a marquis and the income of a vicar.
Her mother likes you.
She does, too.
I know she's not a show-stopper...
-Her father's not keen on the idea.
-He'll come round.
"Met my daughter,
Lady Rupert Standish?"
He thinks I'm in it for the money.
Of course, but you can't let that put you off.
He's an obstacle.
Then you must overcome that.
Her Ladyship asks if you would join her in the drawing room when you've finished.
All right, ladies, off you go.
Chaps, move down.
Louisa, look after Pip for me, will you?
Could we have a word or two later, William?
-Jennings, could I...?
-Certainly, sir.
-Put them in the pantry.
-There's more in here.
I need all the knives.
She's counting again.
Fred? Albert? Ready?
-There he is.
-Who?
Lord Stockbridge's valet.
He grew up in an orphanage.
They made him shout it.
Makes you feel sorry for him.
Nothing to be ashamed of.
Shall I ask Lord Rupert and
Mr. Blond to join you, sir?
No. They can entertain the ladies.
-Give Mr. Novello a rest.
-Did I overhear you saying you were going into business with Sir William?
-I beg your pardon?
-ls it very old?
-Possibly.
-lf you need an expert in changing money, especially Africa,
I'm your man.
Yes, the expert.
No, it's not here.
-Mr. Jennings doesn't have it?
-So he says.
If it's a silver carving knife, he must have it.
It's gone in the wrong drawer in the silver pantry.
That's what I told him.
How old would you say
Mr. Stockbridge was?
Thirty-one, thirty-two.
-Why?
-No reason.
I think I'll turn in.
We've got an early start.
And tell Mr. Jennings we haven't got that knife.
-Pleasant evening, my Lady?
-Not really, no.
Lord Stockbridge on one side, boring for Britain, and Freddie Nesbitt on the other, sucking up.
I'm worn out. Any more chocolate in that pot?
I'll go down and make some more.
Lewis.
Lewis.
-I was looking for my maid.
-She's just gone downstairs.
Can I help?
She's fetching me chocolate, but I wonder if I prefer milk.
Would that be hot milk or cold?
You decide.
I couldn't say, my Lady.
Hot then, with something sweet.
Your hands are in your pockets.
Otherwise, I'll never sleep.
Why? Do you have trouble sleeping, my Lady?
I have a feeling I might have trouble tonight.
I'll be wide awake at one a.m., bored to sobs.
Then we must try and think of something to amuse you.
Barnes.
-I'm so sorry, sir.
-lt's all right, it's fine.
I knew William would try something like this. Fuck him.
Short arse.
And fuck this room.
You should come with me tomorrow.
I'll say I need you.
I got through to the coast, finally.
Is that clock right?
We got turned down by Una Merkel, so...
Sheehan's pushing for a rewrite.
He thinks the part's too small.
It's a Charlie Chan picture, not a movie about a socialite.
So... will I see you later?
I don't think I should risk it, do you?
Good night, sir.
Henry.
Don't forget those.
They'll think you don't care.
-I took the wrong stairs.
-You better not be seen up here.
-I'd better go down.
-Why? There's no rush.
Since you're here now, what about a drink?
What are you doing?
Get off me!
Get off me!
What?
What's this?
What are you doing here?
I took the wrong staircase, I was waiting till the coast was clear.
Go down before anyone catches you.
Just a minute.
What?
Nothing.
-Do you want a drink?
-Sure.
What do you make of the place?
Is this a well-run house, would you say?
-Sir William be good to work for?
-No.
-How long have you been doing this?
-What?
Valeting.
About seven years.
I was a footman before that.
And working for Lord Stockbridge,
-is that a promotion?
-No.
I used to be with the Earl of Flintshire.
Then why did you move?
Because I felt like it.
Who's that?
That's my mother.
-Where's she live?
-She doesn't. I went to an orphanage.
That's right. Sorry.
What happened to her?
-What do you mean?
-Why did she die? Was she young?
Was it in childbirth?
You're not very curious, are you?
Yeah, she was young, she worked in a factory, she had me, and a little later, she died. End of story.
Why didn't you say she was a factory worker?
I didn't fancy discussing my private life with strangers.
Sorry I spoke out of turn, mate.
Didn't mean to offend you.
I'm not offended.
And don't call me "mate".
Well, I'll see you later.
I've got a date with a hot glass of milk.
I shouldn't worry about it.
It goes with the territory.
Look.
It's Mr. Novello.
And him sleeping downstairs.
I'm going to have to watch you, girl.
Her Ladyship says Mr.Weissman's a Hollywood producer.
-He does the Charlie Chan films.
-I like a fright in the cinema.
You could go with his valet.
He'd give you a fright.
Keep your eye on him.
I think he's a queer one.
He's not from Scotland for a start.
At least not any part of it that I know.
-What's Mrs. Nesbitt like?
-She's all right.
Feel a bit sorry for her.
-Of course, it never works.
-What never works?
When a man marries beneath him.
Hasn't the brains to carry it off.
It's romantic to marry for love.
Love? Not him.
He's a nasty piece of work.
"The Honourable Freddie Nesbitt".
That's a laugh.
He was after her father's money.
It was less than he thought.
Now it's spent, all he has is a wife he's ashamed of.
And he's lost his job.
Wants Miss Isobel to put in a word with Sir William.
-What's the matter?
-I never washed that shirt.
She's gonna kill me.
Do you think I could do it now?
Do you want me to go with you?
No, I'll be all right.
What are you doing down here?
I have to wash Lady Trentham's shirt for tomorrow.
There's a sink in the ironing room.
Is someone in there?
What are you doing here?
I had to rinse this shirt out.
You should've knocked, shouldn't you?
-Miss Trentham?
-I was washing a shirt
-for Her Ladyship.
-I hope you found all you required.
Does she have to have marmalade?
Dorothy made too little and we've run out of home-made.
I don't suppose she'd care for strawberry jam instead?
No, I thought not.
I wanted a word with Mrs. Wilson.
Tell Jennings we'll have the soup after the fourth drive tomorrow.
And tell Mrs. Croft to make sure it's hot.
It's been cold the last few weeks.
And more pepper to it.
Is that you?
Were you expecting someone else?
Don't coach your guns, even if they can't hit a barn door.
-Or tell 'em unless they ask.
-Lovely day.
-Jennings.
-I hope it hold. Enjoy the shoot.
Can a pheasant ever be dangerous?
-Dangerous?
-Do I worry about it attacking?
-Morning, sir.
-Right, draw your pegs.
-Morning, Jennings.
-Are you shooting today, sir?
I never shoot.
I'm starving.
Where have you been?
Sorry.
They always send up a good breakfast here.
I'll say that for Sylvia.
She not at all mean in that way.
Oh, dear.
Bought marmalade.
I call that very feeble.
One can't have everything.
Mary...
I won't wear that shirt after all.
The other one's warmer.
Yummy.
Yummy, yummy.
What, you're going shooting?
Mr. Weissman wants me to accompany him. Nothing wrong.
What for? You're not loading.
He hasn't got a gun.
-He might need something.
-What could he need?
We know the idea of service is offensive to you, George, but don't take it out on us.
Please forgive our ill manners,
Mr. Weissman.
He's got something to hide.
We all have something to hide,
Mr. Meredith.
Like to get changed now, miss?
-He won't do it.
-Who won't do what?
My father. He won't give Freddie a job.
I spoke to him last night and he said he'd think about it.
Now he says it isn't up to him.
-Why not?
-I don't know.
Something about why
Freddie was sacked, but I can't get a straight answer from either of them.
You've done your best.
Mr. Nesbitt can't ask for more than that, can he?
But he can. Much more!
He says he's going to tell him.
Do you think he will?
I don't know. He says Daddy will give him a job to keep him quiet.
-Will you say something?
-To Mr. Nesbitt?
To Daddy.
Why do you think
I can make a difference?
Will you?
You should wear your warm underwear today.
Nearly.
That's mine.
Oh God, it's on its way.
Damn!
Bloody gun's no good.
I told you not to bring this.
Blast!
I think I pricked that one.
I'm pretty sure...
Bugger.
Blast it!
Damn!
-Are you all right, sir?
-No, I'm not all right.
-Where the hell did that come from?
-lt's nicked you.
God, it's nicked me.
Where did that...?
Whose the cretin that did that?
Find Strutt. Ask if he knows who's responsible and to send the gun back to the bloody house.
Right you are, sir.
-Everyone knows we're desperate.
-There you are.
Did you find one?
-Well?
-Don't look at me.
If I so much as open my mouth, it'll make things worse.
I've already tried.
Jennings says the cars are ready.
Goody. I'm starving.
I can't just let him down.
What are you wearing?
Why? Don't you like it?
You bought it.
Did I? How extraordinary of me.
Come on, better get going.
-Where's that wretched Mabel?
-Has anyone checked her outfit?
She's probably in black velvet
-with a feather in her hair.
-She looks perfectly normal.
-Don't be a snob, Aunt Constance.
-Me? I haven't a snobbish bone.
Mr. Meredith, is Mr. Stockbridge in?
Search me.
Sorry to disturb you. I was making my routine inspection.
How are you settling in with Lord Stockbridge?
Sorry?
How are you settling in with Lord Stockbridge?
I know you haven't been with him for long.
Not long, no.
Smoking isn't allowed up here.
I hope you have everything to make His Lordship comfortable.
I hope we haven't forgotten anything.
I can't believe you forget much,
Mrs. Wilson.
No, not much.
Well, I'll leave you to your book.
You should be more selective about the people you invite.
I've got a good appetite.
Terribly muddy here. Do watch.
Do go in and have a drink.
It's a bloody awful thing to have happened.
-Louisa.
-Oh, I say.
Two inches to my right,
I would've been dead.
-What's happened to your ear?
-Some idiot shot me.
-I was a terrible shot.
-Did you have fun?
You don't realise how serious this is.
Of course I do.
-Can't you get your sisters to help?
-You think I haven't tried?
-You know what they're like.
-They don't care if we go under, as long as their dressmakers are busy and dinner's served on time.
Wait, there's a queue here.
Shut the door, for heaven's sake!
Don't worry, it's only
Lewis and Dorothy.
If any men are found up here, they get sacked on the spot.
Worse luck.
So you're a convent girl?
Or is that Presbyterian modesty?
-ls the water hot?
-Not really.
No. Won't be till the guns get back.
I better get in yours.
Her Ladyship says Sir William loves his shooting.
Yeah. Can't hit a barn door but he does love it. It's sweet.
Elsie.
Last night...
What?
No, I shouldn't say.
Yes, you should. What?
Well.. when I went down to wash that shirt,
I think I saw him in the ironing room.
-With one of the kitchen maids.
-That wouldn't have been him.
I think it was.
He came down the passage a minute later and I don't see...
No, it wasn't him.
-You weren't serious last night?
-I'm afraid I was, old boy.
I was going to tell you next week.
I don't think you grasp what it'll do to the project.
-lt can't be as black as all that.
-Yes it bloody well is.
I'm sorry to hear that, but business is business.
-I'm not a charity commissioner.
-I'm begging you.
Dammit.
Oh, dear.
-I'll clear that up.
-I'm sorry.
Meanwhile I'll get the glass under the table.
Have you got a cloth?
A cloth... We'll clean that at the house for you, sir.
I borrowed it from Lewis.
I've also been frightened to death.
Perfectly all right, sir.
You just leave this.
You know how you said
Sir William could have his pick between Lady Sylvia and Lady Stockbridge?
I asked Her Ladyship about it and she said they cut cards for him.
-No!
-I can't believe it either.
Do you suppose it was a joke?
I wouldn't be too sure.
You know what I heard?
-Just listen to me.
-What?
Why do we spend our lives living through them?
Look at poor old Lewis.
Her mother's heart attack'd mean less to her than Lady Sylvia's farts.
You must know.
You can't fool me.
I don't look for discretion in a maid.
-Except with my own secrets.
-I don't know much, my Lady. but apparently he counted on
Sir William for an investment and guaranteed his interest, whatever that means.
Anyway, Barnes his valet said he wanted to leave at once, but Lady Lavinia persuaded him to stay until tomorrow, to make less of a thing of it.
Thank heavens. Lewis told me
-you were wearing white.
-She's mad. I never wear white.
I thought it was a little odd.
By the way, don't rub him up tonight.
-I don't know what you mean.
-You know exactly what I mean.
He's in a filthy mood with everyone.
He's talking about stopping your allowance.
But it's for life!
That was settled. He can't.
Just you watch him.
He's spoiling for a fight, so don't give him one.
Now that, you can be discreet about.
Thank you.
Isn't it pretty here?
The house has such a lovely position.
The best view is from the old water tower.
You might walk up there tomorrow.
Do you really have to go back to London?
I'm afraid so, Raymond.
When you're ruined, there's so much to do.
Yes, there is, isn't there?
Moan, moan, moan.
Anyone care for a game of bridge
-after dinner?
-Yes, I wouldn't mind.
Who else? Louisa, how about you?
I don't think so. I've rather gone off cards.
I've never been lucky with them.
Me too.
Mr. Weissman.
Yes?
-Tell us about your film.
-Sure.
It's called
"Charlie Chan in London".
-lt's a detective story.
-Set in London?
Not really.
Most of it takes place at a shooting party in a country house. Like this one.
A murder at night.
A lot of guests for the weekend.
Everyone's a suspect.
That sort of thing.
How horrid.
Who turns out to have done it?
I couldn't tell you.
That would spoil it for you.
But none of us will see it.
Are you making it here?
No, we'll shoot it in Hollywood.
On the back lot.
But since I was in England
I thought I'd do a little research on country living and Ivor was kind enough to arrange it for me.
No, William arranged it for you.
Are you interested in films, sir?
Not likely.
Why shouldn't I be interested?
You don't know what
I'm interested in.
You're interested in money and fiddling with your guns,
-but anything else and I'm stumped.
-That is not fair. Billy...
Elsie.
Elsie, what's...?
It's not as if I didn't know.
So we can all play bridge.
-All playing?
-Who's going to play bridge?
Where's Rupert?
-Rupert?
-Coming.
I heard Lady Sylvia spoke out of turn.
-What'll happen to Elsie?
-Lucky if they don't boot her out
-before morning.
-You should've seen it.
She has been here a long time.
Shall I tell you what that means to them? Bugger all.
Please. There are ladies present.
Where exactly is
-Sir William now?
-The library. He won't come out.
Dorothy.
Mr. Meredith, may I ask what is going on?
George, join me in the drawing room as soon as possible.
-Mr. Probert, take them downstairs.
-Certainly.
Dorothy, I'm surprised at you.
Come along, ladies.
Is it true then?
Has Elsie really been sacked?
-Lady Trentham.
-Well, luck of the draw.
-I think I'd like to...
-Darling, we've just cut.
-Allow me.
-Thank you so much.
Am I awful if I ask you to play something to cheer us up?
-No, of course not.
-Thank you.
I've booked the first passage home and I'll be living on the phone till I set sail and I have to be in London tomorrow, so if you'd prefer to stay,
I can take a train.
-I'll give you a lift.
-Thank you.
You're providing a lot of entertainment for nothing.
I'm used to it.
Excuse me.
Somewhere there's another land...
Darling, you're not going to watch over my shoulder?
You'll put me off.
...that little place we know.
Innocence...
Do you think he'll be as long as he usually is?
-Anyway...
-I think he's rather wonderful.
Wonderful.
I have only seen one.
We shall never find that lovely land of Might-Have-Been.
I shall never be your king, nor you shall be my queen.
Days may pass and years may pass and seas may lie between...
-We shouldn't be doing this.
-Come on.
Sometimes, on the rarest nights, comes the vision...
I don't know. It's just...
-How could she let him touch her?
-Sounds like you don't like him.
You'd be surprised.
-All right, surprise me.
-Maybe I will.
I saw him in "The Lodger", but I've never heard him sing in person.
Hope that plays her tune alone, love that conquers pain and death.
Will you excuse me a minute?
-You don't need my help?
-No.
Shall I ever be your king?
Oh, my Lord!
Days may pass or years may pass and seas may lie between.
Shall we ever find our lovely land?
It seems much more than background music somehow.
Ivor, darling, it was lovely.
Thank you.
I seem to be the victim of a cruel jest.
It dogs my footsteps with the girl I love the best.
Anthony.
It's the commander!
-Oh, excuse me.
-Good evening, sir.
-No, carry on.
-Yes, sir.
My car will meet her and her mother comes too.
What do you want?
-Brought you some coffee.
-lf I wanted it, I'd have rung.
Leave that. Give me some whisky.
And her brother comes too.
I thought you might need a drink.
And some company.
That's very kind of you.
Give me just a sec.
Lovely, long repertoire.
-Where's Anthony?
-Washing his hands, I suppose.
Managed to escape this, didn't he?
He hasn't gone to bother
William again, has he?
I can give you the starlight, love unchanging and true...
We've run out of milk.
Won't be a moment.
Desperate for a fag.
...pools of shimmering blue.
All that I can be, all you ask of me, music in spring, flowers for a king, all these I bring for you.
When I was young, my foolish fancies...
Where's Mr. Weissman's man?
He's missing the music.
What are you doing?
Dorothy, get back to work.
Excuse me... but Dorothy's under my jurisdiction as well, and I say she can listen to a spot of music if she likes.
-Excuse me, where's the telephone?
-Sorry, sir.
It's just over there.
...pools of shimmering blue.
Call and I can be all you ask of me.
Music in spring, flowers for a king, all these I bring to you.
Don't encourage him.
He'll just go on and on.
In BC 33, ah me, that's a dash long time ago, there lived a Roman hero who had shaken hands with Nero.
You're still here.
-I thought that...
-Appearances can be deceptive.
Elsie.
Good night.
So if you wonder what a duke should be, just you take another look at me.
When old King Canute was buying fruit one day, so runs the tale, a young convicted felon brought him a juicy melon and was then released from jail.
This noble youth, to tell the truth, sailed right away to sea and the Duke of Malta's daughter brought up his shaving water and the grand result was me.
So if you wonder what a duke should be, just take another look at me.
I'm doubty,
I'm gouty,
I'm wonderful to see.
All my people, upon my soul it's true look on Noah as a parvenu.
You can search your family tree but you'll never find a duke like me.
If you wonder what a duke could be, take another look at me.
I'm doubty, I'm gouty,
I'm wonderful to see.
All my people, upon my soul it's true, look on Noah as a parvenu.
You can search your family tree, but you'll never find...
So he gave you that for your birthday, did he?
He gave you that for your birthday, William did?
I've got a call booked for California.
California.
We're both undoubtedly sane.
We're not so horribly plain.
Something is wrong, but who can tell us what.
-Freddie, we gave up on you.
-No, please, sit down.
We waited as long as we could.
-ls William still in the library?
-Where have you been?
-I suppose...
-Where could he be?
None of your bloody business.
-I could try and fetch him.
-Would you?
He's always preferred you to me.
Yes, I'd be delighted.
Goodness.
Today is not my day.
If that's what you call a moment,
I'd like to see when you take a real break.
Here, did yours as well.
-Before the rush starts.
-Thank you.
Why isn't it you?
Why must we miss a chance like this?
-Where have you been?
-lt's fine, it's fine.
William?
God, Bill.
Come here, you horrid dirty thing.
Bill.
You've got lips for me, the hips for me, the feet for me, and the beat for me.
Dear God!
Louisa!
Isobel!
Isobel!
George?
Excuse me, sir.
Jennings.
Excuse me, madam.
Oh, dear.
-Stand back, Johnny.
-Give her some air.
Could somebody get a glass of water?
-Keep everybody out of this room.
-Yes, certainly, sir.
Now Louisa, do sit and be quiet.
Bennett.
Mummy.
-Just stay there.
-ls she all right?
-Everything's fine.
-Sylvia...
Mummy.
You can tell Mr. Warner...
-Excuse me, I need that phone.
-Excuse me, I'm on the telephone.
I'm on a call to California.
Could you connect me with the police station, please?
I'm looking for a realistic
Charlie Chan movie.
This isn't out of the question.
We should try.
We can't do the same shit over and over again.
Alan Mowbray. I like that.
These people look like him.
They're tall, don't say much, and have fucking British accents.
They talk like they're from England.
-Evening. We've been expecting you.
-This is Constable Dexter, I'm...
-You must be the police.
-Yes, I'm Inspector Thom...
I'm Lady Sylvia McCordle.
We haven't moved him.
Everyone's in the red room.
Like to come straight through?
-Certainly.
-He's just an American staying here.
I'll tell you who we are and we can leave you with William.
Yes, indeed. I'm Inspector...
-Lady Trentham.
-Yes, the Countess of Trentham.
I served with your husband on a committee...
My brother-in-law Lord Stockbridge,
Lady Stockbridge.
Jennings, please would you remove that vile animal.
Mrs. Nesbitt, Mr. Nesbitt.
Ivor Novello, but I'm sure needs no introduction. No, wait.
Would you like to speak to the servants tonight?
He ought to speak to Probert.
Tell him to come up.
-Certainly.
-Where was I?
-lsobel McCordle, my daughter.
-Chan's in London, not California.
We have rewrites of the cockney maid part and she runs in and says all these things.
I'm here. They don't talk.
The butlers and maids, they stand. They serve.
What about Claudette Colbert?
She sounds British.
Is she affected or British?
Dorothy, would you take...?
Come on, spit it out.
-The police would like to see you.
-Me?
No, Mrs. Croft, Mr. Probert.
Me?
Why?
I don't know what I can tell them.
George, see if anything more is required in the red room.
I don't see the point in the rest of you waiting up.
What about me, Mr. Jennings?
You can go as soon as the police release you. Some time tomorrow.
Until then, you can stay in your room.
I'm not contagious, you know.
Nobody's going anywhere.
Those with remaining duties, see to them quickly.
Otherwise, good night, everyone.
Fat old oik.
-Mr. Jennings.
-Yes, Mr. Weissman.
I have a confession to make.
I think it's clear the valet did it.
No, because the valet has access to everybody.
No, the valet isn't the butler.
There's one butler and lots of valets.
He takes care of people.
He's in their rooms at night.
The valet could easily have done it.
Pull yourself together, Mr. Probert.
Be patient.
They'll be along in a minute.
Couldn't I just make him a bit more comfortable, sir?
-Have a heart, Inspector.
-lt wouldn't be wise, sir.
We shouldn't have to wait much longer now.
I don't think it would do any harm. Go on.
See that's why we have rules and regulations.
What is it, Dexter?
There doesn't seem to be much blood, sir.
-ls that everything, my Lord?
-Yes. Thank you, Parks.
-You should try to sleep.
-lt's so unfair.
Nobody liked him.
Stop snivelling. Anyone would think you were ltalian.
Christ.
Will you let me help you?
No, I can manage.
-Then I'll say good night.
-No, wait.
Thank you, my Lady.
What is it?
Please tell me you haven't come with condolences.
No, I was just wondering
-if you wanted some com...
-What?
I said I was just wondering if you wanted some company.
I suppose life must go on.
Unhook me.
No, there's another one.
You'll never get it off like that.
I'm sorry, for everything.
Don't feel sorry for me.
Pity that poor Dorothy.
She's got the early morning teas and the breakfast trays... then get Miss Isobel down, if there's anything in black.
She needs your sympathy.
I'm well out of it.
I would think Miss Isobel would stay in bed tomorrow.
Unmarried girls don't have breakfast trays.
Not in this house.
I wish I could help.
Well, you can't.
George says Mr. Novello was in on it. And Sir William.
The point is, that Henry Denton, he's an actor.
An actor?
He's playing a butler in the next Charlie Chan.
I'd say the joke was on Lady Sylvia.
I hope Mr. Jennings wasn't his model, or he'd be too squiffy to remember his lines.
Mrs. Croft, isn't it?
I wonder if I could have a few words with you.
I'm Inspector Thom...
I haven't got time for this.
I'm doing the breakfasts.
It won't take much time.
Perhaps you have a room.
You better come to my room.
Bertha, I'm leaving you in charge.
Dorothy, make sure the menus are on Her Ladyship's tray.
Get that filthy dog out of here.
Honestly, these days the countryside is more dangerous than Piccadilly.
Why a silver pantry knife?
It doesn't make sense.
He must have forgotten to bring one.
Think of what they have to carry about.
All those jemmies and torches and skeleton keys.
It's a miracle anyone ever gets burgled.
It's glacial in here.
Get my fur, will you?
Anyway, it wasn't in the silver pantry.
It went missing yesterday.
Obviously William had it.
When the fellow surprised him, there it was, handy as you like.
Are any of the others getting up for breakfast?
Lady Lavinia may be.
That settles it. Come back at 8:30. I'll get dressed.
It's the greatest bore, of course.
But I don't want to miss anything.
When I came back last night,
-I found this on my table.
-What is it?
"This is your final warning.
If I've not received an offer..."
Freddie". What a stupid idiot!
At least he's off your back.
No one will give him a job to shut up.
He's quite a bonny lad.
What's he up to these days?
He's dead.
I don't know what I can tell you.
Shouldn't you be looking for signs of a break in?
I understand that no one has served Sir William longer than you have.
I better be off.
Might not see you again.
I'm only staying till the police give the nod.
But Elsie, you're not in any difficulty?
Apart from having no home and no job?
No, there's no worries there.
Yes, I was forgetting.
You were much cleverer than I was.
You'll be fine.
What will Lady Sylvia do?
I'd set up in London as a glamorous widow with all the gentlemen chasing me for my money.
I wouldn't. I grew up in London.
-ls that where the orphanage was?
-On the edge. Isleworth.
And don't you get homesick?
Not if you never had a home.
Heard about Weissman's valet?
-What about him?
-Turns out he's a fraud.
-He isn't Scottish at all.
-I could've told you that.
-Who is he then?
-ls he the murderer?
Worse than that. He's an actor.
Yes, I want you to wake him up.
How else do I talk to him?
Yes, right. What did he say?
He's talking about
Clara Bow again? Listen.
Tell Sheehan I think
Clara Bow is a nice person, and I don't want her in the fucking movie.
This bastard's death may have saved my bacon.
For God's sake, be quiet.
What the matter with you?
Arthur.
-Are these tomatoes?
-Yes, my Lady.
That's exactly what I want.
-Good morning.
-Morning, dear.
Have you heard? That frightful inspector won't let anyone leave.
Another day of Weissman shouting down the telephone.
He has some work problems in Los Angeles.
I must say he conducts his affairs very oddly.
Coming downstairs, I thought
I was in a Marseilles bar.
Excuse me. I'm expecting a really important phone call.
-Would you get me when it comes?
-Very good, sir.
Thank you. And I'd like tomato and eggs.
Of course, sir, but... perhaps you would prefer to choose for yourself, sir?
What do you mean, like cafeteria style?
The Englishman is never waited on at breakfast.
Really? That's interesting, because an American is.
I'm gonna make a note of that.
-Good morning.
-Morning.
I'd like some coffee, Jennings.
There it is.
You haven't made a lot of friends here.
Good. Good morning, ladies, gents.
I wonder, excuse me...
-Will Lady Sylvia be down soon?
-I shouldn't think so.
She has breakfast in her room, then usually goes for a ride.
But she won't be doing that this morning, will she?
Oh, I see.
In that case, Lady Trentham,
I wonder if you'd be kind enough to join us for some questions?
If you wish, Inspector.
I won't be much help.
But on a day like this we all have to pull our weight.
Mr. Denton made a chump out of Mr. Jennings.
Never mind that.
Did you hear about Sir William?
Apparently he wasn't stabbed.
I mean, he was, but that's not why he died.
He was poisoned.
That's what killed him.
Inspector told Mrs. Croft.
They don't know why the killer stabbed him but he was dead.
That's why there was no blood.
Dead bodies don't bleed.
Trust Sir William to be murdered twice.
He wasn't murdered, not that sort of murder.
Some ruffian broke in thinking the library was empty.
Sir William surprised him and paid the price for it.
-And very tragic it is too.
-I can't see that.
I mean... ruffians don't poison people and then stab the corpses.
Apart from anything else, they're usually in a hurry to get away, aren't they?
What are you suggesting?
Nothing, just...
Just what?
It looks like Sir William was killed deliberately.
No wonder they won't let us go.
Tough luck on anyone who's got secrets to hide.
Now they've cancelled the shooting, muggins here has to pull a luncheon out of the hat.
-ls Her Ladyship back yet?
-No.
Then she'll take what she gets.
Why would anyone kill Sir William?
He wasn't exactly
Father Christmas.
Get on with your work.
And take that filthy dog out.
He made a few enemies in his time.
-"Enemies"? When?
-ls this before the war?
When you were a factory worker?
I was never a factory worker.
I was a cook in one of his factories.
He had two in Isleworth and two in Twickenham, all full of girls, so you can imagine.
Weren't factory girls risky?
Suppose they had complained?
Who to exactly?
What if they got in trouble?
-What sort of trouble?
-Take these. Whites only.
Didn't happen very often.
When it did, he'd arrange to have it adopted.
What if you didn't want it adopted?
-Say you wanted to keep it?
-Then you lost your job.
Take my word, he was a hard-hearted, randy old sod.
-Come in, I'm Inspector...
-This is all too tiresome and absurd.
He's making the most dreadful fuss.
I'd like to ask the young lady some questions.
I'm not leaving, if that's what you think.
Does it bother you if Lady Trentham stays?
-Why should it?
-Sir, someone's traipsed a load of mud in here.
Not now, Dexter.
I understood there was some difficulty between
-Sir William and your employer.
-This is too vulgar.
I wasn't aware of that.
They got on well.
-You were not conscious...?
-There's a broken coffee cup.
They have people to clear these things up.
On with your job.
So you were not aware of trouble over the matter of an allowance?
An allowance, I might add, that Sir William's death has now made secure.
What allowance would that be, sir?
There you are.
Have you got enough light?
Black on black. We don't want you going blind.
They've got to be done.
Outside staff need them for the funeral.
Sorry this business with Elsie has landed you with so much work.
That's what comes of being reliable.
Never mind me.
Mr. Jennings... have you spoken to the police again?
Not yet, no.
I suppose they have to ask their questions, don't they?
Well, yes.
Will they be talking to all of us?
I shouldn't think so.
I'll leave you to it then.
Mr. Jennings.
You know I'd say anything you want me to.
-What?
-Anything
I don't care if it'll help you.
You've only to ask.
Let me pour you a cup of tea.
Yes, thank you. Mind putting the milk in afterwards?
I don't know what came over me.
I usually put it in afterwards,
-but on that occasion...
-Sir.
Not now, thank you.
So sorry.
Mrs. Thompson prefers the milk in first, so I... get used to pouring for her.
Some nonsense about bacteria. You know what women are like, well, wives.
She's a funny old... Sugar?
No, thank you.
-Mr. Parks.
-Robert.
Robert, then.
It's just... last night when you said you'd surprise me, you didn't mean anything by it, did you?
Why? Don't you like surprises?
Mr. Stockbridge.
I assume you're all aware that Mr. Denton played a trick on us by posing as a valet.
Since Sir William was aware of it, it's not for anyone to criticise it.
However, it leaves us with some adjustments for this evening.
Arthur, you'll dress Mr. Weissman.
That leaves Mr. Novello.
I don't want to ask you,
Mr. Probert.
-I don't mind.
-You've got enough on your plate.
-I'll do him if you like.
-That's very generous of you.
-I could always do it myself.
-No.
-lt's no trouble for a night or two.
-Good.
Splendid. That's settled then.
I think we can leave Mr. Denton to dress himself.
"The bastard's death may have saved my bacon".
-What did he mean by that?
-lsn't it obvious?
Is it?
Perhaps the investment
Sir William had agreed would have to be paid now. Sir.
What about the low shot that nearly killed him?
-Sir.
-What is it?
We haven't dusted those things for fingerprints yet.
Good.
-Might the shot have been intended?
-lt nearly took his ear off.
Thank you.
You've been most helpful.
Ask Commander Meredith to join us now.
You won't tell him what I said, Inspector Thomas?
Thompson! Never mind.
Just go and fetch him, please.
Sir.
-We've only got this.
-Mine hasn't go any black here.
We've got some new ones.
-You're a lech.
-George.
They're coming in a minute.
The dressing bell's just gone.
I'm going out of my mind.
I've read my magazines twice.
Get something from the library, even if it's "Horse and Hound".
Well, we are honoured.
In case you've forgotten, this is the servants' area.
Yours is at the top of the stairs behind that door.
Barnes, I just wanted to explain.
No explanation necessary,
Mr. Denton.
If you'll excuse me, some of us have real work to do.
-Come on, Arthur.
-The accent was a dead give away.
-I was just having fun.
-Enjoy your fun in the drawing room.
They're afraid you'll repeat things, be indiscreet.
But I'm very discreet.
I'm known in Hollywood for it.
My discretion.
-Tell Rupert, he won't give money.
-You misunderstand me.
And mummy wouldn't pay five pounds to save me.
Poor darling, come here.
Don't think I'm enjoying this.
All I wanted was a job.
I'll give you a cheque after dinner.
-Have you seen my man Parks?
-No, I've been with the police.
You look as if you've had rather a pasting.
They kept on about the low shot yesterday and wouldn't let it go.
Obviously I told them it was nothing to do with me.
I'm sure, but another time try to be less greedy.
-Parks.
-What?
Attend to Mr. Novello first.
I want a word with Her Ladyship.
Very well, my Lord.
-What?
-I saw you.
Of course it was an accident.
It's hard for a short man like you to gauge the height of the birds.
Mr. Meredith.
You haven't seen Commander Meredith anywhere, have you?
He's not downstairs or in his room.
I washed and dressed him.
Not my fault he can't find his way.
-I didn't mean to disturb you.
-No, please.
I'm just trying some of your jam.
I must be in your way.
No, no bother.
What one is that, sir?
It's raspberry, October '31 .
You might like to try
-the strawberry one.
-Was there strawberry?
Are you all right, sir?
I've just been with the inspector and I feel a little bruised.
Why is it, would you say, that some people seem to get whatever they want in life?
Everything they touch turns to gold.
Whereas others can strive and strive... and have nothing?
Do you believe in luck?
Do you believe some men are lucky and some men just aren't,
-and nothing they can do about it?
-I believe in love.
Not just getting it, giving it.
As long as you can love somebody, whether or not they love you, then it's worth it.
That's a good answer.
I'd better go.
They must've finished dinner.
Thank you.
I thought the wine was frightful tonight. Vile.
Jennings, old boy.
I'll have a bourbon.
We don't have bourbon.
Ordinary Scotch or single malt.
Ordinary for me.
I'm just an American.
This is not an ideal time, but I'd like to see you again.
Mabel is so clever to travel light.
Why wear a different frock every night?
-We're not in a fashion parade.
-No, and I wouldn't want to be.
-Excuse me.
-Difficult colour, green.
-What did she say?
-Very tricky.
-lsobel.
-Excuse me.
This tune used to make me cry.
I promise you I can pay you back every penny.
I must say... your guests have more comfortable beds than servants.
Excuse me.
What did Isobel give you?
What did Isobel give to you?
Tell me!
Ivor... would you play something cheerful?
We're all quite emotional enough as it is.
Excuse me.
Freddie, stop all your lies!
If you don't give it to me now,
I'll scream this house down.
If you don't believe me, try me.
Where have you been?
You've missed dinner.
We can organise a tray.
Try buying yourself a new frock with that.
-We gave up, Louisa.
-Right.
I'm so sorry.
No coffee, but I'll have...
-I apologise. I can't imagine...
-Son of a bitch, it was on purpose.
Shall I fetch you a towel?
-Arthur...
-Oh dear.
Clean this up.
They fished parts of her body from the Thames.
-Some more tea, Constable?
-I'll take that, Bertha.
-Well, go on.
-No head, no hands.
What's the point?
Won't it all be chucked out?
I'll know I've left it in order.
That's all I can do now.
-Yeah, but he won't...
-Leave him alone.
George had his revenge on Denton.
Hot coffee in the lap.
-Poor Mr. Denton.
-I'm glad I caught you.
I assume the inspector won't keep everyone beyond tomorrow.
-He hasn't spoken to some servants.
-Dexter. We're going home.
I was asking how long our guests will be staying.
Mrs. Croft has meals to arrange, and one of the maids
-is anxious to get away.
-No need to worry about that.
I've no interest in the servants, only those connected to the dead man.
I see. Thank you.
Do you have a light, Inspector?
Yes.
I think we can let them all go home.
Got their addresses after all.
Dexter will be here tomorrow to confirm that.
But don't worry, it doesn't end here.
Whoever he is, I'll find him.
I always do.
Inspector. Matches.
Yes. Thank you.
-Sir, it's this way.
-Yes, yes.
There's a way out that way, but we'll take your way.
Beg your pardon, just collecting
Mr. Nesbitt's shoes.
These stairs are the easiest way up.
-Thank you...
-George, sir.
George.
You naughty, naughty girl.
Poor bloke.
We were in the ironing room and a visiting maid came in.
He must think
I did it on purpose.
-You won't tell, will you?
-I won't tell.
You're lucky you're in kitchen and not under Mrs. Wilson.
She'd have sniffed you out without my help.
Do you think Sir William was in love with you?
No, I was a bit of fun, that's all.
And you?
No, I didn't love him.
I didn't mind him, but...
I liked the way he'd talk.
He only talked to me because he was sick of her, but I liked it. He said...
I could be what I wanted as long as I wanted it enough.
You're not sorry then,
-even the way things turned out?
-No, I'm not sorry.
Time for a change. Who knows?
Could be the making of me.
What did he use to day?
Carpe Diem. Seize the day.
What's up?
What did I say?
Where are you going?
Who is it?
What are you doing?
Get back to your room.
You don't want to be caught here.
You didn't really dislike him, did you?
Not really.
At least, not enough to kill him.
You can't have.
You didn't know him.
You'd have to hate him, and why would you?
Can't a man hate his own father?
Sir William McCordle... was my father.
He didn't know it, but he was.
-You said you were an orphan.
-I said I grew up in an orphanage.
Before I left, a group of us broke in and took our files.
I found my birth certificate: mother's name, father unknown.
I found this photograph.
And they had my admission form.
I was two days old.
Guess who brought me to the door.
-That doesn't mean he...
-Yes, it does.
I found out she worked in one of his factories.
She wasn't the only one.
The authorities didn't know or want to. They took his babies and took his money.
What happened to your mother?
She died.
Is that why you took the job with Lord Stockbridge?
To get to Sir William?
-To poison him?
-I didn't poison him.
-What?
-I didn't poison him.
Then you didn't kill him!
Did you stab him?
Even if you did, he was already dead.
Whoever did it must've known.
You can't stab a corpse and not know.
When was the last time you stabbed a corpse?
Who really murdered him then?
I don't know.
I don't care.
I've wanted to do that ever since
I first set eyes on you.
Mr. Jennings.
Wilson, Mrs. Wilson...
Dorothy. I need your help.
Of course, Mrs. Wilson.
Are you all right?
No-one must see him like this.
-Mr. Jennings, come on.
-Come on, Mr. Jennings.
-All right. Bed time.
-No. This way, Mr. Jennings.
Bedtime now. Come on.
-My reference?
-You'll get your reference.
Into bed now.
Take his trousers off, would you Dorothy?
I couldn't do that,
Mrs. Wilson.
Take his trousers off.
Come on, girl.
Is Lady Sylvia?
She's not here, is he?
-Who is it?
-I'm ever so sorry, sir.
-Sorry for what?
-I'm not meant to wake you.
Why does everyone treat me like one of these stupid snobs?
I spent half the week downstairs with all of you.
You can't be on both teams at once.
It's official.
They're off after breakfast.
Thank God for that
What about him?
He's going too. As soon as he's seen Mr. Jennings.
Are you all right?
You sound a bit funny.
Just too many fags.
They'll be the death of me.
Here, you finish it.
-Did you tell the police that stuff?
-I did not. Sorry if I shock you, but the plain fact is he only got what he deserved.
There, I've said it.
I can't stop thinking about those girls.
-The ones that got, you know.
-I'm not surprised, the way you carry on.
Just see it never happens to you.
No, and even if it did, I couldn't part with my baby for a job.
I'm very glad to hear it.
Who is it?
Don't mind me.
-lnspector asked me to take a look.
-ls the inspector with you?
We're working from the station. See if we can't manage things better from here.
What about the poison?
Have you traced that at least?
Hardly.
This house is a poisoner's paradise.
We've found the stuff in practically... every room.
Unfortunately, no one's got a police record.
Except you, of course.
Perhaps the butler did it.
I had a brother who was a conscientious objector.
He did a bit of time, too.
Do they know upstairs you refused to fight and were sent to prison?
I'd forget about it if I were you.
Not everyone's cut out to be a soldier.
Did you remember the others boxes?
-Everything's in the car.
-Wonderful.
Darling. Here I come.
-I can't wait to leave this place.
-Let's go.
What are we supposed to do now?
Freddie, do try to stop being so frightened all the time.
-Have I made a fool of myself?
-Maybe, but you're my fool.
Anthony, I just...
I wanted to remind you of the conversation we had the other night.
Perhaps this is not the most appropriate moment, but when you get the Sudan you'll need an expert, and I'm your man.
Did you ask her?
-No.
-I think that's a good thing.
Servants' hall gossip says
-it won't be till her mother dies.
-Jeremy, you are so...
If that's the case, it's too long for you to wait.
You can do better.
Have you checked your room?
You mustn't leave anything behind.
I'm sure mummy's going to sell the house.
Isobel.
Isobel! Isobel!
Kent's taking over the studio.
He loves Charlie Chan and he hates Winfield Sheehan.
No more rewrites and I can cast whoever I like.
-That was painless, wasn't it?
-No it wasn't.
Not for me, anyway.
Careful. Watch yourself.
Do they know?
-No.
-Do you think they might notice?
I don't care.
Hey, you there.
Where are you going?
To the station.
You want a ride to London?
Sure, why not?
-Hop in.
-Thank you.
There you go.
Good luck.
-Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
-That gives me room for maneuver.
Keep your hands to yourself.
You Brits don't have a sense of humor, do you?
We do if something's funny, sir.
-Mr. Jennings.
-Be quick about.
Honestly, it's getting so expensive leaving something for the housemaids, one might as well take a suite at the Ritz.
What about William's little maid?
I never saw her again after dinner.
Elsie?
-She's gone.
-lt's a pity really.
It was a good idea to have someone whose sorry he's dead.
-Did you have a nice ride?
-I feel guilty. Everyone's gone.
Apart from you and Louisa.
Why don't you stay for luncheon?
No. Best be off.
Leave you in peace.
You will telephone about the funeral plans?
-Don't come if it's a bore.
-Of course I'm coming.
-What will you do with this place?
-I don't know.
Will you keep it?
It's so difficult.
Does one really want the bother nowadays?
I could shut it up and make a decision when my head stops spinning.
Mrs. Wilson could manage till you're ready.
She could manage all right.
Let's not worry about that.
She'll get rid of the wretched Mrs. Croft.
-Why are those two such enemies?
-I don't know.
They were both workers in one of William's sweatshops.
Mrs. Croft was the senior then.
She was the cook.
And Mrs. Wilson, a lowly factory worker.
Now that she's gone up, poor Crofty can't abide it.
Usual rubbish.
Was there ever a Mr. Wilson?
-I can't imagine it.
-Nor could I.
Although, funnily enough,
I think there must have been.
Really? You amaze me.
She might have changed her name, but when she worked with William she was something different.
Parks or Parker or Parkinson, or something like that.
Come in.
-You're busy.
-I was checking the linen rotation.
If left it to the maids, twenty sheets would be rags.
Why did you do it?
How did you know it was him?
-The name or the photograph.
-Yes, the photograph.
It's a miracle that survived.
His mother put it into his blanket.
I suppose she wanted him to have something of hers.
Does he know what happened to her?
They said she died just after he was born.
She didn't die, she gave him away.
He promised the boy would be adopted, that he knew the family.
Turns out we all clung to that dream.
All us girls.
A better start in life for our children.
And he was dumping them in some God-forsaken place.
And I believed him.
I suppose it was easier that way.
My sister never forgave me.
-Your sister?
-Mrs. Croft. She's my sister.
Didn't you know?
She kept hers.
It was very hard for her.
She lost her job and the baby died.
Scarlet fever.
I made him take her back.
She never forgave me for that either.
But even if Robert is your son, how did you know that he meant to harm his father?
What gift separates a good servant from the others?
It's the gift of anticipation.
I am a good servant.
I'm better. I'm the best.
I'm the perfect servant.
When they're hungry, food is ready.
When they're tired, a bed.
I know before they know it.
Are you going to tell him?
Why? What purpose would it possibly serve?
-What if they find out what happened?
-Not much a crime to stab a dead man, is it?
They can never touch him.
That's important. His life.
And your life?
I'm the perfect servant.
I have no life.
-Her Ladyship's leaving now, miss.
-Thank you, George.
You should go now, Miss Trentham.
-Here you are.
-Most generous. Thank you.
Let us know if there's anything we can do to help.
-Are you going to go away at all?
-Not once the shooting's finished.
-Thank you for your help last night.
-You don't have to thank me.
I would kill for Mr. Jennings if I had to.
Don't cry, Jane, they'll hear you.
Come on.
You did what you felt was best for him at the time.
I see that now.
Lizzie...
I've lost him.
I've lost him.
He'll never know me now.
-My boy.
-At least your boy's alive.
He's alive.
That's what matters.
-So, you're leaving.
-Yes.
Goodbye then.
-Goodbye.
-Parks.
Goodbye, my dear. Chin up.
Heavens, what a relief to be going.
It'll take me a month to recover.
Mary, Mary dear...
Do you think if there's a trial I might have to testify in court? Or you?
I can't think of anything worse.
Imagine a person being hanged because of what one said in court.
I know. And what purpose could it possibly serve anyway?
Goodbye.
Somewhere there's another land different from this world below, far more mercifully planned than the cruel place we know.
Innocence and peace are there all is good that is desired, faces there are always fair love grows never old nor tired.
We shall never find that lovely land of Might-Have-Been,
I can never be your king nor you can be my queen.
Days my pass, and years my pass and seas may lie between.
We shall never find that lovely land of Might-Have-Been.
{2195}{2251}I'm a girl with a problem.
{2257}{2293}It's not like I don't know better.
{2346}{2388}I seem to have gotten involved...
{2393}{2473}...in a very tempting situation.
{3902}{3945}I do know better.
{3954}{4018}But some things are hard to resist.
{4046}{4089}See my problem?
{4122}{4209}You look great. Right? This is|completely wasted on the library.
{4215}{4296}Yeah, I know. I got your notes.|Very amusing. Can I get one?
{4314}{4369}I think it's so admirable|that you still study.
{4374}{4394}I do.
{4399}{4515}Some of us need to graduate because|eventually we will have to get a job.
{4526}{4584}Do you guys know that girl over there?
{4589}{4679}-She's got short hair.|-That's Rebecca. She's seen you, go.
{4706}{4732}No, no, no, no.
{4737}{4785}Travis, you are great-looking.
{4791}{4892}And this SoHo artist thing you do is|completely sexy. Plus, you're nice...
{4904}{4983}...which, contrary to what Derrick|may believe, is what women want.
{4988}{5033}-Yeah?|-Yeah. Go!
{5221}{5245}Go.
{5492}{5548}Your friend's real smooth|with the ladies.
{5613}{5649}It's pathetic.
{5733}{5777}Bartenders.|You guys see a lot, huh?
{5782}{5809}More or less.
{5814}{5893}You should hear his life story.|Pathetic doesn't begin to cover it.
{5941}{5961}Yeah?
{5965}{6035}He's homeless but rich.|Completely raised in hotels.
{6045}{6096}Derrick, you promised you|wouldn't talk about it.
{6101}{6167}His father tours.|He's this huge rock star.
{6172}{6260}I'm not supposed to say who, but if|you look at the guy, you'll know.
{6279}{6342}So his dad's running around,|his mom's a supermodel...
{6347}{6388}...and they leave him in hotels.
{6393}{6444}They take care of him,|they just can't be there.
{6457}{6485}Is it Jagger?
{6524}{6592}See, I want to--|I can't. I can't, man.
{6599}{6685}Somebody at the Peninsula sees him|playing checkers with the doorman.
{6690}{6721}Says, "Who is this kid?"
{6730}{6800}He's been living there for two years.|No parents in sight.
{6805}{6828}Come on.
{6833}{6895}Serious. The night maids|are reading him to sleep.
{7019}{7053}Do you guys want to split?
{7059}{7142}-Because I sort of struck out.|-Yeah, let's go.
{7147}{7221}Here, let me buy you guys a drink.
{7292}{7321}On the house.
{7374}{7394}Thanks.
{7600}{7664}-Is it Cobain?|-Way too young. It's Dylan.
{7669}{7720}-Is it him?|-No way!
{7799}{7883}You know, we'd love it|if he'd do a set.
{7952}{8006}Yeah, I'll ask him.
{8171}{8208}What did you tell them in there?
{8213}{8269}-Nothing. A little fib.|-A little fib?
{8274}{8314}We got free drinks, didn't we?
{8319}{8367}But I still didn't get laid, did l?
{8447}{8544}My friend, the sea is wide.|There are many fish.
{8549}{8597}Many, many fish. All right?
{9088}{9131}Travis, didn't you go to bed?
{9139}{9197}I had an idea. I was....
{9213}{9245}We got class.
{9397}{9459}Derrick, come on.|We got Goodwin's class.
{9545}{9603}I got the rent.|I just don't have it right now.
{9608}{9671}-Travis, I don't need it.|-No, I got it for you.
{9676}{9741}-You just said you don't have it.|-Just not right now.
{9746}{9849}Look, it's my apartment, so I make|the rules: It's a socialist state.
{9855}{9941}I have the money, you don't.|Distribution of wealth. No rent.
{10009}{10105}This is the last time someone will|offer you something for nothing.
{10111}{10135}Take the deal.
{10140}{10211}Just think of me as your patron.|I'm a patron of the arts.
{10216}{10250}Remember, your papers...
{10255}{10359}...are due the first week next month,|no extensions. Okay.
{10364}{10475}In 1995, a supermarket tabloid|ran this story on its front page.
{10480}{10543}What do you think?
{10548}{10581}Murderer!
{10602}{10631}Okay.
{10638}{10725}The next day, The New York Times|ran this story.
{10741}{10804}The standard-bearer of|American journalism...
{10809}{10909}...attributed, without apology,|a gossip magazine as its source.
{10929}{10965}Now what do you think?
{10991}{11029}Ms. Waters.
{11093}{11123}Well...
{11138}{11248}...news and entertainment are, like,|exactly the same thing anymore...
{11253}{11330}...so how are we supposed to tell|what's real and what's not?
{11335}{11383}Do you have an opinion about this?
{11394}{11432}An opinion?
{11437}{11521}In an academic environment,|we think about the world we live in.
{11526}{11587}It may be too much to ask|of someone who spends...
{11592}{11647}...her creative intellect on her hair.
{11717}{11783}I thought what Ms. Waters|said was brilliant.
{11791}{11901}Webb has come to help Ms. Waters. Her|gratitude will be rewarding, I'm sure.
{11906}{11982}But at least we have someone|willing to state an opinion.
{11987}{12079}Let's try something else. Back|that opinion up with an argument.
{12113}{12142}Okay...
{12172}{12251}...gossip and news are the same thing.|They always have been.
{12257}{12308}People tell stories.|That's what makes us human.
{12313}{12343}Come on, Webb.
{12349}{12409}Connect the dots. Be clear.
{12417}{12469}People pass a bunch|of stories around...
{12474}{12542}...finally they're written down,|then you have religion.
{12547}{12654}You read the Gospels, they're stories|that completely contradict each other.
{12659}{12754}Matthew's saying this and Luke's|saying, "No, this is what I heard."
{12759}{12787}What's your thesis?
{12805}{12881}All I'm saying is people are people.|We do what we do.
{12891}{12929}And then we gossip about it.
{12937}{12995}It might be great if|we were more noble, but...
{13001}{13047}...the stories wouldn't be as good.
{13053}{13094}And I like gossip. It's fun.
{13165}{13207}Well, that was exhausting.
{13211}{13267}-What'll you do for his paper?|-He's a prick.
{13273}{13367}Maybe we should do one together.|He lets people do that.
{13389}{13428}Hey, Travis. How's it going?
{13433}{13486}Rebecca. Great.
{13569}{13606}Wonder who she thinks you are?
{13611}{13686}I don't know, but whoever it is,|I bet he gets laid a lot.
{13879}{13991}I had an idea for Goodwin's paper.|I think we should start a rumor.
{13997}{14064}-You mean on purpose?|-Why not? We're good at it.
{14069}{14094}What's the point?
{14099}{14140}You know, track it,|see how it grows.
{14145}{14183}-Like Telephone.|-Yeah.
{14197}{14227}So start a rumor?
{14233}{14309}Like Jones is sleeping with us.|That's why we live together.
{14317}{14367}Yeah, no one would believe that.
{14373}{14397}Why not?
{14405}{14491}You never sleep with a girl|long enough to live with her.
{14517}{14550}Well, I might.
{14607}{14645}If Travis took weekends.
{15553}{15599}I sit behind you in Goodwin's class.
{15633}{15727}I thought what you said today|was just brilliant.
{15737}{15815}A beautiful girl thinks I'm brilliant.|I like this party.
{15929}{15953}Come on, Jones.
{15981}{16021}Just one.
{16043}{16069}Hey!
{16155}{16185}Thanks.
{16230}{16265}Of course.
{16281}{16305}Hey, Naomi.
{16450}{16534}Who comes to a party in the|meatpacking district in a Town Car?
{16539}{16589}Her father's a very big deal.
{17559}{17591}Were you going to tell me?
{17597}{17621}Tell you what?
{17630}{17691}-You and Goodwin?|-Say that again?
{17733}{17817}I've always wanted to do it.|Sex with a professor.
{17822}{17919}Oh, yeah, yeah. I take all|my teachers back to the loft.
{17926}{17981}That's funny. I heard a hotel.
{18017}{18047}Who told you this?
{18070}{18111}I promised.
{18762}{18798}You know Naomi?
{18805}{18870}-No, what's her name?|-Naomi Preston.
{18875}{18945}Transferred in last semester|from some place in Vermont.
{18970}{19029}So who's the stiff trying|to warm her up?
{19041}{19129}Beau Edson. Last guy on campus|who thinks she puts out.
{19155}{19215}Everybody knows she doesn't.
{19221}{19271}I don't get women who|are afraid of sex.
{19594}{19689}Maybe I was wrong about Goodwin.|This looks like jealousy to me.
{19694}{19794}The quickest way to get Derrick out of|my life would be to sleep with him.
{19825}{19866}That's not a "no."
{20562}{20594}Why? What?
{20598}{20631}-Nothing.|-You all right?
{20654}{20682}You okay?
{20687}{20722}Martinis.
{20907}{20966}Hey, Travis. What are you doing?|You hiding?
{20978}{21036}I'm not hiding,|I'm just thinking.
{21050}{21082}Are you drunk?
{21106}{21185}I'm just kind of having a little|dialogue with gravity.
{21190}{21248}Here we go. Yeah, okay.
{21253}{21318}I got you. I got you.|Take it easy.
{21330}{21361}-You all right?|-Yeah.
{21389}{21423}Keep your head down.
{21454}{21487}Parties.
{21515}{21560}-How you doing? You all right?|-Yeah.
{21565}{21602}Let me get you a cold rag.
{21607}{21642}You hang tight.
{21722}{21754}Come here.
{21850}{21885}You are so beautiful.
{22037}{22090}Come on, Naomi. It'll be great.
{22334}{22370}Stop.
{23816}{23849}Beau...
{23858}{23921}...I'm so drunk. Come on.
{24289}{24346}Oh, Beau.
{24413}{24450}Please stop.
{24489}{24521}Please.
{24669}{24697}Have you seen Marie?
{24741}{24787}She disappeared with Derrick Webb.
{24793}{24862}No way. Does she even know him?
{24881}{24913}She does now.
{25003}{25057}Is that sexual satisfaction I detect?
{25065}{25119}Hey, a gentleman would never....
{25842}{25885}Hey, I think we got our rumor.
{25897}{25949}I already heard tonight's big rumor.
{25954}{26029}-Oh, yeah. You and Goodwin.|-Ha-ha.
{26052}{26082}Who started that?
{26087}{26168}This is something else. This girl|at the party, Naomi something.
{26173}{26220}-Preston.|-Yeah. Hey, whoa!
{26245}{26280}What do you know about her?
{26285}{26375}She's in my calc class.|Old money, expensive everything.
{26381}{26490}Does her math with a Mont Blanc pen.|She and Beau arrived in Daddy's limo.
{26513}{26556}You do hate the rich.
{26590}{26619}Well, I don't hate you.
{26624}{26669}-I buy you drinks.|-There you go.
{26673}{26765}I like rich people who are nice.|And Naomi Preston is a bitch.
{26796}{26819}Yo, buddy!
{26827}{26861}Hey, Travis.
{26865}{26901}No exploring.
{26930}{27001}I saw her and her boyfriend|in the bedroom together.
{27032}{27136}I was in the bathroom.|I was just flossing and...
{27151}{27254}...they were in the room making out,|and she passes out and he splits.
{27262}{27325}So, how's this gossip?
{27345}{27444}We spread it around like they had sex|in the bedroom during the party.
{27452}{27484}You just said they didn't.
{27489}{27569}We have to make up the rumor,|otherwise how will we know it's ours?
{27581}{27655}This is good. It's simple.|It's close to the truth.
{27661}{27701}It's got room to grow.
{27732}{27761}Hey!
{27798}{27831}Hey, Trav?
{27840}{27865}Hold on one sec.
{27877}{27941}-Screw my dad, anyway. You know?|-Hey. Trav.
{27949}{28033}What are they gonna say about him?|That he's a sane man?
{28062}{28090}Hey!
{28273}{28318}Give me a little help over here.
{28401}{28448}Just grab his feet.
{28457}{28477}Push.
{28544}{28585}-You'll wake him up.|-Shit.
{28611}{28669}Dragging him on the subway|didn't wake him up.
{28704}{28734}Okay.
{28873}{28903}All right.
{29072}{29118}We should take his shoes off.
{29180}{29209}All right, all right.
{29482}{29511}What?
{29581}{29628}Don't even think about it.
{29659}{29715}You telling me it never|crossed your mind?
{29734}{29801}And you do everything|that crosses your mind?
{29814}{29854}Don't answer that.
{29916}{29956}Derrick, I'm not joking.
{29965}{30033}You're just as capable of|meaningless sex as I am.
{30048}{30110}Oh, and they say romance is dead.
{30185}{30227}It'd make our friendship stronger.
{30315}{30353}Is that right?
{30367}{30397}He's out.
{30433}{30469}He'll never know.
{30524}{30559}Am I alone in this?
{30973}{31044}I was right.|I felt absolutely nothing.
{31194}{31241}Well, I felt something!
{31674}{31777}If we started the rumor three times|and then waited for it to come back...
{31782}{31871}...then we could trace them back|and see whose moved the fastest.
{31876}{31915}Doesn't your head hurt?
{31920}{31988}Then I thought,|"This is not some stupid race."
{31993}{32051}Besides, people will spread the|thing back and forth anyway.
{32056}{32128}None of the lines will match.|It's like chaos theory.
{32133}{32225}There's gonna be a lot of noise.|It's like rapid gunfire.
{32240}{32303}You really are not in|the least bit hung-over?
{32308}{32365}See, he's figured out a way|to make it art.
{32372}{32415}Travis, this is very good.
{32429}{32479}Now all we have to do|is tell the story.
{32484}{32542}-If we do this.|-What do you mean, "If we do this"?
{32547}{32594}Wait. Jones, this was your idea.
{32612}{32701}I know, but I don't have anything|against these people.
{32708}{32769}Aside from the Mont Blanc|and Daddy's limo.
{32781}{32808}All right.
{32818}{32891}So you don't like her, but|you don't want to be mean...
{32896}{33001}...because you're from Plymouth, where|the Pilgrims are from, and they wore...
{33006}{33080}-...little buckles on their shoes.|-There were mean Pilgrims.
{33085}{33141}No, they were too busy|giving thanks.
{33185}{33221}Are we gonna do this or what?
{33265}{33311}Jones.
{33364}{33442}I guess we could stick with|the one already making the rounds.
{33450}{33521}Did you hear about Jones and Goodwin|at the Pierre?
{33540}{33591}So now it's the Pierre?
{33735}{33758}So?
{33950}{33982}Let's do it.
{34040}{34124}The party was cool, although|it took us forever to get home.
{34129}{34160}-This is yours.|-Thanks.
{34164}{34232}And we even left early,|before Naomi came down.
{34237}{34328}She and Beau were up in a bedroom|having sex during the party.
{34383}{34468}I mean, I thought the line|on her was, like, no sex.
{34486}{34601}Not that I judge that. A lot of girls|do this chastity thing now. Fine.
{34606}{34659}-I have to say I was surprised.|-Yeah.
{34668}{34756}Everybody heard after she got here|that she wasn't putting out.
{34761}{34864}Because she's beautiful, everyone was,|like-- A lot of people think that.
{34868}{34951}I think her face is too long,|and her nose.... It's me.
{34959}{35016}I'm just saying,|I'm worried about Naomi.
{35022}{35091}She takes this position|that she wants to save herself...
{35099}{35155}...and then she does|something like this!
{35160}{35191}I think in the long run...
{35196}{35280}...people are gonna take her less|seriously as a human being.
{35285}{35312}Well, I heard--
{35316}{35364}I heard....
{35369}{35439}I respect women that|are not into casual sex...
{35447}{35480}...except at a party.
{35485}{35529}I heard, when he put|his hand in her crotch--
{35535}{35572}At first she resisted, but--
{35577}{35604}You know how these things go.
{35609}{35709}I heard about that. Like, six guys|and four girls getting it on. Wild.
{35715}{35751}Wait, that was in high school.
{35756}{35812}-Next thing you know--|-She's holding his crotch--
{35817}{35837}And her skirt--
{35842}{35867}-Is up over her--|-Ears.
{35872}{35958}I knew this girl in freshman year|who was always like, "No."
{35963}{36018}Finally, when she's going,|"Yes," it turns out...
{36023}{36097}...she's wearing rubber underwear,|whips and chains.
{36102}{36149}-She goes down on him.|-Right there--
{36154}{36184}In the window.
{36188}{36222}She is hot!
{36227}{36258}-Hot.|-Is hot.
{36263}{36294}Is so hot.
{36322}{36380}They did it standing on the bed.
{36386}{36466}Blowjob? Yes.|Intercourse? Definitely.
{36477}{36553}Rubber underwear?|Yes, I saw it in her laundry basket.
{36558}{36664}Black rubber bra. It was so cute,|like Victoria's Secret gone...
{36669}{36707}...crystal meth.
{37263}{37353}-What?|-She wears black rubber bras.
{37367}{37458}And apparently enjoys|multiple partners...
{37470}{37511}...on the fire escape.
{39141}{39195}See, it moves forwards|and backwards.
{39200}{39291}Jones started it. Then she heard it.|So you can trace that line back.
{39296}{39373}It goes back and forth like airwaves.
{39440}{39516}What'll we do when the semester ends?|Hand in your room?
{39568}{39600}You think I'm a freak.
{39605}{39677}No. This is very original.|It's like....
{39729}{39760}You're original, Travis.
{39783}{39808}Listen...
{39844}{39875}...I know you, man.
{39880}{39922}Inside, you're like a piston.
{39927}{39978}It's impossible to explain|what makes it run.
{39983}{40029}All the shit that's in there.
{40040}{40063}But....
{40096}{40199}It's confusing, but Picasso, van Gogh,|all those guys, they all had doubts.
{40204}{40244}That's what made them brilliant.
{40292}{40336}Man, I can't even pay my rent.
{40389}{40444}Sometimes I don't even know|what I'm doing.
{40551}{40596}Trying to get at the truth, man.
{40651}{40712}Jones. Come here, look at this.
{40731}{40763}Isn't this good?
{40801}{40888}--totally bombed, had sex|while the party was going on.
{40904}{40994}People were walking in and out,|watching! They got off on it.
{40999}{41075}Naomi's, like, no sex at all.|Huge point with her.
{41080}{41159}Well, I guess Beau's huger.|Or is it more huge?
{41165}{41227}Beau Edson. God, I'd do it!
{41234}{41344}Apparently, Naomi did. With Beau and|even a couple others. The story--
{41870}{41942}-I heard it from a couple places now.|-Listen...
{41956}{42034}...I don't know why people are|saying what they're saying.
{42040}{42090}Did you tell somebody|that something happened?
{42094}{42175}Naomi, I don't need to lie about sex.
{42188}{42253}Well, then tell me. What happened?
{42329}{42397}-Beau, look at me.|-What?!
{42402}{42454}What do you want me to say?
{42458}{42552}You want to have sex, you don't|want to. Now you're asking what?
{42562}{42593}Why are you so angry?
{42598}{42640}Well, jeez, Naomi, I wonder.
{42656}{42693}That's not an answer, Beau.
{42758}{42780}Naomi!
{42912}{42956}The first time I heard it, it was...
{42978}{43078}...some sort of orgy, but that|was obviously an exaggeration.
{43083}{43110}What....
{43124}{43232}What really happened was she passed|out drunk and they had sex anyway.
{43253}{43285}Is this what they're saying?
{43290}{43332}See, that's the best part.
{43338}{43380}It keeps changing.
{43410}{43461}Four different people already said it.
{43480}{43585}Four different people told you|that she passed out and that....
{43600}{43688}And then he had sex with her anyway.|That's the new story.
{43760}{43816}Travis, did anyone|use the word "rape"?
{43842}{43890}You said you were passed out.
{43910}{43946}I was.
{43956}{44013}Isn't it possible that|he went ahead anyway?
{44018}{44065}Well, I would know, wouldn't l?
{44070}{44127}If that happened, wouldn't I know?
{44132}{44166}You said you were drinking.
{44172}{44240}I saw him come down that night.|His friends were there.
{44245}{44332}They asked him if he got laid|and he was bragging to them.
{44388}{44438}What are you so upset about?
{44444}{44498}This is an ugly turn, Derrick.
{44520}{44590}You loved it when it was a three-way.|How's this worse?
{44602}{44632}Stop it!
{44672}{44734}I love it when you get "Pilgrimatic."
{44741}{44841}Not everybody's saying it. Some|people still believe the old rumor.
{44846}{44882}You know, the multiple.
{44914}{44962}It'll probably change in a day or so.
{44968}{45036}It's not something you gotta|be so worried about.
{45065}{45085}Jones.
{45134}{45174}It's not true. It's just words.
{45189}{45230}So how bad can that be?
{45308}{45332}We were kissing.
{45337}{45432}And I had been drinking,|so I wasn't feeling great.
{45461}{45512}He pushed me onto the bed and...
{45574}{45632}...I told him to stop,|and he kept going.
{45696}{45776}I'm sorry, but we're going|to need to be more specific.
{45785}{45850}What exactly did he do after|you told him to stop?
{45900}{45928}Well...
{45941}{45996}...he put his hands under my skirt...
{46010}{46112}...and he was pulling at my panties,|trying to take them off.
{46169}{46199}And...
{46205}{46242}...I think he raped me.
{46278}{46316}You think he raped you?
{46324}{46385}I passed out. I don't know|what happened afterwards...
{46390}{46450}...but he was bragging about it.|He told....
{46476}{46542}-Everybody knows he did it.|-How do they know?
{46546}{46581}I know.
{46596}{46622}Okay?
{46636}{46678}I know he did it.
{47325}{47365}Hey, you ready?
{47406}{47453}Why are the cops talking|to Rick and Bruce?
{47458}{47538}-Naomi's pressing charges against Beau.|-Charges?
{47545}{47610}He raped her while she was passed out.|You told me.
{47615}{47643}That's not what I said.
{47649}{47724}I heard him bragging about it|and so did Leslie.
{47729}{47789}Asshole. He should be in jail|for what he did.
{47834}{47871}I didn't do it.
{47881}{47993}-Your friends say you did.|-They weren't there, were they?
{48073}{48162}Listen, I admit that when I came|downstairs, Bill asked me.
{48167}{48276}It was like, "Did you or didn't you?"|I let him think what he wanted to.
{48281}{48310}What did happen?
{48327}{48438}We were drinking. We were making out,|and then she passed out, so I left.
{48443}{48493}You don't recall her saying no?
{48498}{48575}Protesting? Trying to push you away?
{48636}{48662}Yes.
{48673}{48709}I remember some of that, but....
{48733}{48806}-She was saying no, but--|-But what?
{48853}{48881}But she didn't mean it.
{48887}{48925}I didn't do it!
{49003}{49093}Travis, come look at this.|Zoom in on that.
{49109}{49177}Oh, yeah. He's got her by the wrist.
{49254}{49299}You guys heard what's happening?
{49333}{49363}We have to come clean.
{49378}{49405}Come clean?
{49425}{49465}Like Murder, She Wrote.
{49499}{49589}This is a real cop, Derrick.|Her investigation's not a joke.
{49594}{49637}Why didn't she talk to you?
{49642}{49699}You're the only one who|actually saw anything.
{49729}{49765}Well, that's interesting.
{49771}{49817}Could they arrest somebody...
{49822}{49925}...because what people believe is true|is actually more real than the truth?
{49945}{50026}That's real interesting, Travis.|What a fascinating idea.
{50078}{50183}You need to relax a little bit|because nobody's been arrested.
{50189}{50243}I'm really not sure|what you want to do.
{50249}{50278}Come clean?
{50285}{50333}How do we do that?|We'll tell them what?
{50337}{50401}We started a rumor that may|just turn out to be true?
{50429}{50461}I mean, Jones...
{50465}{50530}...I didn't exactly see|what went on in that room.
{50535}{50581}I mean, what if he did rape her?
{50599}{50633}That's not funny, Derrick.
{50638}{50740}Hey, I was loaded. Marie was|throwing up and Beau shut the door.
{50745}{50806}You said you were certain|there wasn't any sex.
{50811}{50878}Well, I'm almost certain.|80%.
{50898}{50981}The facts shift with perception?|I could track it algorithmically.
{50990}{51029}Travis, he lied to us!
{51066}{51121}I didn't lie.|I may have made a mistake.
{51134}{51218}The whole point was, you knew|for sure they didn't have sex.
{51223}{51315}Well, I'm sorry, all right?|I screwed up. Travis.
{51331}{51398}This is a mess.|We need to go to the cops.
{51403}{51455}-We need to tell someone what we did.|-No.
{51460}{51547}Jones, calm down, all right?|Now think for a minute.
{51552}{51618}What if he did rape her?|I mean, she's saying he did.
{51623}{51693}If we tell everyone this is|a hoax, he'll get away with it.
{51713}{51746}Is that what you want?
{51822}{51907}If she filed a complaint, then maybe|she knows something we don't.
{51912}{51996}If he did it, police are gonna|find the evidence. If he didn't...
{52001}{52076}...no harm done.|We should just keep quiet.
{52081}{52149}Yeah. Don't worry about it.
{52154}{52201}The police know what|they're doing, right?
{52417}{52451}Thanks a lot.
{52593}{52617}Don't do it.
{52624}{52649}Naomi...
{52690}{52718}...Beau's here.
{52723}{52751}What?
{52809}{52833}I'll talk to him.
{52842}{52917}-Naomi. Naomi, I need to talk to you.|-Go away.
{52922}{52985}-Whatever it is that you think I did--|-Get out.
{52995}{53057}-I'm talking to her. Do you mind?|-Yeah, I do mind!
{53197}{53253}-Get off of me!|-Naomi!
{53258}{53327}Hey, Beau!|Everybody knows what you did!
{53345}{53403}Get your hands off!|Get your hands off of me!
{53540}{53589}Beau. Don't worry about it.
{53685}{53739}Witnesses say he was|bragging about it.
{53745}{53829}In interviews, he says that|she said no but meant yes.
{53837}{53877}The rape kit is inconclusive.
{53882}{53952}As it turns out, this girl|couldn't be more hooked up.
{53958}{54004}Her uncle's a councilman,|friend of the mayor...
{54008}{54088}...who called me personally to see|how this investigation's going.
{54093}{54131}What do you want me to do?
{54368}{54427}Okay, like everything else|in America today...
{54432}{54517}...this revolution will be televised.
{54523}{54611}So, what? Now we're supposed|to have some big debate on:
{54616}{54695}"All women are victims, take no|responsibility for your sexuality."
{54700}{54803}Be fair. That's not an argument.|That's simply post-feminist backlash.
{55064}{55143}Like because I have a cock|that means I'm a rapist?
{55159}{55212}We're just a bunch of|hysterical bitches.
{55216}{55245}You said it, not me.
{55273}{55297}What?
{55415}{55522}Ever since suffrage, you have to deal|with the fact that we can talk.
{55527}{55584}So who gave them the vote anyway?
{55643}{55672}Wait, wait, wait!
{55679}{55732}Like men do such a great|job running the show.
{55737}{55813}If it was up to you guys,|we'd be nuked by now.
{55872}{55920}This would be a great time--
{55984}{56097}If this is such a terrible thing, how|come it hasn't been in the newspaper?
{56102}{56175}There's a real question.|Anybody want to address it?
{56220}{56265}Miss Jones, your opinion.
{56435}{56496}It's just gossip right now, isn't it?
{56891}{56915}Who is it?
{56920}{57008}It's Cathy Jones.|I'm in your calc class.
{57073}{57096}Hi.
{57136}{57200}Can I come in?|Just for a second.
{57487}{57519}Taking a break?
{57543}{57572}Can l?
{57585}{57625}I don't usually drink.|I just....
{57647}{57700}It's been really--
{57705}{57760}Everybody knows|what's been going on.
{58015}{58095}It's weird, people you barely know,|knowing so much about your life.
{58191}{58276}I wanted to ask, I know it's|none of my business, but...
{58296}{58358}...are you sure about what|happened at that party?
{58363}{58409}-To you.|-Are you a friend of Beau's?
{58415}{58440}No.
{58457}{58550}No, I don't even know him.|I heard he was arrested today.
{58555}{58639}Well, he should be.|He should be arrested for what he did.
{58668}{58779}It's weird, you coming here....|I thought you never liked me.
{58808}{58893}Well, Naomi.|"Goodwin at the Plaza."
{58900}{58925}What?
{58931}{58983}At Fisker's party, you told Sheila.
{59036}{59120}There was a rumor going around|about me and Professor Goodwin.
{59159}{59223}-You don't know about that, do you?|-No.
{59279}{59396}Well, I don't know why we've never|really talked. I guess maybe...
{59404}{59461}...I was intimidated|by the Mont Blanc.
{59568}{59609}Where are you from, Cathy?
{59633}{59671}Call me Jones.
{59683}{59748}I'm from Massachusetts. Plymouth.
{59760}{59799}Oh, like the Mayflower.
{59876}{59960}Yeah, it's a great source of amusement|to one of my roommates.
{59965}{60036}-Why is that?|-I don't know. He's from Danbury--
{60041}{60117}I'm from Danbury. What's his name?|Maybe I know him.
{60123}{60168}I don't think so. Derrick Webb?
{60292}{60347}Is this some kind of sick joke?!
{60351}{60405}-Naomi!|-Get out of here! Get out!
{60956}{61023}-She said what?|-She knows you, Derrick.
{61027}{61104}-Well, that's news to me--|-You went to the same high school.
{61109}{61171}We might have passed each other|in the hall--
{61176}{61250}I mentioned your name, she goes crazy.|You know her!
{61255}{61337}If you'd calm down,|we might be able to figure this out.
{61489}{61539}You're so beautiful when you get mad.
{61555}{61583}Derrick.
{61604}{61639}I'm sorry.
{61687}{61731}I'm not immune, okay?
{61740}{61802}-You acted like you never knew her.|-Listen.
{61807}{61835}Listen to me.
{61867}{61919}People tend to remember me.
{61924}{61976}You know what?|I don't always remember them.
{61984}{62064}So maybe our parents knew|each other or something.
{62071}{62125}-Did she say anything?|-She just lost it.
{62131}{62215}I don't know what that's about.|Honestly. I don't know.
{62243}{62277}Don't mess with me. Not now.
{62283}{62327}-Jones, not with you.|-Please.
{62372}{62407}You swear?
{62447}{62476}Not with you.
{62615}{62659}Not now, Derrick. No.
{62681}{62707}When?
{62759}{62787}When?
{64963}{65019}People tend to remember me.
{65023}{65081}You know what?|I don't always remember them.
{65111}{65192}-What's his name? Maybe I know him.|-I don't think so. Derrick Webb?
{65199}{65250}Is this some kind of sick joke?!
{65255}{65305}-Naomi!|-Get out of here!
{68374}{68410}Son of a bitch.
{68699}{68791}I'm looking for a student who may|have graduated a couple years ago.
{68796}{68841}Sure. What's the student's name?
{68846}{68889}Naomi Preston.
{68936}{69013}I'm sorry, we can't give out|information on any students.
{69018}{69038}What?
{69353}{69377}Excuse me.
{69384}{69419}I can't talk to you.
{69427}{69482}I'm trying to help Naomi Preston.
{69486}{69555}How'd you hear? No one's talked|about that in a long time.
{69561}{69600}I just heard about it.
{69605}{69705}Well, I don't know how you did.|Didn't even make the papers here.
{69773}{69797}Rich people.
{69843}{69904}With enough money,|you can make anything go away.
{69935}{69974}You got that right.
{69997}{70037}Stories I could tell.
{70070}{70177}The way these kids behave.|No consequences for any of them.
{70182}{70228}So can you tell me what did happen?
{70734}{70815}-Travis, I really need to talk to you.|-In a minute.
{70917}{70958}Now, Travis!
{71008}{71110}He raped Naomi Preston in high school|and then he used us to do it again.
{71222}{71266}I think we could use a drink.
{71271}{71342}Don't try and deny it, Derrick.|I went to Danbury.
{71346}{71431}-We're back to Murder, She Wrote.|-I talked to someone who was there.
{71437}{71498}Someone who was there.|Which would be who?
{71503}{71547}A typist.
{71596}{71669}She's worked there a long time.|She knew everything about you.
{71674}{71735}You heard it in passing|from a complete stranger...
{71740}{71783}...and decided it had to be true.
{71790}{71826}Tell me what you did!
{71840}{71896}Naomi and I were together, all right?
{71970}{71994}I should've told you.
{72016}{72102}It was finally the right time for|both of us, after waiting years.
{72106}{72142}And she wanted to.
{72150}{72218}We were both ready,|and it was wonderful.
{72281}{72326}Then somehow, she freaked.
{72334}{72390}You met her.|She's not the most stable person.
{72398}{72425}You raped her.
{72446}{72516}I swear to you, no matter|what she says, it was not rape.
{72534}{72606}Generally, women are perfectly happy|to sleep with me.
{72616}{72666}Or do you have second thoughts too?
{72692}{72742}That's not an answer, Derrick.
{72821}{72847}Wait!
{72882}{72934}I'm sure he has an explanation.
{72947}{72974}Right?
{72994}{73090}Thanks, Travis.|At least one person has an open mind.
{73198}{73270}Naomi is your classic|poor little rich girl.
{73290}{73369}She's desperate to grow up|and actually become a woman.
{73374}{73446}But she's afraid that Daddy's|going to find out about it.
{73466}{73506}I can deal with that.
{73544}{73593}But then she decided to ruin my life.
{73670}{73721}Everyone in my hometown...
{73731}{73770}...thinks I'm a rapist.
{73795}{73821}And I'm--
{73887}{73958}My family won't even speak to me.
{73990}{74078}"Here's the trust fund, Derrick.|Stay out of our lives."
{74088}{74130}Why that rumor?
{74162}{74239}I admit spreading that rumor|wasn't the nicest thing to do.
{74244}{74326}I have some anger, okay?|I wanted to hurt her.
{74332}{74394}You say that like it's okay|to want to hurt people.
{74405}{74473}Did you spread that rumor out|of the goodness of your heart?
{74478}{74580}As I recall, you thought the idea of|hurting her was kind of entertaining.
{74586}{74633}Come on, man. This is what you did.
{74641}{74686}Travis, you did it too.
{74885}{74914}Look...
{74950}{75020}...none of us intended for|this to go as far as it did.
{75026}{75076}But that is simply not our fault.
{75089}{75137}Now, was the whole thing a mistake?
{75142}{75171}Maybe.
{75195}{75283}You know what? We're in college.|We're young.
{75290}{75356}These are the times we should be|making mistakes.
{75362}{75444}This is the problem with your position|about being nice, Jones.
{75449}{75493}Nice people don't live life.
{75498}{75562}I don't want to go through life|being sweet and polite...
{75567}{75661}...then realize when I'm 80,|I'm just some nice dead person.
{75860}{75909}Travis, come on.
{76106}{76136}I don't know.
{76450}{76487}A couple of us....
{76505}{76585}I mean, I spread a rumor|about Beau and Naomi.
{76590}{76658}I said they had sex during a party...
{76679}{76745}...and she knew she hadn't...
{76750}{76803}...so she thought what anyone|might think.
{76844}{76886}It didn't really happen.
{76918}{76957}I just said it did.
{76967}{77000}That's not much of a story.
{77005}{77086}If you want to help Beau,|do better than, "I made it up."
{77096}{77168}I'm not doing this for Beau.|I don't even know him.
{77175}{77237}I heard that you had a crush on him.
{77262}{77295}No. I don't.
{77300}{77363}Have you ever heard of|obstruction of justice?
{77368}{77421}Impeding an investigation?
{77426}{77476}-That's not--|-Listen to me.
{77482}{77583}Because I'm not a complete asshole,|I'm going to forget that we talked.
{77588}{77678}But if you start spreading this|around, I will not look kindly on it.
{77814}{77856}Didn't go so good?
{77892}{77938}See, that's the thing, Jones.
{77945}{78010}I lie much better|than you tell the truth.
{78365}{78396}Travis, we have to talk.
{78401}{78430}Jones, I was just--
{78438}{78528}We have to tell somebody.|You and me. I can't do this alone.
{78546}{78575}Maybe it'll blow over.
{78580}{78673}It's not gonna blow over.|If we don't do the right thing--
{78678}{78749}What's the matter with you?|You want to turn on Derrick?
{78754}{78806}After everything he's done for you?
{78819}{78882}You are nothing without him,|you know that?
{78914}{78950}You're pathetic.
{79162}{79191}Naomi?
{79204}{79243}It's Cathy Jones.
{79255}{79308}No, please don't hang up!
{79321}{79353}Naomi!
{79751}{79788}Go away.
{79991}{80032}Listen, Jones.
{80051}{80096}You may not believe this...
{80131}{80190}...but I'm sorry you're hurting.
{80239}{80276}I'm a cynical guy...
{80282}{80375}...and it's no big surprise to me|that nobody cares about the truth.
{80407}{80459}But I know it's hard on you.
{80495}{80591}And I'm not proud to be|the one who taught you that.
{80612}{80666}Please don't talk to me.
{80930}{80967}Jones, I mean it.
{81422}{81483}You're wiping my eyes|with a cocktail napkin.
{81524}{81580}Now, how appropriate is that?
{81648}{81676}You know...
{81727}{81792}...what do I care about|Naomi Preston, right?
{81798}{81858}I mean, I'm not ruining|my life for her.
{81866}{81908}That's my girl.
{81948}{82018}What's funny is, she's|never gonna even know.
{82023}{82106}All this happened and she's|never gonna even know.
{82488}{82513}Beau!
{82526}{82560}How was jail?
{82960}{83032}-I heard what you did, asshole.|-What are you talking about?
{83078}{83106}You raped Naomi!
{83112}{83184}What if it's not true?|You heard I raped her?
{83204}{83227}Wait!
{83238}{83262}Wait.
{83284}{83318}Is it true you raped her?
{83378}{83431}The girl has a veracity problem.
{83442}{83490}Any guy who looks at her is a rapist.
{83520}{83572}This could help you, Beau.
{83627}{83688}You and me.|She did the same thing to both of us.
{83748}{83780}Can you give me a hand?
{83816}{83862}Can I tell you my side?
{84176}{84220}My side's really good.
{84312}{84352}Want to know what|really happened?
{84356}{84432}I saw you. I knew what was|going through your head.
{84474}{84539}She was saying no and|you were getting off on it.
{85455}{85495}-Go away.|-I just want to talk.
{85499}{85535}Go away.
{85539}{85608}Naomi, calm down.|I'm here to help, okay?
{85612}{85643}I'm calling security.
{85672}{85728}If you do, you'll|never know what happened...
{85733}{85769}...between you and Beau.
{85791}{85835}What do you know about that?
{85891}{85927}My God.
{85935}{85995}You are still the most beautiful girl.
{86003}{86105}I swear to God, if you don't tell me|what you're here for and go...
{86111}{86146}...I'm gonna lose it.
{86151}{86223}All right. All right.|Okay. Don't be so emotional.
{86347}{86379}Pills?
{86420}{86444}What about Beau?
{86475}{86505}Beau.
{86527}{86565}You liked him, huh?
{86575}{86639}God, it was like déjà vu,|watching you two.
{86643}{86711}Because you liked me too.|You loved me, as I recall.
{86715}{86755}What do you mean, you watched?
{86761}{86817}I watched.|I was in the bathroom.
{86841}{86891}Why are you here?
{86948}{86989}Why are you here?
{87005}{87082}Why did you come to my school|if you didn't want to see me?
{87087}{87140}Because I didn't know, that's why.
{87171}{87227}I wish you were dead.
{87317}{87371}Well, that's nice.
{87435}{87460}Wow, look at this.
{87531}{87567}The Wizard of Oz.
{87587}{87623}You remember that night?
{87639}{87664}Oh, I do.
{87677}{87771}Okay. Get out of here!|I'm fine now!
{87781}{87816}Well, I'm not fine!
{87821}{87873}It wasn't my fault. I wasn't ready.
{87879}{87943}"I love you, Derrick."|And then you ruin my life.
{87951}{87998}All of Danbury thinks I'm a rapist.
{88003}{88089}Just stop it!|Just tell me what you want and go!
{88211}{88241}We're even.
{88257}{88283}What?
{88321}{88389}You ruined my life back then.|I've ruined yours now.
{88403}{88431}We're even.
{88440}{88485}What are you talking about?
{88508}{88548}Beau never raped you.
{88568}{88615}I planted a rumor.
{88623}{88662}And I made you believe it.
{88667}{88696}He never touched you.
{88775}{88807}That's insane.
{88811}{88887}Yeah. It is insane.
{88895}{88971}But the thing is, Naomi,|I still know you so well.
{88976}{89009}And I knew you'd fall for it.
{89015}{89103}You'd hear that story and your|imagination would start running.
{89108}{89183}And you'd think,|"I got raped again by my boyfriend.
{89187}{89251}Somebody I loved.|Somebody I trusted."
{89315}{89368}You didn't know both times it was me.
{89439}{89471}Here you go.
{89716}{89745}Just like old times?
{89983}{90069}Mind if I keep this?|I have such fond memories.
{90107}{90151}Fucking asshole!
{91315}{91344}What happened to you?
{91349}{91407}What? Oh.
{91432}{91548}I had a little showdown with|the lovely Naomi Preston last night.
{91622}{91658}Things got a little heated.
{91663}{91696}You told her?
{91759}{91829}-Yeah.|-And what did she say?
{91921}{91959}She was cool with it.
{92193}{92250}I got something for your wall.|You'll love this.
{92365}{92418}Did you guys hear what happened?
{92438}{92473}No, we just got up.
{92492}{92536}Naomi Preston's dead.
{92602}{92629}What?
{92661}{92747}They found her body this morning.
{92766}{92802}She killed herself.
{92809}{92870}-Oh, my God!|-Wait. Shut up, Jones.
{92889}{92918}Are you sure about this?
{92945}{92990}It's all over campus.
{93042}{93066}Shit.
{93118}{93186}They think maybe she....
{93213}{93300}It was an accident, because she was|drinking a lot and taking pills.
{93353}{93393}This is our fault.
{93398}{93448}Oh, please, Jones.
{93453}{93517}You can't drive a person|to kill themselves.
{93522}{93585}Naomi's weak.|She's always been weak.
{95324}{95405}-Yeah?|-I've been banging for five minutes.
{95413}{95454}I was in the bathroom.|Who are you?
{95466}{95506}I'm Detective Curtis.
{95666}{95693}You Derrick Webb?
{95713}{95773}Yeah, that's me.|What can I do for you?
{95778}{95832}-Can I come in?|-Absolutely.
{95882}{95950}I'd take the keys out of|the door if I was you.
{95972}{95998}Shit.
{96049}{96078}Roommates.
{96083}{96166}I'm here investigating the death|of a young student...
{96179}{96207}...Naomi Preston.
{96212}{96294}Naomi Preston, yeah.|I heard about that.
{96299}{96344}Can I make you some coffee?
{96351}{96390}Yeah, I'd like that.
{96426}{96478}So you didn't say.|Did you know her?
{96484}{96542}Well, we went to high school together.
{96594}{96639}Did you see her last night?
{96646}{96671}No.
{96819}{96874}Listen, I talked to a Beau Edson.
{96886}{96949}He says he saw you go into|her dorm last night.
{96954}{97018}He said that?|Well, Beau Edson's an asshole.
{97023}{97105}You know he's under investigation|for raping Naomi.
{97110}{97134}Yes, I know that.
{97154}{97218}If anyone pushed her|to commit suicide, it was him.
{97304}{97367}This is a homicide investigation.
{97405}{97436}Homicide?
{97460}{97525}I'm sorry.|I heard she killed herself.
{97533}{97593}We're not 100% sure what happened.
{97617}{97687}We have a dead body,|and there was a struggle.
{97754}{97810}How'd you get the scratch|on your face?
{97886}{97914}I was in a fight.
{97924}{97958}With Beau.
{97982}{98017}He looks worse than you do.
{98036}{98101}I was defending myself.|I mean, he jumped me.
{98114}{98168}Is that how you got|the bite on your hand?
{98202}{98225}Yeah, it is.
{98384}{98441}So you're saying Beau|may have done this?
{98466}{98506}No, I didn't say that.
{98603}{98642}I'll get back to you.
{100346}{100393}They can't really think|he did anything.
{100398}{100465}Then why are they asking questions|about where he was?
{100470}{100529}If he needs our help,|let's give it to him.
{100535}{100600}Travis, we could be named accessories!
{100670}{100700}What's going on?
{100757}{100785}They talked to me.
{100789}{100878}That detective asked where you were|the night of Naomi's murder.
{100883}{100970}-They don't know it was a murder.|-It's what they think!
{100990}{101023}What'd you tell him?
{101028}{101085}I told him you were over there.|You told me.
{101090}{101149}What?!|Are you a complete idiot, Jones?
{101154}{101201}How was I supposed to know you lied?
{101205}{101288}-He says you said you weren't there.|-You should have told him--
{101294}{101323}What?
{101332}{101401}I should've lied for you?|Which lie was I supposed to tell?
{101406}{101489}You told so many. If you'd bothered|to tell the truth, maybe--
{101498}{101578}Thank you for taking the position|of righteous indignation.
{101593}{101637}Why didn't you say you were there?
{101642}{101711}Your fingerprints have to be|all over the room.
{101716}{101802}Let's not forget who started|this little rumor.
{101814}{101897}You sent Naomi into a tailspin.|Curtis might like to know that.
{101904}{101949}You're such an asshole.
{101978}{102023}I didn't kill her, Jones.
{102033}{102090}Then it won't matter that|I didn't lie for you.
{102162}{102185}Fuck!
{102250}{102285}What did you tell him?
{102291}{102328}I didn't tell him anything.
{102333}{102392}They called and I'm supposed|to go down there.
{102397}{102440}Okay.
{102492}{102517}All right.
{102533}{102630}You tell them you went to see her|after I did, and she gave you this.
{102661}{102696}Why would she do that?
{102701}{102749}Just tell them that you were....
{102754}{102825}You told her about your art|and she wanted to help out.
{102830}{102910}So she gave you this picture.|Then you and I met for a drink.
{102930}{102958}What if they think I did it?
{102990}{103040}They're gonna-- Are you serious?
{103045}{103133}No, there's no way.|You have absolutely no motive.
{103156}{103195}Travis, Naomi killed herself!
{103200}{103313}It's a suicide. We both know this is|an insane misunderstanding. We just--
{103318}{103343}It's too weird.
{103348}{103404}Wait, Travis. Listen to me.|Listen.
{103426}{103466}Do you trust me?
{103516}{103560}I do a lot for you, don't l?
{103584}{103611}Yeah.
{103618}{103735}The cops are making some serious|wrong accusations here.
{103743}{103783}You know? I mean, I just....
{103788}{103842}-I need your help.|-All right.
{103847}{103918}Will you help me? Cool. All right.
{104435}{104462}Enter!
{104560}{104592}Miss Jones.
{104612}{104670}Can I talk to you for a moment?
{104738}{104812}Well, as we all know,|the campus is abuzz...
{104818}{104892}...with the news of Naomi Preston's|untimely demise.
{104900}{104935}Now there's a juicy story.
{104940}{104996}A girl is raped by her boyfriend.
{105002}{105080}He's arrested, and she can't|take the pressure...
{105086}{105158}...so she drinks herself to death|with sleeping pills...
{105176}{105244}...or something tawdry and useless.
{105268}{105308}It's a real shocker.
{105315}{105371}We've all been having|quite a time with it.
{105376}{105491}You'll love this, because today we'll|talk about the genesis of these tales.
{105496}{105576}Where they get started,|why they get started.
{105582}{105614}Mr. Webb.
{105627}{105680}Perhaps you have some insights.
{105686}{105734}How do these stories get going?
{105767}{105814}I don't know. They just happen.
{105828}{105908}They just happen?|Is that the best you can do, Webb?
{105914}{105995}Lives are ruined, the campus is in|an uproar, and all you can say is:
{106000}{106089}"Shit happens"? I have to say,|usually you're a little more glib.
{106094}{106132}All that deep theory about...
{106138}{106219}...the Bible and human nature|and "Gossip is fun."
{106224}{106266}Usually you have plenty to say.
{106279}{106358}I'd think you'd be proud of your|accomplishment, even brag about it.
{106382}{106429}I don't know what|you're talking about.
{106434}{106499}So what you're saying|is he made it up.
{106504}{106530}That's the rumor.
{106538}{106608}The date-rape scenario was|Mr. Webb's imagination...
{106612}{106648}...and we fell for it.
{106652}{106704}That's not what happened.
{106708}{106756}Why don't you tell us what happened.
{106774}{106828}Jones is the one who|started that rumor.
{106847}{106906}I was completely uninvolved.
{106911}{106942}She's dead, you asshole.
{106947}{106978}That's not my fault.
{106984}{107044}Murderer. He's a murderer.
{107158}{107198}Listen to you people.
{107210}{107308}You told that story. Passed it around,|having the time of your lives.
{107344}{107390}You're the ones who are responsible.
{107536}{107559}Idiots.
{107564}{107610}I think you've proven your thesis.
{107618}{107675}"Gossip is loads of fun."
{108264}{108304}Get out here, Jones.
{108687}{108716}What's going on here?
{108736}{108763}Warrant.
{108810}{108835}Are my roommates here?
{108840}{108874}Up on the roof.
{109087}{109146}-You told Goodwin?|-Yeah, I did.
{109158}{109212}-Do you know what this does?|-Cops know about Danbury.
{109218}{109264}They knew I asked about her.
{109270}{109348}-You got yourself into this!|-I won't take the fall for this.
{109354}{109442}If we had anything to do with|Naomi's death, we have to admit it.
{109474}{109517}You want to go it alone, okay.
{109525}{109583}But then get the hell|out of my apartment.
{110088}{110151}-Have you seen that before?|-Yeah, of course.
{110156}{110199}I saw this in Naomi's bedroom.
{110211}{110291}Officer Stevens just found|this in your sock drawer.
{110319}{110355}In my sock drawer?
{110363}{110444}No. This is my room up here.|That's my room.
{110448}{110492}That's Officer Stevens.
{110715}{110759}I have to show you something.
{110819}{110899}I admit, I should've told you|about this from the beginning...
{110903}{110954}...but I have a weakness|for my friends.
{110960}{111064}I wanted to protect Travis.|But he's clearly-- He's just off.
{111112}{111151}Come look at this.
{111413}{111475}This guy has been obsessed with Naomi.
{111489}{111531}I think he's stalking her.
{111545}{111601}Now he's trying to put|the blame on me.
{111613}{111695}I've always helped Travis,|but I'm not going down for this.
{111755}{111797}Look at this wall.
{111807}{111921}How sick and demented are you to|come up with something like this?
{111926}{111973}I mean, the guy's a sociopath.
{112050}{112098}There's Naomi. Oh, my God.
{112109}{112155}Look what he did to her face.
{112185}{112231}Who would do something like this?
{112369}{112411}This isn't a sane person.
{112421}{112473}-Where is he?|-He bolted.
{112499}{112547}Go out there, see if you can find him.
{112563}{112609}You want me to take this down?
{112623}{112655}Let me keep it.
{112706}{112749}Wait, you don't need this.
{112755}{112807}I mean, this is mine. It's my brush.
{112821}{112904}I want to find Travis.|He's got a very interesting hobby.
{112911}{112945}But you know what I see?
{112957}{112999}I see someone who had a motive.
{113003}{113060}I can put him|at the scene of the crime.
{113065}{113155}His fingerprints are there,|and he's got a scratch on his face.
{113175}{113257}The dead girl's got skin|underneath her fingernails.
{113265}{113370}And I'm betting that the DNA|from your hair, it's gonna match.
{113419}{113459}Get out of my face.
{113489}{113541}I can't touch you without a warrant...
{113546}{113594}...but it won't be hard to get one.
{113615}{113713}I'm gonna leave a car out front.|Don't try to go anywhere.
{114481}{114519}Son of a bitch!
{115555}{115583}Come on. Come on.
{116303}{116330}Where are you going?
{116384}{116413}Hey!
{116481}{116558}I'm going skiing in Switzerland,|thanks to you.
{116562}{116622}Planting that picture|in my sock drawer...
{116634}{116678}...that was a super idea.
{116695}{116738}I was gonna tell them.
{116750}{116785}Then I woke up.
{116797}{116846}You must think I'm stupid.
{116857}{116928}That was your idea, your plan,|to make them think I did it.
{116933}{116965}I betrayed you?
{116970}{117021}-Perfect.|-You get away with everything!
{117026}{117049}What is that?
{117054}{117122}You're not getting away|with it this time, man!
{117137}{117160}Get inside!
{117166}{117200}You're a freak.
{117205}{117242}Yeah, I'm a freak!
{117253}{117321}I'm crazy! I'm a menace!|Is that right?
{117338}{117362}Get inside!
{117367}{117400}-What's the point?|-Get inside!
{117405}{117509}What's the point of this? I'm not|going to jail! They got no case.
{117514}{117562}That's why you're running, right?
{117585}{117697}In the hands of a really expensive|lawyer, it'll all go to shit.
{117747}{117802}Derrick! I saw Travis. He has a gun.
{117807}{117849}-Thanks for the news.|-Shut up!
{117889}{117938}-Sit down.|-What are you doing?
{117942}{118010}-He was gonna get away.|-I didn't do anything!
{118015}{118050}Derrick, shut up.
{118057}{118080}Give me the gun.
{118085}{118126}You know he killed her.
{118131}{118194}I know if you shoot him,|they'll arrest you.
{118233}{118285}Are you listening to me?|Put it down!
{118302}{118358}No, then he will get away with it.
{118421}{118459}Well, then let him.
{118613}{118695}Travis, we don't need to be|a part of this anymore.
{118738}{118777}I know you.
{118825}{118865}You can be better than he is.
{118918}{118958}Travis, put it down.
{118985}{119008}Come on.
{119753}{119785}Call somebody.
{120129}{120158}911, Travis.
{120303}{120337}Look at me. You'll be okay.
{120353}{120406}It's okay. It's okay.
{120411}{120445}Breathe, breathe.
{120529}{120588}We need an ambulance.|Someone's been shot.
{120593}{120646}-Am I gonna be okay?|-Yes.
{120653}{120686}Absolutely.
{120717}{120776}Absolutely. Come on.|Breathe.
{120826}{120875}Come on. Come on, Jones.
{121117}{121182}The cops are downstairs.|They probably heard the shot.
{121187}{121225}-They're probably coming.|-Wait!
{121261}{121286}Wait.
{121301}{121390}What are we gonna tell the cops?|Let's get our stories straight.
{121398}{121461}Our story?|What's the matter with you?
{121490}{121553}We just got to tell them|what happened, because...
{121558}{121597}...this was an accident.
{121605}{121635}You know what?
{121641}{121675}I should tell them|you killed her!
{121681}{121743}Don't be nuts now!|We just got to tell them--
{121749}{121836}Tell them the truth? Why?|You don't! Lying, raping Naomi!
{121841}{121926}Wait! If you want me to tell|the cops everything I did, I will!
{121930}{121978}But tell them I didn't kill Jones!
{121985}{122011}I'm gonna let them in.
{122017}{122052}Shit!
{122063}{122120}All right! I raped Naomi!
{122125}{122208}And that bitch deserved it!|But I didn't kill anybody!
{122279}{122305}I raped Naomi!
{122314}{122394}And that bitch deserved it!|But I didn't kill anybody!
{122585}{122621}Will wonders never cease?
{122659}{122722}Derrick Webb tells the truth.
{123289}{123321}What is this?
{123550}{123583}Hello, Derrick.
{123645}{123673}Naomi?
{123765}{123848}When Jones brought this to us|I never thought it would work.
{123859}{123924}And then when you were pounding|the shit out of me...
{123929}{123974}...I thought, "This had better work."
{123993}{124047}You know what? It was worth it.
{124057}{124129}It worked better than I could|have ever possibly imagined.
{124205}{124245}Who's the victim now?
{124310}{124345}Derrick, this is Matt Curtis.
{124350}{124414}He does a little driving|for Naomi's dad.
{124431}{124498}This is Mark. He's in my calc class.
{124773}{124814}Thanks for your help, professor.
{124861}{124899}See you at the Plaza.
{125033}{125102}It turns out, just this once,|I did lie better than you.
{125149}{125190}What are people going to think?
{125253}{125298}What are they gonna say about me?
{125315}{125374}It's only words. How bad could it be?
Oh, yeah. I've been round the block.
- Really?
- Believe it.
Sowed me oats.
Acted the rip, the rapscallion.
Ran wild, ran free.
Of course, this all back in the days of yore.
Right. You wouldn't think it to look at you.
Yeah, well, time comes, you have to leave behind the old hell-raising.
Take some responsibility for your life.
- Prepare the groundwork.
- How do you do that?
Well, to begin with,
I'd say by nest-building.
You have to find an abode you feel secure in.
Then you have to furnish that abode... procure the necessaries: Furniture, etc.
Kitchen utensils, your wok...
...your juicers.
- What about love?
Well, love's not something you can plan for, is it?
Look all you like as long as you like... but it's only when you let your guard down...
- When you least expect...
- That you find someone.
Take myself for example.
You ever see me before?
No.
I've just ambled in, right? But who's to say by tomorrow, you and me couldn't... and I'm not coming on to you or anything... but who's to say we couldn't be head-over-heels?
Dancing in the Green?
- Nobody.
- Right.
- When there's something there...
- Chemistry.
Right. Who knows where the sparks will lead?
A fella like myself, a stranger... could just be a bit of fun in the sack, no more.
Or, and it's not that crazy... your soul mate.
Yeah, you've got a point.
On the other hand,
I could just be a thief or something.
What do you mean?
Some villain, just waiting for my chance to... smack your jaw and rob the register while the place is empty.
But this is the thing of it, see?
You just never know... what's gonna happen.
Come here. Look at your top!
How many fucking times do I have to tell you? It's all over you.
What are you doing?
Get back over here before I fucking slap you...
Get out of the way!
He's heading for the stairs.
Come on, youse humpy cunts.
Get out of my fucking way.
He's running out to the car park.
Come back here with that!
Get out of the car!
Get out of the fucking car!
Shouldn't you have been here last time round?
I should have, but fuck it.
An hour late.
An hour less there, man. Fucking dump.
Don't start. You the same?
Fucking bus, fucking city.
Here's this fuck now.
- Is it too early to use my pass?
- You know it is.
How much is it to the barn?
You know how much.
Come on, there's people here late.
Another 10 cents. Come on.
- Will youse come on?
- Hold your...
Hurry up.
Now.
You robbing bastard, you.
- How's Cathy?
- She ordered in a kitchen.
- You're joking. New floor not enough?
- Do you believe her?
You wanna see this floor, though.
Oak slats, lovely grain running through it.
Trouble is, this shit costs, and there's only so much overtime going.
- Fucking shit.
- It's all shit, man.
Fucking life.
Mega brand kidney beans, baked beans, butter beans.
Any two for the price of one.
It's a reduction rampage.
- What did you say?
- I say, 'Why not?'
She says, "Because you're not my type".
I say, "Well, what is your type?"
You know what she said?
"Everything you're not".
Jesus.
Didn't score in a single department.
Fucking wank, man.
- Next time?
- What?
That's easy enough for you to say, sitting pretty as you are, man.
- What?
- Sitting pretty. You've Deirdre there...
Oscar, me and Deirdre broke up.
- What? When?
- Few weeks back.
Weeks? Why didn't you tell me then?
How the hell did it happen?
It was felt we should take a bit of a break.
Felt by who? By her, yeah?
John.
Oscar.
Are youse not clocking back on?
Oh, yeah.
Hang on.
Youse clocked on 15 minutes ago.
Get back on that floor, youse little pups.
That's a strike now against each of you.
John.
That's your second, after your lateness this morning.
One more, and a certain ass will be kicked.
I shit you not, as they say in the States.
So, yeah, that was the only place left.
And it was cheap as well.
But Henry wouldn't take it because they rape white women there.
- Who does?
- I don't know. Everyone.
Henry said some fella he knows was driving round there... him and his girlfriend.
They were stopped by the cops.
One held a gun on him, the other one raped her. And then they switched.
- They raped him, too?
- No.
- Oh, the coppers switched.
- Yeah.
So you know, that's that. No sun this year.
Might go down to Wexford or something.
What about you and...
Did you ever smell these?
Smell lovely, they do.
Me and Deirdre?
- Youse broke up, didn't you?
- How did you know?
That's all right then. I saw her with some fella at the Zombie last night.
Who?
Some middle-aged fella. Kissing.
Some baldy fella.
- Kissing a baldy fella?
- Holding hands and all, yeah.
Wexford isn't that bad, is it?
Get a caravan down there, couple of weeks. What do you think?
If the sun comes out, sure we can paddle.
John. Come on, man.
Where is the baldy cunt? Where is he?
Sorry, Deirdre.
This isn't acceptable, Deirdre.
After what, five, six weeks?
This is bollocks.
You don't fucking...
You don't just hook up with the next fella walks by!
The only reason you would do that is if you never cared the first place.
And that's cold, man.
That is the behavior of... and I have no qualms about saying it, a whore.
And not with a heart of gold.
No, with a heart of stone.
A cold, dark fucking black heart, Deirdre.
That's what you have. And I'm glad
I found out. A dirty, black...
- Does 'blackguard' come from blackheart?
- Don't know, man. You all right?
You blackguard, Deirdre.
That's all you are. Do you hear me?
Just a dirty fucking blackguard.
The body compensates, son.
Instead of mobility,
I've increased perception:
Sight and sound, smell, of course.
It's a fair trade, and I wouldn't go back.
Come on. Come on, a sup.
Taste, that's another one.
- Have you ever tasted Guinness?
- Of course.
No you haven't.
You think you have.
Listen, I've gotta go, man.
Sorry and all, but my arm is fucked.
- All right, boys.
- We're not holding your pint.
Why not?
- Because then we've to listen to you.
- Wise to my ploys, aren't youse?
I thought it was her who wanted to take the break.
How're you, Seamus?
Two brown sauce sambos.
Slap it on thick, no butter, two pints of Guinness.
- Right.
- Know what I mean?
No, it was me.
I just thought I'd give her a little test, you know?
I say to her, "Let's take a break".
She says, "Let's not".
Then I know, see?
- John.
- What?
What kind of fuckhead are you?
- That pisses me all the way off.
- Why?
Could you not appreciate what you fucking had?
I'm at a stage, man, I can't even wank.
Two brown sauce sambos.
- You know?
- Cheers, Seamus.
Pulling away like a madman, man.
Two pints.
Half an hour, 45 minutes, nothing fucking happens.
Can't get my fantasies clear in my head.
Couple of occasions,
I don't mind telling you...
I wept like a woman, the fucking frustration.
So you setting tests for Deirdre, man... taking for granted your good fucking fortune... that disappoints me big style.
- I'm gonna go home, you mind?
- You're what?
What you said there is right, man.
Hundred per cent.
- You've just sent me into a state of turmoil.
- Wistful, are you?
Among other emotions.
- Need to go home and reflect on my choices.
- You do what you have to do, man.
See you.
Fair play, man.
Right. Throw us on the floor.
Gently.
Lovely.
Come here and I'll tell you. You there!
- So how goes the fight against crime?
- All right.
It's never-fucking-ending, though.
See what I mean?
Have you not got a sign that says,
'Toilets for patrons' use only'?
I do.
I'll have to enforce that rule.
Give us another 7-UP there, will you?
All right, Lehiff?
Staying out of trouble?
Jesus. Doesn't look like it.
Who did that to you?
Your old one, man.
She poked me in the eye with her cock.
You cheeky little fuck, you.
I'm watching you, do you hear me?
And if I find out that you've been in any way bold...
I'm gonna nab you.
Now don't move.
Stay where you are and take your scolding.
Now, what do I want you to do?
Stay out of trouble.
Stay out of trouble.
That's right.
Fucking disrespect my old one.
Now, hang on till I shake.
All right.
Go on.
So what's wrong with me? What did I do?
- Or didn't I do?
- I told you, Noeleen, nothing.
- It's just something that...
- Yeah, that happened.
You said that already, and I don't believe you.
Is it my age?
Is it something I wouldn't do?
Is it my looks?
Wait a second. Look, don't you...
Wait! Don't you fancy me anymore?
Look. Listen to me.
It's nothing to do with you.
I fancy her, I fell for her.
We clicked, and we wanna be together.
You don't come into the equation, so relax.
Of course I come into the equation.
I'm your wife, for God's sake!
I'm your wife, Sam! 14 years!
What the hell did I do?
- So this fella's moving in with you?
- Yes.
Well, what do you want me to do?
Be like Sally?
Give up on them altogether, grow myself a 'tache?
- Sally doesn't...
- Sally has a 'tache, Ma.
Whatever she did before, bleached or waxed, she's quit.
Anyway, I'm better off.
Did you know John and Oscar broke into Fruitfield a few months back... stole a crate load of Chef Sauce?
And I know that wasn't the only time.
- Chef Sauce?
- It was all they could get.
I'd be over at his place, he's making sauce sandwiches.
Putting it in his cornflakes.
Trying to use it all up. In his tea.
I mean, he dumps me, Ma, breaks my heart... and then has the gall to come over and call me a whore and a blackguard... for not taking the fucking vows?
Well, fuck him.
Him and his brown sauce. Sorry, Ma.
But I've got a guy who's well-off, who's attractive...
- Who's married.
- Well, you can't have it all.
Who's not a thief, but a bank manager.
And if he wants to move in with me... then I think
I'd be some kind of a fool to say no.
Now, I'm gonna have the carrot cake.
What are you having?
All right, my friends, do Daddy proud.
Show them what you've got.
All right. You lads ready?
And action!
Come on, guys, we've been through this before.
They'll get it, lads, just give them a second.
Don't fuck up on me here. Go!
For fuck's sake, how many times have we rehearsed this, youse fucks. Go!
Get down. Martin, get back in the box.
Don't fight. Benny, get off him.
- It is Little Big City, isn't it?
- Yeah.
That's what it's called.
Which says to me, yeah, stories, yeah, characters.
- There's a broad spectrum there.
- Diverse.
And that's what we're doing and that's fine.
But where that diversity is lacking is tone.
- What are you saying?
- Tone, Thomas. Texture.
What I'm saying is, let's go a bit darker now and again.
Find a subject with a little bit more of an edge... and explore that edge with the weight it deserves.
What do you think?
- A bit darker?
- Just a bit.
Just to spice the thing up.
Give it some depth, some complexity...
I know what you mean.
All right.
Go find a subject, bring it to me.
If it's not too much, then I don't see why not.
- Good enough?
- Absolutely.
What about this, Sally?
When's the last time you saw me in a dress?
Give me a voucher.
A gift voucher, please.
- How much?
- Sorry?
- How much for?
- €100, please.
- No hundreds left. Do you want two fifties?
- Please.
- No fifties. Five twenties do you?
- Fine.
Grab it.
It's a sty, my life.
The people I deal with are piss. Waste.
Is that what you're interested in?
I'm a fuck, man. I mean... my only really human quality to speak of is a fondness for Celtic mysticism.
What's that?
The music, man.
Artistes like...
Fainne Lasta, Raithneach,
Amhann na Ngealach, Clannad.
You like them artistes?
Their music? Of course you do.
But what I'm saying is, the kind of justice I'm questing... requires a certain attitude that people might find... you know, extreme or unpleasant.
It might not be suitable.
Grab it.
- You ever compete?
- Just as a kid.
I could have turned pro... except for I joined the Guards, made crime my calling.
My da used to say, "Hate your opponent".
He was my trainer.
'Hate him, and you'll never give less than 100%.'
That's a philosophy I still follow.
That's why I'm such an animal, man.
- Is that what you want for your show?
- Yes.
- Cool.
- It's exactly what I want.
I just have to run it by my boss.
Get the go off him and then we can...
Run it by him.
Let him know I'm up for it, big time.
Fucking underbelly, you're saying?
No better fucking guide, man.
- You nearly finished?
- Midnight. Yourself?
- About 10 minutes.
- You lucky prick.
Gonna pick up a chicken black bean, spring roll starter...
Will you come on? We've homes to go to.
- Do you hear this?
- I know.
You'd think we were dogs or something.
- Are we moving or what?
- Will youse wait a minute?
Fuck's sake.
Listen, take it easy, yeah?
Where are we?
I can't see.
We near Springfield yet?
I'll give you a shout.
I was thinking we'd throw you a birthday party. What do you think?
I don't want one, Ma.
Don't believe in that party fandangle.
Deirdre feels you're letting yourself go, Sally.
Deirdre wants to hook me up because she's embarrassed I've no fella.
At least I'm not in their thrall like she is.
She escapes one, and another one nets her.
What's the story with that, anyway?
What?
Any chance of them two getting back together again?
None of your business.
No.
And listen, I wasn't going to say it to you, but since we're having this discussion... would you not...
Would you not get yourself a bit of Immac or something?
Get rid of that old ronnie you're cultivating.
I haven't got a ronnie.
Well, no, you're hardly the Burt Reynolds league... but there's such a thing as grooming, you know?
Whether you're courting or not, love.
Springfield coming up, now.
Mum?
Mustn't be back yet.
Are you nervous?
Not really.
They'll be well impressed.
Take your coat off. I'll make some tea.
- Deirdre.
- Yeah.
Come here for a sec, will you?
I wanna show you something.
- Jesus.
- You must be Sam.
Christ.
There were nine, ten people at the most.
All the windows were smashed.
So it was just a matter of climbing up on to the top.
Well, of Sally climbing up on to the top, and of her helping them out... and me helping them down.
- And there was nobody killed?
- No.
- Despite the blood.
- That's amazing.
- So the ambulance came and...
- Yep, took them all away and that was that.
Made a statement to the police, but we weren't much use.
You don't know how it happened?
- Have I got a ronnie?
- A what?
- A ronnie, mustache, like.
- Show?
Well, you're no Tom Selleck, but...
Go fuck yourself.
Sorry, Ma. Fucking idiot.
Why are you so angry, Sally?
Because she's no business, that's why.
I don't go round talking about her physical...
Jesus.
You don't know how it happened?
Be a few settlements there, I'd say.
- You should've stayed on till the next stop.
- We should've.
Anyway, it's nice to meet you, Sam.
Sorry it had to be in, what would you call it, such dramatic circumstances.
So, how are you finding living with Deirdre?
Her place okay?
- He thinks it's a sty.
- No, I don't.
It just needs a bit of a dusting, hat's all.
- And a hoovering, and a mopping.
- Maybe a paint job.
Ouch. I'm messing.
No, it's great. It's early days, but we're getting on all right, aren't we?
- And how's your wife coping with this?
- Sally.
No, I'd like to know.
Is she upset? Depressed?
- Let's go, Sam.
- No, wait a sec, Deirdre.
If he can't handle this kind of talk... then he shouldn't put himself in this position.
- How long you married?
- Fourteen years.
And you can, just like that, finish with one, start with another?
That kind of shit sickens me, you know that?
Sorry, Ma.
And you stay where you are. I'll go.
The stench of fucking adultery in here.
When Vincent and I broke up,
I thought the same thing, Noeleen.
It's me.
I'm dysfunctional in some way because I couldn't hold on to him.
So you know what I did?
I proved to myself that it wasn't... by attempting, by doing things that proved it.
By becoming better alone than I'd ever been with him.
- Tell me how.
- I will.
Will you?
I can't tell the difference.
- What do you want?
- Anything.
Do you have a preference in terms of content?
Like women and women, or men and men?
What the fuck are you insinuating?
I don't know your preferences.
I'm only trying to help you here.
- You just want straight, yeah?
- Just people fucking, man.
Make sure the chicks are good-looking.
I saw one of them before, they were hound dogs.
- There you go.
- Mutts, they were.
There's no one taking dumps in this, is there?
- You want that?
- No.
Look, Oscar, it's just fucking, all right?
- Bit of oral, bit of anal.
- All right.
Anal men or anal women?
Can't keep your paws off her, can you?
So what happened to your sister?
She was in love with this guy and she wanted to marry him.
Guy from London, name was Duane.
She was gonna move there with him.
Took out her savings for a new start.
A few thousand pounds.
Well, you can see where this is going, can't you?
He convinced her to take it out in cash.
Then he stole it from her and went back himself.
Jesus, Deirdre, get away.
You're freezing! Please, I'm serious.
Thing is, though, after he took the money... he tied her to her bed, told her she was a rubbish lay...
...and then did a poo on her chest.
- A what?
Ma found her.
It was like two or three days later, and the stink, she said.
Flies crawling over her, and her hysterical.
So she moved back home then.
Hasn't trusted a man since.
Jesus!
Why would you?
Are you warm yet?
Yes, you are.
Get off!
Bastard.
Fucking bastard.
I'm telling you, this young fella came out of nowhere.
He threw a stone through the windscreen, a big one.
- I panicked, I swerved...
- You lost control.
Anyone would have. The bang, the shock,
Jesus, the windscreen shattering.
And yet no one saw this boy?
- None of your passengers?
- Are you joking me?
With the muck on those windows, how could they?
They can't even see the bus stops.
I have not been negligent, man.
No way. I did nothing wrong.
Kid ran up in front of me and hauled that rock.
Fucking pegged it, he did.
The weather seems to be pretty much the same... as it's been for the past couple of days... with the wind coming up from the south-east.
We've got squalls, sunshine patches.
We've got fairly heavy rain.
Dublin's gonna get a lot of rain this afternoon.
- Hey, man.
- Hi.
- What you up to? You not working?
- Not anymore.
What?
Did you get let go?
- Fired.
- Fuck.
That's mean. You okay?
You want another one?
I don't intend stopping any time soon.
- What happened to you?
- Some fuck, man, don't ask.
Some little fucker.
I was driving up by Greenhills.
Stroked jammer? Of course.
Comes out of nowhere...
...fucks a rock through the windscreen.
- What?
Into the ditch I went, banjaxed my face.
Do you believe it?
Two pints, please.
- So tell me about it.
- Fuck it.
Fuck nothing.
Time like this, you need to talk.
A shoulder, an ear.
Get it off your chest, man.
Speaking in front of a group.
Excellent, in fact, we'll do a list.
Do you know what I find fascinating, an muinteoir?
- Dreams.
- We'll be doing dreams in a couple of weeks.
- Fabulous. Will we?
- We will. So, public speaking.
How does that make us feel? Anyone?
- Vulnerable?
- Good.
- Shy.
- Exposed.
Scared.
- Powerful.
- No, it's just negative things now.
Naked.
Do you ever dream you're naked, an muinteoir?
It's fascinating. Do you ever do that?
- Okay, what else?
- In command.
Negative things. Come on, now.
- Weak.
- Weak. Excellent.
Or you're relieving yourself on O'Connell Street.
What does that mean, an muinteoir?
Number twos, like, in a little toilet outside the GPO... and you're afraid to wipe your bum because everybody will look at you.
It's fascinating and laugh, like.
- Okay, so. What's that, Maurice?
- Dreams, an muinteoir.
We're not talking about dreams, you fool.
Did you not hear him?
A couple of weeks' time, he said.
Can you not wait?
You stupid old fool, what are you?
What are you? A fool!
- What do you want?
- Give us a ten.
Don't do tens anymore.
Don't break it up that small anymore.
Fuck.
Out of the way.
Flatfoot, fat fucking faggot.
Go on, you prick. Prolong the inevitable.
See that? Even in your, what are they?
What have you got?
Even in your Nikes, I'm more nimble.
Me in my heavy brogans. What have we got?
We've got money. Quit your wriggling!
We've got gear.
There you are.
Where the fuck is the motor?
For fuck's sake. Some fuck's after...
Shut the fuck up! You giggling whore, you.
When will he be back?
No, I can't wait that long!
This is bollocks, man, I'm telling you.
My rank, I should not have to deal with this kind of unprofessional and...
Fuck it.
Give me the number of a taxi firm, will you?
That's not what we want, Ben.
It's indigestible. It's too hard.
- But it's real, it's true.
- I know that.
It's out there.
I'm talking about a world people don't see, Thomas.
- The humanity within...
- But that's not what I hired you to do.
Now, you wanna use a copper?
Find some fella who helps the homeless in his spare time.
- Or one who can juggle.
- He likes Celtic mysticism.
Yeah? Raithneach, Clannad, artistes like that?
- Fainne Lasta?
- All that shit, yeah.
But how's that a quirk, Ben?
Sounds like the guy knows his music.
But him knowing his music is a far from good enough reason to do him.
He's too hard and he's too nasty. Nasty.
- Too nasty.
- But...
Softer.
Jerry. What's this I hear you're gonna be on telly?
The truth and nothing but, man.
Not in a supporting role, either.
- The subject, I'm gonna be.
- Jammy fuck, you.
Leading man.
- Has nobody any balls these days?
- That's what I said.
- Yeah?
- To his face.
- I agree with you 100%, Jerry.
- The faggot.
Is he a faggot? Bet you he is.
One of those fucks that tries too hard to be one of the ladies.
I read you.
Well, fair play to you.
Talking to your boss like that, I respect that.
You work your way up, that's what I say.
Develop your own show.
Call it Hard As Nails Cunts or something.
Then we'll collaborate.
Yellow-bellied fucks.
Listen, buddy, crime calls.
- I'll catch you again, all right?
- Catch you, man.
Motherfuckers.
You think people enjoy that kind of attitude? Because they don't.
Go on, do it again if it makes you feel so good.
Bloody state of you. What I should do now... is speak to your manager and have you fired... if I could only be bothered.
Don't know how well off you are.
Go on, do it. You know you want to.
I've changed my fucking mind!
There's a couple of jars smashed in that lane.
Clear them up, will you?
It's not my job, it's Thomas'.
He's on the brush.
Your job is to do what I tell you.
Now come on.
It's not Dolce Salsa, is it?
- It is, yeah.
- Can't do. Dolce Salsa makes me sick.
- All I have to do is smell the stuff.
- Move.
Thomas, wait there.
There you are. Do it.
Okay, man.
You're okay, Thomas.
I'm just trying to make a point.
For God's sake!
Told you.
You finished?
- You finished?
- Yeah.
Come with me.
Thomas, clear up that sick before someone slips in it.
I want you to get one thing straight.
I'm your boss, you do as I say.
Go home, repeat it, maybe it'll lodge.
One more incident like this, do you hear me? One more incident... and I will TCB, as they say in the States.
I will "take care of business".
You are here to do as you are told.
You are here to work.
So get back out there and do some.
Come on, Thomas, move it.
If you move it, you won't have to smell it.
- I know that you've been patient, Karen.
- Stop.
No, you have. Taking me shopping and everything, the classes.
Maybe it's a different kind of boost you need.
Something to remind yourself you're attractive, say.
Maybe you need to be chatted up or something.
- Flirted with, pursued...
- Wanted, Karen.
- That's what it is.
- Okay, then.
Let's do something about that.
- Here's one, Ben.
- What is it?
It's good.
Like all the other good stuff
I've read so far?
I'm getting a bit tired of your attitude, Ben.
You can't choose one, that's fine.
I've chosen one for you.
Read it... get the lads, and get on it.
But it's not up for discussion, Ben.
Hello?
They want us to go on...
They want us to go on telly.
Because of the accident, the bus.
Some man just rang.
They wanna do an interview.
Said to ring him back if we're interested, you know.
I'm telling you,
Jonesy said it's the best place to go.
- Maybe not the best, but the easiest.
- If you're desperate.
But I am, John. You know I am.
Jesus Christ.
See, if this is all the competition there is...
And some old ones are cute.
- Not too old.
- Where?
This is what Jonesy said.
You gotta scout about a bit.
I'll meet you in a while.
Pint of Guinness, please.
You dirty bastard.
Fancy a bit of mature, yeah?
Look, I know why you're here.
I've got my own business, you know?
Fish and chip shop.
- You like fish?
- Some fish.
- Not fish-and-chip fish.
- Right.
- You like chips, though?
- You know what I like? Onion rings.
Right.
Not the biggest fan of them myself.
It's about the only part of my produce that I'm not partial to.
Look, I'm not gonna beat around the bush, ladies.
But if we can't be compatible about business...
- Now, him I like.
- Who?
- That young guy?
- There's two of them.
If he asks me to dance, will you get up with his friend?
Come on. I'd feel silly on my own.
I mean, feck it, a woman my age... place like this, what's the point in lying?
That's my philosophy. The truth.
Life's too short. What was I saying?
The hormones, right.
No, it's not the worst thing... because since I've been on them,
I have to say...
I've been feeling very erotic.
You know what a younger man like yourself lacks?
A bit of mature loving.
You lack it because you don't look for it.
But let me tell you something.
I'm sporty.
I'm actually...
Celia, you're talking about honesty?
I'm actually just waiting on a mate. Sorry.
Okay.
I won't waste any more of your time.
- I found one.
- Yeah, what's she like?
- Will you dance with her mate? She's nice.
- What's her mate like?
- Which? The right or the left?
- The left.
- All right.
- The left's mine.
All right, fuck it.
- I hope you know, I've no interest.
- Me, neither.
So nothing's gonna happen.
We're just gonna dance, enjoy it, and we're going to finish when they finish.
- What's that perfume?
- Hey.
- I was just...
- Hey.
You come here often?
Yes?
No?
It's my first time.
I didn't know it'd be, you know...
Older people?
- That's okay.
- Older than me, say.
Are you a little shy, Oscar?
I think you are.
I think you're very nice, too.
Would you like to come home with me?
I know, I can't believe I said it, either.
But would you?
Blue Enigma.
My perfume.
You said...
You said you were waiting on a friend.
How dare you?
- If you don't want me, you tell me the truth.
- Who's this?
I'm coming here...
- Who the hell are you?
- Nice dancing with you.
How dare you? I'm coming here long enough not to need these lies.
I'm finished. I'm going to the toilet.
Did you hear what I said earlier on?
I'm coming here long enough not to need these lies.
Do you hear what I'm saying? You big liar!
Oscar, I'm splitting. Do you hear me?
- Will you be all right?
- Who'd have you anyway, you pug-ugly?
Fuck you.
Fucking liar.
So what do you wanna do?
Do you wanna go out?
Wouldn't mind staying in.
- Again?
- Why not?
I'm gonna take a bath.
- Can I help?
- You can bring me in a glass of wine.
Hello?
- Can I speak to Deirdre, please?
- Who's calling?
It's John.
- John she used to go out with?
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry, I can't put you on to her.
- Why not?
You're the competition, aren't you?
You're the ex.
- Sam, who is it?
- It's for me, Deirdre.
What is it you want, anyway?
You wanna win her back?
She's not going back.
- So what's the problem?
- The problem is it'd make me uncomfortable.
I'm sure you're not the worst, okay?
But as far as Deirdre's concerned, you're my enemy.
- Pal, you don't want me as your enemy.
- No?
I can make life hard, man. That's right.
Talk to me like you're talking,
I'll crack your baldy head, man.
And I know you're baldy.
I'll be the worst enemy...
You ever fucking had! Do you hear me?
All right, John boy?
Sorry for your troubles, man.
What? A pint of Guinness, please, Seamus.
Heard about your break-up.
This is Lehiff, by the way.
Come here, why don't you join us over here?
- We got some business...
- A proposition.
We got a proposition we wanna run by you.
- Potential of a few quid, man.
- Many a quid's potential.
Follow us over.
I need a bit of a lift at the moment, Oscar.
Bit of a pepping up.
Can you pep me up?
Good Jesus.
Look. Rough, man.
Bit of pain-slash-pleasure, you know?
Jesus, my cock's killing me, my bones, my muscles... but I'm energized.
- Good, because I've a proposition for you.
- A what?
Some business.
Come on, I'll tell you on the floor.
Fuck.
- It's my cock, John.
- Yeah, so you said.
I'm telling you. Pain-slash-pleasure.
Fucking aching me, it is.
Yeah, don't even ask about my balls.
So we hold the girlfriend hostage, say we'll kill her if he doesn't do as we say.
Drive him to the bank, two of us, the other stays with her... he gets us the money, we let her go.
Wear masks, whatever, disguise our identity.
Thing is, though, and this is the sweet, the poetic part, though, right.
The girlfriend is Deirdre.
You're joking? And the fella is...
Her fella. That's right, the baldy fuck.
Are you on?
- I don't think so.
- What?
Why don't you just ring her?
Tell her you want her back.
Fuck that. That's over now.
This is the new shit.
It's all a bit risky.
But vengeance, man, it's not about the money.
- Well, it is, but the satisfaction...
- That's you, John.
That's your reward. I'm sorry.
- Come on.
- It's too big. No, man.
And I wouldn't recommend you get involved, either.
I'm getting involved, all right,
I'm not passing this up.
- And if you were any kind of fucking mate...
- What?
- Fuck you!
- No, fuck you, man.
- If you were any use...
- I am use.
- Except for fucking fogeys.
- She's no fogey.
She may be older, but she's sporty.
And I'm taking exception to that description.
Granny, she is.
May have to break your face for you, you keep it up.
- You big cock, you.
- You're a cock!
No, you are. Big hairy prick, you.
Can't even get laid by a bird your own age.
Come here, feck me.
I've got you, man. Give up.
You got me on the wrassling.
See, when I start using my karate...
- Wrassling or karate...
- John! Oscar!
I'm sick of this now.
Come up to Mrs. Rooney's office.
Put a stop to this claptrap, once and for all.
Henderson!
Good shot, man.
Nice one, John.
Get off my groceries, will you, you knacker?
Fucking eejit.
I'm not going to the hospital, I told you.
Now Mr. Henderson has decided he doesn't want to bring the police into this.
But you understand we're going to have to terminate your employment, John.
Have you anything you'd like to say or...
Go fuck yourselves?
No, Tony, no, it's about what I expected.
I'm just so sorry it had to come to all of this.
- And you go fuck yourself, too.
- Enough of that.
No, Tony, if he hasn't even got the grace...
...or the originality to...
- Fuck youse.
- Hello.
- How you doing?
How are you?
Look at your woman's makeup.
Fuck. Take a chisel to get that off.
Hey. Youse off the telly?
- Yeah.
- Put me on.
- No.
- Go on, youse pricks. Put me on.
I'll do a dance for youse.
- What do you think? Riverdance.
- Fuck's sake.
- Okay. You all set?
- Yeah.
Let's get the heroic angle.
The mythic shot.
There's something wrong with the light here.
I don't see why we can't just shoot this thing straight on.
There's some sort of a shadow there that I can't seem to get rid of.
That's not, I don't think, shadow.
That's a moustache, Ben.
That's ruining it, isn't it, Charlie?
Sorry, Sally.
You hear this 'mythic shot' shit?
Could you step out of the shot for a minute?
Just for a minute.
Right, Maura.
What happened when the bus went over?
It must have been quite a surprise.
Could you tell us exactly how you felt?
Who the hell...
- Christ! What the fuck?
- What was that?
Actually, Maura, can we put Sally in for this one, please?
Do what you can with the moustache.
Lose the low angle if you have to.
I told you, if we shot simply, we'd be home by now.
Fucking mythic shot.
Sally, it'll be great.
Okay, let's go.
That's wanton, now.
Condolences, man.
Seriously.
- My stereo there?
- No.
- My sounds?
- No.
At least they had taste, the cunts.
You gonna put this in your film, Jerry?
- Hello?
- Call yourself a maverick?
Yeah.
Then be one, Ben. Do me anyway.
What?
Do your own film.
You have access, don't you?
Cameras and all that? Sound shit?
Wanna do the underbelly, don't you?
You said you did.
- I know.
- You said you were a maverick.
Well, this is how mavericks create.
Outside the system.
Oh, yeah.
But if you're prepared for that, let's do it.
- If not, well, okay, fine.
- No.
- Be a conformist.
- No, I'd like to, it's just...
Yea or nay, Ben?
Yea or nay?
Tonight on Little Big City... an accident could have become a catastrophe... if it weren't for the intervention of several brave passersby.
One of whom we have here with us.
We felt that a... well, actually, I felt that there were people... whose lives were in danger.
So I jumped on top of the bus.
The bus was on its side, actually... so it wasn't that high to jump on top of the bus.
- Oh, my God.
- What?
It's horrible, Ma.
Not on the bus, but in the bus.
I saw it through the window.
And I was frightened that there were people dead everywhere.
There weren't, there was just a few cuts and bruises.
- Damn.
- You didn't miss much, it's only your sister.
- Was she good?
- Not really.
She was a bit inarticulate, to tell you the truth.
- I was shit.
- No, you weren't.
My hair was shit. Yes, I was.
My moustache. I am like Burt Reynolds.
Fucking hell.
- Listen, do you mind if we stay in tonight?
- What?
- I'm knackered, do you mind?
- Sam!
Come on, Deirdre.
We don't have to go out every night, do we?
Every night?
I pay rent here.
I pay your rent on top of my own.
I give you money. I treat you well.
Is that not enough?
- It's not what I want, Sam.
- Well, what do you want?
- Come on, tickles.
- No. Put me down.
Fuck. What the fuck?
Listen. Fuck this.
- Oscar, I'm sorry, I...
- This is too much.
What's wrong with you? Jesus.
It was kinky at first, but my fucking jaw.
- Don't go, Oscar, please stay.
- Fuck that.
Look, you're better off finding someone into that shit, Noeleen.
- I won't, I'll stop.
- I'll see you again.
- Oscar, please. I'll stop.
- I'll see you again.
Oscar, I won't, I'll stop.
My fucking jaw.
It's like, I knew I had it, but I didn't care because I didn't see it.
Now I see it.
Now I do. I don't understand why I didn't.
It's like I kept it as a badge of,
I don't know... maybe of mourning or something.
I don't know.
Or courage.
I mean, you've been through the wars, love.
That's true. I've distinguished myself.
What about you, Ma?
You never thought of getting someone?
Getting married again?
I don't think I could, even if I wanted to.
Your father was...
- I don't know, I'd feel...
- You were betraying him?
No, I think he'd have wanted me to.
It's just, I still feel close to him, you know?
To have had someone like him in my life that special, I feel it's enough.
And who could ever give me what he gave me, anyway?
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.
His love, for one thing.
My home.
The times we had.
We did have times, Sally.
A whole load of memories.
The children he gave me.
My beautiful children.
With or without moustaches.
I feel blessed by all of that.
By you, Sally.
So why would I want for anything more?
I'm serious, love.
I know.
I've been so lonely, Ma.
I know you have, baby. I know you have.
It's all right.
Delicious, this.
I can feel it doing me good already.
Vitamins and shit. Carbs or whatever.
Think they're in the beans.
- You have any brown sauce?
- Sure.
Or is it the pudding?
Anyway, what time is it?
It's 7:30, we don't go till around 8:00.
That way a knock on the door won't be too strange.
Don't forget, I won't be talking.
That's right.
You can nod, whatever. Or grunt.
Write shit down.
There we go.
- You scummy fucker.
- Want some? It's nice, man.
Go on, give us a shot.
It's delicious.
Give us some of that.
It's gorgeous.
You got the gun and all, Lehiff?
- Give us a look.
- Here? Use your head, man.
- That's not fucking bad.
- I'm telling you, man.
I'll show youse after, all right?
That's fucking delish, man.
Be careful, you fuck.
Stick on some sounds, will you, to get us in the mood.
What have you got?
Clannad.
Fuck that, we'll do without.
Here, look at these.
I got them in the joke shop, so as we can drive the bloke to the bank.
Anyone looks, they see real people, but not the right people.
- Clever.
- Better fucking believe it.
This shite, you've gotta be
Stephen fucking Hawking.
Hawkings, which is it?
Hawking.
Where's your sis, Cathal?
- Why? She gonna be on this?
- I don't know.
What would she do to get on?
- She'd do anything you want, Jerry.
- To the camera.
To the camera, Cathal.
- Would she give me a riding?
- She might.
- The whore.
- She's not a whore.
This is Wayne, Ben.
Dealer.
He isn't doing much at the moment on account of surveillance.
That's right. Can't even take a shit in peace.
Reckon he's done the odd drive-by as well.
That'd be telling, Jerry.
What's this? A film?
Fucking scumbag.
It's a documentary.
About what?
About scumbags.
So tell the camera what it's like dealing death for a living.
Go on. Feeding filth to these poor addicts.
Fuckhole.
Are you looking for a shot, man?
Dislodge the champion off his podium?
Reckon I can do it, Jerry.
- You getting this, Ben?
- Reckon I can whup you!
See what I mean? Scum.
It's the only thing they understand, Ben.
Jesus.
How are you?
Who is it, Deirdre?
Okay, so these lads will go with Sam here.
And me, the really dangerous fuck of the trio, will stay with you. All right?
- Good.
- Okay, Sam?
Good. All right?
I won't.
- I will.
- All right, let's go.
What the fuck do you see in a fogey like that, anyway?
Can't say he'd be too energetic sackwise.
You can answer me.
That chick's a bit young for you, isn't she?
What would she be, 25, 26?
And gorgeous.
Suppose it's the old wage, though, isn't it?
That would attract them all right.
I'll tell you what, though, despite her material wants...
I'm talking about my own wife here now, she has them.
Me and her is based on more than that.
Snuggle her at night.
Get the old belly-fluts.
Does your woman give you that? No?
Or more to the point, do you give her it?
- You own this place?
- No.
Rent?
I wouldn't mind owning somewhere like here, now.
It's not the best by any means... but for a man of my humble wants, you know?
Is that a wok I see?
Very nice.
Are they worth getting?
You find you have much use for it?
I suppose.
Have my eye on a few kitchen appliances.
Woks, blenders.
Feel it's time I domesticated myself a little bit.
Wokked my own grub instead of always ordering in.
And what kind of oil would you use?
I hear olive's the best.
Well, that's what I use.
Right.
And what are the advantages you find it has above, say... chip-pan oil or...
You fucking idiot.
Right, now get back in there and make me some tea.
Go on.
All right. Go on, go.
You mean that, Mick?
What you said about the missus?
- About getting the fluts and all.
- Oh, yeah.
You think I didn't?
True love, man.
You feel it, you feel it.
What do you think?
Yeah.
You feel it?
With Deirdre, man.
I do.
It gets me in here.
Yeah.
That's where it gets you, all right.
Try and fuck with me?
Have to watch you like a vulture.
Don't want sugar. Get me brown sauce.
Brown sauce?
There's something wrong with that, is there?
It's the new fucking business, sure.
Everyone's doing it.
Not a bad old morning?
Hey, Sally.
- Should you not be in work?
- I took the day off.
Thinking of leaving altogether, actually.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it's pissing me off, you know?
What about yourself?
- It's my birthday next week.
- Yeah? Happy birthday.
Thanks.
And my mother got me one of those mall vouchers.
You know, you can use it in any shop.
So I'm gonna get a makeover.
- Nice massage.
- Treat yourself?
Bit of a facial. Exactly, yeah.
- Get my moustache waxed.
- What moustache?
Oscar, come on.
You've a bit of hair there, but it's hardly a ronnie, man.
Needs a bit of bleaching's all that needs.
Do you want a coffee?
Hey, I was just on my way up to you.
What's up with your phone? Is it broke?
Or more to the point...
Slow down a second.
More to the point, where were you last night?
- Leave me alone, Karen.
- What?
I get you.
This new man in your life, is that it?
Now that everything's peaches and cream, it's dump your friends... leave them hanging, is that it?
Stop a second, will you, for fuck's sake!
Is that the explanation?
After all the effort I put into you, the time I spent, the...
- Stop, I said!
- Get your fucking maulers off me!
Lookit, look at this.
Oh, man, it's bulging.
Prepare to be rich.
Prepare to fucking...
Where the fuck is he going?
Sam!
What the fuck?
Who's that?
I'm sorry!
Where's the bag?
What the fuck? Some chick.
She's vicious, man.
She's an animal.
Look at her milling into the fucker.
- I'm sorry, Noeleen.
- You okay?
Yeah. Yes, it's okay.
Retaliate, you dope.
Grab the bag, stand the fuck up and...
Coppers.
Sketch, man, skedaddle, will you? Jesus.
- Get off him. Come on.
- Calm down, madam, will you?
- I don't believe it. Who was that?
- Don't fucking know.
That's it now.
All that risk, that work, for nothing.
I promised Cathy a shed out the back.
What the fuck will I tell her now?
You know those sheds?
Store your shovels and shit.
Your lawnmower.
The fuck?
- That's the little fucker who stoned my bus.
- So? We've gotta get back, man.
- Fuck that.
- What the fuck do you mean, 'Fuck that'?
- What about Deirdre?
- You're the one that loves her, you go back.
I've my own mission here.
Mick!
Right, he's moving.
- Looking for love, it's tough.
- It is.
- How did we get on to this?
- Don't know.
And it's frightening.
- A lot of bad decisions you can make.
- Yeah, a lot of wrong turns, exactly.
Potential for heartbreak, for hurt.
But you persevere.
- You reckon?
- Yeah.
- You've got to, do you not think?
- No, I do.
I mean, what else is there?
Exactly.
What the fuck else is there?
Who is it?
What's going on?
What the fuck does this mean?
Where's you-know-who?
Are you fucking around here?
Take this fucking thing.
What's going on, man?
She got out of order.
Now who's this crazy old one?
Fuck that, fuck her. Where is everyone?
Don't write it, tell me. Are you listening?
I'm a prick? You're a prick!
If this is fucked up, I wanna know how.
I said talk now, man.
- Who's got the money?
- Why did you hit her?
- Because she's a cunt!
- John.
Now tell me.
You're after blowing your cover, sure.
Shut the fuck up, or I'll smack you again.
And don't give me any more of this mad old shit. Tell me!
Fuck. Look what you're after making me do.
Fuck this.
Are you all right?
Fuck, Deirdre, fuck.
Jesus, I'm late.
They said they'd a cancellation for 10:00, but if I miss that...
- You better hurry.
- It's great to see you, Oscar.
And, come here, if you wanna leave your job, you know what I say?
Leave your fucking job.
Go somewhere you're treated right.
Thanks for the coffee.
Do you wanna go out some night?
We have a hit, huh?
Yeah.
Respect. From one maverick to another?
Professional.
Get in!
- What?
- We're not finished yet. Come on.
- You ever been in a high-speed pursuit?
- No.
Well, buckle up and get filming.
Of all the cunts.
This is where we separate the men from the faggots.
Film me when I talk, man.
Come on, you fuck, you.
Is that all you got?
That your best?
Bollocks.
After costing me my job.
- Fuck, where's he going?
- You filming me?
He's going to the country.
- You're out of your element now, pal.
- So are we, Jerry.
Shut the fuck up.
I am gonna nab you directly.
I'm right behind you, you little fuck.
I won't hurt you, come here.
Step on the bumper, will you?
Put your weight on it, so I can climb back.
Please.
Sorry, sheep.
Got to put you down, man.
Out of your misery.
It was you, you fuck! You stole my motor.
You shouldn't have pissed on my legs, man.
- Fuck's sake, and my sounds, man!
- Shit sounds.
You were playing them, fuckhole!
You hear this fucking hypocrite?
Anyway, the power of certain artistes... is beyond the ken of cunts like you.
You just don't have the requisite Celtic soul, man.
Yes, I do.
That's a brave fucking statement, huh?
Would you like the chance to back that up?
You and me.
Hand to hand.
You win...
I let you go.
Okay.
Are you getting this, Ben? Come on!
This episode will be entitled
"Personal Justice".
Come on, you fucking scumbag, you, come on.
Good lad.
Jerry!
...over 80 miles an hour.
The chase, which ended here and resulted in destruction of livestock... the vicious shoot-out and the loss of a life.
Detective Jerry Lynch... a 15-year veteran of the Garda Siochána, distinguished himself...
- Was it the money?
- No.
- To hurt me?
- Deirdre.
- Him?
- Maybe a little bit, I don't know.
- You were an idiot. You know that? Always.
- I know.
Always the same shit, or ever since I've known you.
Taking the long way to get what you want, and fucking everything up on the way.
- Anything but ask, huh?
- I might be refused.
Anything but say what you need.
You have to take that chance, John.
And you're right, you might be refused, but on the other hand...
You know?
- Might's not definite, is it?
- No.
It's a vague enough term at best.
Tell me what you need, John.
Hey, fuckhole, look at you. Give us a look.
See you, John.
Sure, it's only a flesh wound.
So action-fucking-central, huh?
So tell us about it.
Come on, man, tell.
Shit happens you can't change.
You've no choice but to deal with it, adapt to it.
Other shit, though, you have the choice, the means to improve your situation... and change things.
That's what you do, don't you?
- You do.
- Try to make yourself happy.
This is philosophy, George.
This is life. Come on.
More.
Succor, you know? Satisfaction.
I mean, take me for example, my handicap.
Or what you might call my handicap.
Snap! Hey, snap!
What's up, man?
I'm bricking.
Relax, they haven't got you yet.
They're not gonna.
What did you say at the hospital?
Said I was mugged and dumped in the canal. Filed a report and all.
So fuck it. Keep the cool, we'll be hunky.
What about Deirdre?
She won't say anything, you know?
No, what about her and you, man?
Have youse finished your little intermission?
What?
I'll race you. Come in here, think you're the king on wheels?
- I'm the king round here.
- Fine.
Me.
Are you chicken, pal?
You afraid to face the king?
- Because you're not, you know.
- Not what?
The king. You may be the prince.
Jerry!
Come in.
- Did you see me on the news?
- Yeah.
- "Detective hero".
- Yeah, I know, but come here.
The way it was told is the way it has to be.
I know.
- You saved my life. You're the hero, Ben.
- Hey.
No, I mean it.
As a token of my respect, no, fuck that, my admiration...
I want you to have these.
- Wow, Fainne Lasta.
- You've earned them.
A warrior soul, Ben.
A kindred soul.
I better go empty my colostomy bag.
- We'll meet again, no doubt.
- Yeah. On the streets, huh?
On the streets.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
- Hey, Maura.
- Hello, John.
Can I talk to you?
Sure.
- If you don't shut up, I will race you.
- I hope so.
I'll show you, you fucker. Come on.
I just wanna say a couple of things to you, all right?
Now, I'm not asking for anything, so don't feel any pressure.
- Okay.
- Just listen.
This is a list of things that I want... and have wanted... for a long time.
Straight from the heart, no fucking around.
To be with you... to live with you, and to... eventually, you know, marry you.
To have your child...
- For me to have yours?
- Yes. All my children.
- However many, three, four...
- Go on.
To grow old with you.
To know... and that's the main thing... to know, all right... that you feel the same.
That's it.
How hard was that?
Hard enough.
Well, I do feel the same.
- What's wrong?
- Not in front of your ma.
You fucking prude!
They don't mind.
- Will you ever cheat on me?
- Never.
- Will you take care of me?
- Always.
- Will you ever neglect me?
- No.
- Raise a hand to me?
- No.
Take a shit on me?
Do you want me to?
I have had enough of you.
Fucking coming in here every night...
On your marks. Get set. Go!
Where are you, you grumbling old piece of shit, youse?
Come on, you old fucker.
Oh, my leg.
Default, man.
Where is he?
Default. There was an obstacle.
Do you see this?
I am the king of the world.
The king of the Republic of Ireland.
Saw you on the box, love.
- Yes?
- You were shit.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
And thank you because you are out of here.
So, you and Sally, man.
Who'd have thought?
Fucking love her, man.
Here, wait till I tell you what we did last night.
Don't, man, fuck's sake.
You're right. Keep it to myself, I will.
- Cherish it.
- That's it.
Relish it, I will.
So, you relish being out of a job?
Fucking right.
No getting up, no taking orders.
- No Henderson.
- That's the best bit.
- Being free of that fuck.
- Absolutely.
- Are you off, Mr. Henderson?
- I am, indeed, Mrs. Rooney.
A little R&R, as they say in the States.
Isn't it lucky for some?
I am the boss.
I have authority.
You are the minion.
You're beneath.
I have the power.
What do I have?
I'm sorry, I didn't get that. Speak up.
What do I have?
That's right.
That's absolutely...
What the fuck?
- Where the hell is it?
- Just do it manually.
Are you sitting on it?
Just do it manually.
This is good.
You can see the nocturnal activities...
No, I saw this one. Something else.
Is it under you?
Keep going. Come on.
No, back one.
Back one.
Jack, thank God you're home!
- Amy, what's wrong?
- I need your help.
It's Connie, she's run away again!
She's only 15.
How does my daughter fall for this slimeball?
- Do you know him?
- Yeah, I met him once.
His name is Zip.
That's a great name, huh?
- Jack, you're a cop.
- Grand Theft Auto.
You want Missing Persons.
You know where he lives?
Something like Trump Street...
- or Trout Street or....
- Turk Street?
- Yeah, it's Turk Street.
- So tell Missing Persons.
Got a list a mile long.
When they get her, she'd be the age...
- I wanted her to leave.
- She'll be back.
It's three days, Jack.
I'm really scared.
- Amy, I'm...
- I know.
You're going on vacation, some music festival.
A week with you and your cello.
That will be so different for you.
I know I'm just your neighbor.
I had no business asking.
You have a great time, okay?
I was planning on blacking him out.
I'm glad I didn't.
Can't be that different from looking for a car, right?
Turk Street.
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry. You okay?
- You mustn't bother.
No bother. Just get out of the rain.
Come on, come on.
So you don't live in the neighborhood?
- No, I'm looking for someone.
- You can just set them down there.
No, no, no. I'll take them into the kitchen.
Well, this way.
Thomas, we have a visitor!
Don't be alarmed, we have a stranger in the house.
- Thomas. Dear, this is...
- Jack.
Jack Friar.
This is Mr. Quarre. I'm Mrs. Quarre.
Now, who is it you're looking for,
Jack, a friend?
No, a suspect.
Well, not a suspect, really.
A young man.
You're a policeman.
- I really should be going.
- Oh, dear, don't go.
- I'll put on some water for tea. You...
- Thanks, but I have to go.
We won't hear of you leaving.
I must thank you for your kindness.
Now, it's Indian tea.
"Indian" Indian. Not the ones we beat the crap out of.
No, I really must go.
This one's made from hardwood.
Oak. Mahogany.
I got one made in Africa, from ivory.
Maybe one of your cousins carved it.
Jack.
Tell us about the suspect.
Is he a lone operator or a member of some vicious gang?
- He seems to be an operator. Yeah.
- What does he look like?
I'll show you.
He had blond hair, blue eyes....
Stand up.
Stand up.
- Now, how did you find me?
- What?
I said, how did you find me?
Find you? Who are you?
You smart-ass.
Swung on the bat, back over the right side.
Patterson showing why he has
28 saves already this season.
- You like baseball?
- It's just a little bump, officer.
I checked it out.
- Ready for your tea?
- I don't like tea.
Well, who does? Tea is for Chinks.
Give him a real drink.
- Would you like a shot?
- Make it a Mai Tai.
- That's what we drank in Korea.
- Who are you people?
What happened here?
This cop showed up looking for us.
- Me at least.
- That's why we kept him here, boss.
For you to decide.
What did you hit him with?
- No guns.
- No guns.
Do I have to post a list of rules at the front door?
It might help.
Has anyone else a gun?
Sure.
Finally got a hit, shithead.
Come on, Miller, knock him in!
- Listen, Mr...?
- Quarre.
- Quarre.
- It's an alias.
I really had a photograph, not of that psychopath, but I...
There's a game on.
He pops one up on the first pitch.
Thank you, dear.
- Don't gloat.
- I'm not gloating.
Don't be a sore loser.
- Maybe he's onto us for Seattle.
- You shouldn't have let him see you.
I wasn't just gonna let him walk out of here.
The questions are, what are we gonna do with him?
And what if there are more of him?
Kill him.
We do not kill.
Because the penalties for killing are so distasteful.
Yeah, it's easy for you to say.
He didn't have your picture.
He has no picture.
Perhaps we should outfit you with a wooden club and a loincloth.
Are you...?
Are you calling me backward?
The best way to chase something, Hoop... is to let it chase you.
Greetings, Erin.
Business. That's what you always say.
"This is a business."
Tell the old people the schedule's been moved up a day.
A day?
- That's today.
- That's why you'll wanna hurry.
Sorry.
You should try to have a calming influence on Hoop.
Rather than an inflammatory one.
Is it your place to tell me who not to inflame?
As a matter of fact, it is.
With this rose, I thee wed.
All things in good time.
Until then, lover and loved.
Pimp and whore.
Coarseness does not become you.
That sick fuck.
- It'll all be over soon.
- All of it?
- This job, our last.
- You and him?
- That over?
- What do you mean?
You know what I mean. He hurts you... keeps us down.
I gotta pack.
I'll help.
- Tyrone sees you in my bedroom...
- We're just talking, for chrissake.
Okay.
Later, then.
Hoop.
I never chose Tyrone.
Yeah, but sometimes you laugh at me with him.
He expects it from me.
- Don't you understand that?
- Fucking cop's listening.
The cop's not our problem.
Tyrone.
So we leave the airstrip no later than 8 p.m.
Don't smoke that in here.
I'm sure as hell not gonna miss you telling me what to do.
- Control freak.
- Control is a good thing, Thomas.
You could do with more of it.
Control that.
Now, we land in Bermuda no later than 2 a.m.
- Correct?
- Aye, aye, sir.
We refuel and Hoop pilots the balance of the journey to the Caymans.
- Is he taking his meds?
- Yes, I assume so. Why?
I have to teach him to fly, but I'm not responsible if he flies off the handle.
I will control Hoop.
- How did you know where to find us?
- I didn't.
You're not who I'm looking for.
I have a picture...
Yeah. You have a picture, all right.
Of a guy with blond hair, blue eyes.
- I'm looking for a girl.
- Oh, now it's a girl.
You know, I just can't keep your story straight.
Hoop!
- Stop it!
- All right.
Settle down.
These are too tight.
Eventually, I'm gonna be alone with you, cop.
Get away from him!
Is that better?
Thanks.
There is a picture.
And there is a girl.
Was it out of willfulness or out of stupidity you let this man see you?
I'm sorry, Tyrone... but I think he seems to have seen you too.
No, he hasn't.
Seems he's smarter than you.
She's like a spoiled child.
Hateful towards those who take care of her.
- And yet totally dependent.
- Leave her alone.
And Hoop... is the spoiled boy.
The spoiled boy to whom I gave a future... despite the metal plate in his head and the diagnosed psychosis.
Now, Hoop, was it the belle of tacos or the king of burgers... which had most recently rejected your services?
What are you laughing at, cop?
It's good that our stay in these close quarters nears its end.
- Brunch is ready.
- No, brunch is canceled.
The unexpected appearance by the cop has altered our plans.
Excuse me, I have been cooking since his goddamned appearance.
No one said anything.
Well, perhaps brunch is just what we need.
Who would like to say the blessing?
- How about our guest?
- He should say a prayer.
- Leave him alone.
- You haven't anything to worry about.
I'm sure everything will go as planned.
I'll say the blessing.
Dear Lord, for that which we are about to receive...
Ten million dollars, amen!
You always forget the ketchup.
Bring me a beer.
Please.
No, thank you.
He's probably not used to eating a proper breakfast.
This is delicious.
Remember, you're flying, Thomas.
I flew 57 missions in Korea, and I was drunk every time. Don't you tell me...
Let him drink. I'll fly the damn plane.
Pilot to copilot, shut up while I'm telling my story.
Excuse me, dear, but nobody gives a titty about your story.
Well, I don't want this punk interrupting me.
Come on, old man. You wanna fly us?
I'll let you fly. Come on.
Come on! First one's free.
Are you children?
Must I put you in separate rooms?
Take him into the kitchen.
- You brought the cops.
- Shut up.
You defective little prick.
It's our banker friend. Delay him.
Keep him out of the house.
Your clothing is inappropriate.
Go change it.
- David, what are you doing here?
- Well, I needed to see Erin.
She left me a message, said it was important.
- She's not available just now.
- Where is she?
Frankly, I don't know.
I just came in from shopping.
I'm sure she'll get in touch with you later.
Why don't you go back to your office.
If Mr. Quarre knew you were playing hooky... he might not look so kindly on you dating his granddaughter.
David!
Erin!
Hey.
It's happening today.
- What?
- Yeah. Now.
- Why?
- Well, I don't know why... but everyone says it has to be.
Look, I can't.
If you want us to be together, you have to.
Go back to the bank, and we'll see you soon, okay?
David, I'm on the street in my robe.
Look, I adore you.
Thomas, Isabelle. If we're delayed, simply wait at the landing field.
Keep your cell phone on, in case of a problem. Erin!
You'll stay and entertain our guest.
What about David? He expects me.
I will deal with David.
- Hoop?
- Yeah.
Good.
So shall we?
Take my bags.
Both of them.
Be available to take calls.
David may need to hear your devoted voice for reassurance.
You're art.
Do not fade.
You comfortable?
Been better.
Hey, you okay?
May I have some water?
Water?
You look a little stressed.
- Look, Miss...?
- Erin.
Erin, you need to let me go... before that headcase, Hoop, comes back to kill me.
Tyrone won't let Hoop kill you.
Tyrone... is against killing.
So....
Do you want any kind of music?
Would you like some music?
Look, miss, please...
I can't let you escape.
Then I would have to escape, and no one escapes Tyrone.
That's ridiculous.
Is it?
This is how Tyrone says,
"You shouldn't have left."
It's all right. I get 10 percent off my pedicures now.
- Are you taking your medication?
- Why?
You appear agitated.
Yeah. Well, you piss me off.
They got a medication to make you stop doing that?
So, what do you plan on doing with your share of the money?
I don't know.
I want... I wanna breed dogs.
Back in Utah.
Excellent.
So is there a young lady in the picture?
Maybe there is, maybe there isn't.
- David Brewster.
- We're here. Hoop is beginning.
- Why are we doing this today?
- What?
- What did you say?
- I need an explanation.
Your explanation comes in the form of your share of the money.
- Is Erin there?
- No, she's not.
But I have complete faith you can swindle your bank without her.
Just make sure you're available when I enter.
You don't look so good.
That's because you're used to looking at you.
Maybe that drink wasn't such a good idea. What should I do?
What should you do? Find that picture so you can see I was telling the truth.
And you can tell your friends.
I look a lot better when I'm not waiting for someone to kill me.
All right.
Listen, I couldn't find the picture, okay?
I walked the whole block.
Hey.
Oh, God.
Please don't die.
Don't die. Please.
Shit!
Shit!
How you doing, leatherhead?
I got the generator set up, just in case this storm messes with the lights.
How's it look?
Oh, it looks great.
I've been thinking about those missions...
- Has the plane been fueled?
- Yep.
And I'll be here just as long as you need me.
Excuse me, sir.
I put your kit in the fridge.
You could have let me die.
"Cop dead from a diabetic coma."
It's perfect.
Dump the body somewhere.
Nobody would ever know he'd been kidnapped.
I guess I owe you one.
I mean that.
I noticed your suitcases were packed.
Were you supposed to be somewhere else today?
Not on Turk Street.
Like where?
The Berkshires.
A fantasy camp for frustrated musicians.
Basketball junkies go to
Michael Jordan's basketball clinic.
I get my fix playing with Yo-Yo Ma.
Your apartment struck me as lonely.
Don't cops dream?
Nightmares mostly.
I don't trust you leaving here without seeing Erin.
Then by all means, you should call her for your assurance.
I trust she's at home.
Women talk.
Some excessively.
- Yes?
- We got problems.
The system is patched into a backup power source...
- that's very complicated.
- Can you deactivate it?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm working on it.
It's just gonna take some time.
- How much?
- I don't know.
Two, three minutes tops.
Do it.
Did I hear what I just heard?
I was a state-sponsored prodigy until Moscow collapsed.
My peers became prostitutes, musically or otherwise.
I met a man in a bar.
Tyrone became your ticket out.
He said he saw my potential. I flattered myself he meant my music.
So you guys are robbing a bank, right?
How?
Just smile.
So tell me about the Federal Reserve.
You really don't know who we are?
I'm just a cop who finds stolen cars, who's looking for a lost girl.
And look, you found one.
You are not lost.
It would take a search party to find me.
What are you doing?
Stand.
Have a seat. We have backup generators.
Ladies and gentlemen, please calm down.
- The problem will be fixed.
- Send the money.
- Send the money! Send the money!
- Please remain calm.
Sir, could you help us shine the light...?
I'm sorry. I'm sure the problem is just momentary.
I don't have moments. Tell your loan officer to wire my loan immediately.
We wire funds electronically.
Our computers are...
Well, to hell with your computers!
My funds must be sent by 6:00!
Sir, I'm afraid that if wiring the funds is an impossibility, the agreement...
Have you heard of this device? Can it not be used to transfer said funds?
Sir, please, just calm yourself.
If you would, just step into my office.
Would you mind, please?
Do you know Chanson Triste by du Parc?
Do you like being tied up in a chair?
Or would you rather play some beautiful music?
How much are we talking about?
Ten million. Our spread is substantial.
It went to committee.
Now, think lender liability, sirs.
If those funds aren't in escrow by day's end... my company will lose a $100 million contract.
So consider that to be your true exposure.
My laptop is charged.
I could modem it through.
I'm calling my lawyer.
Sir, that won't be necessary.
Get the laptop.
I missed a few notes.
That's a nice piece.
I've never played it before.
I know what I want for saving your life.
What's that?
They say playing the cello is like dancing.
Show me.
How?
You'd have to put the gun down.
That's crazy.
I believe in the concept of a man and a woman... and the man owing her one.
I mean, you did say that, didn't you?
That you owe me one.
Don't do this.
Damn you.
Put your hand on mine.
A.
D.
G.
I could break your neck.
I should.
Yeah, you should.
Are we done?
Yeah, we're done.
We're even.
This disk contains all the relevant routing information... account numbers and passwords.
It's your authentication.
Great, just a little more paperwork.
Now... about Erin.
He insists on meeting Erin at his place.
We don't have time for this.
Do we know where the banker lives?
Yeah, it's over the mountain.
It's a haul.
- You've been there?
- I drove her a couple times.
- I thought they met in restaurants.
- Well, maybe he cooks.
Go there.
Tyrone called. He said it could be another couple of hours.
I sent Willy for dinner.
Tyrone? And you trust him?
This job is no different from Seattle or Sydney or Dallas or Miami... and he still needs us.
Unless he thinks he can take a bus to the Caymans.
But this is our last one.
Then he wouldn't have called.
Do you think we'll be happy in Fiji?
We can have sex on the beach.
- Oh, Thomas!
- Let's go wait in the airplane.
You know I won't have sex on airplanes.
But this one's on the ground.
When was he leaving the bank?
He should have been here 45 minutes ago.
She gabs on the phone, even if the outcome remains unsettled.
Not even you would be that dimwitted.
Maybe the two of them are working together.
- Get out of the car.
- What?
- Get out of the car!
- Why?
Watch for him.
Hey, it's raining out here!
Then go inside.
- Get in!
- But there's an accident.
I don't want to hear about it. Get in!
You see that?
- What?
- This! This, this, this!
- Just how would he find you?
- Not by looking.
He knows where I'd go.
He can hear me think.
What would he do when he found you?
Maybe he'd kill me.
Maybe you could prevent that from happening.
Maybe he and Hoop are coming back to kill you.
You worked your way partially free from the bonds.
You'd have no choice but to kill them in self-defense.
So give me the gun.
We could wind up with $10 million.
You know what happens to cops who have $10 million?
- They eat their service revolvers.
- Open your mind, Jack.
You're more than a cop.
I'm more than a thief.
You'd know that if you were paying attention.
I have been.
And I know.
Erin?
Where is she?
Erin!
Hey, banker boy.
- What are you doing in my house?
- You should thank him.
Look what a splendid effort he made infiltrating your bank today.
Where's the disk?
Gee, it's locked.
There's no fucking disk.
Where is it?
Oh, hey, what's this, huh?
Go ahead. It's password-protected.
Okay! Okay! Okay!
Okay, but I just risked everything for Erin.
So you think I'm gonna blab now just to get out of a beating?
Well, ticktock.
What time is it?
They haven't called.
They must have left you behind.
Or should I say, they left your ass?
- They wouldn't.
- Oh, and a fine ass it is.
You can sit on it until my friends start looking for me.
Or you can cut me loose, come in with me and tell what happened.
Damn!
What?
What?
Bastard.
I'm to blame now? Go right ahead, but that doesn't change the facts.
They didn't need you, so they left you.
Just shush! God.
- Hello?
- Why has the phone been occupied?
I'm sorry, I didn't know it was off the hook.
- So why didn't you check it?
- How was I supposed to know?
Your friend here insists on seeing you... before he gives us our information.
You must have fucked your way into his heart.
Hoop's on his way for me.
I have to get ready.
- Is this your first crime?
- Yeah.
No embezzlement, no juggling the...?
- No, nothing.
- Not even as a kid?
- No shoplifting, no peeping Tom?
- Hardly.
So this really is your inauguration.
- Take my advice...
- You know, I stole my dad's car once.
- Really?
- Yeah, drove it to Mexico.
- So, what happened?
- Drove it off a cliff.
Never even told my father.
Apparently, driving isn't one of your talents.
- Come on in here. Come on.
- Jack, please.
Come on.
Keep coming.
Come on, pick up the phone.
- What are you doing?
- Pick it up!
Pick this up.
I can make it look like he died escaping.
Don't.
Now, you go get some more rope.
Remember what's to happen later.
Tyrone.
Not until we have the disk and the password.
- Just me?
- Just you.
Oh, how fetching you look, my dear.
Perfect for a late date.
- David.
- Erin.
I tried to be there, but they left without me.
Quick, what's the password?
- We need some time together.
- Well, there's no time.
Well, certainly a short interlude can be squeezed in for young lovers.
Give me the gun, Hoop.
Give them 15 minutes, no more.
I did it! I did it.
I knew you could. Come here, come here.
Not giving Tyrone the password was so smart. You're so smart.
God, who knows what he would have done if I wasn't here?
- So, what is it?
- Oh, no, no, no.
I'm going to the Caymans with you.
You cannot be seen with Tyrone.
Not now, not ever.
I'm only gonna be gone for a few days.
And then we can go away together like we planned.
- I don't think I can wait any longer.
- Oh, you poor thing.
As soon as we get the money.
I promise.
Enough promises.
Oh, shit.
I was dreaming.
We were on this beach.
I looked wonderful in my bikini.
- Yes?
- What the hell are you pulling, huh?
- Our friend became difficult.
- Difficult?
You haven't seen difficult, I have.
Try a battalion of gooks squirting napalm up your butt.
I'll tell you what's difficult.
- And you've been amply rewarded.
- Listen to me, ass-face.
The bank could still figure this out.
- Hey.
- Hoop?
Banker boy, did you have fun, huh?
Your time's up, I'm sorry.
- What are you doing?
- You have a good time?!
- Fuck you!
- Stop! It's not his fault!
- Was your dick hard, huh?!
- Stop it!
- You fuck!
- Leave him alone!
- It's not his fault, it's my fault!
- Shut up!
Stay out of this! This is not about you!
Stay there!
What's the matter, Romeo?
Having a little trouble with your pants?
Let me help you!
Fuck! Fuck! You fuck!
What are you gonna do, huh?
- You stupid....
- Please stop, please.
Hey, I told you, stay out of it!
I don't want to hurt you!
Fuck!
You wanna dance, huh!
I'm sorry, did that hurt?
- Stop it!
- Did that hurt? Get up.
Get up! Here, come on. Yeah!
Come on. Come on, banker boy.
You pussy!
- She's mine.
- Stop it!
- She's mine. She's mine!
- Tyrone!
Tyrone!
You have to hurry.
Hoop's gone crazy. He's killing David!
I couldn't stop him. I couldn't.
He just snapped.
His 15 minutes was up.
Did you get the password?
You?
No, I didn't get the password, you see, because I was too busy fucking him!
Can you think of any reason
I shouldn't let you hang for this?
Tom! Tom! It's looking pretty fierce out there!
- We better take care of the lights!
- Don't worry, darling, I'll do it.
- Thomas, go get your slicker.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We'll give him one more hour.
Maybe it's....
E-R-l-N.
Password accepted.
You know, it might be the Quarres.
Continue north, Hoop.
- What about the plane?
- We don't need a plane.
We'll be driving to our destination.
I see no reason to share this with that boorish man and that insipid woman.
Our shares will increase accordingly.
Is somebody planning on telling me where we're going?
We're driving to Albany, New York... where I've cultivated some banking relationships.
- Then what?
- Then a mere three-hour drive... to the Canadian border.
I need to use the bathroom.
- You should've done that at the house.
- I didn't know that at the house.
We have a six-hour drive to Albany.
And if we're not out of the country by 2 p.m... you'll have no pot to piss in.
We need to get gas anyway.
Fill it up quickly and check the tires.
Erin, do me a favor.
Wipe off the dead banker.
Tyrone... the cop had this.
He wasn't looking for Hoop for beating up some clerk in Seattle... he was looking for you.
Maybe I shouldn't have told you.
Tell him.
I arranged for you to get the gun.
- He wants you to kill the cop.
- Yeah.
But it's not what we want.
Yeah.
Okay.
What?
Tire.
We're in the middle of nowhere.
Why have you stopped here?
- I'm gonna check the spare.
- What do you mean "the spare"?
Didn't I tell you to check it back at the gas station?
Any last words, Brainiac?
I'll spare you my wisdom.
You'll forsake it.
Oh, no, please. I'm sure I'll miss it.
I'll look at your life as a novel, Hoop.
This being the tragic moment at which, in the ultimate irony... our headstrong hero shoots himself in the brain.
So let me get this straight, you're my brain?
Not only that, I'm also the restraint that you lack.
Stand back.
Without me, you would be in prison or worse.
You really think you would thrive so without me?
Witness tonight because I was standing right beside you.
You killed a man.
Once you shoot me, you'll have killed two men today.
And the cop, three.
Do it.
Do you imagine that Erin...?
That Erin will ride into the sunset with you?
Shut that music off!
- Turn it down!
- Okay! Okay.
- Hoop, what are you doing?
- What?
Nothing.
Our friend only got a little overexcited.
It's better now, Hoop, isn't it?
Yeah.
So get in the car.
Not you.
- Were you behind this?
- You told me to give him the gun.
- So the policeman really is after me?
- Yes.
We'll see.
An unfortunate detour, I'm afraid.
- I need the gun.
- No, use another method.
I've seen that you can.
Go.
Hoop, wait!
Well, now, my dear.
Witnessing an execution you caused is only going to be awkward.
What could you possibly say to the man?
Cop...
I told you I'd be back.
I hope you know how to die fast... because we need to be in Albany by 8.
You know how to die fast?
Die fast, cop. Fast.
Faster. Faster. Faster.
Faster. Faster. Faster. Faster, cop.
Spare yourself the effort.
We lack time, so forgive my brevity.
Were you carrying a photograph... when you stumbled upon our house this morning?
- Yeah.
- Now look at me.
Was the picture of me?
- Was this the picture?
- That wasn't the picture.
That wasn't the fucking picture, okay?
Leave him alone.
The truth is, it hardly matters.
A killing has already occurred.
Not just this one, but another man as well... so the stakes have been raised.
It makes sense to clean up loose ends.
And I'm a loose end.
The loosest.
Erin... come here.
- Now....
- No.
- Just put your finger there.
- No.
Easy, this is your baptism.
Think because you've already killed, killing me is no big deal?
You kill me and every cop on the planet's work takes a sudden vacation.
You become the case that never closes.
They never stop hunting.
You'd be job one.
Pay attention, Erin, because this applies to you too.
When they catch you, wherever they catch you, they're gonna subdue you.
And they're gonna subdue you substantially.
They'll tell you to run.
That'll confuse you... because you never heard that before.
Then your animal brain's gonna kick in with the survival mode.
Tell you stupid shit like,
"They're letting me go." So you'll run.
And then what?
Then they shoot your dumb ass.
Well... don't you think they have to catch me?
Oh, you're thinking all that money is gonna help you hide.
Funny, because shit-for-brains over there told me about your time frame.
Now, if you planned on driving to Albany in six hours... you were gonna use the New Jersey Turnpike.
You're probably gonna drive at night.
But now you're late, and you hadn't counted on rush hour.
If you think you're gonna make that drive, you got another thing coming.
Dearest, I don't remember hearing anything about Albany.
I knew it. You dirty, double-crossing bastard. Put it down.
Nobody's trying to cross you, Thomas.
Give him the disk. Now.
Oh, God, what have I done?
Oh, God.
This is a well-oiled machine.
Look, why don't you take me with you.
- Why?
- You can't get the money on your own.
But you can with my help. My car's got flashing lights and a siren.
I can still get you to Albany in time.
Get as much of the money as you can,
I drive to the border, you go across.
Hey, you promise me a share, maybe I'll cross with you.
- And then what?
- First of all, I need some more insulin.
Secondly... when we get across, we let the girl decide who she wants to go with.
You propose driving through a busy city with a captive policeman.
You must think me a foolhardy man.
Make a turn at the next corner. Left.
Now left again.
I thought we were going to the freeway.
Turn again. Left.
Go there.
Out of the car, both of you.
Further.
Here.
So how do you move $10 million?
Send the money to a number of banks... in amounts small enough not to draw attention.
Hey.
Why don't you try and get some sleep.
Oh, man, it's worse than I thought.
Hey, hang on. It's gonna get bumpy.
Nicely done.
Oh, man.
Hey, what are you gonna do, shoot me in the back while I'm driving?
- Mr. Leeds, please.
- Yes, can you hold, please?
- Yes, I'll hold.
- So who's going in to grab the money?
- Me?
- Don't be absurd.
I trust you no more than I trust her.
- Yes, Mr. Clifford Leeds, please.
- This is Mr. Leeds.
Welcome back, Mr. Abernathy.
It's been so long.
One more thing, I'm a bit ill.
Would it be possible for me to pick up the checks at the drive-thru?
- Of course, if it's a problem...
- No. I'll alert the teller to watch for you.
Well, she'll know me by my chauffer, a very earnest-looking black man.
Okay. Thank you, Clifford.
Good morning.
Mr. Abernathy, Mr. Leeds said to be expecting you.
Excellent.
- Have a good day.
- Thank you.
May I see those?
Jesus.
I get ID'd trying to deposit a check... at my own bank.
Where to next, Tyrone?
Just continue straight.
I'll tell you when to turn.
Red light, red light.
- Damn.
- We have right of way.
- You asshole.
- I'm actually beginning to trust you.
Enough to take that gun out of my back?
No.
But this much.
Hey, how are you holding up?
Fine.
You are gonna give her her share before we cross the border, right?
Once we cross, you can either go with me, go with him... or go your own way.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
I believe you have some checks for me. Mr. Abernathy.
- Abernathy?
- Yes.
- Watch your head.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
Move it.
- Oh, damn.
- What?
Don't look, don't look.
That teller, she's making the security guard... write down our license plate.
Can we do this quickly?
We have time to make it to another bank.
It's not worth the risk.
Now then, let's go to the border.
Passport?
We cool?
We're cool.
You have to lose the shotgun.
No, the shotgun is essential to our understanding.
I'll just cover it.
Give me the map, Erin.
You've done excellent work,
Officer Friar.
Perhaps you'd like to stay in my employ.
Jack, you don't have to kill him, please!
- I'm okay.
- Don't move. Don't move.
I'm all right.
Tyrone, give yourself up!
- Halt, police.
- Jack, don't kill him!
Tyrone, it's over.
There's no place to go!
- Gun!
- Drop your weapon.
Freeze!
- Let go of me, Jack.
- Put it down.
- Put it down now.
- Do it!
Now step away from the car, hands up.
Please remain in your car.
You understand that while under Canada's jurisdiction... we respect your interest in this situation.
No warrants or reports have been made as of yet.
We'll wait for your recommendation.
Lucky thing having those license plates behind you.
Tell them I was a hostage.
It's the truth.
I tried to leave him.
You know I tried to leave him.
I couldn't.
I've got a million dollars right here.
You've got yours.
We could spend our lives on vacation, the same vacation.
You have a way of making me feel really good... when you want something.
- It's not like that.
- Oh, but it is.
Only you don't know it.
When we danced the cello... you could have killed me.
Whatever you saw in me then, see it now.
Help me, Jack.
Arrest her.
You're okay?
Yeah.
I lost my earring.
- What does it look like?
- It's a pearl one.
It should turn up.
I'm fond of them, 'cause my husband gave them to me.
- You should go.
- Yeah.
I... really enjoyed that.
Yes, I know.
Leon...
Leon... this is about sex.
It's about a man and a woman joined groin to groin.
Get it?
Come on.
No.
Like this.
- Mom?
- I'm in here.
- I don't have any clothes.
- You looked on your bedroom floor?
- Yeah. I mean clean ones.
When I come home,
I'll clean them, okay?
- Why are you jogging, Dad?
- I want to get fit.
- What for?
- I don't want to die.
- You are gonna die.
- Not just yet.
Mom? Clothes?
- Then stop jogging.
- Mom, clothes?
What am I gonna wear?
- See you, mom
- See you, Dad.
- See you, mate.
- See you, Dad.
- Hey, hey, what about me?
- I'm 16 now.
- You're telling me you're a man now?
No, but...
- Have a good day, Dad.
- Yeah. You too.
Is there some point where a son stops kissing his father?
Apparently.
- Police!
- Get out!
You weren't a bit hard?
The guy deals drugs.
He's scum.
- Yeah, but he wasn't going anywhere.
What did you expect me to do?
Are you seeing anyone?
Not with the hours I keep.
What about somebody on the force?
Male cops are lousy in bed.
There is someone.
He eats in the same restaurant as I do.
Have you spoken to him yet?
We've exchanged glances.
Oooh...
It's a start.
- How's Sonja?
- She's good.
Haven't seen her around for a while.
Yeah, well... she's busy, with the boys and work...
Tell her I said hi.
I will.
- Have you told him you're not happy?
I would have thought that he wouldn't need to be told.
That depends on how good an actor you are.
Well...
I guess I must be pretty good.
How do you want your marriage to be?
Passionate... and challenging, and... and... honest...
Isn't it honest?
Not emotionally.
Not emotionally it isn't.
It just feels... like we're... like we're just... going through the motions, you know?
And I want more.
I want more than that.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
Dr. Valerie Somers.
Thank you.
We don't know what to feel anymore.
We don't know what's right or wrong anymore.
The confused cry of the modern age...
We ask,
"What can we believe in?
What should we believe in?"
Our politicians?
Hardly.
Our priests?
You'd be amazed at how many clients come to see me because they once believed in a priest.
It's not supposed to be that way.
But it is.
What then?
Our parents?
"Home is a sanctuary."
For the priviledged few.
For most, it's a battleground.
It's not meant to be like that.
But it is.
Love?
Can we believe in love?
Feel safe in it?
Loving someone means we have to relinquish power.
It's mutual surrender.
But how can this take place?
Trust.
Trust is as vital to human relationships as breath is to life... and just as elusive.
Two years ago, my 11-year-old daughter was murdered.
Her name was Eleanor.
This wasn't supposed to happen.
But it did.
It seemed to go well.
I was worried you weren't going to be there.
I said I would be.
Do you want a whiskey?
I've got an early client.
Why don't we take separate cars in the morning?
I've got a late meeting. That way, you wouldn't have to wait for me.
I've got plenty of work
I can do.
You can pick me up after your meeting.
Sure.
Okay.
I met someone.
We went home and had sex.
As you do... well, some of us do.
And he asked to see me again.
I wasn't expecting that.
And?
Against my better judgement,
I said yes.
We've been seeing each other for awhile.
And you like him?
Yes, I do.
Very much.
So?
He comes encumbered... with a wife.
Is he gay?
When he's with me, he seems to be.
Does she know about you?
I assume so.
She would sense it, wouldn't she?
It depends on how good he is at deceiving her.
Or how good she is at deceiving herself.
"V." Don't forget "V."
Hi, Nik.
Having a party, Jane?
Yeah.
Did you want to join me?
Take this inside for Mommy.
Well?
Yeah.
Where?
In a motel.
- Oh...
- Did you get his number?
- Is that what you do?
I don't know.
If you like the guy.
But he's married.
Well, what?
He's not happy.
He can't be, if he's... messing around.
You want to see him again?
Do you think I should?
You want me to be honest?
No. No.
When are you gonna take that thing off?
It's too tight.
I've got to get it cut off.
Nik caught up with Pete the other day.
He wants to come back.
I don't love him, Paula.
- Go up to the guy, and ask if you can join him.
- What have you got to lose?
- Just a little dignity.
It is not the issue here.
He eats alone in a restaurant.
- So do I.
- Exactly.
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.
Uh...
Jane, this is Claudia.
- Claudia, Jane.
- Hi.
Hi.
Jane's in the same dance class as Sonja and I.
I'll get going.
Say hi to Sonja.
Sorry.
Is that really awkward?
No, it's fine.
- How are you?
- I'm good.
Yeah.
Good.
I'd better go.
Jane.
Mmmm.
Where did you find it?
- Paula?
- Mmm.
There's an unmarked police car in front of Jane's place.
She's seeing a cop now?
Don't be nosy, Nik.
What? Are her and Pete getting back together or what?
I don't know.
What if they are?
What do I say then?
Nothing.
Well, he's... he's a mate of mine.
Then do him a favor and stay out of it.
The baby's sick?
Yeah.
Shit.
Oh fuck...
- Don't stop.
- Here.
Leon?
- Oh fuck.
- You're all right?
What is it?
What is it?
It's nothing.
- Should I call...
- No, no.
- Just...
- Should I get a doctor?
I get this pain in my chest sometimes.
You should have told me you have a weak heart.
I don't.
I don't want to have an affair with...
I don't have a weak heart, all right?
This is not an affair, it's a one-night stand that happened twice.
Oh shit.
Sorry.
I didn't mean that.
Do you worry that we don't make love very often?
No.
I don't really think about it that much.
- Why not?
- I love you.
Whether we make love three times a week or once a month does not really change that.
Doesn't it?
- Is this a test?
- No.
It's just... I want to know what you're thinking.
Why do women always want to know that?
You're up late.
Yeah, I'm trying to finish this.
You want one?
I've got one.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Just had a shit of a day.
Stopped off and had a drink with Claudia.
Yeah, I know.
I phoned her.
I didn't know if you were working late.
All right.
Fuck! Fuck!
You fucking stupid bastard!
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Would you fucking look where you're going?!
Fucking idiot!
Fuck!
Oh fuck.
Hey! Wait.
Are you all right?
Sorry.
Here's your bag.
- Jesus.
- What happened?
- I fell.
- Are you all right?
- It's nothing.
Let me look.
I'll be all right.
I said I'm all right!
I keep thinking about her.
Are you feeling guilty?
Do you think I should be?
It doesn't matter what I think.
He feels manipulated by her.
How?
She's very needy.
Are you trying to justify his deceit?
No, I'm trying to understand it.
- It's complex.
- Mmm-hm.
But isn't it still an act of deceit?
No marriage can be based on that.
Most marriages are based on that.
You think you know what goes on in most marriages?
What? Because I'm gay,
I can't have an opinion...?
- It's not what I was...
- She's not the victim in this.
She chose to marry him.
Not knowing he was gay.
There's knowing, and there's "knowing."
What do you mean?
I think some women like to live the lie.
It's easier than dealing with the truth.
Maybe she loves him.
But so do I.
Then he has to make a choice.
Unless one of us withdraws from the contest.
Is love a contest for you,
Patrick?
Patrick?
Yes.
Sometimes.
What happened to your head?
I bumped it on a clothes line.
Listen... thanks for last night.
I'll lie for you to anyone, except Sonja.
I don't want to lie to her again.
Fair enough.
Why are you trying so hard to fuck up your life?
You don't know how lucky you are to have the marriage you've got.
And you're pissing all over it.
It's great your husband comes with you.
Yeah.
- What about yours?
- I'm separated.
Ah...
- Can you tell?
- No.
No, you just have this...
- kind of look.
- What? Desperate?
No.
Full of potential.
Sorry I'm late.
- Jane, this is my husband Leon.
- Hi.
Yeah...
Excuse me, everybody.
There is a salsa band playing tonight and tomorrow at The Latin.
Leon. Sonja.
Are you guys coming?
I thought we'd have a nice dinner together.
Come on. You can go out to eat anytime.
I'd like to go.
- I'm kind of tired.
- Okay.
I'll see you at home.
Bye.
- What was that about?
- Hey, she needed a partner.
- And you happened to volunteer?
- She chose me.
I'd never say anything, Leon.
- Pete!
G'day, Nik.
How are you, mate?
Drove by to see Jane.
Doesn't look like she's in.
Did you see her tonight?
No.
You don't know where she is then?
No, sorry.
How is she?
The last time
I saw her, okay.
That's good.
- How are you going?
- Good.
Good.
It's late.
I thought she'd be home.
Sorry,
I haven't seen her.
If there was something
I should know, you'd tell me?
'Cause... if she's seeing someone,
I'd want to know.
It'd be easier.
Of course.
I hate this.
- Thanks, man. See you later.
- Take care.
So why did you and your husband split up?
I don't know.
I just turned around one day and I realized I was living with a man
I didn't love anymore.
- It was that simple?
- No.
But you knew that much.
Maybe my expectations were too high.
You're a brave woman.
You are.
Most people settle for less.
I really like you, Leon.
Maybe a little too much.
But I'm...
I'm starting to wonder just... where this might go.
I'm still in love with my wife, Jane.
Right.
- I'm sorry.
So...
I'm wondering why... why have you been seeing me if you're still in love with your wife?
I don't know.
It's not something that I planned.
Look, Jane, l...
This doesn't have to end badly.
Just go.
- Just go. Go.
It's twofold actually.
He thinks he runs the faculty, but he hasn't published anything decent since 1985.
You seem preoccupied.
I'm having trouble with a client.
I'm not handling him very well.
Refer him on.
I find him a little threatening.
Why?
I don't like...
- what he's doing.
- You're judging him.
Darling, you have to refer him on.
I'll see you outside.
Excuse me.
I hate what's happening to us.
I hate it.
We don't talk anymore.
We lost our daughter.
That could have brought us closer.
Do you think about her very much?
Of course I do.
I just don't need to write a book about it.
Do you think
I did the wrong thing?
I just wanted the whole... world to know.
Look at me, John.
Look at me.
- Come on, kids.
We're late for school.
Watch the road.
Come on. In you get.
- Goodbye, love
- Bye, Derek.
Hi.
Hi.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I'll pop around after work.
Okay.
- Hey, Nik.
You want coffee?
Yeah, sure.
Pete was over last night.
How is he?
Not good.
How's the job hunting going?
Are you guys all right for money?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
'Cause if you need some money,
I'll be more than happy to...
No.
I know Paula wouldn't take it.
She's doing extra shifts now.
You sure there's no bill you want to clear?
It's fine.
The offer's there.
- Thanks.
- It's all right.
Why didn't you wake me up?
I thought you could do with the rest.
- I'll go have my shower.
- Actually, I've got an early start.
- I'll only be 10 minutes.
- Just take your own car.
- Come on, wait for me, please.
- Jesus.
Sorry.
I have a lecture tonight anyway.
So, you'll be home late?
Yeah.
Bye.
I think he's having an affair.
He's distant, preoccupied, like he's holding something back from me.
What would you do if he was?
I...
I think I'd leave.
Yeah.
And does that scare you?
Yeah.
I'm...
I'm middle-aged. I don't know what it's like out there.
You know?
And I have these two... beautiful boys.
But l...
I would survive if I had to.
I like being this age.
And l...
I like the lines around my eyes.
I don't know if he does, but...
I do.
It's not that he might have slept with another woman, you know?
It's that he might not tell me.
That would be the betrayal.
Do you still love him?
- Valerie?
Patrick Phelan is here.
Give me a minute, okay?
- You don't like me, do you?
- Is it important to you?
Would it make a difference if I were straight?
I don't have a problem with your sexuality.
But it is a problem that I'm having an affair with a married man.
You must stop trying to make me the subject.
It's just another form of defense.
I'm curious about your role in this triangle.
My role?
I'm a respite from a marriage that's gotten too hard.
How?
He takes refuge in me.
- In what I offer him.
- What do you offer him?
Sex unencumbered by need.
Why doesn't he leave her?
Good men don't know how to leave their wives.
Good men or cowardly men?
He told me that making love to her was like trying to fill an empty well.
What did you say?
What?
- You said something to me.
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did!
- I didn't say anything.
- You heard him, didn't you?
- This is bullshit...
- Bullshit?
- Yeah.
I want your name.
Give me your name!
I want your name!
A bourbon, please.
A double bourbon with ice.
Thanks.
You all right?
Yeah.
You sure?
You don't look all right.
What?
Are you a cop?
Yeah.
Really?
Really.
Sorry, I just... something weird really happened.
I was walking and this woman started yelling at me.
She thought
I said something to her.
- What for?
- I don't know.
I was walking down the street and she went nuts.
- Did you?
- No.
I didn't do anything.
I don't do stuff like that.
Take it easy.
I believe you.
Sorry. It was just really weird and... now you're a cop, so that's really weird. Sorry.
You want another drink?
Yeah. Thanks.
Same again.
- Sharon said there's a booze bus on the freeway.
- I'll take the backroad home.
- Hannah!
- Yeah?
Grab Dad's wallet from the kitchen.
- Yeah.
Hey.
- She asked me for coffee this morning.
- Who?
- Jane.
- What for?
- I don't know.
- I can't find it!
It's near the fridge.
I don't know.
She's trying to come on to me.
What?
She's lonely, Nik.
And you're bored.
That's a lethal combination.
Stay away from her.
What's the matter?
You're a bit jealous, huh?
Huh?
You ever fuck with our marriage, and I cut your balls off.
I'll hang them on the lawn, between your socks and your jocks.
Got it?
Sure, babe.
Wake me up when you get home. Huh?
I'm running down this hill, and I go around this corner.
And suddenly, there's this guy, and bam!
Right into him. Right away,
I'm going after him...
"You fucking prick!
Look where you're going."
- But it was your fault.
- Well, yeah.
I don't know why I went at him.
It was just... my buttons got pushed or something.
Anyway, so I look down, and there he is, on the ground, cowering.
- Huh?
- He's got blood on his face...
- and he broke his fucking nose.
- Oh no.
And he gets up and he starts to role-play.
- And that's when it happens.
- What?
- He starts to cry.
- What for?
I don't know.
What makes a man cry like that?
Yeah, a lot of things.
So what did you do?
I just held him.
I just stood there and I held him.
But the whole time
I was thinking,
"You fucking weak prick, pull yourself together."
- Don't you want to cry sometimes?
- Yeah, but...
- you don't, do you?
- Mmm.
Hey.
We ordered your food, but we ate it.
What's that smell?
- Where's your mom?
- Dancing.
- Where's your brother?
- Upstairs.
Shit.
Sam!
Sam?
Sam! Sam!
What the fuck is going on?
For Christ's sake,
I'm a cop!
- All right, you get the good stuff.
- Don't you smart-mouth me.
- What's going on?
- Your brother is being an idiot.
- So what's new?
- Did you know about this?
Have you tried it?
If you ever give your brother that shit...
- As if I'd give...
- Shut up!
- No...
- Shut up!
Give your brother this stuff, I'll give you a thumping you won't forget.
I don't care how big you get!
Give me the rest.
- That's it.
Get downstairs.
- You're grounded, mate.
- What?
Oh shit.
Oh God.
You're a very beautiful woman, Sonja.
I'd like to fuck with you.
Can I have a whiskey, dry please?
Excuse me.
Hello.
You look like you're enjoying yourself.
Yeah, I am.
It's good you're having fun, while our son's at home smoking pot.
I know.
I told him if he's gonna do it, he should do it at home
- so we can control it.
- Why didn't you tell me?
Because you haven't been around much lately.
I'm not having drugs in the house.
What are you gonna do?
Banning it won't solve the problem.
- What are you doing here?
- What?
What are you doing here?
Most of the guys here aren't much older than our son.
- I thought we'd go back to your place.
- We can't. My mother.
Wait. Slow down.
Stop. Get off.
- Jesus!
What's wrong?
I'm sorry.
This was a bad idea.
Sorry.
Fucking uptight bitch!
Hello?
- You found John and Valerie.
Leave a message after the tone.
- Hi, it's me.
Are you there?
Okay,
I've had an accident.
I'm okay.
I can't get the car started.
I'm on the backroad and...
I just wanted to get home.
I'll try your mobile. Bye.
I called road services.
There'll be a 90-minute wait.
Where are you?
You didn't say you'd be late.
I can't stand this!
Please...
Please, I need you.
John?
There is a man.
Patrick.
He's a client and he's... he's gay.
I don't understand this.
I don't understand... us... anymore.
I don't want this to be happening to us.
Oh...
There are lights.
There's a car coming.
I'll wave it down.
Wait for me.
We'll talk when I get home, okay?
Bye.
I love you.
- You need sleep.
- You wish.
- What have we got?
- Locals got a call, about 12:30 AM from the husband. He gets home late, his wife's not there.
She's left messages on the answering machine, saying she ran off the road, she's making a call from a phone box, about 2kms down the road.
Last call says she saw a car coming, she's gonna wave it down.
But she never makes it.
$50 says it's the husband.
You're on.
Mr. Somers?
Knox. My wife's name's Somers.
I'm Detective Zat.
This is my colleague,
Detective Weis.
We've located your wife's car, Mr. Knox.
Do you mind if we come in?
Mr. Knox, it appears that your wife ran off the road.
There's a telephone box several kilometers further along.
- Should I go there?
- We're conducting a search, but... if she accepted a lift from somebody, it's unlikely she'll be there.
Would you mind answering a few questions?
I've been through all this with the police.
I know, but would you mind telling me what happened last night?
I got home around midnight.
Her car wasn't here.
I came in,
I checked the machine.
There were a couple of calls.
The last message said there was a car coming and she was going to wave it down.
- That's when you called the police?
- No, I waited about 20 minutes.
- That's how long it would have...
- So you called at about 12:20?
Yes, more or less.
Do you have a photo of your wife we could have, please?
Thank you.
How was your wife yesterday?
- Fine.
- Nothing troubling her?
No.
I am trying to find out about your wife's emotional state.
Right now, I'd say it's pretty bad, wouldn't you?
None of this is particularly pleasant.
- I can imagine.
- Imagine what? You're married?
Yeah.
If your wife got into a stranger's car... a man, let's assume... and didn't come home, what would you imagine?
Right now,
I'd be going mad.
Yeah.
Mr. Knox, we need the tape.
She... this is private.
- In what sense?
- She's upset.
She wasn't expecting anyone to listen to it.
I'll make sure this is returned to you.
- You didn't wake me up last night.
- I got in late.
What's with the face?
- I fell over.
- You were pissed?
A little.
Come on, kids.
You packed your bag, Hannah?
- Quickly. Come on.
- Hi!
- Hi.
- Hi.
Seatbelts on, quickly.
- Nik got in late last night.
- Got nothing better to do than spying?
- What?
- What?
- You know, don't invite Nik in for coffee when I'm not here.
All right?
Paula?! Hey.
That's the appointment book.
All her notes and session tapes are kept in a filing cabinet.
- Do you mind?
- No.
- How was she yesterday?
- All right.
Is she the kind of person that would get into a stranger's car?
No.
Not after what happened to her daughter.
Sarah, I'd like you to print me a list of her current clients,
- addresses and phone numbers too.
- Is that ethical?
Probably not.
- It's not that he might have... slept with another woman... it's that he might not tell me.
That would be the betrayal.
Do you still love him?
Good evening.
Richard Morecroft with ABC News.
The police are inquiring into the disappearance of a woman in Bushland, north of the city.
Psychiatrist Valerie Somers was last seen on Friday night.
Her car was found abandoned along the Lower Ridge Road.
She might have accepted a lift from a passing motorist.
Ms. Somers has recently completed a book about the murder of her own daughter.
The body of 11-year-old
Eleanor Knox was found dumped in a city laneway 18 months ago.
Police are appealing to the public for information regarding
Ms. Somers' disappearance.
Why do you think she turned off the freeway?
Some people say it's shorter.
Who's Patrick?
I don't know.
She mentioned she was having some trouble with a client.
What kind of trouble?
She didn't go into it.
She doesn't talk about her clients.
- Why not?
- It's unprofessional.
- Even between husband and wife?
- Yes.
- I tell my wife everything.
- That surprises me.
Why?
Most men hold something back.
You're some kind of academic, aren't you?
I'm Dean of Law.
I studied at Harvard.
That's where Valerie and I met.
I don't understand why she'd get into a car with a stranger.
Maybe she didn't.
Maybe she knew him.
- How's your marriage been lately?
- Fine. How's yours?
Up and down.
Where were you Friday night?
Am I a suspect in my wife's disappearance?
Where were you
Friday night?
I was at work.
Can anybody verify that?
No, I was alone.
Nobody saw me.
Nine times out of 10 when a wife goes missing, the husband knows something about it.
You're a prick.
The young constable will give you a ride.
- Anyway, we've been seeing each other for a while.
And you like him?
- Yes, I do.
Very much.
- So?
He comes encumbered... with a wife.
- Don't you have a home to go to?
- Yes. Do you?
Did you find anything?
She dedicated the book to John.
"For teaching me to trust again."
- Did you listen to Phelan's tapes?
- Yeah.
- What did you think?
- She didn't like the man.
Go home.
You got an early start.
- What about you?
- Soon.
Okay.
You really look like shit.
Go home.
Thank you.
Talked to mystery man yet?
He never came back.
Silly bugger.
I'm not asleep.
Did you watch the news?
Yeah.
Will you find her?
It's not looking good.
I saw her client list,
Sonja.
Why didn't you tell me?
Because it was private.
It was just something
I had to do.
There was a time when there was no private between you and me.
That is because I had somebody
I could talk to.
- I have to tell you something...
- I have to tell you...
I had an affair.
I slept with her twice.
I know it hurts you.
It hurts her...
Why?
Because I'm numb.
I can't feel anything anymore.
Just totally fucking numb.
Why did you sleep on the couch?
I came in late last night.
I didn't want to wake your mama.
Are you fighting?
- Yeah, a bit.
- Why?
There's something we've got to sort out.
- You all right, Mom?
- Yeah.
I'll be in the car.
Can you grab something to eat?
We're running late.
Are we gonna talk about this?
Or you just going to punish me?
This is how you're gonna punish me?
I fucked up.
- People fuck up.
- Really? I don't.
You know what's so easy?
It's easy to go and find somebody.
You know what's hard?
What's hard is not to.
Sonja, listen.
I just want...
Get off me.
God.
We'll talk about this tonight, all right?
Oh... get fucked!
I don't even know if I'll be here later.
Hi.
Did you know?
You're ready?
Pete?
It's me.
Can you come over?
- What number is it?
You sure you're up to this?
Mr. Phelan.
We're investigating the disappearance of Valerie Somers.
We were hoping you could help us.
It's not a good time.
- I was out late.
- Who with?
Mr. Phelan, the woman's missing.
- You know what's happened to her?
- Not yet.
You had an appointment with her?
Can you tell us how she was?
She seemed all right.
I don't know.
You don't know?
She's the therapist.
I wasn't focused on how she was.
How do you get along with her?
- Fine.
- That's it?
Fine?
We didn't end our last session on very good terms.
Why is that?
- We disagreed about something.
- What was that?
What? That guy you've been fucking?
- Married guy?
- How did you know about that?
- She records all her sessions.
- That's private...
- Yes, but under the circumstances...
- That's my life!
Is there somebody in that room?
Who is it?
Your boyfriend?
- Could you ask him to come out?
- He has nothing...
- Leon!
- What's the matter with you?
- You don't have the right...
- Who are you?!
You have no fucking right!
Finished?
That went well.
Your marriage is falling apart and so are you.
- It's none of your business.
- It is if you can't do your job!
If you don't like the way
I'm handling things, take it up at the station.
Push.
- Hello?
- Dylan?
Hi, Dad.
Could I speak to your mom?
No, she's still pissed off at you.
All right.
Tell her...
- tell her I'll be home soon.
- All right. See you, Dad.
What did he say?
He said that he's sorry, that he loves you, and he wants you to stop being angry with him.
You look bereft, Leon.
The other question is, why don't you?
Don't be deceived by appearances.
Want a whiskey?
- Somebody may have hurt your wife.
- I need to know if it was you.
- I didn't hurt her.
- She was upset on the phone.
- She was afraid.
- Of what?
- Of being alone.
Of me not being there for her.
Why weren't you there for her?
While your wife was in some phone box, calling for your help, where were you?
Are you seeing someone else?
- Is it an affair?
- No.
With a man?
Is that what's going on?
I believe that's what
Valerie thought was going on.
What are you talking about?
For some reason, she believe you were involved with Patrick Phelan.
Is that it?
Were you seeing men on the side?
- I don't have to listen to this?
- Yes, you do.
My wife's out there somewhere.
What are you doing about it?
I'm trying to find her.
But I need to know what's inside her head.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Have you ever cheated on your wife?
No.
- Never desired another woman?
- Yes, of course.
- But you never acted on it?
- No.
Well, you're a better man than I am.
So there is someone else?
No.
There was someone once.
A woman.
Once that's happened, you're never entirely believed again.
Something gets broken, permanently.
Trust, I suppose.
When that happens, anything's possible, it would seem.
You don't lose a daughter, like we lost Eleanor, without some damage.
So where were you?
I left work late.
I stopped at the place where my daughter was killed.
I go there... a lot.
- Valerie didn't know that.
- You didn't tell her?
Why not, John?
What holds your marriage together, Leon?
Loyalty?
Love?
Maybe habits sometimes, passion, our kids.
Ours was held together by grief.
There wasn't much else left.
You didn't love her anymore?
I'm saying that sometimes, love isn't enough.
- Leon!
Where the hell have you been?
We got a call from a man, saying his wife saw a neighbor throw a shoe into a vacant lot on the night Valerie disappeared.
She's got the shoe.
Black leather.
Where are we going?
- This could be tricky.
- Why?
I know the woman.
Oh Jesus!
- Detective Claudia Weis.
- Leon!
- We had a drink the other night.
- How are you?
Good.
You'd better come in.
My wife's pretty upset.
- Jane, it's the police.
- This is Leon and...
- Claudia.
- And Claudia. Jane.
- Is that the shoe?
Yeah.
You shouldn't have touched the shoe,
- Mrs...?
- O'May.
It's Jane O'May.
Right, Mrs. O'May, you shouldn't have touched it.
Well, I did.
Yeah, but you shouldn't have.
Well, I did, didn't I?
It's on the table.
- Could we have some coffee?
- Yeah.
It's out the back here. Thanks.
I'll give you a hand.
Are you all right?
- Have you got a light?
- Yeah.
How do you want to handle this?
You're a policeman, aren't you?
Why don't you just do your job?
I've never seen you before.
Can I speak to Paula, please?
- It's urgent.
Can you tell her to call me as soon as she can?
Yes, as soon as she can, please.
Leave it!
Go get your brother.
Nik D'Amato? Detective
Claudia Weis, City Central.
My kids. I need someone to watch my kids.
Right. I'll give you a couple of minutes.
- So I go to the window, at about 11:30.
I go to the window, and he's chucking that.
And he threw it over there, and he was looking like he was... really guilty.
Nik.
- You're back, Pete?
Only sort of.
- How are you?
- Good. And you?
I'm in a bit of trouble.
Can you take the kids?
Just till Paula gets back.
- I wouldn't ask unless I really needed help.
We'll take them.
Thanks.
Here you go.
- Thanks.
There's pajamas, toothbrush... there's a video and some other stuff in there as well.
Thanks very much, okay?
It's time to go.
No, Daddy, don't go.
Don't go!
Come on.
I'll be back soon.
- Come on.
- No! No!
How did you get the scratches on your face?
- I want to see my wife.
- She's on her way.
Can you tell us where you were Friday night?
I want to see Paula.
You are in deep shit, mate.
Your wife can't help you.
- Do I know you?
- I doubt it.
- I've seen you before.
- Shut up! Shut up!
- You were next door at Jane's place.
- I told you to shut up!
Where are my kids?
- Where are my bloody kids?!
- With your neighbor.
- Who are you?
- Calm down.
- I don't want to be calm.
- Can I get you something?
Yes, you can get me my husband.
- And get me out of here!
- Can you just step in here?
Mrs. D'Amato.
I'm Detective Sergeant Zat.
I believe you met
Detective Constable Weis.
I want to see Nik.
Your husband is helping us with our inquiries.
Bullshit.
He was seen throwing a shoe into a vacant lot.
Who saw him?
A search was conducted in the block opposite your house.
Mmm?
Another one?
My kids play there.
Every kid on the street plays there.
They found the shoe.
It was identified as belonging to Ms. Valerie Somers.
She's been missing since last Friday night.
Paula!
- Hello?
- Janey, it's Paula.
Hi.
- Is Andrew awake?
Your kids are fine.
- You know?
- Maybe I could talk to Hannah.
- No, she's asleep.
- The baby?
- You know what? They're all asleep.
Sorry about this, Janey.
Nik's in trouble.
They won't let me see him.
I don't know what to do.
You know what?
It's okay.
Everything's okay.
- Your kids are really safe.
I'm sorry.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
Bye, Janey.
Does she know you rang the police?
No.
They say you've... hurt some woman, Nik.
I didn't, babe.
I didn't touch her.
Don't. Not yet.
- What is it, Hannah?
- The baby's sick.
What is it?
What is it?
He's burning up.
- Get us a flannel. A wet one.
- Panadol.
- What?
- He needs Panadol.
Panadol.
- Poor little thing.
- It's all right for babies?
- I don't know. Only get half.
- Baby Panadol.
- What?
- Baby Panadol.
- You'll have to go to the chemist's.
- There's some at our house.
I'd met some mates for a drink.
We used to work together.
It's something we keep up.
We drank more than we should have, so I took the backroad.
The police don't patrol it.
It must have been about... a quarter to 12:00... and I see this woman standing at the side of the road.
I don't want to stop.
It's late, and I'm thinking
Paula will get worried.
But what do I do?
The woman needs help.
So I pull over.
My car ran off the road.
Get in.
Thanks.
What's your name?
Valerie.
I'm Nik.
- It turns out she lives in one of those houses by the Bay.
There's a string of houses along there.
It's out of my way.
It's in the opposite direction.
She doesn't say much.
I can tell she doesn't want to talk, so I just... leave it.
But I know this shortcut and I just don't...
I just don't think.
And before I can say,
"This is the short way," she's gone.
What do you mean, she's gone?
Hey!
Wait!
I'm not going to hurt you.
Trust me!
You know...
I thought that... if I'd leave her alone... she'd stop being afraid of me.
I just...
I just left her there.
When I got home,
I saw her...
I saw her shoe on the floor of my car.
And l...
Jesus, I just wanted to help the woman...
Why didn't you report it, Nik?
Because I thought she'd be all right.
I thought she'd find her way out of there.
Then when l... and when
I saw her on the news... that she was missing, l...
By then who was going to believe me?
Thank you... for letting me know.
Bye.
Paula? Come in.
Hi.
Hey, sweetie.
- Daddy will be home soon.
- Maybe they can come back later.
- They've been so good for me.
- No, I don't think so.
Paula.
He didn't do it, Jane.
How do you know?
He told me.
Paula?
What could I do, Paula?
All right.
Go inside and put your bags in your rooms.
Stupid...
You've got no right, Jane!
You hear me?!
You have no fucking right!
I don't want to see you anywhere near my kids again.
I was home, Leon.
I didn't pick up the phone.
- John? There's a man...
Patrick.
He's a client and he's... he's gay.
I don't understand this.
I don't understand... us... anymore.
I don't want this to be happening to us.
Oh... there are lights.
There's a car coming.
I'll wave it down.
Wait for me.
We'll talk when I get home, okay?
Bye.
I love you.
I thought she would come home.
- It's not that he might have... slept with another woman.
It's... that he might not tell me.
That would be the betrayal.
- Do you still love him?
- Yeah.
I still love him.
I don't want to lose you.
What?
I don't want to lose you.
I couldn't bear it.
You ready?
Oh. Not going.
Not dressing up like an adult.
Yeah, but we're game-day players.
Come on.
Let's go.
Okay.
I put on the clothes, and I feel better for a second
Iike I'm somebody with someplace to go but then I think
I'm a complete fraud and they'll see right through me.
...La-la-la
La-la, la-la-la...

Not an easy job market but you're the most sought-after graduates in history.
Know your value.
Sell to the highest bidder.
Now, we know your...
...market share of existing markets.
Nothing else matters.
You can talk about your art history your Derrida, your la-dee-dah, your poetry but in reality, the moment you step outside the magic circle drawn around this institution you are at the mercy of market forces and nowhere will prepare you more thoroughly to harness those forces for your own benefit than McKinsey and Company Consulting.
Remember, follow the bouncing ball to McKinsey.
You got to get over to l-banking.
You won't buy workout clothes for ten years.
Somehow I don't see you working in a bank.
Thanks.
I calculated the odds of getting hired by McKinsey.
From Stanford or here, it's about 500 to one.
From anywhere else, forget about it.
Why do you tell me these things?
So... how you doing?
I'm fine.
That could be the most dangerous lie you tell today.
Come on, Bill.
I've been back for ten minutes.
Just put me to work.
I'll be okay.
I've got a Missing Persons.
Male, Caucasian, 24 years.
Name: Embry Larkin.
So, when'd this kid go missing?
Uh... two years ago, from the university.
Rich kid.
Dropped out. No family.
Some um, lawyer-- a trustee-- says he hasn't touched his accounts.
Now tell me he was on drugs and depressed.
Well, there is a drug thing, yeah.
Come on, Bill.
He drove up north with a couple of rocks in his pocket.
-He jumped in a lake.
-Hey, we're not looking to hit any home runs here, okay?
The kid had money.
It's going to get investigated and you're the right guy today.
You going to give me a cruiser?
"Boa. B-O-A."
My mother's been to a snake church.
Did you say, "snake church"?
Yeah, snake church.
Okay. "Persian religious teacher." Nine letters.
Zoroaster.
Great. Good and evil.
"My book is Genius"--
"Genius" capitalized.
He's a physicist.
I should know this.
He had weird hair.
"Feynman. F-E..."
I can spell "Feynman."
"F-U-C. Feynman."
I'm sorry.
My McKinsey interview is in 30 minutes.
Personally, I'm not a dog that salivates every time some l-banker consultant rings his little bell.
Hey, um, Katie, um
I love being friends in quotation marks.
It makes me so horny.
Knock it off. We are friends.
Hey, Katie.
Amanda. Sam. August.
So, um, we were just talking about friendship and how...
How we'll all be selling out.
Sooner or later.
Some of us sooner than others.
I don't know, you guys.
I think it's just really about doing what makes you happy.
He's right. Harrison, you're just so... hopeful.
Oh, thanks.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I already spoke with two officers.
I'm not sure what else I can tell you.
Right, right.
Well, those other two detectives are no longer on this case.
I am.
So, what makes you think
Embry Larkin is dead?
Purely account activity.
We haven't heard from him in a couple of years.
He hasn't used any credit facilities.
But this kid was all over the map.
I mean, how do we know he's not sitting on some island smoking Thai stick, wearing a sheet?
He also had two first-class airline tickets to Athens, Greece, that he never used.
It takes seven years for a missing person to be declared dead.
Now's as good a time as any to get the ball rolling.
Right.
Well, who gets the money?
The Larkin Foundation.
-All of it?
-All of it.
Look, his family was a client of the original partners.
I don't know this kid at all.
Katie!
Hi, Katie Burke.
There is a message for you.
Your thesis advisor,
Professor Jergensen's office they said I should find you, so I did.
Here's the message.
It says for you to come to Jergensen's house.
That's scary.
How's your thesis coming, anyway?
It's almost done. How's yours?
Turned it in.
Ms. Burke, I'd like to have you meet Wade Handler.
He's a police officer.
Hello.
Hi.
Mr. Handler has a line of inquiries...
That's "Detective," Professor.
"Doctor," Detective.
Detective Handler has a line of inquiry that he's forcing upon the college.
Force?
Oh, no, we don't use force-- not in the People's Republic-- we ask politely because the college is good for the tax base which is good for the community which is good for everybody.
So, um, Katherine Burke...
Katie.
Katie... I'm investigating a young man who was a student here,
Embry Larkin.
Something happen to him?
Well, that's what I'm trying to find out.
What was your relationship?
He was my boyfriend.
Detective, this college is very proactive about the privacy of its students.
Oh, I understand, Doctor.
I'll be gentle.
So... he was your boyfriend?
He disappeared.
He left school.
He disappeared, or he left school?
Which?
Both, I think.
I... haven't heard from him.
Not once?
Not even once.
Do you have any idea where he might be?
-No.
That's fine.
Thank you for your time.
Here's my card.
If you think of anything else, just give me a call, all right?
How's your thesis coming?
I'm learning so much.
You have a draft for me?
Close, really close.
Let's preserve our older dorms.
Go home, leave it alone.
Let's preserve our older dorms.
Go home, leave it alone.
Let's preserve our older dorms...
How'd it go?
I completely blew it.
There's tea and stale pastries.
Don't, whatever you do, take one.
I got crumbs all over my cashmere sweater.
I won't be wearing a cashmere sweater.
So, I don't think that'll be a problem.
Ooh, working-class hero, good strategy.
They hated me.
I could tell.
They want Vietnamese orphans... and engineers.
God, why wasn't I born a Vietnamese orphan?
This is so familiar--
"l blew it. I'm a loser," and then, "Oh, look, I got an A."
No.
I lost my concentration.
I wasn't supposed to concentrate.
It was supposed to be effortless.
And then,
I started concentrating and becoming earnest and then I started seeing them as seeing me as seeing myself as the type of person who wants to appear earnest which is completely wro...
Do you hear what's going on up here?
I hate wearing these itchy things.
How do I look?
How do you think you look?
...Of unbounded domesticity
Though a doctor of divinity is located in this vicinity
But they give up the felicity of unbounded domesticity

A doctor of divinity...
Headline: "Composer of Questionable Talent
"Excoriates Audience

"ln a bizarre exercise in self-loathing
"Senior Embry Larkin--
"winner of the Leonard Bernstein
Award for Original Composition--
"stood up before his latest theatrical production
"Trip-Hop Inferno and lacerated the audience for their attendance."
He flipped off 200 people and disappeared three weeks before graduation.
He was already
Summa Cum Laude and he says,
"Screw you and your degree."
It was exceedingly theatrical and standard Embry.
What was standard about it?
Dropped out twice-- once to work on some archeological dig in Cambodia... once to work in a factory.
I expect him to pop up running La Scala or the Berlin Opera.
What a guy.
800 math S.A.T.s.
3.94 GPA.
Thesis?
"Emerging Ancillary Markets in the Global Wireless Revolution."
I bet that's quite a read.
We're actually looking to beef up our Tech Practice but then you probably already knew that.
So...
"Katherine Burke..." who are you?
Where do you come from?
I grew up in the middle of nowhere.
The birthplace of Wendell Willkie is 20 miles away, and that's about it.
My mom works in a bottling plant and sells Nutra-Life products and my dad left when I was little.
I never really knew him.
Hmm.
Tell us about a problem you've encountered.
My guidance counselor tried to keep me from applying to good schools.
I thought she was my friend.
She said she understood me and that I would be happier staying close to home-- junior college or secretarial school.
She hated me.
What action did you take?
I invited a senator who attended college here to speak at our school.
And what was the result?
I got a strong letter of recommendation from a U.S. Senator, was accepted early decision and they gave me lots of financial aid.
And what did you learn from this experience?
Truthfully?
Of course.
Mrs. Castleman was a sneaky bitch.
It was the first time
I was betrayed by someone I trusted.
I looked up to her.
I didn't come close to understanding the depth to which she resented me.
I learned that people who help me, who invest in me become my partners, and my success is their success that relationships are symbiotic.
I learned responsibility based on others' faith in me.
I hope to be able to pay some dividends to those investors.
How many pennies do you think it would take to fill this room?
With or without us in it?
Whoa, whoa, stop!
Okay, that was... appalling.
Sopranos, this piece was written by monks who believed in God.
They're singing not to other monks but to God.
They're singing about God to God.
And you think
I'm a tough audience.
Okay, I'd like to hear you you, and... you.
Step down here.
From the beginning.
And...
You and you.
And...
You.
Again.
Sing.
This is the spirit dissolving in the music carrying up to God...
Open up and let her rip.
Don't perform... create.
Say, "Muse, I hate you, but I hate you on my knees."
Scream, "l am the infantile center of the goddamn universe!"
Everyone!
I am the infantile center of the goddamn universe!
Now everyone!
Are you listening to this?
Water polo or lacrosse?
Lacrosse.
Word is, you slaughtered it.
I talked to Brian whose brother dates that cold fish, Susan.
Did you really call some lady a bitch?
Slight exaggeration.
Yeah, they saw 60 people and liked exactly two-- you and a North Korean girl who speaks eight languages.
They said that?
Ms. Burke?
You sure work hard.
Listen, do you have time for a cup of coffee?
No, I really don't.
Steam heat.
The best kind.
Doesn't dry you out up here.
You're not a big one for small talk, are you?
I mean, I get it, believe me.
A person can really piss their life away talking to idiots.
Do you think it's possible this kid, Embry might have killed himself?
Nobody with Embry's self-regard would kill himself.
Nobody. He would have himself bronzed first.
In fact... if you see a statue of him somewhere check and see if there's a person inside.
He hurt you that badly, huh?
It's none of your business.
Well, actually, it's my job, so it is my business.
You know, I'd love to just pal around and talk about the past-- really, I would-- but I'm actually trying to move on with my life right now.
Right.
I'll see you around.
We need to be quiet... in the library!
Quiet!
Studying...
Ah, 10:30 on a Friday night.
I wonder where Katie is?
I thought you were entertaining the lacrosse team.
I was being entertained by the lacrosse team.
The global wireless revolution will be safe until tomorrow.
And the day after.
We're leaving.
Want a blender drink?
No, blender drinks suck.
Oh, look, it's a Siberian bear.
Who paid for all this?
What?
Who paid for all of this?
His dad was just appointed
Governor of Uttar Pradesh.
Evening, Mr. Bond.
To Russia.
What?
-To Russia.
-To Russia.
Yeah.
Match you.
-Again.
-Again.
Again.
-Again.
-Again.
Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!
What makes a kettle whistle?
What makes gold precious?
Right now... everything is so perfect.
I feel so connected.
We'll show you everything...
Why don't we feel this way all the time?
Maybe I'll always wear a hat.
Hat guy.
The guy who wears the hat.
Beautiful day
It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day.
Are you all right?
No.
Look, Katie... um... a cop stopped by my room.
He left a note.
He said he wanted to ask questions about Embry.
He probably talked to you first and, uh, you know
I was just hoping it didn't upset you.
Harrison, my entire body feels like rusting metal.
And I'm seeing things.
I think I might have a chemical depression.
Come on.
You are not one of those people.
What people?
The problem people.
You know, "Hey, look, have you seen my new problem?
"Hey, guess what?
I got a shiny new problem."
You're not like that.
You're amazing.
No, I'm not.
Okay, um, you know what?
This is what we should do first.
Let's get out of here.
There is a huge anti-globalization rally.
We could camp out.
We could get arrested.
Just stand for something.
I'd like to go to sleep now... and when I wake up,
I'll stand for something.
Katie, it's not a joke.
Yes, it is!
Harrison, it's a huge joke.
Anti-globalization?
You might as well stop oxygen or the sun coming up.
You know what?
You're really tired.
Um... yeah.
You're very tired and I am, uh... I'm going to go.
Um... you know if you think about it, please try not to forget our plans this weekend.
Okay?
Let's talk about you... about your yodeling.
Level with me.
You've never sung anything before, have you?
I've sung... in the shower, walking, sort of under my breath.
Burt Bacharach.
Johnny Mathis.
I wanted to meet you.
Hey...
Uh-uh-uh...
You're a virgin.
Nobody this organized ever had time for sex.
Okay, Katie from Rushville if you have a voice, you sing.
Nobody ever said, "lf you had a voice, take finance."
I've been working, baby
Till I'm down
Just want to get next to you, boy
I've been searching, baby
For a way to tell you how
All of the time
You took it
All of the time...
What now?
Whoa. Is this a bad time, or...?
No. I'm sorry.
I thought you were somebody else.
That's good for me, not for them.
So, we're having a little event at an NBA game kind of a meet-and-greet.
It's fun, you know if you're into pretending you're not under a microscope.
Do you like basketball, or...?
I don't know.
Oh. Uh...
Sure. I'll come.
I... Thank you.
It's exciting.
That's... for you.
See you.
Inability or helplessness can have serious psychological ramifications.
Powerless people become either hostile or passive.
Neither is desirable.
We need to feel that we are heard and that justice has been attempted when we feel we are unfairly treated.
Negotiation for resolution of disputes when your actions prevent another from achieving their goal... is apparently a conflict of interest...
If we were to define goals...
La-la-la
La-la la-la-la
Where is this?
It's not a theater.
Embry was interested in non-traditional space.
This is underthe theater.
My final production--
Middlebrow For Lowbrows--
"but look
"we're under the stage, like hell, itself.
Isn't that brilliant?"
It's derivative.
You people are derivative.
You haven't produced a real artist in over a decade and I would rather be dead than mediocre.
So, one last announcement before the show:
Screw this play screw this place and screw you people.
And then he vanished, like a magic trick.
Where do you think he went?
Word is, he had a car waiting.
Probably went to the airport.
I guess I haven't been feeling like myself lately... whatever that means.
I mean, I don't...
I don't know what "myself" feels like.
It's subjective and changes all the time.
Have you been feeling uneasy?
I'm having trouble finishing my thesis.
Uh... I'm having trouble sleeping and when I do sleep,
I'm having these weird dreams.
Huh.
You're exhausted, yeah?
Emotionally mentally and physically?
Okay.
This should help you with the anxiety, all right?
And I'd like to schedule a regular time for us... at least until exams are over.
Okay?
I just keep thinking that the finish line is right there and if I can just get across it then everything will be okay.
We'll get you across.
So, I'm going to see him now,
I guess, on a regular basis.
You just want to do him.
I know you.
You know you.
He is cute.
Mm, sort of.
He's not my type.
Smart, sensitive, wants only to talk about you-- how is that not your type?
Sam, I can't read,
I can't sleep...
And I'm sure Dr. Dave will be able to give you what you need.
I'm serious.
Okay, okay, did he sit behind his desk or did he pull his chair close to you?
Close to me.
Did he... Iean over like this?
Did he look into your eyes like this?
You're going to do him.
Sam...
Come on, how long has it been, sophomore year?
What if it's rusty... or broken?
I still feel like
I'm betraying him.
Embry? Please.
What if Embry comes back?
He'd... wreck your life just like before.
Listen, I want to tell you something.
Um, I believe your friend,
Embry, is dead.
He had two airline tickets for Athens, Greece.
Never used.
No credit activity.
He didn't... he didn't believe in credit.
No cash withdrawals.
No ATM.
Was that other ticket for you?
Were you going to Athens?
Originally, but we were both having second thoughts.
Well, I saw the beginning of that show-- his speech to the audience.
Look, that was just Embry being Embry.
He was going for shock value.
He was leaving;
I was a sophomore.
I mean, I thought that he would call from Europe and maybe I would meet up with him in the summer.
I never heard from him.
You have unusually kind eyes.
See you around, Detective.
I'm Wade Handler.
I'm a cop.
You don't have to share if you don't want to.
I don't even know what to say.
Uh...
I'd find tollbooth tickets and credit card receipts for bars in towns
I didn't think I'd been to.
One day I went out to my car and there's a dent in the front.
I look closer.
There's blood and some brown hair.
I still don't know what happened.
Maybe it was a cat.
There was an incident two years ago involving an undergraduate student and illegal drugs.
Right. What do you want to know about Embry Larkin?
Well, he got himself arrested.
I want to know what he was selling.
Was it heroin?
Heroin? Embry?
Are you kidding?
I'm not kidding.
No, no, he wasn't into that shit.
They put him on Ritalin when he was three you know, your standard
A.D.D. misdiagnosis.
Okay, um...
Basically, he was taking Wellbutrin which is sort of like having a perfect cup of coffee.
You know, it was great for work, great for repetitive tasks.
Add in some Paxil which is anti-depression, anti-anxiety-- you know, that general sense of well-being.
Was he selling it?
Look, Embry's dad was rich and Embry's mom was rich and they died when he was three or four making him doubly rich, so... no.
So, what'd it do?
Made him normal, you know, when he took it.
La-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la...
Katie...
I heard my name whispered...
"Katie. Katie."
There was somebody on the other side of the row of books.
I think it was my old boyfriend.
I think he's back.
I'm almost certain I saw him in his car.
I think he's been watching me.
And how does that make you feel?
Nervous... elated... scared.
I want to see him, but... but scared that I want to see him.
Why do you say scared?
Because I lost a part of myself with him.
I just dissolved.
He was like a drug.
And he was locked inside the library with you?
I think so, yes.
But you hadn't seen him in two years?
I know how this sounds.
Katie, you fell asleep in an old library which is terrifying under the best of circumstances.
You're facing your graduation, the completion of your thesis job interviews...
Iife-changing transitions.
You need to make allowances for the emotions that this will bring up.
Yeah?
He convinced her she could be an artist.
They were going to live in a houseboat in Amsterdam... a sailboat off the coast of Sardinia.
He'd compose, she'd sing and tell him he was a genius.
Please, I'll have a double order of escape fantasy and a side of running away.
He was losing interest?
I saw it coming.
He'd replaced her in his show.
That bastard hurt her.
You know, she hasn't dated anyone in two years.
Was he a jealous guy?
He didn't like her friends, particularly the guy friends-- particularly, one friend-- this guy, Harrison Hobart.
He felt threatened by me.
Katie and I are close, and one day he was being a bit of a bully psychologically and I said something.
He turned on me.
He just started poking me in the chest with his... with his finger until, finally,
I stopped backing up.
You know, I didn't realize he had a bottle in his hand.
He put you in the hospital.
Yeah, well, it was only overnight.
Why didn't you press charges?
If you had pressed charges
Katie might've held it against you?
Yeah, probably.
You see
Embry didn't want to admit it but Katie and I had much more in common than the two of them did... and he apologized, so...
What is your relationship with Katie?
Oh, man, I wish I knew.
You dating her?
I don't know.
Well, sort of.
Well, either you are or you're not... right?
Is this about Embry or is this about Katie?
I remember my dad leaving.
Almost my first memory.
He said, "l love you.
You can't come with me."
My mom turned the heat down to 55 to save money.
I just remember this... feeling of... emptiness...
...always being cold.
Sam...
-Hey.
-Hey.
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
Oh, well... big night.
I saw Embry.
I think he's back and I think he's watching me.
Where did you see him?
I saw him outside of class.
I saw him get into his car.
You want to... you want to sit down?
You're kind of making me nervous.
Are you afraid of him?
Is that why you're here?
I'm just afraid.
Okay.
I'll look into it.
Thanks.
You know, I'm not really doing anything.
You're welcome to hang out if you want.
Okay.
Okay.
So... why did you become a cop?
Oh, I don't know.
I, um... I had some issues.
I was screwing up.
My uncle had a badge and he cut me a break.
What kind of issues?
Extreme... extreme substance abuse.
Being a cop help?
Oh, no.
Uh-uh.
What do you mean?
Well, I got a pocketful of Get-Out-Of-Jail-Free cards and I never changed anything.
Then I used up all the cards.
Setting the foundation.
Recreational logging.
Squirrel.
Who took all these?
Self-timer.
Ex-fiancee.
She got tired of The Handler Show.
Yeah, when things start going too good
I can't help myself,
I got to mess 'em up.
It's my M.O., anyway.
Finished product.
Excuse me.
Can you take me home now, please?
Katie?
You scared me.
Harrison, I'm...
I completely forgot.
I'm sorry.
You lied.
You lied to me.
I'm a... I'm a total idiot.
I'm just... I'm completely deluding myself!
No, you're not an idiot!
You're not an idiot.
Katie,
I got to tell you something and I should've told you a long time ago.
I think... you're kind... beautiful... and talented and l... I love you.
What?
Uh... I'm in love with you.
I think I've always been in love with you.
Harrison...
But, you know, you don't have to say anything.
You're great... and... you're kind and organized and one of the smartest people I know and anyone would be so lucky to be with you.
Harrison... Harrison...
I go away for a while and look what happens.
You let the whole place fall apart.
The police are looking for you.
I don't really want to talk to the police right now.
You've been messing with me for two weeks.
More like three.
You're proud of yourself?
You think this is fun?
Katie, look...
This... this isn't going to work.
What happened to you?
Where have you been?
I went traveling--
India... Asia.
I lived and worked.
I made my own money.
I had to see what was out there to know the value of what is here... the value of this.
Do you know what my big goal has been?
It's been to stop thinking... to not think to not think that every time the phone rang it was you!
To not think that every piece of mail in my mailbox was from you!
To not think that every person
I'd see approaching was you.
I thought about you every bit as much as you thought about me.
I don't believe you.
Katie I was afraid to say this before.
I love you.
Katie.
Hi, Katie Burke.
Do you know anything about somebody being in the tunnel?
Because the door was open and it's not supposed to be open and it's to remain closed at all times unless you're maintenance and you haven't been around to ask about it and I'm supposed to ask.
No, I don't. I'm busy.
That's not very nice.
Should I tell you what I know?
I was going to, but now maybe
I've changed my mind.
What are you talking about?
Harrison Hobart is missing.
That's two, isn't it?
Embry is definitely back.
I know I should've told you right away but I'm overdue on my thesis which is essentially one long string of endless numbers and finals are coming up and Embry has always had a sort of... chemical aversion to Harry Hobart and I don't... I don't know if he would do anything.
I mean, he might, but this... this whole experience is so far out of my normal range of things.
Okay, slow down.
Are you saying that Embry might have done something to Harrison?
I don't know.
I'm not sure.
I don't know why I feel so comfortable with you.
I know that I shouldn't.
God, what am I doing here?
It's okay.
No, it's not.
Get down on it, get down on it
Get down on it, get down on it...
If somebody told me this was the rest of my life
I think I'd kill myself right now.
This isn't the rest of your life.
This is right now.
Yeah, well, right now my friends are out somewhere else and they're having a great time.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
Your old friends.
Yeah.
I'm just blowing off steam.
I'm sorry, all right?
So what's up with the Larkin kid, huh?
Apparently he had a car waiting-- a CTS Limo.
It was supposed to take him to the airport.
He never got in.
Never used the airline tickets.
The girlfriend says he's back.
What's this girl like, Wade?
What do you mean?
Is she a nice girl?
Yeah.
Smart?
What do you think? Yeah.
What about you, Wade?
Are you smart?
Harrison is a responsible young man and we know he holds you in high regard.
He thinks of you as a confidante.
This is so unlike him.
We're obviously very worried.
If there's anything at all you could tell us...
I don't know where Harrison is.
I'm as worried as you are.
This is difficult for me to ask and in no way am I impugning you.
Was Harrison using drugs?
What?
He missed his father's birthday.
Can you think of anyone he might have gone to visit... any new friends... people we don't know about?
Uh, Harrison doesn't even drink coffee.
He worries about damaging the instrument.
We're grasping for anything.
I'm sure that there is... some explanation.
What do you think you're doing?
Finding you.
Do you know where Harrison is?
The tree-hugger?
I don't really keep tabs on him.
Have you seen him lately?
Wouldn't you like to know.
You piss me off like nobody else, you know that?
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
What you going to do about it?
I want you to come away with me to the country house.
Where is Harrison?
I'll tell you at the country house.
Sure he was in love with her.
Harrison's a good guy.
He mooned around, but he was sweet.
He got his name on scientific papers when he was about 12.
So, what did he know about anything?
Do you think it was odd that he still liked a girl who hadn't shown him any real interest in over two years?
I thought it was the opposite of odd.
Guys are drawn to her like bugs around a bug lamp.
For four years, I've had the privilege of watching it.
That bother you, Julie?
Think you see the horns of jealousy?
You got my angle?
You might want to ask yourself why you're so interested in her.
They think it's a coltish vulnerability but it's just self-obsession.
The pea brain says,
"She needs saving" and the pea brain says,
"l can save her" and then she doesn't notice them.
So, they go crazy.
It's about the missing dad and... validation.
She just needs a friend.
Embry.
Embry!
Detective.
What are you doing here?
Oh, right.
Stalking Katie, I remember.
Listen, I'm...
I'm looking for her.
I think this kid,
Embry Larkin, is back.
Who told you that?
She told you that Embry's back?
She's seen him?
Do you think she's with him right now?
I know. I'll keep asking you questions and you keep not answering them.
Look, I'm just concerned about her.
Detective, you seem like a pretty good guy-- you do, you do-- but Embry was the love of her life.
Ouch!
He who snatched the maidenhead from the maiden.
I shouldn't have said that.
Do you want to come upstairs and have a drink?
Bad Samantha! Bad Sam!
I better go now.
You fell asleep.
It's been a long time since I've watched you sleep.
Where were we?
Oh, no.
-What did you do to Harrison?
-What did you do to Harrison?
What did you do to him?
Evisceration.
Vivisection.
Drawn and quartered.
The quartering act.
Dismemberment.
And set him on fire.
You arrogant, preening... bore!
Who are you running back to,
Katie?
Not the tree-hugger.
Not the townie cop.
You're already the young professional-- passionless, desiccated.... smug.
He slipped that under my door a couple of nights ago.
Where's the old place?
Suite 408.
I'm sorry.
I should have told you sooner.
Can I keep this?
And I saw him again.
I went to his country house.
I told him I never wanted to see him again.
Well, I want to see him.
I need to see this guy.
Detective, please do me a favor.
Sure.
I'm done.
Everyone's done.
I'm not done.
Detective!
You should arrest that man.
It's medicinal-- glaucoma.
I've got a prescription.
Just don't play any Grateful Dead or you're all going in.
Okay, we'll try not to.
Hey, Jed, what do you say?
Hey, long time, no see, Handler.
Listen, if you're not too busy dipping into the drug seizures you want to take a look at these for me?
Do a little compare and contrast of the handwriting.
"My summer vacation.
Working for the
Supreme Court Justice."
I bet he got in.
Thanks, Jed.
Hey, Handler, are you happy?
You seem happy.
Last Chance Dance?
Yeah, that's where they call the wonks out of their cubbyholes and try to mate them.
That would be you.
Wonks?
I'm a scientist. Pure science.
It's sexy.
Very sexy.
Yeah, you want to go?
Did she just ask me out?
I believe so.
I'll go.
Katie! Oh, my God.
Look what came!
You got the job!
I didn't look at this at all.
There's a card in it.
For what, shipping all of your antiques?
Airline tickets?
Bob?
Oh, come on.
Don't be one of those annoying people who wins then acts like winning doesn't matter.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
You know, you could've told me that Embry was back.
I know.
You're thinking about the cop, aren't you?
Maybe.
Okay, visualize this with me.
You're down in New York consulting with Lou Gerstner or the head of GE telling them how to buy
South American countries but on the weekends you fly back up here to hang out with the cop, do cop things maybe go to cop mixers.
I like the cop.
Yeah, um, I can see that.
How much money do detectives make?
Didn't your mother tell you that's a rude question to ask?
No. She was always asking people that.
If I guess right, do I get a prize?
Maybe.
A million bucks.
I didn't want to insult you.
You're not going to insult me.
Look, you don't do police work for the money.
What do you do it for?
I don't know really.
Most people do it because that's what their fathers' did.
Is that what your father did?
He was a teacher.
Hey. Hey...
Oh... I guess I was dreaming.
I was... just having a dream.
What are you thinking about?
That I just woke up next to a girl that I don't really know and I'm not hungover.
How does that feel?
Like free-falling through space.
Can I tell you something and you won't get mad?
You don't seem like a cop to me.
You don't seem that happy doing it.
Can I tell you something?
I'm thinking about quitting.
What would you do?
I'd probably go up to my cabin and hammer some nails figure out the meaning of life.
Okay, I'll come.
I didn't ask you yet.
Sure, you did.
I feel like an anvil has been removed from my ankle.
Finishing your thesis?
Finishing my thesis, school, everything.
That's a good thing.
You know, um... I know you're moving down to New York after graduation, and... the transition from school can be tough.
So I want you to know you can always call me, okay?
'Cause I'm down there a lot, and...
I mean, I was actually wondering if maybe, um...
...if I could call you.
I was nervous about telling you that I'm feeling better and that I won't be needing to see you anymore.
Thank you for making it easier.
Hey, Handler.
Hey, Jed.
You really off the job?
I really am.
You probably don't care but the samples were a match.
The same person wrote the flyer and the college application.
Well, that's just aces, Jed.
You keep up the good work.
See you around.
Only thing is... ink tests show that the note was written two years ago, not last week.
You people are derivative.
You're not viewing a representation of hell.
You are hell.
You haven't produced a real artist in over a decade.
...Screw this play... and screw you people.
Uh... the last time I checked, a weekend lasted two days.
Am I wrong?
Did we switch to a French workweek while I wasn't looking?
Oh, look who's jealous.
Is there electricity or will you be using the light from the fireplace?
I don't mean to pry but when do they want you to show up at McKinsey?
I'm not sure.
Absolutely not.
What do you mean you're not sure?
I mean I don't know.
I haven't heard.
Okay, uh, listen.
Don't flip out but I'm thinking of deferring it for a year.
What?
It's only a year.
I'm burned out.
I'm tired.
What's this cop done to you?
He hasn't done anything.
Well... maybe a little something.
He doesn't even know this is what I'm thinking.
I think go with him.
So what if it takes up a year of your life?
I mean, God, everybody thinks that everything has to be so planned out you know, like our life is on a rail and one misstep, it all goes away.
Basically... who knows?
The last time you were this irrational was with Embry.
Maybe that was the last time
I was happy.
Well, so I just said,
"The hell with it."
Then I went and climbed a mountain but I didn't bring enough water.
So I got a little disorientated and the state police had to come and pick me up.
It was really more embarrassing than anything else.
Oh, um...
Whatever happened with that cop, right?
'Cause he was kind of sweet on you, or...?
Um... I don't know.
I think he's in New Hampshire.
Oh.
Well, New Hampshire's nice this time of year.
I've changed my mind,
I've changed my mind
Yeah,
I've changed my mind, oh...
Come on... come on.
It doesn't like to move the large numbers.
Did you ever think you'd be up this late restructuring a media company?
I thought I was going to be a rock star.
I won't make stupid threats but you're not going to run away with this guy because wherever you go,
I can follow you... even if it's to the woods in New Hampshire.
Why don't you yell?
Come on, I dare you.
Hey, hey, are you okay?
What's the matter?
Let's just leave.
What happened?
He was here.
Who? Embry?
Well, where is he?
Where'd he go?
I'll take care of this right now.
No, don't.
That's what he wants.
He'll hurt you.
Just wait here.
Why don't you join us?
You're going to be great.
You shouldn't be in here.
I'm coming with you.
Well, where do you think he is?
He's right there.
Hey.
Embry, stop!
I want to talk to you!
Hey, Embry?
Hey, Embry?
Come on out.
I'm a police officer.
I've got a gun.
I don't want to hurt you.
Embry?
Hey.
I heard what you said up there.
It was amazing.
It was an incredible performance.
I wasn't... acting.
But we're... Ieaving together.
Stick with finance, Katie.
It's what you're good at.
Embry!
Embry!
Embry, wait!
We're leaving together.
You think I'd take you to Europe?
You'd just stand around awkwardly and I'd feel sorry for you.
I love you!
Really?
We made love right over there.
And now I can't get away from you fast enough.
Embry!
Look at you.
You have no grace.
What are you doing?!
Crazy bitch.
You can't come with me.
Embry, why are you doing this?!
Look at me!
Embry!
Katie!
There's no one there.
There's no one.
No one.
We're not going away together, are we?
We're not going to New Hampshire together, are we?
We'll get you help, okay?
-No. Listen.
-I want to come.
I want to go with you.
You'll be okay.
I want to go with you.
Katie, you can't come with me.
Look.
That's pretty.
There's snow on the roofs.
Katie, listen.
I'm this close to making partner.
We both know the rules about interoffice romance.
I wish we could keep seeing each other but it's just not worth the risk.
I hope we can still be friends.
So where are you?
You're in some motel room.
You just wake up, and you're in a motel room.
There's the key. It feels like maybe it's just the first time you've been there…
but… perhaps you've been there for a week…
three months.
It's kind of hard to say.
I don't know.
It's just an anonymous room.
This guy.
He's here already.
Lenny!
It's Leonard… like I told you before.
Did you? I must have forgot.
I guess I've already told you about my condition.
Only every time I see you.
- My car.
- This is your car.
You're in a playful mood.
It's not good to make fun of someone's handicap.
Just trying to have a little fun.
Roll up your window.
- It's broken.
- I can get that fixed for you.
- So where to, Sherlock?
- I got a lead on a place.
What the hell you wanna go there for?
- You know it?
- Yeah. It's just this fucked-up building.
- Why do you wanna go there?
- Don't remember.
- Looks like somebody's home.
- That thing's been here for years.
What are you talking about?
These tracks are only a few days old.
Tracks? What are you? Pocahontas?
Come on!
Let's take a look inside.
“Teddy.”
“Don't believe his lies.
He is the one. Kill him.”
I finally found him.
How long have I been looking?
Find anything?
Didn't think so.
Let's go.
Fuck this.
You're gonna pay for what you did.
- Beg forgiveness, and then you pay.
- Leonard.
You don't have a clue, you freak.
Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out.
Leonard, you don't know what's going on.
- You don't even know my name.
- Teddy.
That's 'cause you read it off a fucking picture.
You don't know who you are.
I'm Leonard Shelby. I'm from San Francisco.
That's who you were.
That's not what you've become.
- Shut your mouth.
- You want to know, Lenny?
Come on.
Come on. Let's go down to the basement.
Let's go down, you and me, together.
Then you'll know who you really are.
No!
It's just an anonymous room.
There's nothing in the drawers.
But you look anyway.
Nothing except the Gideon Bible, which I, of course, read religiously.
You know who you are, and you know kind of all about yourself.
But just for day-to-day stuff, notes are really useful.
Sammy Jankis had the same problem…
but he really had no system.
He wrote himself a ridiculous amount of notes…
but he'd get them all mixed up.
You really do need a system if you're gonna make it work.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
- What can I do for you, Leonard?
Burt.
Burt. I'm not sure. I think I may have asked you to hold my calls.
- You don't know?
- I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
Right. You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them.
Yeah.
You don't remember saying that?
- That's the thing. I have this condition.
- A condition?
- It's my memory.
- Amnesia?
No, no. It's different from that.
I have no short-term memory.
I know who I am. I know all about myself.
Since my injury, I can't make new memories.
Everything fades.
If we talk for too long,
I'll forget how we started.
Next time I see you,
I'm not gonna remember this conversation.
I don't even know if I've met you before.
So, if I seem a little strange or rude or something-
I've told you this before, haven't I?
Yeah. I don't mean to mess with you, but it's so weird.
- You don't remember me at all?
- No.
- We've talked a bunch of times.
- I'm sure we have.
What's the last thing you remember?
My wife.
What's it like?
It's like waking. It's like you just woke up.
That must suck.
It's all backwards.
Maybe you get an idea what you want to do next, but you don't remember what you just did.
- I'm exactly the opposite-
- How long have I been staying here?
- Couple of days.
- And you're holding my calls?
- Like you said.
- Okay, but this guy's an exception.
- You know this guy?
- Yeah, it's your friend, right?
What makes you think he's my friend?
- I just saw you together, that's all.
- He's not my friend.
- Okay.
- If he calls or if he shows up here… give me a call in my room, okay?
His name's Teddy?
- Teddy, yeah.
- All right.
Look, I hope my condition's not gonna be a problem for you.
No, not as long as you remember to pay the bill.
Yeah. Okay.
- Forty.
- Forty.
This guy-
He's here already.
Lenny!
You really need a system if you're gonna make it work.
You kind of learn to trust your own handwriting.
That becomes an important part of your life.
You write yourself notes.
Where you put your notes-
That also becomes important.
You need a jacket that's got like six pockets in it.
Particular pockets for particular things.
You just kind of learn to know where things go and how the system works.
And you have to be wary of other people writing stuff for you that is not gonna make sense…
or is gonna lead you astray.
I don't know. I guess people try and take advantage of somebody with this condition.
If you have a piece of information which is vital…
writing on your body instead of on a piece of paper can be the answer.
It's just a permanent way of keeping a note.
Who is this?
“Remember Sammy Jankis.”
Excuse me, sir.
You left these at your table.
Thanks.
- Lincoln Street?
- Yeah.
Go straight out on Sixth Street.
Go east all the way-
- Hold on. I'm gonna write this down.
- It's easy. Just go-
Trust me. I need to write this down.
“The Discount Inn.”
Discount Inn.
Natalie.
My car.
Teddy.
“John Edward Gammell.”
This guy told me his name was Teddy.
“Don't believe his lies.”
- Yeah?
- Mr. Gammell?
- Lenny, is that you?
- John Gammell?
Lenny, it's Teddy. Stay there.
I'll be right over.
Okay. I'll be waiting.
“White. Male.”
“First name John.”
“Last name: G” for Gammell.
“Drugs. License plate.”
“SG13…
7IU.”
It's him.
I found you, you fuck.
You said we talked before.
I don't remember that.
Yeah, but it's not amnesia.
I remember everything up until my injury.
I just can't make new memories.
So I can't remember talking to you.
What did we talk about? Oh, Sammy Jankis.
I guess I tell people about Sammy to help them understand.
Sammy's story helps me understand my own situation.
Sammy wrote himself endless amounts of notes, but he got mixed up.
I have a more graceful solution to the memory problem.
I'm disciplined and organized.
I use habit and routine to make my life possible.
Sammy had no drive, no reason to make it work.
Me? Yeah, I got a reason.
“Today, 1:00 p.m. Meet Natalie for info.
She has also lost someone.
She will help you out of pity.”
- Natalie?
- You don't remember me.
- Sorry. I should have explained. I have this-
- You did explain, Lenny.
Please call me Leonard.
My wife called me Lenny.
- Yeah, I know. You told me.
- Then I probably told you how much I hated it.
Yeah.
Do you mind taking your glasses off?
It's hard for me to-
Thanks. So you have information for me?
- Is that what your little note says?
- Yeah.
Must be tough living your life according to a couple of scraps of paper.
You mix your laundry list with your grocery list… and you'll end up eating your underwear for breakfast.
I guess that's why you have those freaky tattoos.
Yeah, it's tough. It's almost impossible.
I'm sorry I don't remember you.
It's nothing personal.
I do have information for you.
You gave me a license plate number.
Had my friend at DMV trace it.
Guess what name came up.
John Edward Gammell. John G.
- Do you know him?
- No.
But his face on his driver's license looked really familiar.
I think he's been in the bar, maybe.
Here's a copy of his license, his registration, photo and all.
Are you sure you want this?
- Have I told you what this man did?
- Yeah.
Then you shouldn't have to ask.
But even if you get revenge, you're not gonna remember it.
You're not even gonna know that it happened.
My wife deserves vengeance. Doesn't make any difference whether I know about it.
Just because there are things I don't remember doesn't make my actions meaningless.
The world doesn't just disappear when you close your eyes, does it?
Anyway, maybe I'll take a photograph to remind myself… get another freaky tattoo.
Tell me about her again.
Why?
Because you like to remember her.
She was beautiful.
- To me, she was perfect.
- No. Don't just recite the words.
Close your eyes… and remember her.
You can just feel the details.
The bits and pieces you never bothered to put into words.
And you can feel these extreme moments…
even if you don't want to.
You put these together, and you get the feel of a person.
Enough to know how much you miss them…
and how much you hate the person who took them away.
I added an address in here.
It might be useful.
It's an abandoned place outside of town.
A guy I knew used to do bigger deals there.
It's isolated.
Sounds perfect.
- Do I owe you any-
- I wasn't helping you for money.
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
See, you have this condition.
Are you still staying at the Discount Inn, room 304? You left it at my place.
Yeah.
- They treating you okay?
- I don't remember.
You know what we have in common?
We are both survivors.
You take care, Leonard.
“Remember Sammy Jankis.”
I met Sammy through work.
Insurance. I was an investigator.
I'd investigate the claims to see which ones were phony.
I had to see through people's bullshit.
It was useful experience,
'cause now it's my life.
When I meet someone,
I don't know if I've met them before.
I have to look in their eyes and try and figure them out.
My job taught me the best way to find out what someone knew was just let them talk…
and watch the eyes and the body language.
If someone scratches their nose while they're talking, experts tell you it means they're lying.
It really means they're nervous.
People get nervous for all sorts of reasons.
It's all about context.
Yeah, I was good.
Sammy was my first real challenge.
Yo, Lenny! I thought you split for good.
- Things change.
- So I see.
- My name's Teddy.
- I guess I've told you about my condition.
Only every time I see you.
Come on, I'll buy you lunch.
- Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
- Yeah.
I'm sick of hearing about the guy.
What about John G? You think he's still here?
- Who?
- Johnny G., the guy you're looking for.
- That's why you haven't left town, am I right?
- Maybe.
- Leonard, look. You have to be very careful.
- Why?
The other day you mentioned that maybe somebody was trying to set you up… get you to kill the wrong guy.
I go on facts, not recommendations, but thank you.
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
- Why not?
- Because your notes could be unreliable.
- Memory's unreliable.
- Oh, please!
No, really. Memory's not perfect.
It's not even that good.
Ask the police.
Eyewitness testimony is unreliable.
The cops don't catch a killer by sitting around remembering stuff.
They collect facts, they make notes, and they draw conclusions.
Facts, not memories.
That's how you investigate.
I know. It's what I used to do.
Memory can change the shape of a room.
It can change the color of a car.
And memories can be distorted.
They're just an interpretation.
They're not a record.
They're irrelevant if you have the facts.
You really want to get this guy, don't you?
He killed my wife.
He took away my fucking memory.
He destroyed my ability to live.
You're living.
Only for revenge.
Then we'll get the bastard.
Where you staying?
The Discount Inn.
I don't know what room.
I haven't got my key.
Probably left it in your room.
Hi. I'm checked in here, but I think I've misplaced my key.
How you doing, Leonard?
Probably in the room, right?
- Don't see my key anywhere.
- Shit.
This is the wrong room.
You're in 304 now.
- I'm sorry. I fucked up.
- This is not my room?
No. Let's go.
Why is this my handwriting?
This was your room, but now you're in 304.
- When was I in here?
- Last week.
But then I rented you another room on top of it.
- Why?
- Business is slow.
I told my boss about your condition and stuff… and he said,
“Try and rent him another room.”
How many rooms am I checked into in this shit-hole?
Just two, so far.
At least you're being honest about ripping me off.
You're not gonna remember anyway.
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
Leonard, always get a receipt.
Yeah. I'm gonna write that down.
- What time is it?
- Quarter to 1:00.
Your room's-
- Natalie?
- You don't remember me.
I'd just become an investigator when I came across Sammy.
Mr. Samuel R. Jankis. Strangest case ever.
You know, the guy's a 58-year-old semiretired accountant.
He and his wife had been in this car accident.
Nothing too serious.
But he's acting funny.
He can't get a handle on what's going on.
The doctors find some possible damage to the hippocampus.
Nothing conclusive, but Sammy can't remember anything for more than a couple of minutes.
Can't work, can't do shit.
The medical bills pile up.
His wife calls the insurance company, and I get sent in.
Now, this is my first big claims investigation, so I really check into it.
Sammy can think just fine, but he can't make any new memories.
He could only remember things for a couple of minutes.
- This is Mr. Shelby.
- He'd watch TV…
but anything longer than a couple of minutes was too confusing.
He couldn't remember how it began.
He liked commercials. They were short.
Sammy. It's time for my shot.
The crazy part was that this guy…
who couldn't even follow the plot of Green Acres anymore…
could do the most complicated things…
as long as he learned them before the accident…
and as long as he kept his mind on what he was doing.
Be gentle.
The doctors assure me there's a real condition called anterograde memory loss…
or short-term memory loss.
It's rare, but legit.
But every time I see him…
I catch this look…
this slight look of recognition.
But he says he can't remember me at all.
Sammy, it's okay. I got it. I got it.
- Hi, Mr. Shelby.
- Hi, Mrs. Jankis.
I can read people, and I'm thinking: bad actor.
So now I'm suspicious, and I order more tests.
Awake.
Where am I?
Somebody's bedroom.
It must be her room.
But who is she?
It's only me.
- Did you sleep okay?
- Yeah. You?
Oh, shit. I gotta be someplace.
- It's pretty weird.
- It's useful.
You never write a phone number on your hand?
I should be able to talk to my friend today about the license plate.
- Yeah, the license plate.
- John G.'s license plate.
You have it tattooed on your thigh.
“Natalie.”
“She has also lost someone.
She will help you out of pity.”
If it's registered in this state… it should only take a couple seconds to pull up his license and registration.
I'll call you as soon as I talk to him.
Do you think we could just arrange a meeting now?
I'm not too good on the phone.
It's great that you- that you're helping me like this.
I'm helping you because you helped me.
So next time you see me, will you remember me?
I think you will.
I'm sorry.
Lenny, before you go, could I have my shirt back, please?
Yo, Lenny! I thought you split for good.
Sammy couldn't pick up any new skills at all.
But I find something in my research: conditioning.
Sammy should still be able to learn through repetition.
It's how you learn stuff like riding a bike.
You just get better through practice.
It's a completely different part of the brain from the short-term memory.
So I had the doctors test
Sammy's response to conditioning.
Just pick up any three objects.
That's a test?
Where were you guys when I did my CPA?
Sorry.
Ow! What the fuck?
- It's a test, Sammy.
- Test this, you fucking quack.
Some of the objects were electrified.
They'd give him a small shock.
They kept repeating the test… always with the same objects electrified.
The point was to see if Sammy could learn to avoid the electrified objects… not by memory, but by instinct.
Natalie, right? Who the fuck is Dodd?
- Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
- What the fuck have you got me into?
Come inside.
- Who is he?
- Calm down. Okay?
This is my problem. You offered to help.
It has nothing to do with your investigation.
How did you get me into this?
You offered to help when you saw what he did to my face.
- How do I know he did that to your face?
- Because I came straight to you after he did it.
I showed you what he did, and I asked you to help me.
- And I just take your word?
- Yeah.
Something doesn't feel right.
I think someone's fucking with me, trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
- Did you?
- What?
- Kill him?
- Of course not!
Hey.
Sit down, okay? Sit.
This has nothing to do with you.
You helped me out, and I'm grateful.
You have to burn them.
Leonard, you decided to help me.
Trust yourself.
Trust your own judgment.
You can question everything.
- You can never know anything for sure.
- There are things you know for sure.
Such as?
I know what that's gonna sound like when I knock on it.
I know what that's gonna feel like when I pick it up.
See? Certainties. It's the kind of memory you take for granted.
You know, I can remember so much.
The feel of the world… and her.
She's gone.
And the present is trivia, which I scribble down as fucking notes!
Hey. Come on. Try and relax. Come on.
It's not easy for me to relax, you know?
Come on. Take your jacket off.
Now. Come on.
Hey.
Didn't think you were the type.
It's backwards.
Come here.
Come here.
What about here?
Maybe it's for when I find him.
I've lost somebody too.
I'm sorry.
His name was Jimmy.
- What happened to him?
- He went to meet somebody.
He never came back.
- Who did he go to meet?
- A guy called Teddy.
What do the police think?
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
When you find this guy, this John G… what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna kill him.
Maybe I can help you find him.
I don't even know how long she's been gone.
It's like I've woken up in bed and she's not here… because she's gone to the bathroom or something.
But somehow I just-
I just know she's never gonna come back to bed.
If I could just reach over and touch her side of the bed…
I would know that it was cold.
But I can't.
I know I can't have her back.
But I don't want to wake up in the morning thinking she's still here.
I lie here not knowing how long I've been alone.
How can I heal?
How am I supposed to heal if I can't… feel time?
“She has also lost someone.
She will help you out of pity.”
They kept testing Sammy for months… always with the same objects carrying the electrical charge.
Ow! What the fuck?
- It's a test, Sammy.
- Test this, you fucking quack!
Even with total short-term memory loss…
Sammy should have learned to instinctively stop picking up the wrong objects.
All the previous cases responded to conditioning.
Sammy didn't respond at all.
It was enough to suggest that his condition was psychological, not physical.
We turned down his claim on the grounds that he wasn't covered for mental illness.
His wife got stuck with the bills, and I got a big promotion.
Conditioning didn't work for Sammy, so he became helpless.
But it works for me.
I live the way Sammy couldn't.
Habit and routine make my life possible.
Conditioning. Acting on instinct.
Awake.
Where am I?
Motel room.
Some anonymous motel room.
Nothing in the drawers, but I'll take a look anyway.
Nothing except the Gideon Bible.
Lenny! Open up!
Just a minute.
Open the door.
Lenny.
Open the door.
Come on!
Hi, Teddy.
Finished playing with yourself, Lenny?
I get it.
Amorous neighbors.
What are you doing here?
You called me. You said you needed my help.
I've had more rewarding friendships than this one.
Although I do get to keep telling the same jokes.
What the fuck is that?
- Who the fuck is that?
- You don't know him?
No! Should I?
Wait a minute.
- Is that John G.?
- I don't think so.
- You don't think so? You didn't write it down?
- I might've fallen asleep before I did.
For Christ's sakes!
Ask him.
What's your name?
Your name.
- Dodd.
- Who did this to you?
- What?
- Who did this to you?
You did.
- I'm not gonna help you kill that guy.
- No, just let me think for a minute.
Okay, Natalie. Who's Natalie?
- Natalie who?
- Why?
- Maybe I know her.
- Look. We gotta get him out of here.
All right, all right.
He's gotta have a car, right?
We take him down to his car, tell him to get the fuck out of town or we're gonna kill him.
We can't walk him out of here tied up and bleeding.
- How the fuck did you get him up here?
- I don't know.
You don't know.
Yes, I do. This is not my room.
It must be his room. Great! Let's go.
- No, no. We can't just leave him here.
- Why not?
Because the maid's gonna walk in.
She'll see him, call the cops. He can ID us.
Okay. We untie him… we clean him up, and we march him out of here with a gun in his back.
A gun. Why would I have a gun?
It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
Fucking hope not.
Which one?
We should probably steal his car.
You know, teach him a lesson.
Shut up.
That's all right for you to say.
You're the one with the Jag.
Get in.
I'm gonna ride with him. You follow us.
Give me your keys.
Take your own car.
- So was he scared?
- Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache.
Fuck you. You should have stolen his car.
- Why? What's wrong with this one?
- Nothing. You want to trade?
So what do you do now?
I'm going to find out what the fuck that was all about.
Natalie, right? Who the fuck is Dodd?
Sammy's wife was crippled by the cost of supporting him… and fighting the company's decision.
But it wasn't the money that got to her.
- I never said that Sammy was faking.
- Listen. I have an idea.
Sammy, I have an idea.
Just that his problem was mental, not physical.
I want you to have a pen in your pocket, okay?
- But she couldn't understand.
- You're gonna have a pad in your pocket.
- I did something wrong?
- You did something wrong!
We're gonna deal with it.
We're gonna try harder.
She looks into his eyes and sees the same person.
If it's not a physical problem, he should just snap out of it.
- Ellen called!
- Ellen called?
- Ellen can't come today! Ellen can't come!
- Okay. I'm sorry!
- I'm sorry. I'm trying. I'm sorry.
- Try harder!
So good old Leonard Shelby from the insurance company gives her the seed of doubt… just like he gave it to the doctors.
But I never said that he was faking.
I never said that.
I don't feel drunk.
- Hello?
- Shit.
Housekeeping.
- Not right now.
- I'm sorry.
Okay.
“Dodd. Put him onto Teddy or just get rid of him for Natalie.”
Dodd.
Get rid of him. Ask Natalie.
Teddy, Teddy.
Leave your number.
You know what to do.
Yeah. This is a message for Teddy.
I'm at the Mountcrest Inn of Fifth Street, room six.
I need you to come over as soon as you get this. It's important.
This is Leonard. Thanks. Bye.
Fuck.
What Mrs. Jankis didn't understand was that you can't bully someone into remembering.
The more pressure you're under, the harder it gets.
Then call me back?
Okay. What am I doing?
I'm chasing this guy.
No. He's chasing me.
Fuck.
“Dodd. White guy.
Mountcrest Inn on Fifth Street.”
I'll get the jump on you, you fucker.
Fuck.
Sorry.
I need a weapon.
This'll do.
I don't feel drunk.
Do I know this guy?
He seems to know me.
What the fuck?
- I like your car.
- Thank you.
- Where'd you get it?
- Are you interested in buying one?
I haven't made a strong enough impression on you?
I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.
Okay. What am I doing?
Who is this?
Ouch. Cut it out.
- How can you read that again?
- It's good.
Yeah, but you've read it, like, a thousand times.
I enjoy it.
I always thought the pleasure of a book was in wanting to know what happens next.
Don't be a prick.
I'm not reading it to annoy you. I enjoy it.
Just let me read, please.
Probably tried this before.
Probably burned truckloads of your stuff.
Can't remember to forget you.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Sir, that'd certainly be in keeping with some of my own discoveries.
I was hoping for a little more on the drugs angle.
Can you hang on a sec?
The police report mentioned the drugs found in the car outside my house.
The car was stolen, but his prints were all over it.
I got friends in the department.
They gave me a copy of it.
I dealt with the police a lot in my insurance job.
With my condition, it's really tough.
I can't keep it all in mind at once.
I have to summarize the different sections.
And there's pages missing.
I guess I've been trying to log them all.
I don't know why these are crossed out.
But they weren't even looking for John G.
The stuff they found in the car fit in with what they believed had happened… so they didn't chase any of it up.
Honey.
Honey, it's late.
Everything okay?
You okay in there?
Was it good for you?
What? Was I supposed to lock the door?
No.
I'd like you to leave now.
There's something about the drugs stashed in the car that doesn't ring true for me.
Because the police claim the guy was an addict… needing money to score, which I think is bullshit…
'cause he's not gonna go breaking into places while he's still got a stash that big.
I think John G. left it there or planted it there.
How do you know that?
Shit. That's true. It fits.
So he's a dealer.
Hang on a sec.
Now we're getting somewhere.
“Discount Inn.”
Yeah, okay. Blonde's fine.
That's what they say.
The Discount Inn. 304.
Leonard.
What then?
We just go to bed.
You wait for me to fall asleep.
You go into the bathroom and you slam the door.
- Slam it?
- Yeah. Loud enough to wake me up.
- And that's it?
- That's it.
First I just need you to put these things around the room.
Just pretend they're your things and that this is your bedroom.
- Should I wear it?
- No. Just like you took it off or something.
I don't want you to use it. I'm sorry.
I just mean put them around the room… as if they were your things.
Whatever gets you off.
I can't blame the cops for not taking me seriously.
This is a difficult condition for people to understand.
Look at Sammy Jankis.
His own wife couldn't deal with it.
I told you about how she tried to get him to snap out of it.
Eventually she came to see me at the office.
I found out all kinds of shit.
She told me about life with Sammy, how she treated him.
Thank you for seeing me.
It got to the point where she'd get Sammy to hide food all around the house.
Then she'd stop feeding him to see if his hunger… would make him remember where he'd hidden the food.
She wasn't a cruel person.
She just wanted old Sammy back.
Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you've decided that he's faking.
Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is faking anything… just that his condition can't be shown to be-
I just want to know what your honest opinion about Sammy is.
We shouldn't even be talking like this while the case is still open to appeal.
- I'm not appealing the decision.
- Then why are you here?
Try to understand.
When I look at Sammy…
I don't see some… vegetable.
I see my same old Sammy.
What do you think that's like for me to suspect he might be imagining this whole problem… and that if I just could say the right thing… he'd snap out of it and go back to being normal?
If I knew that my old Sammy were truly gone… then I could say good-bye and start loving this new Sammy.
As long as I have doubt,
I can't say good-bye and move on.
What do you want from me?
I want you to forget the company you work for 30 seconds… and tell me if you really believe that Sammy's faking his condition.
I need to know… what you honestly believe.
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
Thank you.
I thought I helped her. I thought she just needed some kind of answer.
I didn't think it was important what the answer was… just that she had one to believe.
- A car this nice you should lock.
- Who the fuck are you?
- Teddy, your buddy.
- Prove it.
Sammy. Remember Sammy?
You told me about Sammy!
Geez!
What the fuck are you doing in my car?
What, your sense of humor went with the memory?
- Do you even know why you're here?
- Unfinished business.
Lenny, let me inform you.
Your business here is very much finished.
- You're still here because of Natalie.
- Who's Natalie?
Schmuck, whose house do you think you just walked out of?
That's right. Take a look at your pictures.
I bet you got one of her.
Nice shot, Leibovitz.
You'll wanna make a note.
You can't trust her.
Yeah? Why's that?
Because by now she's taken a look at this suit and the car… and she's starting to figure out ways of turning the situation to her advantage.
She's already got you staying with her, for Christ's sakes.
You can't go back in there.
Let me give you the name of a motel.
- You're lucky I ran into you. That broad's bad news.
- What do you mean, “bad news”?
She's involved with drugs.
Look. These. You see these?
This is the bar where she works.
Her boyfriend's a drug dealer.
She takes orders for him, arranges meets.
He writes messages on the back of these.
Then she slips him the answers when she serves him his drinks.
- Why should I care?
- Because when she gets jammed up… she's gonna use you to protect herself.
From who?
Guys are gonna wanna know what happened to her boyfriend.
Guys are gonna come after her.
Somebody's gotta pay, Lenny.
Somebody always pays.
Maybe she'll make it you.
Oh, yeah?
Maybe she'll make it you. Is that it?
You worried that she's gonna use me against you?
- No.
- Why not?
Because she doesn't know who I am.
- Why are you following me?
- Maybe I wanna help.
She doesn't know anything about your investigation, okay, Einstein?
So write this down.
When she offers to help, it'll be for her own reasons.
I'm not lying.
Take my pen. Write this down.
Do not trust her.
- There. You happy now?
- I won't be happy until you leave town.
Why not?
You ever wonder how long you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
What sort of questions?
The same sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
- Like what?
- Like, how did you get this suit, the car?
- I have money.
- From what?
My wife's death. I used to work in insurance.
We were well covered.
So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership.
You don't have a clue, do you?
- You don't even know who you are.
- Yes, I do.
I don't have amnesia. I remember everything right up until the incident.
I am Leonard Shelby.
I am from San Francisco-
That's who you were.
You do not know who you are… what you've become since… the incident.
You wander around playing detective.
You don't even know how long ago it was.
Let me put it this way. Were you wearing designer suits when you sold insurance?
- I didn't sell insurance. I investigated it.
- Right. You're an investigator.
- Maybe you should start investigating yourself.
- Thank you for the advice.
Look, do me a favor. Don't go back in there.
Will you take the motel out of town?
It's been fun, Lenny.
“Do not trust her.”
“Don't believe his lies.”
Fuck it. I need my own place.
No. She shouldn't have given me that responsibility.
I'm a claims investigator, not a doctor.
Yeah. I guess.
But I've got all sorts of other considerations.
Legal responsibility, large financial-
Who is this?
Write this down.
Write down what happened. Write it down.
Concentrate.
Keep it in mind. Find a pen.
What happened?
What does it look like?
He beat the shit out of me.
Who?
Who?
Fuck, Leonard. Dodd.
Dodd beat the shit out of me.
- Why?
- Why? Because of you.
Because I did what you told me to do!
Go in and reason with him!
- Tell him about Teddy! Great fucking idea!
- Calm down. Take it easy.
You're safe. It's okay.
Come on. Just sit down.
Sit down.
Here. Sit down.
Okay. You're okay.
I'll just get some ice for your face.
Here.
I did exactly what you told me to do.
I went to Dodd… and I told him that I didn't have any of Jimmy's money… or the drugs… and that this Teddy must have taken everything.
And what did he say?
He didn't believe me.
He said if I don't have the drugs by tomorrow, he's gonna kill me.
Then he just started hitting me.
Where is he?
- Why?
- I'll go see him.
And?
I'll give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.
He'll kill you, Lenny.
My wife used to call me Lenny.
Yeah?
Yeah. I hated it.
This guy is so dangerous.
- Let's just think of something else, okay?
- No, no.
You just tell me what he looks like… and where I can find him.
- Have you got a pen?
- In my purse.
He'll probably find you.
- What do you mean?
- I told him about your car.
Why?
He was beating the shit out of me.
I had to tell him something.
Just write it all down.
Be careful.
I'll be fine.
- A car this nice you should lock.
- Who the fuck are you?
Front desk?
Burt. Right.
This is Mr. Shelby in room 21.
Yeah, that's the thing. I don't want any calls.
Nope. None at all.
- What's wrong?
- Somebody's come already.
- Who?
- He calls himself Dodd.
What does he want?
He wants to know what happened to Jimmy and his money. He thinks I took it.
Did you?
No.
- What's this all about?
- Fuck!
You don't have a fucking clue, do you?
You're just blissfully ignorant, aren't ya?
- I have this condition.
- I know all about your fucking condition, Leonard!
Probably know more about it than you do.
You don't have a fucking clue about anything else.
What happened?
What happened is that Jimmy went to meet some guy named Teddy.
He took a lot of money with him, and he never came back.
Jimmy's partners think I set him up.
I don't know if you know this Teddy, or how well.
- Neither do I.
- Don't protect him!
- I'm not.
- Help me.
How?
Get rid of Dodd for me.
- What?
- Kill him. I'll pay you.
What do you think I am?
I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
What then? Love?
What would you kill for?
- You'd kill for your wife, wouldn't you?
- That's different.
- Not to me. I wasn't fucking married to her.
- Hey, don't talk about my wife.
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want!
I can say whatever I want and you won't remember.
I could call your wife a fucking whore and we could still be friends.
- Calm down.
- Easy for you to say. You can't get scared.
- You don't know how, you fucking idiot!
- Take it easy. This has nothing to do with me.
Maybe it does. How the fuck would you know?
You don't know a fucking thing!
- You can't get scared, but can you get angry?
- Yes.
You pathetic piece of shit.
I can say whatever the fuck I want… and you won't have a fucking clue, you fucking retard!
- Shut your mouth.
- You know what? I'm gonna use you.
I'm telling you now, because I'm gonna enjoy it so much more… if I know that you could stop me if you weren't such a fucking freak.
Did you lose your pen?
That's too bad, freak. Otherwise, you could write yourself a little note… about how much Natalie hates your retarded guts and that I called your wife a fuckin' whore.
- Don't say another fuckin' word.
- About your whore of a wife?
I read about your condition, Leonard.
You know what one of the causes of short-term memory loss is? Venereal disease.
Maybe your cunt of a fucking wife sucked one too many diseased cocks… and turned you into a fucking retard!
You sad, sad freak.
I can say whatever the fuck I want… and you won't remember.
We'll still be best friends… or maybe even lovers.
Fuck.
I'll see you soon.
Stay focused. Find a pen.
Gotta write this down. Gotta write it down.
Concentrate. Concentrate. Concentrate.
Keep it in mind.
Keep it in mind. Keep it in mind.
Come on. Gotta find a pen.
I gotta find a pen.
Write this down.
Write this down, exactly what happened.
Gonna write down exactly what happened.
Come on.
I gotta find a pen. Geez! Come on.
Keep focused. Keep focused.
Keep it in mind.
Come on. Find a pen.
Write this note.
Write down what happened.
Write it down. Concentrate.
Keep it in mind.
What happened?
What does it look like?
He beat the shit out of me.
Who?
Who?
Fuck, Leonard. Dodd.
Dodd beat the shit out of me.
Hello?
It's Burt, from the front desk.
- Yeah?
- I know you said you didn't want any calls.
But this guy called.
He's on the phone now. He says he's a cop.
- A cop?
- Yeah.
He says you're really gonna wanna know what he has to say.
I'm not too good on the phone. I need to look people in the eye when I talk to them.
You can crash on the couch.
It's comfortable.
Just have a seat.
Thanks.
How long do you think it's gonna take you?
You told me you were looking for the guy who killed your wife?
That depends on if he's here in town or if he's moved on.
I have my file here.
Can I ask you something?
If you have all of that information… then why haven't the police found him for you?
- They're not looking for him.
- Why not?
They don't think he exists.
You see, I told them what I remembered.
I was asleep.
Something woke me up.
Her side of the bed was cold.
She'd obviously been out of bed for a while.
There had to be a second man.
Somebody hit me from behind.
I remember.
It's about the last thing that I do remember.
Look. The police did not believe me.
If we check the police-
How did they explain what you do remember?
The gun and stuff.
John G. was clever.
He was clever.
See, he took the dead man's gun, he replaced it with the sap that he hit me with.
He left my gun and he left the getaway car.
He gave the police a complete package.
They found the sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand.
And they only found my gun.
They didn't need to look for anybody else.
I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.
The cops are not gonna believe someone in my condition.
Leonard, you can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help you.
Thanks.
I have to go back to work.
So, just make yourself at home.
You can watch TV or you can have some food, whatever you want, okay?
- Make yourself at home.
- One thing.
- Something to remember you by.
- My name is Natalie.
“Natalie.”
- What's wrong?
- Somebody's come already.
- On the house.
- Thanks.
You really do have a problem.
Just like that cop said.
Your condition.
Nobody's perfect.
What's the last thing that you do remember?
- My wife.
- That's sweet.
Dying.
I remember my wife dying.
Let me get you another one.
I think this one's dusty.
Why are you calling me? What do you want?
I know you're a cop, but what do you want?
Have I done something wrong?
I don't know. Something bad, maybe.
Why are you asking me? I can't remember what I've done. You wouldn't believe me anyway.
Because of my condition.
You don't believe someone with this condition.
Nobody believed Sammy!
I didn't even fucking believe Sammy!
“Ferdy's Bar.”
“Come by after. Natalie.”
I'll have a beer, please.
- What do you want?
- A beer, please.
You can't just waltz in here dressed like that and ask for a beer.
- What, is there a dress code?
- Why are you here?
- I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
- That's me.
Yeah. We met before, right?
- Then why am I here?
- I don't know. Why don't you tell me.
I don't remember. I have no short-term memory.
It's not amnesia.
- You're the memory guy.
- How do you know about me?
My boyfriend told me about you.
- Yeah? Who's your boyfriend?
- Jimmy Grants. Do you know him?
No.
He knows you. He told me about you.
He said you were staying at the Discount.
In fact, a cop came by earlier, was looking for you.
Said he was looking for a guy who can't remember anything… wouldn't know how he got here or what he'd done.
Said I get a lot of guys around here like that.
Chronic alcoholism is one cause of short-term memory loss.
- Are you Teddy?
- No. My name's Leonard.
- Did Teddy send you?
- I don't know.
- What's happened to Jimmy?
- I don't know that either.
- Sorry.
- You don't remember anything?
You don't remember where you've been or what you've just done.
No. I can't make new memories.
Everything just fades.
- Then why did you come here?
- I found this in my pocket.
Your pocket.
Bar bet. Care to contribute?
- No, thanks.
- It's for a lot of money.
Come on. Proceeds are going to charity.
Help me out.
Thank you.
- On the house.
- Thanks.
It's completely fucked because nobody believes you.
It's amazing what a little brain damage will do for your credibility.
I guess it's some kind of poetic justice for not believing Sammy.
You know the truth about my condition, Officer?
You don't know anything.
You feel angry, you don't know why.
You feel guilty, you have no idea why.
You could do anything and not have the faintest idea 10 minutes later.
Like Sammy.
What if I've done something like Sammy?
I didn't tell you what happened to Sammy and his wife?
She came to see me at my office. I thought she was trying to catch me off guard…
so I didn't tell her what I really thought, but I never said that he was faking…
just that his condition was mental, not physical.
I found out later that she went home and gave Sammy his final exam.
Sammy? It's time for my shot.
She knew beyond a doubt that he loved her.
So she found a way to test him.
Sammy. It's time for my shot.
She really thought she'd call his bluff.
There you go.
Or she just didn't wanna live with the things she'd put him through.
Sammy.
It's time for my shot.
It won't hurt.
She went into a coma and never recovered.
Sammy couldn't understand or explain what happened.
He's been in a home ever since.
He doesn't even know that his wife is dead.
I was wrong about Sammy, and I was wrong about his wife.
She wasn't interested in the money.
She just needed to understand his problem.
His brain didn't respond to conditioning.
But he wasn't a con man.
When she looked into his eyes, she thought he could be the same person.
When I looked into his eyes,
I thought I saw recognition.
Now I know. You fake it.
If you think you're supposed to recognize somebody, you just pretend to.
You bluff it to get a pat on the head from the doctors.
You bluff it to seem less of a freak.
What drug dealer?
- Hey, Lenny, how you doing?
- It's private back here.
- It's okay. We know each other. Right, kid?
- How did you know I was in here?
The Jag's out front.
Should have put it around back.
What are you still doing here, Lenny?
There's plenty of tattoo parlors up north.
I guess I wanted to get something down before it slipped my mind.
- Give me the keys. I'll move it.
- It'll be all right for a minute.
Wait out there.
Give me a minute.
I gotta get something for you.
Fact six: Car license SG137IU.
Look. Wait a minute, will ya?
- We gotta get you out of here.
- Why?
Man. Come on, Leonard.
How many times I gotta tell you?
- It's not safe for you to hang around here anymore.
- Why not?
Because that cop's looking for you.
I gotta get you a new identity, some new clothes.
A different car would do for now.
So put these on.
What cop?
He's a bad cop. He's the one that checked you into the Discount Inn.
He's been calling you for days, telling you shit, slipping envelopes under your door. Shit like that.
- How do you know this?
- He told me. He thinks it's funny.
- He's been laughing at you.
- You're full of shit.
I'm not. He knows you're no good on the phone, so he's been calling you.
Sometimes you don't answer the phone… so he slips shit under your door to scare you into answering the phone again… giving you a line of crap about John G. being some local drug dealer.
- Jimmy Grants.
- Who's Jimmy Grants?
Leonard, Jimmy's the drug dealer.
The cop wants to know how his operation's run.
He's got some score in mind.
Somehow you're involved.
Uh-huh. How do you know him?
I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town.
The local boys put us together.
If he knew I was helping you, he'd fucking kill me.
So take these clothes, put them on and get the fuck out of here.
Come on, Leonard. Just go.
You are full of shit.
“Come by after. Natalie.”
“Ferdy's Bar.”
Hey, Jimmy.
I'm sorry.
I thought you were somebody else.
Sorry.
That's okay.
So this Jimmy Grants deals drugs out of the bar where his girlfriend works?
But he's not gonna bring her along.
He'll come by himself, right?
I always figured the drugs angle would be the best way to get him.
No, Officer. I'm as ready as I'll ever be.
You're in the lobby? What do you look like?
I'll be right there.
Lenny.
Officer Gammell.
Yeah. Come on.
- Smile.
- Not here.
Over here.
- Is it Officer or Lieutenant Gammell?
- You know what?
Don't write Gammell, just Teddy.
- Why?
- I'm undercover.
This is the directions where he's going.
- My number's on the bottom if you need me.
- You're not coming?
No. It wouldn't be appropriate.
Nice picture. I look thin.
Hey, Lenny.
Make him beg.
Teddy!
Hey, Teddy!
Jimmy.
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- You Jimmy Grants?
Expecting any other Jimmys out here,
Memory Man?
- Do you remember me?
- Yeah, I remember you.
Where the fuck's Teddy?
Well?
Motherfuck-Fuckin' retard!
- Strip.
- You're making a big fucking mistake, pal.
Strip!
My associates are not the kind of people you wanna piss off.
Don't say anything else.
- I knew I couldn't trust that fuck!
- Take it off.
Cocksucker.
Your pants too.
- Why?
- I don't wanna get blood on them.
Wait. Did he tell you what I was bringing?
- Take your fuckin' pants off!
- I've got 200 grand stashed in the car!
- Just take it!
- You think you can bargain with me?
- Take the money and walk away!
- I don't want your fuckin' money.
Then what?
- What do you want from me?
- I want my fuckin' life back!
Sammy.
He said “Sammy.”
How does he know about Sammy?
Oh, fuck.
What have I done?
Mister, I need help.
There's a guy in here, he's hurt bad.
- We gotta get him to a doctor.
- All right.
I don't know what happened.
I've got this memory thing.
- Do I know you?
- No. Don't worry. I'm a cop.
- Is he still breathing?
- I don't know. Maybe.
What the hell were you guys doing down here?
I don't remember. I have this condition.
I hope it's not as serious as his,
'cause this guy's dead.
Ow! Lenny! That shit kills!
So you remember me now, huh?
You are a fuckin' cop.
Yeah. And I'm the guy that helped you find him.
Get up. Get up.
Lenny, you got the wrong idea.
Who is that? He knew me.
Of course he did. He raped your wife.
He fucked up your brain.
Bullshit. He's not the guy.
His name is James F. Grants.
John G. Check your tattoos.
- What was he bringing the 200 grand for?
- What?
- What was it for?
- A load of amphetamines I told him I had.
- Is this a drug deal?
- No. Yeah, that and your thing.
Look, Leonard, Jimmy's your guy. I just figured we'd make a few dollars on the side.
- How did he know me?
- The Discount Inn. He dealt out of there.
The guy at the front desk let him know if anybody came snooping around.
He called Jimmy the minute he saw you taking a picture of the dump.
- You're fucking using me.
- No! You get half!
He knew about Sammy!
Why would I tell him about fuckin' Sammy?
You tell everybody about Sammy, everybody who'll listen.
“Remember Sammy Jankis?”
“Remember Sammy Jankis?”
Great story.
Gets better every time you tell it.
So you lie to yourself to be happy.
There's nothing wrong with that.
We all do it.
Who cares if there's a few little details you'd rather not remember?
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- I don't know.
Your wife surviving the assault.
Her not believing your condition.
The torment and pain and anguish tearing her up inside.
The insulin.
That's Sammy, not me.
I told you about Sammy.
Yeah, right.
Like you tell yourself over and over again.
Conditioning yourself to remember.
- Learning through repetition.
- Sammy let his wife kill herself.
- Sammy ended up in an institution.
- Sammy was a con man, a faker.
I never said that Sammy was faking.
You exposed him for what he was-a fraud.
But I was wrong. That's the whole point.
- See, Sammy's wife came to me.
- Sammy didn't have a wife.
It was your wife who had diabetes.
Ouch.
My wife wasn't diabetic.
You sure?
- Ouch. Cut it out.
- She wasn't diabetic.
You think I don't know my own wife?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
I guess I can only make you remember the things you wanna be true.
- Like old Jimmy down there.
- He's not the right guy.
He was to you.
Come on. You got your revenge.
Enjoy it while you still remember.
What difference does it make whether he was your guy or not?
- It makes all the difference.
- Why? You're never gonna know.
- Yes, I will.
- No, you won't.
I will. Somehow I'll know.
- You won't remember!
- When it's done, I will know. It'll be different.
I thought so too.
In fact, I was sure of it, but you didn't!
That's right. The real John G.
I helped you find him over a year ago.
He's already dead.
- Don't lie to me anymore.
- Look, Lenny.
I was the cop assigned to your wife's case.
I believed you.
I thought you deserved a chance for revenge.
I'm the one that helped you find the other guy in your bathroom that night… the guy that cracked your skull and fucked your wife.
We found him. You killed him.
But you didn't remember.
So I helped you start looking again… looking for the guy you already killed.
Yeah? So who was he?
Just some guy. Does it even matter who?
No reason, Lenny. No conspiracy.
Just bad fucking luck.
Couple of junkies too strung out to realize your wife didn't live alone.
But when you killed him,
I was so convinced that you'd remember.
But it didn't stick.
Like nothing ever sticks.
Like this won't stick.
I took that picture… just when you did it.
Look how happy you are.
I wanted to see that face again.
- Gee, thanks.
- Fuck you.
I gave you a reason to live, and you were more than happy to help.
You don't want the truth.
You make up your own truth.
Like your police file.
It was complete when I gave it to you.
Who took out the 12 pages?
- You, probably.
- No, it wasn't me. See, it was you.
- Why would I do that?
- To create a puzzle you could never solve.
You know how many towns?
How many John G.'s or James G.'s?
Shit, Lenny. I'm a fucking John G.
- Your name is Teddy.
- My mother calls me Teddy.
My name's John Edward Gammell.
Cheer up.
There's plenty of John G.'s for us to find.
All you do is moan.
I'm the one that has to live with what you've done.
I'm the one that put it all together.
You wander around, you're playing detective.
You're living a dream, kid.
A dead wife to pine for.
A sense of purpose to your life.
A romantic quest that you wouldn't end even if I wasn't in the picture.
- I should kill you.
- Quit it. Lenny, come on.
You're not a killer.
That's why you're so good at it.
What are you doing?
You know what time it is?
It's beer o'clock. I'm buying.
Fuck.
I'm not a killer.
I'm just someone who wanted to make things right.
Can I just let myself forget what you've told me?
Can I just let myself forget what you made me do?
You think I just want another puzzle to solve?
Another John G. to look for?
You're a John G.
So you can be my John G.
Do I lie to myself to be happy?
In your case, Teddy… yes, I will.
Hey, that's not your car!
- It is now.
- Jesus Christ, you can't take it!
- Why not?
- Because the guy you just killed owns it!
Somebody'll recognize it!
I think I'd rather be mistaken for a dead guy than a killer.
I might hang on to this for a while.
Lenny.
Will you help me find the keys?
Help me find my keys.
I have to believe in a world outside my own mind.
I have to believe that my actions still have meaning… even if I can't remember them.
I have to believe that when my eyes are closed… the world's still here.
Do I believe the world's still here?
Is it still out there?
Yeah.
We all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are.
I'm no different.
Now, where was I?
^ xSilver ^
Aah! lt's love, isn't it?
Sometimes you walk into a house and you take one look around , and you know.
And you say, ''This is for me.''
Oh , l think it's perfect. lt's just what we've been looking for.
There aren't enough plugs.
Hey, wait, Mr. Coleman , now.

When we get older, we could trip.

Hi, Sara.
My name's Teddy.
Your husband told me to tell you he loves you very much, but sometimes he loses track of the time. l'm sorry l'm late.
Happy anniversary.
Happy anniversary.
Yes.
Look at what he brought you.
Look at that. lsn't that pretty?
Oh, you know, you have a wonderful husband that thinks about you like that on your anniversaries.
You're so fortunate! lt's beautiful. lt's actually Teddy's fault that l'm late.
He had a little accident in the backseat, cotton all over the place, but l cleaned it up. lt's okay. l forgive Teddy.
Hey, come on, Sara.
Don't be like that. l'm on a roll here.
We sold seven houses this month.

Did l miss that much stuff this month?
Okay. We're gonna take off this weekend .
What?
We're gonna take off and go down to the lake like we did last year with the kids for the whole weekend .
-How's that sound?
-Can we really close on this?
Yes. How about this?
We can close on this.
How about this?
Close on that.
Let me go tell the kids.
All right?
Okay. All right.
Megan and Michael , big family adventure!
Hey!
Michael Jordan Evers!
Aah! Aah!
Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Dad ! There's a...
-What is it?
-There's a spider in my room!
-There's a what?
There's a spider in my room on the window.
Why don't you kill it, man?
That's a big spider!
Come on . lt's just a spider, Michael.
How big could it be?
What is this?
Where's the spider at?
What? Man, you're acting like it's Mothra. lt's just a spider.
You're making a big deal out of nothing, Michael .
You're 10 years old . lt's time l teach you how to kill a spider the right way.
The most efficient way to crush a spider.
You got to get a good magazine.
Doesn't matter what you use.
Some people like to use ''Life'' or ''Time'' or...
This is my ''Sports lllustrated''
Swimsuit Edition.
What are you doing with it?
-l don't know.
-Yeah, right. lf you can look at this, you should have enough courage to kill a spider the right way.
So l'm gonna roll this up so you get a good grip on it.
You get a bead on the spider.
You get a side swing.
That's where you can really get some good action going.
You want to come across like that so you really crush it.
You come across this way so you get his whole escape route in case he try to go...
You take it, and you whack it.
Go on.
Whack the spider. l don't want to whack it.
Come on, you got to whack the spider, Mike. Whack it.
Dad, l'm afraid of spiders. l can't whack it.
Let me explain something to you .
All your life you're gonna be facing spiders, okay? l am?
What l'm trying to say is you should never be afraid .
People know, they use that against you . l'm not scared of anything . l'm your dad, right?
You're my son .
You whack that spider. l can't whack the spider, Dad.
Come on . Whack it.
You can do it. Whack the spider.
-l don't want to whack it.
-Yes, you can . Come on.
Kill the spider.
Kill the spider.
Dad, l can't crush it. l can't whack it!
Hey.
There.
Happy?
No, l'm not happy, Megan . l was trying to make a point about how it's important to whack your own spiders!
Whatever.
Mm-hmm.
Past the Old Miller Road.
Okay. Great. lt is an old home, Ms. Evers.
And my employer is anxious to move on.
Would it be possible for you to come alone to discuss the situation?
But my husband and l work as a team.
The master usually does not take visitors.
However, from your photograph, he thought you to have a trustworthy face.
About your husband , he felt differently.
Oh .
You got our flyer.
The master had wished to meet you tomorrow evening.
Oh , l'm so sorry.
But tomorrow l've got plans that can't be broken.
Who is that?
-Excuse me a second .
-Who is that?
Just someone calling about repping a house.
What's the address?
Where is it?
Sara, do you know where this place is?
The places up here are big multimillion-dollar mansions.
This could be big.
And what about our big family adventure?
JlM: lt's just a little detour.
How long is it gonna take?
No more than 20 minutes.
20 minutes tops.
You kids should be excited.
You're gonna see Mommy and Daddy in real-estate action.
Somebody's calling me.
Who's calling me?
Hello. Jim Evers,
Evers & Evers Real Estate.
Stan , how you doing?
What's the latest?
Really?
The Selmer property?
Tomorrow?
Wow. l'm kind of out of town right now.
Hey. But, hey, listen .
Maybe l could come back early.
Oh, no. l can't come back early.
No, l can't come back early.
Maybe we should just take care of this on Monday.
All right?
Monday?
Monday sounds fantastic.
Okay. l'll talk to you on Monday.
We're gonna talk on Monday.
Are we still in America?
Here it is, right here.
Okay? All right?
Yeah, that's a whole lot of gate.
They must have a big possum problem down here.
That's some big possum.
Didn't they know we were coming?
Of course they knew.
Maybe there's a call box or something.
Hello?!
Hello!
The Evers are here!
Yes, we're here now!
Nobody's answering.
Now l got to get out in the dirt with my brand-new shoes on.
Wow.
How are we gonna get in?
What if you give me a boost, and l'll go around the back?
They're probably old .
We'll surprise them.
You'll probably kill them.
Let's just go. lt's getting late.
You know, Sara, you give up too easy.
You got to be more patient.
The Evers way is to be patient.
All right.
We're in business.
Let's go, let's go.
Let's do this.
Wow.
Bob Vila would have a field day with this place.
Hey, Megan , don't slam the door like that. lt's very sensitive. lt's a car, Dad.
Ah ! lt's not just a car. lt's a very delicate piece of machinery.
Shh . She didn't mean what she just said.
She didn't mean that.
Come on .
Let's see what's around back. l'm getting hungry.
Me too.
Don't worry.
We'll be 20 minutes tops.
Hey, Dad , when we get to the lake, can l go to that pizza shop where l ate that whole pizza, and when we got to the cabin, l threw up and you still saw the pepperoni chunks in it?
Yeah , we can go there if we can avoid a repeat performance.
Wow.
Now, that's something you don't see every day.
Oh, my God.
Dead people?
Hey, honey.
You know they have, uh , dead people in the backyard?
Well , some people have pools.
Some people have private cemeteries. lt happens.
You're gonna sell a house with this?
This historical sprawling manor with spacious grounds? Yes.
Hey, that's good .
We'll put that on the listing.
And leave out all the dead people?
We'll just stick to the bright side.
Oh, no. l got my good suit on.
Oh.
You think it's gonna stop?
Oh , l hope it's not raining at the lake.
When you're at work with Mommy and Daddy, you're always on your best behavior, right?
Okay.
Whoo!
Look at the size of these knockers.
Ever see anything like that before?
Hello?!
Evers Real Estate!
Evers Real Estate!
Hello? ls anybody home?
Hello?
We're the Evers from
Evers & Evers Real Estate.
Hi!
Have you ever seen anything like this?
Never.
Sara, this puts us in a whole new league.
Smells like Grandma's house.
Worse.
Smells like Grandma.
This place is just a little dusty.
We'll get a cleaning crew to come out here and shine it up.
This place would be sparkling from top to bottom.
Mom, this place has spiders.
Sara Evers.
Yes, l'm Sara.
My name is Ramsley.
Hello, Ramsley. l'm Jim Evers of Evers & Evers Real Estate at your service.
We were not expecting ...others.
Yes, we were on our way out of town .
Yeah, then when we realized the enormity and complexity of your unique estate, we wanted to commit the full resources of Evers & Evers Real Estate.
At Evers & Evers, we want you to be happy forevers and evers.
Please accept this waterproof calendar as a token of our appreciation.
Very well.
We shall have to place other settings.
Who do you have the settings for?
Master Gracey wishes to discuss his affairs over dinner.
Oh, l'm afraid we have plans.
Honey, we can't stay for dinner.
Oh, yes.
But we mustn't be rude, darling.
What about our family adventure?
Yeah, Dad.
We'll just have some soup, and then we'll get going, okay?
All right?
Wow.
Wow.
Nice.
Very nice.
Good job.
Good job.
Hey, Megan, how'd you like to eat like this every day at home?
The master will be with you shortly.
Carry on. l said, ''Carry on.''
He walks off.
Have you ever seen a fireplace this amazing? lncredible.
Ah , we could have one heck of a wienie roast in that thing, huh?
Seriously.
Look at this detail. l've never seen anything like this.
-Haven't you?
My grandfather spared no expense when he built this mansion.
Well , your grandfather had really good taste in tchotchkes. l'm Jim Evers of Evers & Evers Real Estate.
Charmed to make your acquaintance, sir.
Edward.
Edward Gracey.
Uh, this is my wife, Sara.
You want to come meet
Mr. Gracey?
Very nice to meet you ,
Mr. Gracey.
And this is our daughter, Megan , and our son , Michael.
You have very beautiful children , Ms. Evers. l kicked in some chromosomes, too.
Children.
Madam .
Oh. Nice.
Okay.
Thank you .
The master was very pleased when he heard you could come on such short notice.
Normally we would not have called you here so abruptly.
But we had no other choice.
What do you got, termites or something?
Big house like this must have a lot of termites.
No. But lately there have been more...disturbances.
What do you think of the house, Ms. Evers?
Oh. l think it's absolutely incredible.
The ltalian influence.
The Renaissance style of the molding.
The attention to detail is stunning.
You never see houses like this.
Or at least l don't.
Great care and love went into the building of this mansion.
This house is my inheritance.
My birthright.
But lately it's become too much to bear.
Tell me, Mr. Evers.
Do you believe in ghosts?
Ghosts?
Yeah. Sure. l believe in ghosts. Yeah . l don't think it's a good idea to put that on the listing.
You should talk about how many bathrooms are in the house.
People love bathrooms.
We should play up the toilet angle and leave out ghosts. l think that'd be best.
The storm has swollen the river.
How's that?
The storm has flooded the road. l'm afraid there will be no leaving the mansion tonight.
What?
Of course you are all more than welcome to spend the night here.
Oh, no. l really don't think we should.
We've got plans. l'm afraid there's no other way.
Ramsley will show you to your rooms. l believe the children will be comfortable in this room.
Yeah.
Real homey.
You'll be fine.
Wow.
Hey, listen .
When you flush the toilet, check and see how quickly it refills.
Good night, Dad.
Good night. l hope you and the madame will find this room to your liking.
Yeah. lt's great. lt'll be like spending the night in a fine hotel.
Will there be anything else that you require, sir?
Are you gonna get us some chocolates?
Pardon?
You know, the little chocolates they put on the hotel pillows.
Sometimes they have chocolates on the pillow.
They have little chocolates on the pillows... to have.
What's the problem? ln the first place, we weren't even supposed to be here.
We were supposed to be at the lake.
What am l supposed to do, control the weather now, Sara?
That's not the point.
You couldn't resist.
You just had to come.
Excuse me. This is a big opportunity for all of us.
Not for us, for you.
The only thing you seem to care about anymore is work.
Oh, but when l'm working hard , it doesn't matter as long as l'm bringing you home expensive gifts, right?
Hey, what are you ...
Hey, Sara.
Hey, Sara, l didn't mean to say that, okay?
Sara.
Come on.
Stop it.
Sara.
Sara. l'm sorry about that, honey.
Can you open up, please?
Aah!
Ooh.
You scared me.
-Pardon the intrusion, sir.
-Yes.
The master was wondering if he might have a word with you in the library.
A word? Okay. l'd love to have a word with him.
Sure.
Let's go talk some turkey.
Yes. Turkey.
-Very good, sir.
-Yeah. lf you will kindly follow me.
Yeah. Of course.
Of course.
Hey, Sara, l'm gonna have a word with Mr. Gracey. l'll be back in a minute.
Ramsley, l was just wondering.
Have you ever been to a tanning salon? l've got a friend who's got a really great place.
You can get a really smooth tan.
Do something about that ashy white look. l'm sure the ladies would love it.
Yes.
Sounds wonderful .
Would you care for a drink, sir, while you're waiting?
Yeah. Don't mind if l do.
Thank you , Ramsley.
Oh, wow!
Now, that's class.
That's what l need to do.
Get a big picture of myself to put on the living room wall.
Adds a touch of elegance to the room.
Yes, sir.
Very elegant.
Thank you .
Thank you so much , Ramsley.
Mmm.
So, Ramsley, how long you been a butler?
A long time.
What are the most important qualifications in case l might be doing some interviewing?
Attending to every detail.
Understanding priorities.
And above all, knowing one's place.
What does your boss like to do?
What's he into?
You know, what floats his boat?
The master likes a great many things.
Art, literature, beauty.
And all that stuff about ghosts.
Did he get, like, a bad clam in his jambalaya one night?
You don't believe in ghosts, sir?
Absolutely not.
Let me tell you something.
The way l see it, you only go around the track once.
So you do it full-out all the way around.
Mr. Evers, may l confide in you?
Please do.
The master is not well.
He must leave this house,
Mr. Evers.
He must move on. lt is of the gravest importance, l assure you.
Or l fear the very worst. l can't believe this.
Still no reception.
We had to take that little detour.
20 minutes tops.
Yeah, right.
Do you think it's gonna stop raining soon?
How should l know? l'm not the weatherman.
Hmm.
Stogies.
Not bad.
Not at all .
Hold onto that.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Wonderful.
Must be nice.
Must be really nice. l tell ya.
Ahh.
Hmm.
Hello there, good man .
Ramsley, fix the gentleman a drink.
Nigel , l just recently returned from the Continent, where l found the most interesting book.
Yes, it was called
''Raising the Dead.''
Oh! Oh, cripes.
Oh. l hope that doesn't stain.
Oh.
Wow. lnteresting.
Wow.
Wow. l wonder where this leads to.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, open this back up!
Hey, open up!
Ramsley!
Ramsley!
Push back the head !
Hey, will somebody push the head back?
Megan!
What do you think it is? lt's a ghost ball. l think it wants us to follow it. l think you're crazy. lt does. lt wants us to follow it.
Hey, Megan , wait up!
Where's that scary albino when you need him?
Oh.
Hello.
Have you seen my husband?
Excuse me.
Wait!
Wait!
Oh, Ramsley. lt's you.
May l help you?
Yes. l was just looking for my husband.
Ah, indeed. l left him in the library.
Right through there.
Honey, it's late.
Let's not fight anymore.
Come to bed?
Oh ! l'm sorry. l thought you were my husband.
Can l help you with that?
Ramsley hates it when l leave things lying about.
Yes.
He seems a bit proper.
He strikes most people that way.
Once you get to know him , you'll find that's not the case.
But he's really...
He's really very sweet.
Thank you.
He's been like a father to me.
Mr. Gracey, may l ask you something?
Yes. Of course.
Anything.
This house. lt's been in your family for generations. lt's your home.
Why do you want to sell it?
These walls are filled with so many memories.
Some of them painful. l think for you to understand , l really must show you. lt's all right.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Although it might be a bit worn and faded from its original grandeur, this house was once filled with so many things.
So much life.
With grand parties, dancing, laughter, and, above all, hope.
Being a Gracey meant that you were denied nothing.
The world was yours.
What happened here, Mr. Gracey?
She did.
Who?
Elizabeth.
Hers is the story that haunts these walls.
Come on.
Megan, wait.
You don't know the last time that thing's been inspected.
Would you just relax?
Where's your sense of adventure?
This is against all my better judgment.
Hi! ls anyone home?
Those must be termites.
Some big-ass termites.
That's all.
Hello?
-Oh!
Oh.
Aah! Aah!
Megan!
Mom.
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here!
This is unspeakable!
Unspeakable! You have to leave!
-Who is that?
-That's none of your business.
Now, come on. Get out of here. lt's way past your bedtime.
Her name was Elizabeth.
Are you kids hungry?
Does anybody want a cookie?
Cookies?!
Don't offer them cookies!
They're trespassers!
Trespassers don't get cookies!
This is none of their concern . lt is their concern!
They're involved!
Hide! Hide!
The children are not in their room.
Have you seen them?
Children?
What children?
What children?
Her children.
The children she wasn't supposed to bring.
Along with that brainless husband of hers.
Thank you. lf l had to listen to another word from that insufferable fool, l think l would have burst.
Of course, sir.
What a fool!
Did l not tell her to come alone? ls it really too much to ask for a little cooperation?
A little order?
Of course not, sir. lf you find the children , bring them to me.
-Certainly, sir.
-Yes, sir.
The final arrangements have been made.
Nothing further will interfere with the master's plan.
Thank God l heard your voice. l lost my way. l don't know how to get out of here. l'm sorry if l sound a little frazzled. l just had myself a little freak show back there. lt's time to respond. l was supposed to meet with Mr. Gracey.
But l got stuck in the wall.
Goblins and ghoulies from last Halloween, awaken the spirits with your tambourine.
Okay, l hear you, but l don't see you. Where are you? l am Madame Leota, seer of all, voice to the spirits.
Whom do you seek?
Hey! Hey!
Hey, let me out of here!
Silence!
Whom do you seek? l am seeking a way out of here.
Then you must look within. l don't want to look within . l want to look without.
There is great evil in this house.
A devil's curse. lt seeks to destroy you.
Why would something seek to destroy me? l'm just here to sell the house.
Dark spirits from the grave, come forth.
Lift us from the black and show us.
Show us the way back.
Dark spirits?
Hey, no dark spirits.
Don't you make no dark spirits come out.
Lift us.
Lift us up to the light.
And lead us through this stormy night.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey!
Hey, l'd really like to stay on the ground. l'd rather stay on the ground .
Can l stay on the ground?
Evil and darkness have fallen this night.
But now to survive, you must gain new sight. l must first gain new underwear.
Only the light will lead the way.
Follow it and find your way home.
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
Go, Mr. Evers.
Your family is at stake.
Your very life is at stake.
Break the curse.
There is no escape for you unless you lift this spell.
Go.
Save yourself.
Save your family.
Release her.
Release us all! l'm getting so queasy. l'm getting very queasy.
Oh !
Aah! Aah!
Aah! Aah!
Aah!
Oh!
-Dad!
-Dad!
Hey!
Michael and Megan, you okay?
We're fine, thanks.
Get your things.
Let's get out of here.
We have a problem.
Because of the rain?
We're gonna get a little wet.
Let's just find your mom and get out of here. l'm afraid that's not possible.
She can't leave.
And why not?
Because she can't! lf l could tell you, l would.
But l can't, so l won't, okay?
Hey, how'd you ...
Hey, look.
Come on.
Daddy's having more hallucinations. Let's go.
-They're ghosts, Dad .
-They're not ghosts.
We're just having hallucinations from that dinner we ate. lt was that chicken . lt didn't taste right.
-Oh!
-lt's not the chicken!
All right. lt's not the chicken.
But we're getting out of here.
But we have to help them.
You can't help the dead, honey.
They're beyond help.
The man's talking sense.
Everyone should keep their noses in their own business.
But we have to help them break the curse.
Why is everybody talking about a curse?
Have you been talking to that crazy green gypsy in the giant paperweight?
We've got to go back to see her.
-No back. l'm not going back.
-But, Dad!
They had me floating all around the room.
Hey, l was strapped to a chair, floating around the room with a marching band chasing me. l'm not going back anywhere!
Forget it, Casper!
But Mom's in trouble.
What kind of trouble?
She died here in this house.
She was so very young.
So very beautiful.
She was in love with the heir to this mansion.
Your grandfather.
And he loved her more than life itself.
But they were from different worlds and couldn't be together.
How did she die, Mr. Gracey?
She took her own life.
Poison.
After that, his life became unbearable.
And so, without hope, without love, without Elizabeth, he hung himself.
His soul wanders these halls, waiting for her to return. lf you listen carefully, you can still hear the beating of his broken heart.
Wait a minute.
Hold it a second.
You're telling me this guy is dead and the reason we were brought here is he wants to try to get jiggy with my wife?
Pretty much.
Are you upset?
The guy is dead , and he's trying to get with my wife!
And the house isn't really for sale!
Yes, l'm upset!
Oh, Madame Leota, is it her? ls she truly our dear, departed
Elizabeth come back to us? lt is true.
She walks these halls.
You see? l told you it is her!
But do not be deceived.
All things are not as they appear.
For the curse to be lifted , the truth must be known.
And for the truth to be known , you must find the key.
What are you talking about, ball lady? What key?
Enter the tomb under the great dead oak and travel down deep under the ground.
And there you will find the key that must be found.
Find the black crypt that bears no name, or soon your fate will be the same.
You're telling me all l have to do is find this key, then l'm gonna walk out of here with my wife and kids?
The key is the answer to all .
Well, great. l'm in .
Let's get this key.
There's only one problem.
How do we get out of here?
Yeah, how do we get out of here?
Well, there's always, uh , my way.
Hey! l thought you said you could drive this thing!
Don't you worry. l know exactly what l'm doing.
-Aah!
-Aah!
Well, you better just keep your eyes on the road!
-Move over!
-What are you doing? lf you keep driving , you'll kill us all!
That's where you're wrong.
Because some of us are already dead!
Dad, look.
Ready?
Fire!
Dad?
Yes, son? l see dead people.
Excuse me.
Why are all these ghosts still hanging around here?
When they died , they couldn't find the light.
And now...
Now they're trapped.
Doomed to wander the Earth for all eternity.
Nice.
Nice job.
Whoa!
Okay.
Hey!
Hey, what are you doing here?
Can they see us?
No.
Of course not.
Yes, l can. l'm looking at you right now in your stupid hat.
Don't listen to him.
He's lying.
Whatever. Come on, kids.
Let's go. Come on. l could swear he was looking right at me.
He's psychic.
This was to have been her wedding dress.
Oh, it's lovely. lt would have been lovelier if she'd had a chance to wear it.
Now it serves only as a dark reminder of what could have been.
To love someone so much and then lose them so suddenly. l can't imagine how awful that must be. lf you truly love someone, they never leave you.
They remain in your heart forever. lsn't that romantic?
He was willing to throw everything away for love.
Well, now he's broke, dead , and cursed. Nice move.
-Oh, crap!
These are my new shoes.
Hey, kids, watch your step.
-Oh, crap!
Hey, Michael, don't say ''crap.''
All right.
Where is this place?
Okay, where are we? l think the gypsy lady said something about making a left at an oak.
Okay.
Well , glad she was so specific.
What is that?
Do you hear that?
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
# And harmonize #
# When we ghosts come out
to socialize #
# Doom, doom, doom, doom #
# When the cryptos creak
and the tombstones quake #
# Spooks come out
for a swinging wake #
Excuse me.
Sorry to bother you.
But we were wondering if you happen to know where the mausoleum was.
# Down by the #
# Old mill stream #
# Where l first met you #
No, no. l think they said it was an old oak.
That's what they said . lt's by the...
# By the light #
# By the light,
by the light #
# Of the silvery moon #
Yeah. You sound really good .
Your harmony's tight.
But we're trying to find my wife. She'll be...
# Comin' 'round the mountain
when she comes #
# She'll be comin' 'round
the mountain... #
Listen, guys. l'm trying to find a key. l'm trying to find a key...
# Where's the key?
Where's the key? #
# Where's the beautiful key? #
# Find the key, find the key #
# Oh, how happy you'll be #
The key that l'm trying to find is in the mausoleum.
The key is in the mausoleum.
# You left your key #
# ln a mausoleum #
# Down in Dixie #
Dad, there it is!
- # Dad, there it is #
-Thanks.
- # Dad, there it is #
-Thanks for nothing.
Okay.
We made it.
All right, kids.
Stay close.
Hey.
Look. lt's a warning.
Now, how do you know that? l studied Latin for three years, Dad.
You thought it was dumb, remember?
You said it was a dead language.
Oh , we see how wrong l was about that.
''Beware all who enter.
Here lies the passage to the dead.''
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Where are you going?
-l don't like Latin .
-Hey, wait. Michael.
You're 1 0 years old now.
You got to start being a man. l just turned 1 0. l'm still getting used to it.
Okay.
Here's what we do.
Megan, stay here with your brother.
What? l'm not gonna leave him out here by himself.
You guys stay together. l'll go in here, and l'll take care of this.
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
Oh.
Wow.
Okay.
All right.
Okay. l'll be right back.
20 minutes tops, right?
20 minutes tops.
What was it that gypsy told me to look for?
Look for a crypt with ...
Look for a crypt...
-A crypt without a name.
-Aah !
Oh !
What's the matter with you?
You can't just be popping out like that. l thought l told you to wait with Michael. l was worried you wouldn't find it.
Besides, Michael's fine.
She said, ''Find the black crypt with no name, or soon your fate will be the same.''
That must be it.
Good hunch, Dad. l'm officially starting to get sick of this place.
And we're here 'cause of who?
Because l take seriously my responsibility as breadwinner. l want you guys to have everything l never had before. l didn't know you had a bad childhood . l didn't have a bad childhood .
Then why do we have to have what you didn't have?
Because...
Hey, don't be tricking me, you little Latin-speaking
1 3-year-old .
Let's just get this over with.
Hold this.
Hold it with two hands, now.
Aah! Phew!
Oh, man .
Excuse me one second. l'm sorry to bother you.
Oh!
Aah. Ugh.
Oh, no.
Ew.
Aah.
Okay.
All right.
Now, that wasn't hard, was it?
Let's get out of here.
That gypsy had me thinking it was gonna be hard.
-That was easy.
Oh! Oh!
Oh, no.
Oh! Oh, no!
Go get the key! l'll take care of him!
Hey, man, go on back to bed .
Get back in your bed.
Go back to bed . l'm Jim Evers of Evers & Evers Real Estate.
Hey, look, l don't want no trouble, man.
The gypsy told me it was all right to get the key, so --
Oh!
Just lighten up.
Now, let me tell you something. l got to get my wife. l don't want no trouble.
Seriously, back up!
You asked for it.
Next time you're gonna think twice before coming back from the dead , ain't you?
-Did you get the key?
-l'm looking ! l'm looking!
Take your time. Relax. l have everything under control. l have everything completely under control.
Megan , you better look faster!
Oh , l don't want to do this.
Jeez.
Aah!
-Aah!
Give me your hand.
Okay.
Come on , come on , come on!
Come on, guys!
Hurry up!
Hold on!
Come on, guys!
Hurry up!
Michael!
Michael , open the door.
Michael, it's locked from the outside!
Michael, open the door.
Open the door. Michael!
Dad, there's spiders everywhere, and l don't have a magazine.
-Hey, Michael , are you scared?
-Uh-huh.
Michael, it's okay to be scared.
Everybody gets scared sometimes.
-Daddy's scared right now.
-You are?
Yes, l'm very scared .
Now, please open the door, son!
Michael , open the door, or l'll kill you!
That's great.
Keep him calm.
Hey, Michael, listen , it's okay to get scared.
Everybody gets scared now and then.
You just can't let it stop you.
Michael, if you think you're scared now, wait till the zombies come out!
What zombies?
Michael!
Hey, Michael, look.
Just open the door.
Please, man.
Open the door right now.
Dad, they're coming !
Michael , open the door right now!
Open the door!
Open the door!
Open the door right now!
Open the door!
Oh!
Aah!
Lock it! Lock it!
Okay.
Come on !
All right.
Okay. All right.
Get 'em off!
Okay. Come on.
Get 'em off. Okay.
All right. We got it.
All right. You okay?
Okay.
My brave little man.
All right.
All right.
You okay?
Yeah .
You got the key?
Oh, no.
Wait. Whoa.
Yeah, l got it. l got it.
There it is.
Okay.
All right.
Now, we went to hell and back to get this thing.
Where's the door out of here?
First, you must find the trunk.
Trunk?
Yes, trunk.
Not door?
No. Not door.
Trunk.
All you said l had to do was find this key! l got the key.
Now you're telling me this story about a trunk!
The key is the answer to all, remember?
Look, l don't make the rules. l just work here.
Okay. That's it.
That's the last straw. l've had enough of this nonsense.
Hey, what are you doing?!
Put me down!
This is bad luck!
This is very bad luck! l'll show you bad luck. l'm tired of playing around. l'm getting nauseous!
You'll get over it.
Please don't drop me. l'm fragile. l'm very fragile.
Don't talk to me about being fragile. l'm the one that's feeling fragile right now. ls that it?
-That's it.
-Hmm. All right.
Now we're in business.
Hey, hold her for a second.
All right.
Okay.
Okay.
How do l know what to look for?
This thing is full of junk.
Find the thing that must be read lest your heart be filled with dread .
There's nothing in here red.
Hey, wait a minute.
There's a letter here. lt's a letter.
''Yes, my dear heart, l will marry you. l will love you for all eternity.
And tonight at last, we will be together. l do.
Forever yours, Elizabeth.''
She didn't kill herself.
She wanted to be with him.
Yeah, and somebody gave him the wrong letter.
Yes.
Well done, Mr. Evers. l must say l'm impressed.
You are more persistent than l would have ever imagined.
The butler did it?
You got to be kidding me. l will deal with you two later.
Why'd you kill her?
Because the master would not listen to reason.
He had everything in the world.
And yet he was willing to throw it all away for love. l did tell him it would end badly.
You're a real cold dude.
No, Mr. Evers. l am a rational man. lt was my responsibility to the house.
My duty, sir, to see to it that the boy did not make a foolish error in judgment.
Running away with that girl would have destroyed this house. lt would have destroyed everything .
And l could not stand by and watch it all fall to ruin.
Punch his face in, Dad.
Yeah, but first l'm gonna tell his master what really happened.
The master must never know.
Edward and his love will be reunited, and this curse will be broken.
That's not her.
That's my wife.
And what she sees in you l'll never know.
But that is of little importance now.
The only thing that matters is that the master's pain must end.
And it will end tonight.
The curse will be broken, and we can all finally move on.
All right. That's it, man .
Where's my wife?
Getting ready for her wedding, of course.
What wedding?
He can't marry her.
He's dead, and she's not.
True.
But that can be easily corrected.
Life, l'm afraid, is such a delicate state. lf you put one finger on my wife, l swear l'll kill you.
How wonderful.
You're going to kill a ghost.
-Leave him alone!
-Stop it!
-Aah!
-Aah!
Let them go!
You're gonna let my kids out of here, take me to my wife, and let us out of here right now!
You want out, fine.
Let me show you out.
Now, for the last time, good night, Mr. Evers.
Aah!
Ugh!
Oh!
This house has waited so long to have its shroud of darkness lifted.
And tonight, for the first time in, oh, so many years, l believe it may be possible that the story will finally end differently.
Sara?
Do you believe that love is about second chances?
About forgiveness?
Yes, l do.
Don't you remember?
Remember?
Mr. Gracey, are you all right?
Don't you recognize me at all?
Mr. Gracey. l thought certainly bringing you back to Gracey Manor would help you remember.
Remember what?
Mr. Gracey, you're scaring me.
Where it happened.
Where we spent our last moments together.
Where we danced together for the last time before you...
Before you killed yourself!
But now you've returned to me.
And at long last, we can be together.
Why do you not remember?
You were my world, my life!
And l have loved you in death as l did in life!
Let me go!
Why do you not remember?
You are her.
You are Elizabeth.
You must be!
Can you not sense it?
Search your heart. l am your one true love.
And now we can finally be together.
Don't you understand?
Elizabeth , you must listen to me. l'm not Elizabeth!
Please! l implore you.
Leave me alone!
Get away from me!
She doesn't remember. lt can't be her. lt is her, sir.
The gypsy woman prophesied her return.
And now the time has come.
You had best get ready.
But she doesn't remember. ln time she will , sir. l assure you she will.
Open up!
Hey!
Let me in !
Aah!
Oh , Ramsley, you have to help me.
There's something horribly wrong. Mr. Gracey...
Yes. l know, my dear. l know.
He's expecting you .
He's always been expecting you.
And you haven't put on your dress yet.
We can't keep the master waiting.
Waiting?
For what?
Why, your wedding, of course.
My... l'm not Elizabeth!
Of course you are, my dear.
You may not see it yet.
But in time you will .
You don't actually think l'm going through with this madness?
Oh, yes. l very much do.
You see... we wouldn't want anything to happen to the children.
Now, would we?
Michael!
Megan!
You wouldn't.
Of course not, my dear.
But that is entirely up to you. lf not, l really do fear for the children.
Have her ready.
And this time, any further acts of insubordination will be dealt with in the harshest possible manner.
But, sir?
There are worse things than purgatory, madam. l can assure you.
Have her ready.
Tears of joy.
What are you doing?
Hey, you leave me alone.
Just get out of here and leave me alone.
Oh, l see.
You're just gonna sit there, feeling sorry for yourself.
You tell me why not.
This whole thing was my fault.
We should've never been here in the first place.
Supposed to be at the lake.
We'd be sitting by a warm fire right now.
And l made us come here.
And now it's too late.
No. lt's never too late.
Hey, look, l tried to get in there, and l can't, all right? l tried! l failed!
You try.
You fail.
You try.
You fail.
But the only true failure is when you stop trying.
What do you want me to do?
Huh?
Try again.
Hold on!
With what?
-Aah!
-Aah!
Elizabeth?
Yes, my love. l'll be right back.
Okay. l'll wait here.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony.
Dad!
Help us!
Michael!
Megan!
Wilt thou , Edward Gracey, have this woman to be thy wedded wife, to live together after God's ordinance in the holiest state of matrimony? l will.
And do you, Elizabeth Henshaw, take this man to be your lawful husband, to love and cherish in death as you did in life? l do.
Whoa!
Aah!
From this day forward, you shall be joined together as one for all eternity until the very end of time.
What God has joined together let no man cast asunder.
-Dad!
-Dad! lf anyone has any objections...
Yeah, l got a few objections!
The next time l say we're going to the lake,
-we're going to the lake.
-Let's go.
Get away from her. l lost her once. l don't intend to let it happen again.
This is not Elizabeth .
Ramsley, you tell him the truth. l don't know what you're talking about.
Now you got amnesia, huh?
Elizabeth didn't kill herself.
He did it.
He's been lying to you all along. l'm warning you, sir.
Step away.
Don't think 'cause you pull out your sword l'm gonna let you marry my wife.
My patience is wearing thin.
Elizabeth , please, come along. l'm not Elizabeth.
You must be.
Her name is Sara.
She's from New Jersey.
Ramsley wants you to think she's Elizabeth so this curse would be lifted.
That is absurd.
Forgive me. lf you're gonna kill me, kill me.
But on the other side, l'm gonna be whipping your ass for all eternity.
So maybe you should read this before you stab somebody.
-What is it?
-lt's Elizabeth's letter.
Her real letter.
The one she wrote.
The one he stole.
You never saw it.
What's the meaning of this?
Must we continue to listen to the ramblings of a lunatic?
But it is written in her hand.
Yeah, it's written in her hand .
Explain that, Ramsley.
Well?
Your union was unacceptable. l tried to warn you , but you wouldn't listen.
So you killed her. l told you it would be a mistake to run away with that girl.
But l loved her!
Was love my mistake?
Yes! l tried to protect you.
All these years l've sacrificed for you.
But what would you understand of sacrifice, duty, or honor?
You loved her.
Well, damn you .
Damn you all to hell!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Jim!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
-Mom!
-Mom!
Mom , what's wrong?
Are you all right?
-Mom.
-Hey!
Hey, Sara.
Sara, what's the matter?
Sara, what's wrong?
Hey, what's the matter?
What's wrong? lt's the poison!
Oh, no.
No.
Hey, Sara.
Come on. Please.
Don't do this!
Sara, don't do this.
Please.
Jim...
Sara! Hey!
Sara.
Sara, come on. Please.
Sara.
Sara, l love you.
Sara, please. l love you so much.
Hey, get away from us!
Leave us alone!
No, Dad. lt won't hurt us.
Elizabeth, is that you?
Yes, my love.
The ghost ball was Elizabeth.
The truth had to be known for me to be released.
He saved me. lt was nothing.
Oh, Elizabeth.
Yes, my darling? l have waited so long for this moment.
And now only heaven awaits.
He's not really kissing your mom .
Hey.
That's my wife.
Sara?
Jim? l thought l lost you.
Oh. l thought l lost you, too. l'm back, Sara. l'm back.
Can you ever forgive me?
Oh, what's to forgive?
You loved her.
Here.
Take this.
What is it?
The deed to the house. lt's yours.
Do with it what you will.
Sell it, keep it.
Do whatever makes you and your family happy.
And thank you.
Thank you all so much.
Wait! Wait for us!
Hold on!
What's all this?
Well , l don't know what we'll need.
What are you talking about?
We're going to heaven.
You can't take it with you.
The hell l can't.
-Oh.
-Goodbye.
-Bye-bye.
-Thank you all so much.
You're welcome.
-Thank you.
-So long , now.
Okay, little man.
All right. Hurry!
Let's go!
-Bye!
-Bye!
Okay.
Here we go.
Whoo!
Bye-bye.
Angels in heaven together at last.
The tale is well ended for those who have passed.
Love endures all , no reason , no rhyme. lt lasts forever and forever all time.
Mom, Leota won't shut up.
-Are we there yet?
-l'm getting pretty hungry.
Can we get some pizza?
How long before we get there, Sara?
20 minutes tops.
Nothing takes 20 minutes.

More After The End Credits
Hurry back.
Hurry back.
Be sure to bring your death certificate. lf you decide to join us, make your final arrangements now.
We've been dying to have you.
The French tried to build a canal here before the Americans.
At the height of their effort,
500 workers...
... were dying every week from malaria and yellow fever.
They couldn't come up with cemetery space fast enough...
...not to mention the morale problem all those crosses would have made.
So they bought shiploads of vinegar in Cuba...
...and in each barrel, they sealed one corpse.
And then they sold them as medical cadavers all over Europe.
And for a while, that was their principal source of profit.
You see, this place has always had a special way of dealing...
... with both profit and death.
As some of you may have heard, there is a hurricane warning tonight.
Well, Rangers do not wait on good weather.
Rangers do not wait for a bright, sunshiny day.
Oh, no. Rangers are trained to operate in the worst possible conditions...
...and take said conditions and turn them against their enemy.
You each have one rifle, one sidearm and one white phosphorus grenade.
This is a live E and E, so please keep those weapons safetied...
...so as not to shoot off your nonexistent dicks.
The rally point is a bunker two clicks north of the LZ.
You will split into teams of two.
Each designated area has 20 reactive targets.
The first team to get all 20 and reach the rally point wins.
Anything goes pear-shaped out there, you pop white and radio in.
I will be in each area monitoring your progress.
If I see anybody drag ass...
...I swear to God, you will swim the canal.
-Where is the original pickup point?
-About two klicks up the valley.
So this was a Ranger training team?
When were they due?
They missed contact six hours ago.
Colonel Styles, that doesn't necessarily mean anything in a storm like this.
No, it wouldn't be any wonder if they were delayed.
I'm not seeing them.
I'm gonna have to come back around.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute,
I'm coming around to your side.
We got one-- No, maybe two.
Wait, I think he's carrying somebody.
Is he hurt?
All right, let's get down there.
What is that?
Is that live fire?
Christ, they're shooting at each other.
Get us on the ground. Now!
I've got a bleeder down here.
A little suction down there.
There it is.
That's enough!
You went out with your sergeant and six men last night on an exercise.
You came back a few men light.
Four, to be precise.
Where are they?
Not in this lifetime.
Captain...
...if you don't make progress on this, we'll have Washington crawling all over us.
What did he write?
"I'll only talk to a Ranger.
Someone from off-post."
Let me see it.
It's a stall tactic. Nothing more.
Give him what he wants.
I know somebody.
-Sir, I am confident that I can handle this.
-And I'm not.
Oh, God.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
-Hello.
-Tom, what's wrong with your phone?
I've been trying to reach you all day.
There's a hurricane.
Everything's shut down.
-Hola, Tommy!
-It's carnival, come on.
-The girl's name is Gabriella!
-I want to meet all your friends!
-She wants to meet you.
-Yeah, we'll samba!
-Are you coming?
-I will. I will.
You better.
I'm gonna come and get you.
-Tom?
-What's that?
-I said, are you drinking again?
-Nothing like that.
Any time a cocaine dealer is suspected of bribing an agent...
...we pull him off the assignment and run a check. It's not personal.
A drug lord that I helped bust says that he paid me off...
...you guys believe him, and say it's not personal? Fuck you.
Relax, I'm sure you'll come up clean.
You'll be back on the job in a week.
With everyone looking at me sideways, wondering if I'm dirty.
Look, I'm DEA in cocaine central.
All we have down here is trust.
And after what you did, nobody's ever gonna trust me-- Hold on.
Are you putting me--?
Tom, Bill. I need you to come down here.
-Come down where?
-Clayton, as soon as possible.
-Something happened. It's bad.
-Are you all right?
No.
No, I need your help.
Sir?
Sir, this is completely unorthodox.
This guy isn't even Army.
Go ahead, sir.
He was Army.
I hadn't seen him in years...
...until I ran into him the other night in a parking lot. Trust me, he was Army.
He trained at Benning and here with me, so he knows the territory.
Before he left the service, he was the best interrogator I had ever seen.
Tom Hardy could get in your head faster than you could tie your shoes.
-Why did he leave the Army?
-I don't know and I don't care...
...because there is nobody better in a room.
Sir, if he's not Army, it's not official.
Well, then, Captain Osborne, it's unofficial.
Evening, sir.
It doesn't get unofficialer than that.
-Hey, Bill, how is it going?
-Pretty much fucked. You?
Wet. So how's the knee?
They're never gonna make me a general anyway.
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.
Why am I here?
I'm curious about that myself, sir.
Sir, I am Julia Osborne.
I am the provost marshal here.
-Osborne, do I look like a "sir" to you?
-Not particularly, sir.
Captain, Osborne is the closest thing we have to an in-house investigator.
And you're going out of house.
How does that make you feel?
-Hostile and uncooperative, sir.
-Fantastic.
Okay. Tom, look, before this hurricane hit...
...I recalled all exercises except for one...
...a six-man Ranger team and their Black Hat out in the bush.
-We're missing three and the sergeant.
-Not West?
Oh, tell me it wasn't West.
-You know Sergeant West, sir?
-He was our Black Hat.
-That must have been an honor.
-That's one way to put it.
West is a professional, the face of the modern Army.
You notice I'm no longer in the Army.
They were due for pickup at 1 830.
So the problem is that three didn't come back?
No. The problem is, one of them is dead...
...one has a bullet in his hip and one won't talk.
Now the one who won't talk was exchanging live fire with the dead one.
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one.
Sergeant Mueller, killed right in front of me.
If Command finds out you're using a civilian...
...with my background, forget it, they'll cut you a new asshole.
Your involvement's a secret. Anything you uncover will be credited to Osborne.
-Well, then, let her do it.
-Sir, that is not a bad idea.
Captain, will you excuse us for a moment?
All due respect to Osborne, this is way out of her league.
This kid we have in interrogation requested a Ranger.
Someone he'd never met. That's you.
Jesus, Bill, he could have requested a sailboat.
It doesn't mean you have to give it to him. I don't get this.
Any spooks involved here?
ClA? FBl?
Not exactly.
What does that mean?
There was a group of guys down here and they....
And they what? Come on, Bill, spill it.
Permission to speak freely, sir?
Osborne, I swear to God...
...you call me sir one more time,
I'm gonna scream.
I know who you are. The DEA is investigating you for bribery.
Suspicion of bribery.
It's all in the wording, really.
I'm not comfortable having you involved with this.
Three things:
First, you don't have a choice.
Second, I've never taken a bribe in my life.
And third, I'm still a little drunk from earlier today...
...so if I skip over the witty banter...
...and move straight into coming on to you, I hope you don't take offense.
Dog tags identify them as Sergeant Raymond Dunbar...
...and Second Lieutenant Levi Kendall.
Levi? Who would name their kid Levi?
General Jonathan Kendall, of the Joint Chiefs.
Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone.
Kendall Jr. will be unconscious for at least another hour.
The soldier we're talking to first is Dunbar.
-ls he in an interrogation room?
-Yes, sir.
-Move him.
-Why?
Interrogation rooms tend to look suspiciously like interrogation rooms...
...which makes people uncomfortable. Is he cute?
-Excuse me?
-Dunbar, is he cute?
-lf you're not gonna take this seriously--
-ls he handsome?
Does he carry himself well?
Does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor?
Does he have good bones, which suggests good breeding?
Does he slouch or sit up?
These are questions that reveal a great deal about a man's character.
Get over yourself for two-and-a-half seconds and tell me, is he cute?
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
I'll let you know how it turns out.
Agent Hardy, if this goes to trial someone is gonna have to testify...
...about what's said in interrogation.
And with your colorful background...
...you'd be the most impeachable witness in history.
Now, I may be stuck with you, but you're definitely stuck with me.
Okay. At some point I want you to go bad cop on him.
-The signal will be my rubbing my nose.
-Not scratching your balls?
Look for both.
Any donuts around here?
I questioned him for two hours.
He didn't make a sound.
You try poking him with a stick?
Sorry, no. I didn't learn sophisticated techniques like that.
I bet I can get him to talk in under three minutes.
Ten bucks. That's without telling him I'm a Ranger.
Go.
Sergeant Dunbar, good evening.
I'm Tom Hardy. I believe you've already met the vivacious Captain Osborne.
I understand that you've had a rough time of it out there...
...and that you're not talking.
I'm sure you just want to get some sleep and food.
Did they feed you yet?
Go on. You can still eat in front of someone and not talk.
My parents did it for years.
You want another one?
Maybe later.
Okay, Ray, I'm gonna be upfront with you.
I don't know if you did what you did in self-defense...
...and frankly, I don't care.
The thing is, I made an agreement with a friend...
...to talk to you till your transport showed up.
So....
You like baseball?
Oh, I could talk baseball for days.
You know, batting averages, ERAs,
I got statistics in my brain.
I don't know how I remember them.
It's freaky.
You wanna talk baseball?
Oh, come on, Ray, we gotta talk about something.
We're gonna be here for six hours.
Come on, who do you like?
Who do you like?
Sir, I don't like baseball.
Why not?
I believe the game of baseball to be too slow.
Too slow? It's a game of anticipation.
That's the beauty.
Well, sir, I just don't like it.
I'm sorry I don't have an adequate explanation.
Well, that's all right.
I'm not gonna kneecap you or anything.
Sir, I requested a fellow Ranger.
I apologize. I just....
It's just that you thought
I looked like a scumbag. I know.
It turns a lot of people off.
You know, I was here in the 75th, under Sergeant West.
Yeah, he had a wicked-looking blade.
Yeah. He still got that?
Hand-carved. Yes, sir.
Well, the reason I remember is he would use me as his knife dummy.
-He ever do that to you guys?
-Oh, yeah.
What West used to do is he would say that he could...
...slice a man from stem to sternum, the stem being your dick, okay?
-I get it.
-Okay. Well, anyway...
...if you're his knife dummy, he would just ram this pipe into your balls all day.
And that was a long day.
By the way, Ray, I promised I would ask where West and the others are...
...and can they be found?
There's no need.
They're dead, aren't they?
Yes, sir.
You kill them?
Look, we got enough on you to deep-fry your ass!
Back to silent treatment, fine by me.
-I'm just gonna have to haul your ass--
-Okay, whoa. Time-out.
Look, Ray, this is what you call
"good cop-bad cop."
She shouts. I stand up for you.
You're grateful.
This establishes some sort of bond of trust.
I don't wanna play games with you...
...so I say we take a break. Okay?
And get you another donut.
You see if you wanna talk anymore.
-"Deep-fry your ass"?
-You set me up.
I believe somebody owes me 1 0 bucks.
You could have told me what you were planning.
Everybody knows good cop-bad cop.
By admitting it,
I could gain his trust.
-You think he did it?
-No, sir.
Yes.
What about the rest of my people?
In 5 1/2 hours, it'll be out of our hands.
I'm gonna have a lot to answer for.
I'd appreciate it if you could get me some of those answers.
-Why did you ask for a Ranger?
-I'm not telling you what happened.
Why don't you tell us about the others?
Tell us about the course.
Tell us about Sergeant West.
Is he still the same prick?
I do not care that you are triple volunteers.
I do not care that you think you are hard.
And I especially don't give a rat's fuck what four-star general's dick...
...you sucked to get the privilege of being able stand before me today.
Those of you I deem unworthy will not remain.
Is that understood?
Can I get a "Hoo-ha, sergeant"?
Hoo-ha, sergeant!
Those of you I find lacking will quit.
And those of you who refuse to quit will have a training accident.
This base suffers three training accidents a year.
Unfortunate accidents that I will not hesitate to repeat...
...if you cross me. Is that understood?
-Give me a "Hoo-ha, sergeant."
-Hoo-ha, sergeant!
-And what's your name?
-Sergeant, my name is Pike, sergeant.
Pike, surrender your sidearm for inspection.
What the fuck are you doing?
Have you lost your fucking mind?
-You told me to relinquish--
-Are you talking? Did you speak to me?
Who the fuck told you to speak?!
A Ranger never relinquishes his weapon!
If George S. Motherfucking Patton rises from his holy grave...
...and asks you for your weapon, you will not surrender your weapon.
Everybody better give me a "Hoo-ha, sergeant."
-Hoo-ha, sergeant!
-Now, son...
...there are people in this world that will kill you for no damn reason...
...other than something passing through their mind!
I hail from Biloxi, Mississippi, where vanilla motherfuckers like that...
...used to hang us from trees by our necks on a whim!
Does that sound like the kind of fucking place you want to grow up?
Sergeant, no, sergeant!
Are you implying something negative about the great state of Mississippi?
From the beginning, West had a chip on his shoulder for this guy named Pike.
By the time we did Green Hell, it was getting nuts.
Green Hell was 20 days in the Darien at 40 clicks a day...
... with an 80-pound pack on your back.
We got real used to number oddities like that.
The course was called Jungle Leader and the idea...
... was to teach you how to think when you were exhausted.
And West really knew how to get you exhausted.
We spent our nights doing escape and evasions...
... with live fire snapping by our heads...
...or else up to our noses in some damn swamp...
...slapping bugs and dodging snakes.
The nights we did mock POW stuff, they wouldn't let us sleep at all.
We humped over the Cordillera three times...
...all the way to the Colombian border and back.
Some of that stuff is steep as hell and the rain never let up for days.
Those packs got heavy in the rain...
...and nobody ever hated anything like we hated those damn packs.
There was this one escarpment, it wasn't more than 500 feet...
...but, Jesus, it was slippery.
Mr. Pike...
Mr. Pike...
...can you tell me the muzzle velocity of an M-1 6?
Yeah.
-Eleven hundred, sergeant.
-Eleven hundred what?
Meters per second, sergeant.
Take 40% of that and multiply it by the exact number...
...of each animal Moses took with him on the Ark.
-Come on.
-Twenty....
Come on. You tired, Mr. Pike?
Too tired to think?
Zero, schmuck.
Moses wasn't on the Ark.
Have you lost it?
Well, tell me this.
What is your weapon?
Your weapon, man. Your weapon.
What keeps you alive and makes the other guy die?
What is your weapon?
It's your brain, Mr. Pike.
Your noggin. Your noodle.
Your smarts. Your gray matter.
Your poise under fire.
Your wits, when all about you are losing theirs.
I think you came to this party unarmed, Mr. Pike.
Take off your pack.
Take it off.
Here, I'll help you. Come on.
You can't complete this march without a pack, Mr. Pike.
I suggest you go back and get it, even if it takes 40 days and 40 nights.
That business bothered a lot of the guys...
...even Mueller, who was a redneck you felt uncomfortable sleeping around.
Dumb shit.
So that's what we were coming back from yesterday afternoon.
We figured we'd finally get a shower and a hot meal.
I mean, we were the walking dead.
We were about as ragged-out as a man could ever get.
Here comes Master West himself.
What we have here is an opportunity.
A unique opportunity for a spectacular training event.
Dunbar. Kendall.
Mueller. Nunez. Castro.
Drop your packs. Weapons only.
Muster at the east LZ in two minutes.
-Jesus Christ.
-What was that, Mr. Pike?
You think a little rain is inappropriate for combat?
That the game should be called on account of weather?
Are you concerned for their safety?
Sergeant....
What?
-No, sergeant.
-Good, then you can join them.
Those are the guys that went on the exercise with you?
Yeah, and that is all I'm saying.
Ray?
You smoke?
Is this a trick where you won't give me a cigarette till I tell you more?
No, I just forgot mine in the car, and I was hoping that you had some.
My brand. My lucky day.
You seem like a good guy, Ray.
You carried Kendall wounded to the pickup...
...but I just don't understand.
What did you do to make
Mueller want to kill you?
I'm not saying anything else.
I just don't understand why he asked for a Ranger.
The man's in trouble.
Never leave a man behind.
-So?
-Ranger code.
Never leave a man behind.
What's the matter?
This place gives me the willies.
-Not the happiest of memories, huh?
-No.
He's the son of a general, so go easy on him. Kid gloves.
-All right.
-I mean it. Kid gloves.
I got it.
Yeah. Thanks.
Tommy, that you?
Pete Vilmer, as I live and breathe.
How are you?
-How are you? I'm good.
-Osborne, Pete Vilmer.
I know. Let me guess, you two trained together?
Guilty as charged, Julie-bird.
What are you doing here?
-You're not getting all nostalgic on me?
-No, I can't tell you--
-I'm running this joint.
-No.
Yeah. We're busy as hell too.
Packing up supplies...
...getting ready for the move stateside.
Who'd have thunk it?
Pete Vilmer, bettering society.
Shall we see Kendall or would you like to continue...
...the backslapping for a couple of minutes?
"Julie-bird."
Now if I were a smart man, and I am not...
...I could come to the conclusion that you two saw each other socially.
Oh, I've seen you around the base before, but...
...well, are you in the Army or...?
Coast Guard.
We're worried about Florida beaches.
Oh, I've seen you before.
You were in the newspaper.
You're that DEA agent with friends in low places.
Oh, the price of fame.
We were wondering if you'd answer a few questions for us?
Oh, no. I'm really fatigued.
I feel all drugged-up.
Our collective hearts weep.
Well, we just wanna know what happened out there.
Oh, you wanna know what happened?
Well, there are degrees of truth, captain.
You know, there are always degrees and things are not what they seem.
You know, this is--
It is too late and I am too tired to give a shit...
...about some pissant lieutenant's bad version of intrigue.
You're trying too hard, Levi.
You know how I can tell?
Because you're sweating, and you're sweating...
...because you don't know how much Dunbar told us already.
Excuse me.
-Those were kid gloves?
-I thought I did pretty well up till the end.
You mean when you yelled at him and walked out?
Well, that would be the end, yeah.
We'll play it differently when we go back.
Go back? We just blew it.
-I thought you didn't have any cigarettes.
-I lied.
-Will you just wait? Just wait.
-For what?
Excuse me. A patient is asking for you.
Shall we?
My father is what you would call a very powerful man.
-So we've heard.
-Oh, come on, you know...
...you don't know the half of it.
I mean....
You know, all my life he's made me feel weak and insignificant.
Yeah, I think that is reason why I joined the military in the first place.
And how is that going for you?
Oh, it's horrible.
I fucking hate the military.
You're terrified of him, aren't you?
No, no, we just hate each other.
You know, and normally he wouldn't lift a finger to do anything for me...
...but the one thing he cannot stand is a scandal...
...and you know, a joint chief...
...with a homosexual son in the military definitely qualifies as scandal.
Well, that blows "Don't ask, don't tell" out of the water.
So is this family history lesson coming to a point?
About four months ago,
I began a relationship with a local...
...and my father decided to intercede. And Colonel Styles...
...made the incident quiet.
But according to my father...
...transferred me into
West's training course.
And, you know, West just hated that.
He made sure everyone knew where I was and all that.
Couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.
Well, he wanted more than that.
More intrigue, Levi?
Yes.
I swear to God, you will swim the canal! The teams are as follows...
Dunbar and...
...Mueller.
Pike and Nunez.
Kendall and...
...Castro.
You have one minute to touch down.
Get your shit together!
That's when he did it.
He was threatening my life.
It was clear as day.
Did anyone else see or hear this?
No, of course not. There was a helicopter, you know?
-Nobody could hear anything.
-I don't know how familiar you are...
...with investigative work, but there's this thing called motive.
And you just gave yourself one.
Well, you wanted to know what happened...
-...and I'm telling you the truth.
-What happened to degrees?
I didn't kill him.
Then who did?
Thirty seconds to LZ.
Click in! On the skids!
Lose the communicators!
I did want to tell someone, but Mueller would've just laughed...
...and Nunez wouldn't have given a shit.
I suppose neither would Pike or Dunbar.
Of course, West had me paired with Castro...
... who treated me like a leper from the day that I met him.
I started getting it in my head that maybe West had paid him.
Maybe he was the one who was supposed to give me a training accident.
All I could think of was
West was out here...
...somewhere in this godforsaken swamp...
...making us stalk around in this hurricane, and just waiting.
Hey! What the fuck are you doing? Huh?
-This is fucking ridiculous!
-Shut up and shoot something!
I was terrified, and I wasn't about to be...
...the victim of some discriminative hate crime.
You know, maybe I should say
I wasn't scared at all, but I was.
I was terrified.
You know, enough to want to murder somebody.
But you didn't.
Come on!
Come on!
Is that West?
Whose area is this?
West.
-What did you do?
-We found him like this.
You kill him?
We found him like this.
Where's Pike?
Come on, tell me! Where's Pike?
-We got separated.
-Yeah?
-Yeah, we did.
-Before or after the explosion?
Before or after the explosion?
-I don't know.
-What do you mean?
I mean, I don't fucking know, okay?
We got separated, so shut the fuck up!
Shut up! Exercise over!
Get out of here!
Radio's had it.
-Are we gonna leave him like this?
-We have to.
The MPs will secure the site till the ClD gets here.
-What about Pike?
-I'm not waiting for Pike.
You can if you want.
Fucking do something, okay?
Where you been?
You guys all right?
Where's Pike?
-West is dead.
-What?
What happened?
He took a phosphorus grenade in the back.
-Are you kidding me?
-No.
He's out there smoldering.
How long have you guys been here?
Ten minutes. We finished the course, and just before we got here...
-...we heard an explosion.
-That's your story?
-Yeah, that's our story, Nunez.
-Watch it, motherfucker!
Hey! Hey! Stop!
What?
Hey, calm down!
Everybody just calm down!
Where the hell is Pike?
We got separated, okay?
She just doesn't remember if it was before or after the explosion.
-Before the explosion, all right?
-Oh, so now you remember? Now?
-Yeah.
-Now you remember?
-Before the explosion. Hear me?
-So you think Pike did it?
Does anybody know the shit that we are in, how fucked we all are?
Kendall!
Let me see your grenade, Nunez.
-Yeah, let's see it, Nunez.
-Nunez?
-Let's see that.
-Get off! Fuck off.
This is bullshit, man.
This is so bullshit.
I'm so sick of you guys. Okay.
Are you happy now? Here it is. One.
Here it is. You see it?
So sorry to disappoint you. You're not gonna have a strip-search tonight.
The man is fucking dead, all right?
So, what happened?
-Must be a level three out there.
-You okay?
-Yeah.
-Pike, you got your grenade?
No, I used it.
You know West is dead?
Of course I do.
I killed him.
-He admitted it?
-He thought we would all be on board.
He was that type of guy, I guess.
You know, apparently, Pike wasn't even his real name. He changed it--
Come on, come on, focus, Levi.
Okay, fine. So then
Mueller went after him...
...and we had to pull him back and calm him down...
...and we said that we would turn
Pike in. So then everybody agreed...
...and....
Kendall!
Come here.
Come here!
Come here.
Don't tell me that you ain't glad that West is dead.
Now we got a opportunity here.
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-What I'm talking about...
...is we can all walk out of here heroes. All right?
Now, all we gotta do is get rid of Mueller and Nunez.
We get the other guys to play along...
...and we can be the men that took down our sergeant's killers.
All we gotta do is tell the story right.
You're out of your mind.
After I woke up,
I saw Pike and Dunbar talking.
No! No!
You sack of shit!
It was just a reflex.
Castro had already been hit.
I must've passed out, because the next thing I knew....
-Mueller was chasing Dunbar?
-Because he had shot Castro.
Why did he carry you out?
I don't know. Maybe he wanted somebody to cover for him.
But I can't. I know what I saw.
And he killed those men.
And you'll testify to this?
Of course.
Okay. That's it.
Agent Hardy?
What did Dunbar say to you?
Let's go have a beer.
I don't drink beer.
What about the case?
You don't drink beer?
Who doesn't drink beer?
Me. What about the case?
The case is done, with two hours and 40 minutes to spare.
I thought we'd get a beer and I'd get to flirt with you. What do you think?
-You believed Kendall?
-Absolutely.
Because Dunbar wouldn't tell us everything. Why? Because he did it.
No. Dunbar came back for Kendall.
I don't think he's capable of murder.
-How long you been doing this?
-What's that have to do with it?
That means less than a year.
Osborne, murder is basic. No conspiracies, no grand mysteries...
...no puppet masters behind the scenes pulling the strings.
Everyone is capable of murder.
Dunbar's our guy.
Look, there's no physical proof.
We need a confession.
From Dunbar? Forget it.
You're not gonna talk that kid into giving himself up for the death penalty.
-Nevertheless.
-Nevertheless what?
Kendall will testify.
That's all we need.
It's not enough for me.
Hey, Ray. Had a nice talk with your buddy, Kendall.
Hey, Ray. Had a nice talk with your buddy, Kendall.
-Seems you killed a bunch of people.
-That son of a bitch.
-Well, that'd be my reaction too.
-He's lying.
Why didn't you say something?
We would've dropped the charges.
I'm serious, goddamn it!
Fuck your "serious." Right now, we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours.
You got something to say? Say it.
Did Kendall tell you about the drugs?
-About the business Mueller ran?
-What drugs?
He sold them out of the hospital for 50 bucks a pop.
West is easier to handle when you can't feel the pain.
Oh, that's good, Ray. You know I'm
DEA and you figure you say "drugs"...
-...and I'm all ears, right?
-It's not like that.
Then why didn't you bring this up before you were accused of murder?
No, wait! Don't say it. I'll tell you.
Drug charges in the Army come with a 20-year sentence.
You figured Kendall fucked you, you'll fuck him right back.
-I didn't shoot West.
-I know. Pike did.
You think you know everything, don't you?
You haven't even scratched the surface.
I know enough to know that you've got two choices.
You can sign a confession and spend the rest of your life in a cell...
...or you can tell us to fuck off and you'll be hanged.
Now...
...am I scratching your surface yet?
Dumb bastard!
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
-Excuse me?
-The next time...
...I wanna borrow your balls,
I'll ask you.
Tom? Where are you going?
-I'm done. I'm out of here.
-Wait. What about the confession?
Why don't you confess?
The only reason you brought me here...
...was to protect your career. People are dead and you don't give a shit.
-What are you taking about?
-About West!
You're the base commander. You know what he's all about and you stood by.
It was just a matter of time before someone fragged his ass!
He deserved it. Now, there!
There's your fucking confession.
Hardy?
Hardy! What about Dunbar? What about what he said about the drugs?
You are incredible! If someone said "Santa Claus," you'd say:
"You can't leave. We haven't explored the flying reindeer angle!"
-You fucking coward!
-No, no, wait! You stop right there.
I was there! I was tortured by that guy!
I wanted him dead 1 5 years ago!
And now, I should feel bad about someone who offed him? Forget it.
-No can do.
-So fuck the Army, right?
-Fuck the Army and fuck those kids too.
-That's right.
Yeah, all they wanted to do is serve their country and take a stand...
-...and protect assholes like you!
-Oh, don't you even start.
Don't you talk to me like some recruiting poster...
-...because I did my time!
-Yeah, please. Oh, yeah.
-And you couldn't hack it!
-Yeah.
You were like me once. You believed in the whole honor and duty thing...
...and trying to make a difference.
Isn't that what you said?
-I was trying to get your number.
-Thank you.
-You believed it. I saw it in your eyes.
You believed in it and those kids did too. Now they'll never tell their story.
Never gonna get to expose West for the monster you say he was.
I thought you wanted me gone.
You grew on me.
Look, I'm gonna go in there, and I'm gonna talk to Kendall...
...and to Dunbar, and I'm gonna try to figure this whole mess out...
...because I care what happened out there. And I think you do too.
-"l didn't shoot West."
-What?
That's what Dunbar said. "l didn't shoot West." West wasn't shot.
Kendall said he was burned by a phosphorus grenade.
Dunbar never saw the body.
Hey, look, I apologize.
-You saw West's body?
-Of course I did.
-Where?
-Down by the creek bed.
-And he was shot?
-Yeah.
What about the phosphorus grenade?
One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him. I thought you knew this.
Tell us.
-What did you do?
-We found him like this.
You kill him?
We found him like this!
Stop. Kendall said that only Nunez showed up at the body.
-You were at the bunker with Mueller.
-He's lying.
I was at the body. We didn't see
Mueller till we got back to the bunker.
-Where you been?
-West. He's dead.
Back up.
-Mueller was alone in the bunker?
-Yeah.
What are you doing here alone?
Pike and I got separated, then
I heard gunfire. It was close.
Well, so did we.
Why you didn't come?
So where's your grenade?
And I didn't buy it, but Mueller still had his grenade.
At least you and
Kendall agree on that.
Okay, what happened next?
Pike came back.
Mueller, what the hell happened to you?
Where were you? One minute you're next to me, the next you're gone...
-...the sky lights up like Christmas.
-Where've you been, Jay?
There's a hurricane out there, okay? I couldn't find the spot. My radio's busted.
-Where's West?
-Yeah, right.
Shut up.
West is dead.
What?
-Where've you been, Jay?
-I said, I couldn't--
No, no, no, no. No.
Fuck you.
-Fuck you! No! Stop it! No!
-Okay, hello!
We just wanna see your pack.
-We wanna see your pack because....
-Why?
Because whoever shot the sarge popped a grenade first. That's why.
A dead body shows up and just put it on the darkest face in the room?
-It's not like that and you know it.
-Do l?
Do l, Dunbar?
I just want you, papi, to show them your pack.
Right now.
Good.
Tie him up.
Ray? Come here.
Come here close, I wanna talk to you. Come on.
We're friends, right?
-Ray, we're friends, right?
-Yeah.
Well then, come on, man, untie me!
You know that I didn't do this.
-You hated West more than any of us.
-Maybe, but not enough to be a killer.
-You're the one missing a grenade.
-Anybody could have taken that out.
Did you check your pack coming in on the bird?
Look, you know
I don't have this in me.
-lf not you, then who?
-Mueller, that's who.
Oh, come on, man.
We were scanning the area together then he just ups and disappears?
-That's what he says about you.
-Who you gonna believe...
...a redneck or your friend?
-Listen, check my pack.
-Why?
That's a combat cocktail.
Demerol and anabolics.
-Mueller gave it to me.
-You're lying, man.
Does that look like I'm lying? It kills the pain, focuses the brain, man.
I've been using for about eight weeks solid.
After that first night, man, it was bad.
Malnutrition and exposure.
I needed something to keep me from crashing and Mueller hooked me up.
The way I see it, West knew. He found out and was gonna report him.
-But they killed him first.
-They?
Yes! Mueller and Castro. They must've sabotaged the radios and...
...one of them must've taken a grenade out of my pack on the chopper.
Who popped white?
What the hell's going on?!
I don't know, sarge!
I don't know what happened!
Get down!
You saw West's body.
How was he killed?
His chest was hamburger, Jake.
See, that's close range. You go full-auto on somebody, close range...
...they're gonna be swimming in blood.
Look at me. I don't have a drop on me.
Now, how about Mueller? When
I walked in, he wasn't wearing shit.
-I don't know, man.
-What don't you know?
This is a lot of shit to digest!
I gotta think!
Come on, Ray, man, we don't have time to think! We need to go now!
Look. No, listen.
Let's wait till we get back, then we'll tell everything to the MPs.
If we wait, I am a dead man.
I have a black face and there are a hundred men out there...
...dying to testify how much I hated West.
My court-martial will take five minutes.
It's me or them. I don't got that time.
You gotta make up your mind, man.
Ray. Untie me.
Come on, Ray.
What the hell are you doing?
Hey, wake up!
-Hey, hey. This place is gonna go!
-Shut the fuck up, Pike!
-You were gonna cut him loose!
-Why?
-Because I didn't do it, Nunez!
-We all know what you did, Pike.
Yeah, where's your shirt, Mueller?
Ask him where his shirt is!
My shirt? I tossed it.
I was soaking wet.
That's a convenient excuse for the murderer. He tossed his bloody shirt.
-I was freezing from the hurricane!
-So you took your shirt off?
I wasn't wearing a poncho, goddamn it!
Hey, what about him?
Maybe you brought an extra shirt.
-We have to go.
-We're not going anywhere.
Sergeant Mueller, you are under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant West.
-You have no authority--
-lt doesn't matter...
...because you will be charged with murder!
-Shut up, Pike.
-You will be court-martialed....
-What are you doing?
-I said, shut up!
-Shut up, you dumb fucking nigger!
-You fucking white-trash motherfucker!
I saw you do it!
Jesus!
-Oh, my God.
-He wouldn't shut the fuck up!
So you killed him?
Put the gun away!
-You too?
-I'm sorry, Ray.
Okay. Pike got free. He got a weapon and he came after us. That's our story.
-West was one thing, but this is--
-Shut up! Shut up, Mueller!
We have two dead bodies and a story that explains them.
That's what we're gonna say.
-You're either with us or against us.
-Castro, put it down!
Which is it?
Castro!
Goddamn it, now we're gonna have to shoot them both.
Can I get some more coffee?
Can I get another cup of coffee?
Yeah. Sure. Yeah.
Okay. So the plan was kill West, blame it on Pike.
Right. And for that to work, okay, you need a witness.
-Dunbar.
-Exactly.
So it's a good plan, but it goes wrong.
Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy...
...so they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into their cover story.
Right. And Kendall might've agreed if the hurricane hadn't butt-fucked the bunker.
"Butt-fucked the bunker"?
Well, I just-- Well, you know.
Happy endings. What do you think?
I think we're gonna need proof.
Ray, you're gonna have to put what you said in writing.
And, Ray? Ray? For you to have any chance of coming out of this...
...we need to corroborate your testimony.
Otherwise, this is just another story.
Pike said the supplier was somebody over at the hospital.
Guy named Vilmer.
Oh, my God. I haven't had one of these since college.
-How long you and Pete been together?
-On and off for two years.
Serious?
Semi.
For you or for him?
You don't get to interrogate me, Hardy.
Know about the drugs?
-Sorry, I gotta ask. Did you?
-No!
Gotta put him in a room, you know.
Try and stop me.
I need that consult report on the chart.
On the chart, okay?
Yes, sir.
Pike said the supplier was someone over at the hospital. Guy named Vilmer.
Well, shit, if it's on tape, it's gotta be true.
Piece of advice? Charming's not the tack to take with us right now.
I want a lawyer.
No.
Excuse me?
No, you can't have a lawyer.
Fuck you, Julie-bird.
Uniform Code of Military Justice says I get a lawyer.
I don't have to say shit to you.
How about them Yankees?
Now, Peter, what I just did is illegal.
It'll kill my career in the Army.
And that will end any chance of going to law school...
...so I don't have anything to lose.
Now, do you really want to go round two?
Jesus Christ. What the fuck!
I called them "combat cocktails." Okay?
I got them hooked, I had them push, once they were in, they couldn't get out.
It was a perfect goddamn crime.
How'd you get around the drug testing?
Who do you think administered the tests?
I swapped their dirty piss for someone else's clean.
They could use all they wanted and never pop positive.
-Who else was involved?
-You broke my goddamn nose!
Who else was involved?
Mueller and that kid who took a bullet.
What, you didn't know that?
How'd you recruit them?
You know how it is in Panama, Tommy.
It's easy to spot the bad eggs.
First week I snuck a couple of them off base. Bought them some drinks...
...tried to find out which one of them was interested.
After that it was smooth.
I handled the cooking supplies...
...they handled distribution. That's it.
Broke my fucking nose.
When did West find out?
I didn't know he knew.
I just supply.
I don't know shit about what happened last night.
That's real noble.
Thanks for clarifying.
How long have you been doing this?
Gee, I wasn't looking at my watch.
-Were you doing this while we were--?
-While we were fucking? Yeah.
Right under your nose.
-Riggs?
-Yes, ma'am.
Read this gentleman his rights and...
...see to it that he gets medical attention and stick him in a cell.
Yes, ma'am.
Nice seeing you again, Pete.
Why would he risk 20 years in prison just to sell a few painkillers?
Doesn't add up.
Kendall's the key.
Ma'am, colonel's looking for you and Mr. Hardy.
Tell him we'll be right up.
Now, look. How far do you want to go with this?
I think we should go see Bill, hand over Vilmer...
...give him Dunbar's confession and forget about Kendall.
So Vilmer admitted to supplying the drugs?
Yes.
-Christ.
-Now, look, Bill...
...you know, you got Vilmer's confession,
Dunbar's confession...
...that is more than enough to clear you with ClD.
Great. Good.
Good job, both of you. Thanks.
Thank you. All right.
Then we'll get out of here.
There is one more thing, sir.
Vilmer says Kendall was involved in the drug scam.
Captain, I don't wanna hear this.
Well, actually, Kendall did try to burn Dunbar with us, so...
...that usually means someone's involved.
Captain Osborne, you are not to go near Lieutenant Kendall.
That's an order. Understood?
Pike never admitted shooting West.
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar.
Why don't you ask him about the murders...
...he's covered up for his drug dealer?
Did it ever weigh on your conscience or did you just--?
Or do you just not think about it?
Running out of time!
Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.
Mueller shot Pike point-blank in cold blood.
I don't remember that at all.
Don't get me wrong.
Mueller was perfectly capable of murder.
He was the type of guy that you felt uncomfortable going to sleep around.
Why did you pin three murders on
Dunbar? The man saved your life.
Oh, so I should cover up for his misdeeds?
-What? I was just telling you the truth.
-Not according to Pete Vilmer.
Vilmer. Vilmer.
Vilmer, Vilmer, Vilmer.
Vilmer. Is that what you think you have on me?
It's his drug-peddling word against mine.
You have to do better than that.
You guys are on drugs.
-They got their story straight.
-What do you mean?
What Kendall's saying about "the type of guy you feel uncomfortable...
...sleeping next to"?
That's what Dunbar said about Mueller.
Hardy, they planned this.
Not bad for hostile and uncooperative.
-You're running out of time now!
-You and Dunbar got your story straight.
You two just kept bouncing us back and forth, trying to...
...figure out the differences, killing time till transport can whisk you away.
You're accessory to murder, you understand that?
You're going to jail.
Right, Hardy?
-lf he's lucky.
-You know what? You're full of shit.
You are fucking full of shit.
What, you scared, Levi?
Is that why you're laughing?
You think we got nothing on you?
That doesn't matter, Levi.
No, it doesn't. Know why?
We'll find one of those bodies...
...and I'm gonna make sure it has a bullet in it that matches your weapon.
I'm just gonna get your pistol, take it to the morgue...
...shoot it into one of their skulls.
What's going on?
What's happening? Kendall?
Nurse!
Get in here, get in here!
What happened? Suction!
Give me suction!
-Get that tube in there!
-Hold him!
Captain Osborne?
Sir.
You're relieved of your duties until further notice.
-Yes, sir.
-You'll be lucky if I don't put you in...
...for a court-martial.
-He was dirty, Bill.
-He's dead, Tom!
And don't think you're not on my shit-list too.
We found the bunker. It was demolished, like they said. No bodies.
Come on, a hurricane like that could've blown them three counties away.
What happens to Dunbar now?
In 1 0 minutes he gets on a plane, which means you're done.
You'll understand if I don't walk you out.
-Strange kid.
-What?
Kendall.
Even while he was dying he was making jokes about infinity.
What?
What?
Dunbar wrote this when he asked for a Ranger.
There's an 8 on it.
I don't know.
Okay.
I'll find out by myself.
Stop.
Okay.
Any spooks involved here?
ClA? FBl?
Any spooks involved here?
ClA? FBl?
Not exactly.
-What's that mean?
-There was a group of guys down here....
There was a group of guys down here who were way out on the hairy edge.
They did covert stuff and they--
They what?
They went rogue. They went renegade.
Dropped off the face of the earth, disappeared into drug land...
...and with their special skills cut one hell of a swath through the competition.
West trained some of these guys.
And he hated them for what they did, and they hated him.
-That could be what this is about.
-Who knows about this?
How do I know?
They're ghosts, right? They're dead.
This could all be a story.
None of this could be true.
But the note that that kid wrote...
...had an 8 on it.
And that's what this outfit called themselves.
Section 8.
Section 8?
You mean, like, they're crazy?
-How could you keep that from me?
-Classified.
You son of a bitch!
Mister, I've had it with you!
Okay, so are you happy?
Is that a no?
Ma'am. Need your signature for this guy's transport.
Sure thing.
What the hell happened to you two?
None of your business.
Kendall's dead and you're going to jail.
ClD's here to take you to Washington.
Guess I'm on the same transport as Pike.
Hey, Julie-bird, you bitch...
...why don't you go on and get me something to eat? I'm starving.
-What did you say?
-I didn't mean to call her a bitch.
No, no, no, before. What did you say?
What, that me and Pike were on a transport plane going to D.C. together?
You mean Dunbar.
No, Pike.
The one that they just hauled out of here.
The guy that they brought in with Kendall on the chopper.
That was Dunbar.
No. That's not right.
What do you mean? Why not?
Tom...
...Ray Dunbar is black.
Son of a bitch did the whole thing!
Files don't show race.
All he had to do is switch dog tags.
-Where's this transport going from?
-Hangar Four.
Move it. Come on, go!
Go! Go! Go!
-Sir!
-We got company, sir.
-I need to talk to your prisoner right now!
-What, captain?
-I need to take him back for questioning--
-We're not finished with you yet, Pike.
-Wanna bet?
-Let go!
Hey! Hardy, what the fuck are you doing?
Gun!
-Sir! We have tried to--
-Come on down, Pike, come on down!
You wanna talk baseball now?
I don't think so!
You don't have any bodies yet!
What are you gonna do?
-You're not gonna shoot me!
-You see what happens when you lie?
What do you got?!
You got nothing on me! You got--
Hardy, what are you doing, man?
Stop that!
-Let him go!
-Stand down!
Tom, what the fuck are you doing?!
Stand down, goddamn it!
Shut up!
Well, well, well.
What have we got here?
I told you he knows.
Now, wait. Knows what?
About the other operation.
What other operation?
The coke.
They were sending pounds of it back to the States, using military supply lines.
Vilmer would hide it in crates of files.
Hell, he'd ship it in a corpse if he had to.
West figured it out about a week ago.
He was gonna go to the colonel.
Kendall and Mueller must've decided to take him out of the equation.
You have got to be the dumbest bunch of sons of bitches on God's green earth.
You think you can ship that shit right under my nose?
Mueller, what are you doing?!
Get his weapon.
Castro, wait!
Castro!
-Put it down.
-Fuck you, let him go!
This ain't some drive-by! You think you can kill a man face to face?
-Put it down, Pike!
-He'll fucking shoot you!
I am your objective, right? You fire, I fire.
You're down to four. Well, three.
You can't trust him. Maybe I'll take one or two more of you before you take me.
The odds are in your favor that at least two of you walk out of here alive.
Conversely, there's absolutely no way l should be able to walk out of this bunker.
This is bullshit! I'll do it!
So pretty.
So dead.
Kendall, what are you doing? Kendall!
What, you don't believe me?
Medical crate 8469846 in
Shipping D awaiting transfer.
See for yourself.
Vilmer and whoever his partner was must have been making millions.
Where did the coke come from?
Fuck if I know.
I mean, this is Panama.
Throw a rock in any direction, you'll hit three cartels.
About an hour later,
Kendall and I found Dunbar.
Put it down! Put it down, son.
-I just wanna go!
-Understandable. Now, put it down.
-Look, I never meant to hurt anybody!
-Let's keep it that way!
You surrender, I take you in.
I know it sounds like a shitty deal, but you get to live.
I'll go my way, and you go yours, okay?
Not gonna happen! You either surrender or we die where we stand.
-So, what's it gonna be?
-Sarge!
I knew if sarge died they'd blame me.
That's why I took Dunbar's dog tags.
Oh, God! Oh! Oh, God!
Mueller didn't die after all.
Came after us with a vengeance.
You know the rest.
How'd you get Kendall to go along with switching Dunbar's dog tags?
I gave him a choice. Either go along or I drop a dime on his drug scam.
How about the bodies?
That hurricane almost lifted me off the ground.
But they're out there.
It's there, just like you said.
So you'll testify to all of this?
I don't think you're gonna get any deals.
I don't want any deals.
I'll take him now, if you don't mind.
We should've died out there with the others.
Did you get what you wanted?
Not even close.
Just that one thing that I wanted to ask you about.
-Say when.
-Yeah, this is Hardy.
Oh, really?
Okay. Thank you.
The kid said that West waited till the end of the week to tell the colonel.
Now, why would he wait until the end of the week to tell you?
I mean, that doesn't sound like the West that we knew.
You think the kid was lying?
No. I don't.
-I think you are.
-What?
I do. I think you're lying. I do.
I think that....
-I think that West came to you--
-And?
And you told Mueller and Kendall to kill him.
Then what did I do, go and poison Kendall?
-Well, who said he was poisoned?
-What?
I just found out. The hospital found out three minutes ago.
-I was on the phone with the pathologist.
-Golly, Tom, the kid was puking blood...
...all over the hospital.
You know, gunshot and childbirth just didn't seem to fit...
...so I took a wild-ass fucking guess.
Was that really the pathologist?
No, that was my message service.
Even if it was, does that prove anything?
You keep forgetting...
...I don't have to.
-What?
-I don't have to prove anything...
-...because it's not my job.
-I mean, golly, Tom....
I just have to get you to the real guys.
One-third.
Come on, Tom.
You've never met a bribe you didn't like.
Oh, I see. I see.
You called me so in case
I stumbled upon something...
...you'd just buy me off.
Crossed my mind.
Like I said, they were never gonna make me a general anyway.
This is about quality of life.
Tom, you've had a hell of a run of bad luck. Bounced out of the Army...
...hanging by a thread at the DEA. You're gonna wind up a fucking process server.
If you lose enough times, what you are is a loser.
Why don't you cut yourself a break, for chrissake? Forty percent.
Once I'm up and running again.
Up and running again?
This is just a hiccup.
I can get another three, four months before they close the place down.
I'll have to think about that.
And then I saw the gun and then he drew it...
...so I had no choice but to fire.
How many rounds did you fire, captain?
-Two. Three, maybe.
-Okay.
All right, ma'am. Thank you.
Thanks.
Now what?
I'm gonna go home and get drunk and try to forget all of this.
Well, in that case...
...there you go.
Your phone number?
Yeah, I thought maybe later
I'd slip by and we'd do the old--
It's just in case you need me to testify about the shooting.
But you don't worry, they'll clear you on that.
He was your friend.
Yeah, but he was a lot of other things too.
Besides, my friends don't betray their country.
Tuesday?
Tuesday, pick me up at 7?
Tuesday at 7. You're one of the good ones, Osborne.
I don't want you to worry about what happened.
All we gotta do is tell the story right.
All we gotta do is tell the story right.
And we can be the men that took down our sergeant's killers.
All we gotta do is tell the story....
-T ell the story right.
-T ell the story right.
--friends in low places.
--the murders he's covered up for his drug dealer?
--wasn't even his real name.
Pike wasn't even his real--
They're dead, right? They're ghosts.
West trained some of these guys.
And they hated him.
I wanted him dead--
I wanted him dead--
I am your objective, right?
Osborne?
If you don't like the music, just say so.
Don't move. Put your hands on the table. Now.
Who are they?
They are my colleagues. And they're discussing breakfast recipes.
-You knew about the coke.
-Yes, I did.
You knew about Vilmer.
You knew about Styles.
In fact, they work for you, because you're Section 8.
You planned all this.
And you killed West.
Give me one good reason why I should not fucking blow your head off right now.
Tom?
Why did this young woman have a weapon pointed at your head?
This is Captain Osborne, and she has had a long day.
Oh, I'll bet it was something you said.
She thinks I killed you.
He didn't.
I thought you hated each other.
I'm not particularly fond of him, and he is sort of a jerk, but what can you do?
-Will you cut me some slack?
-Slack?
Did he say "slack"?
Captain. Sit, it's safe.
You wanna talk about slack?
You take a simple find-out- who's-working-for-who operation...
...next thing I know, there's corpses flopping around like it's raining fish.
-Yeah, but I rescued your ass.
-Rescued my--?
-Did my ass need rescuing?
-Don't put me in this.
You stumble upon a drug operation...
...in the middle of 1 0,000 heavily armed men...
...and you didn't have to be pulled out?
See now, that's different.
I was going to retire early anyway.
So you found out about the coke and you told Styles?
Yeah, who did nothing.
Except order Kendall and Mueller to kill you.
And you figured that they were gonna do it in the jungle.
That's why I called this genius.
Breakfast is ready! Do you remember the triplets? Raul's daughters?
-This is hotter.
-This might eat me!
Captain.
Dunbar.
Or is it Pike?
-Oh, actually it's neither, ma'am.
-Right.
-So you're not Nunez.
-No, ma'am. I'm afraid I'm not.
Right. Because none of y'all exist. You're all dead.
Well, you could refer to it as bureaucratic absence of presence.
I mean, we're here.
But we're not here.
Now, he would be dead in the ground if you hadn't saved his ass. I mean dead.
You are on it today!
What are you laughing at?
The idea that you just transferred into his unit.
Negative. I just transferred to Arlington Cemetery.
You keep talking shit and you're liable to make roll call.
-So you're all Section 8?
-I told you she was smart.
No, you said she was....
What did he say she was?
-Hot.
-Hot.
Yes, ma'am. We're officially Section 8.
And what about the story about you guys being all...
-...renegade drug dealers and stuff?
-More like ragamuffins.
That's been our unit's cover story since the beginning, ma'am.
And it's a story that scares the frijoles out of the Colombians.
Okay, so now that I know all this, what happens?
I get a needle in my arm and wake up tomorrow morning with no memory?
Isn't that what you guys do?
We actually thought you handled yourself quite well in this situation.
We were gonna offer you a job.
Did she tell you the story about the carnival last night?
-Oh, don't start.
-Shit.
-What do you want to know?
-Miss Festival Party Lady.
What do you wanna know?
Don't act like you weren't all over this man.
Yeah, tell him the truth.
So, what are you gonna do?
I think I need a beer.
Here you go, colonel.
Colonel?
I'm looking for Darby Reese.
Does he know you're coming?
No, he doesn't.
Darby.
Someone's mom's here to see you.
Yeah, all right.
All right, yeah.
Who'd you say you are?
Margaret Hall.
He'll be right down.
How 'bout this?
- Mother of Beau.
- Mr. Reese?
You're younger than
I expected. Please, sit.
I want you to stay away from my son.
Does Beau know you're here?
- Dyl, where are your sneakers?
- Don't know.
Please find them, sweetheart.
You'll catch a cold.
Oh, Jack! I'm sorry.
Margaret, where on earth is that damned remote?
I... I... I don't know. Um...
Oh, broken, isn't it? Didn't
Dylan step on it last night?
Oh, for the love of Pete.
Try the one in the study.
I think it'll work.
And where is Mr. Dylan?
He's in the driveway.
Dylan!
Sweetheart, do you know where your brother is?
Um, in the driveway.
- I mean Beau.
- Oh.
He took off in the boat. Mad about something. I don't know.
Been gone a while, kiddo.
I went to Reno today.
I know. He called.
I'm goin' upstairs.
May I come in?
May I come in?
- I need to talk to you.
- You need to talk to everybody lately.
- Please, don't be glib.
- Like I told you, he's my friend. That's all.
Well, he may not be the friend you think he is.
He's just a guy, all right?
It's just a place.
You have got to talk to me about the drinking.
I shouldn't have been driving. I'm sorry.
You shouldn't have been drinking or visiting nightclubs.
- Are we through?
- No.
You could've been killed in that accident.
I know you're having difficulty.
- If you're having feelings...
- I don't know what it is you think I feel, but you're blowing this whole thing out of proportion.
He offered to stay away from you.
- What?
- For money.
He said if I paid him, he'd stay away.
Five thousand dollars.
- I don't believe you.
- I'm sorry. It's true.
- He said you'd tell me things.
- Oh, Beau, stop.
Would I lie to you?
Was Darby with you Friday night?
Just let it go.
I don't want you seeing him anymore.
Do we have to talk about this now?
I don't want you going into Reno.
We can put the music lessons on hold for a while.
Margaret? It's Tom.
Yes. Tom, it's Margaret.
It's good to hear you too.
Everything's fine.
We're all fine. What?
I can't hear you.
Yeah, Dylan's helping me.
He's making X's on the calendar.
Don't you disappoint him.
Beau...
Well, hold on a sec.
He's right here.
Hi.
I'm fine. Yeah, same stuff.
Yeah, school, water polo, you know.
No, no. No answers yet.
No, Wesleyan lost my transcripts.
Yeah.
I'm not playing as much as I'd like, but I'm enjoying the classes.
No, the drive's been fine.
Yeah, I miss you too.
Are you crazy?
That's my mother's room!
- It's me.
- Yeah, I can see that.
What do you say?
You wanna have some fun?
No. Just go away. You're gonna wake everyone up.
Come on!
Shh! Just go away.
Someone's gonna see you.
Hey, I came all the way from Reno.
- Come on.
- All right.
Quiet. Just be quiet.
I'll be right down. Don't move.
You make a sound, I'm gonna drown you in the lake.
Come on.
Whatever you say, lover.
Light a match or something.
Ah. Much better.
I'm sorry about my mother.
I thought I was your little secret.
Imagine my surprise.
No, she knew I was at the club
Friday night. All right? That's all.
- She doesn't really know...
- She knows. Believe me.
- Why... Why are you saying that?
- Beau-Beau.
She's a mother, not a moron.
Shut up.
She was bound to find out sooner or later.
That's the way these things work.
Look, I just don't want you talking to her anymore, okay?
- Or to anyone else, for that matter.
- All right.
No, no one. I'm serious.
It's my business.
- If I choose to tell...
- Whatever you want, precious.
What did you talk to her about?
- What did you say to her?
- Nothing.
Well, not much.
You gotta relax, beauty.
Why? What'd she tell you?
Did she ask you to stay away from me?
- I believe she did.
- And?
And I...
All right, I...
I told her I might be amenable to a little... negotiation.
Friendly to an offer.
Beau?
To stop seeing me?
- Of course I was lying. You know that.
- I know what?
That you tried to steal money from my mother?
It's only money. Don't take it so personally.
- Look, I need money. Haven't you noticed...
- Get off me. Get off me.
- I tend to overindulge?
- I said, don't touch me!
That hurt, you little fuck.
Hey, come on. Come on.
Look, I'm sorry, all right?
- I'm sorry. Beau...
- Get off my arm.
Jesus, Beau, you're not being a very good host.
Get out. Get out of here.
Easy, tiger.
Get the fuck outta here.
That hurt.
Hey, Beau. Beau. Beau, come on. Come on.
Beau... Beau.
Jesus, Beau.
Beau, what...
Sweetheart, what happened?
Beau?
I thought I was the only one up.
- You're sure I shouldn't go?
- Yes. I'll be right back.
Problem?
No, just the wind.
- Did I, uh, hear Beau earlier?
- No, I don't think so.
Why don't you get to bed?
It's late.
Margaret, is that you?
- You're up early.
- Trouble sleeping.
- Going for a swim?
- Too cold.
Just a walk.
Maybe I'll run a little.
Where have you been?
I lost my mitt. I can't find it.
- It's around. We'll find it.
- Were you out on the boat?
- Is Paige ready to go?
- You've been AWOL quite a while, Maggie.
- Did you enjoy the walk?
- Did you look under your bed?
Why were you out in the boat?
Go look under your bed.
Paige, the Lloyds are here!
- Is Beau up?
- Beau? No, I haven't seen him.
So, you took a spin on the lake?
Paige, slow down, please.
- Hey, hey, gangplank.
- Honey, the Lloyds are waiting.
Where were you all morning?
Mom, I can't find it.
Dylan, please, it's time to go, now.
You'll just have to borrow from one of the other boys. It won't be so bad.
- You can't just borrow another kid's mitt.
- Of course you can.
Who's gonna let me borrow their mitt?
- Dad told me...
- You'll work it out, Dyl.
People like to share. Go on.
Running late?
Yeah. Sorry.
Lost track of the time.
Do you mind picking up? I have a tennis thing I can't get out of.
- Well, if you can't, then...
- No, I'll manage.
- It's not a problem.
- Okay, great. Bye-bye.
- What happened last night?
- Wesleyan wants another music sample.
I'm being considered for a grant.
I need $50 for the session.
All right. So, what happened last night?
Can you give me a ride? 'Cause
I'm late for water polo already.
Beau.
Look, what do you want me to say?
That you were right?
Fine, you were right, okay?
I just want to know what happened.
- Look, I'm already late.
- You're bruised and scraped.
Something happened, and you've got to tell me...
Oh! There you are.
I thought we were gonna take that skiff out for a spin.
I just got back. Beau needs a ride to school.
- Will you be all right for a little while?
- I was out on the dock.
I couldn't see you there.
Found this, anyway, on the beach in the sand, plain as day.
I'm surprised you didn't see it this morning, Margaret, on your walk.
No, no, I didn't.
What happened to your face?
You're... You're not gonna say anything to Dad, you know, about-about last night?
No.
All right. I'll find a ride back. Bye.
I think that boy ballerinas just don't look right.
They look so funny.
I perfectly agree with you.
You know, he put on his tights the wrong way.
I think... I think he's very funny.
- I don't know.
- Hey!
Are you sure you're not getting a crush?
Oh. yeah?
Hey, look.
What's going on?
Did somebody drown?
Something like that, kid.
Keep moving.
Yes, I'm trying to get through to Captain Thomas Hall.
The U.S.S. Constellation.
His wife, Margaret.
Please don't put me on hold again.
I need to speak to him today. Right now.
Yes, I realize they left port.
I told you, I'm his wife.
Well, no, it's not exactly an emergency.
His wife, Margaret.
All right. No, no message.
Thank you.
He's dead.
Darby's dead. He was killed Monday night.
- The night he was here.
- Beau...
It's in the paper. Look.
Did he know other people in Tahoe?
How should I know?
He knew everybody.
The police are saying...
They're saying someone murdered him.
Did anybody else know he was coming?
Did anybody know you were friends?
Does it matter? Mom, he's dead.
I don't know. Do you think the police will want to speak with you?
I don't know.
Must be a real relief to you, though, huh?
I mean, him being dead and all.
- Oh, Beau, please. No.
- That's gotta have some appeal.
- I mean, can't bother you, can't bother me.
- Stop it, for Christ's sake!
You know, you were right, Mom.
He was a loser. Now, it's just in the paper.
Mom? Oh.
There's some man downstairs.
He wanted to talk to Dad, but I told him that...
Who'd he say he is?
He didn't.
All right, I'm coming.
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.
- I came to see Tom Hall.
- He isn't in.
I can wait. I told that to the girl.
I'm his wife.
- When will he be back?
- He won't be.
Not today.
What exactly is it you want?
I came to talk about Darby Reese...
And your son.
- Dylan?
- What, Mom?
- I need you to play somewhere else.
- What?
I need to speak with this man.
- Promise you won't touch the computer?
- Yes, I promise.
I think you know Darby Reese.
So, uh, you must know he's dead.
Murdered.
Your son's been spending a lot of time with Mr. Reese.
Like, special time.
Sort of intimate.
I forgot my fish book.
Dyl? Dyl? No more interruptions.
- You understand? Okay.
- Mm-hmm. Sorry.
We know Darby was coming here
Monday night to see Beau, the night he was killed.
- "We?"
- Yeah, I have a partner.
- A partner?
- Yes.
- Well, Beau's done nothing wrong.
- Maybe.
I said, he's done nothing wrong.
So why haven't you gone to the police?
Why don't they know that your son and Darby were...
Is there a point to this?
We think your son is mixed up in a murder. That's the point.
I think you should go now.
Have you been listening to me?
No, I... I really...
I think you should go.
Will you just shut up?
What... What's wrong with you?
You think this is a game?
That I've come to chat? To offer advice? What... To warn you?
Does it work, your video machine?
- Put this in.
- I... I...
I said, put it in the machine!
It belonged to Darby.
He owed us money.
We thought it worthless, but not now.
Now it has value.
Now we are sure it has value.
- So, play it.
- It's playing.
Like movies?
- Please shut it off. Please.
- Forty minutes of budding sexuality.
$50,000 by tomorrow, or there'll be a copy with the Tahoe police.
Where do you expect me to get $50,000 in 24 hours?
That's not our problem.
And how do I know that's the only copy?
You don't. That's the position you're in.
Come up with the money, you'll own the tape.
You don't want the police involved any more than they are now.
Margaret? For the love of God, you gotta talk to those cleaners about these stains.
Oh, sorry. I didn't realize...
Jack Hall.
Alek Spera.
Jack, Mr. Spera has, uh...
He's helped Tom with some things.
Spera? From the air station?
Please don't come back here.
I'll meet you in town, anywhere, just not here, not around my family.
All right.
- The post office?
- Yes, okay, that's fine.
Okay. Tomorrow, 5:00.
And remember, Mrs. Hall, $50,000.
4:00. 4:00. I have the kids.
Okay, 4:00.
Mom?
I'm not going to practice today.
I just can't.
Can you call the school and let them know?
I... I don't wanna talk to anyone.
Not now.
Well, my... My husband is, as I explained to you, he's in the navy, he's on a boat.
He's somewhere in the middle of the North Atlantic.
It's just not possible for me to, uh, to get a signature from him.
I mean, what can I say?
Well, you cosigned the mortgage, so you and your husband will both have to sign on any future encumbrance.
Now, if it isn't possible to reach your husband by fax, perhaps we can...
I need the money tomorrow.
I'm sorry.
Hello?
- Here you go, bud.
- Thank you, Beau.
You're the best.
Yes. I'm sorry. No, of course I'm talking about a current balance.
No, no, 3-0-1-5-5.
Account number 4-8-7-4-3-9...
No, I'm trying to determine my credit limit.
The available credit, please.
No, no, 3-3-0-1-5-5...
Jack, I didn't know you...
Can you hold on a minute?
- Your laundry, Jack.
- Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm. Oh, these damn tweezers.
I thought I might have my lunch early today.
All right, I'll bring it up.
Well, can we do it on the phone as an advance?
All right, good-bye.
I'm sorry.
You okay, Beau?
- Can we start it again?
- Relax, kiddo. They're gonna love ya.
Oh, my God. It's so ugly.
No, I have to have it immediately. Today.
1-9-7-7-3-4...
I just wanna know how quickly we can have the cash.
H-A-L-L. I'll hold.
Yes? Hall.
No, the cash, not credit.
Please don't transfer me. Please.
I'm not interested in a personal limit.
Lonergan. Mary Lonergan.
Can you say that again?
Thank you.
Hall. H-A-double-L.
No, I have to have it immediately.
Mine? November 5, 1960.
Margaret.
I can't reach him.
Account number 6-0-1-1...
Yes, that means I can't get his signature.
O-O-9-7...
My mailing address is
7087 Lakeshore,
Tahoe City, California, 96145.
No, don't bother calling back.
Because we won't need it at Christmas.
Thank you.
Jack? Leave that for Beau.
He'll be home soon.
Oh, don't be silly. It's just a bottle of water.
- Well, thanks.
- It's good for the back.
- Ooh, I think.
- Jack, can I talk with you about something?
Surely.
I have a problem.
I need some money.
- Oh?
- I know this is awkward.
Don't be silly. How much?
Uh, no, that isn't...
Well?
The thing is...
Well, come on, Maggie. Spit it out.
My back's tightening up.
The thing is, I'm not really sure.
- Why don't I go and check my purse again?
- Here.
Take...
Take 80.
And if you need any more, let me know.
All right, Jack.
This is the last one.
Jack, I really don't think you should...
Jack?
- Jack!
- Margaret...
Jack?
Jack? Jack?
Can you hear me, Jack?
Wanna see my mom again?
Yeah, I do.
You could come in. Mom!
Two, three, four.
Dylan, call 9-1-1.
Go. Tell them we need an ambulance.
Two, three, four, five.
Jack?
Use more strength.
Press harder.
Do you know how to do this?
Can you do this?
Tilt his head back.
One breath when I hit five.
One, two, three, four, five.
One, two, three, four, five.
One, two, three, four, five.
Mommy, they said they're coming in five minutes.
- One, two, three...
- Dylan, I need your help.
- Four, five.
- Can you go upstairs and get me a pillow?
- Dylan, please?
- Five! Go!
One, two, three, four, five.
One, two, three, four, five.
Jack? Jack?
Jack, can you hear me? Jack?
Oh, Margaret. Oh...
Just lie still.
Everything's fine.
- Everything's fine.
- Mom?
It's okay, Dyl. Everything's fine.
Mom? Mom, are you there?
Pick up if you're there.
Where are you?
Um, well, I'm at Amber's. She needs a ride tomorrow night to ballet.
I hope that's okay.
Oh, and I'm gonna stay here for dinner, okay?
Um, all right. Bye.
Hello?
Where's my mother?
She's, uh...
Your grandfather, he had a...
You should call the hospital.
And who are you?
I'm, uh...
I know your father.
I'm a friend of your father's, and I was, uh...
Leaving.
I've been tryin' your cell phone all day.
Why haven't I heard from you?
I had nothing to say.
Right.
You should have called.
Where's the money?
Why?
- I'll go back tomorrow.
- Why tomorrow?
Why is tomorrow different?
Because it is.
I couldn't get it today.
Of course you could. You could have, but you didn't.
- Look, I want that money.
- Yeah.
And so do you.
You do understand me?
- I said I'd take care of it.
- All right. Fine.
I trust you, Alek, like I trust myself.
You say you're gonna get the money, you get the money.
But, goddamn it, you better get that son-of-a-bitch fuckin' money,
'cause this is a good piece of business, and I'm not gonna walk away from it.
I don't know what the fuck's goin' on with you.
All right. Tomorrow,
Alek, right? I'm trusting you.
And if you can't carry through, I will.
Yes, Jack Hall.
I'm his daughter-in-law.
No, we just came from the hospital.
He said sometime in the next two days.
All right. Will someone call?
Please. Tonight. Thank you.
Mom?
- Did you talk with the hospital?
- Yes.
- How is he?
- I don't know.
I'll be right back.
There's someone...
I have to speak with someone outside.
I did mean to come yesterday.
I waited almost an hour at the post office.
- I'm sorry about that.
- You were not coming, Mrs. Hall.
- You were here. You saw what happened.
- You were not coming.
Did you get the money?
No.
- I'm not sure you understand the situation.
- We don't have the money.
You have to get the money.
Is that not clear enough?
It's $50,000. It is not the kind of thing that everyone can just go out and get.
Have you spoken with your husband?
He can't be reached. He's on a carrier somewhere in the nor...
This is truly none of your business.
What about... The old man?
Well, you have to try harder.
- "Try harder?"
- I don't think you're really trying.
- Really?
- Yes.
Well, maybe you should explain
"really trying" to me, Mr. Spera.
Tell me, how would you be
"really trying" if you were me?
But you're not me, are you?
You don't have my petty concerns to clutter your life and keep you from trying.
You don't have three kids to feed, or worry about the future of a 17-year-old boy who nearly got himself killed driving back from some kind of a nightclub with his 30-year-old friend sitting drunk in the seat beside him.
No, these are not your concerns. I see that.
But perhaps you're right, Mr. Spera.
Perhaps I could be trying a little harder.
Maybe sometime tomorrow between dropping Dylan at baseball practice and picking up my father-in-law from the hospital,
I might find a way to try a little harder.
Maybe I should take a page from your book.
Go to the track, find a card game.
Maybe I should blackmail someone.
Or maybe you have another idea.
I mean, maybe you have a better idea of how I might try a little harder to find this $50,000 you've come here to steal from me.
You're right. I'm not you.
I don't...
This is only a business opportunity. That's all.
What kind of a heartless man are you?
Do you ever get away from your family, Mrs. Hall?
I'll talk to Nagle about the time.
- Maybe he'll listen.
- Mom!
I'm sorry. You don't know what kind of a man Nagle is.
Please, just go. Leave my family out of this.
- It's getting late. Paige needs to go.
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- Is everything okay?
- Yes. Yeah.
- I'll get it!
- Dylan... Mom.
Hall residence, Dylan speaking.
One minute, please.
It's for you. Mr. "Sparrow?"
I'll take it upstairs.
Okay, Dylan. Hang up, please.
Why are you calling me here?
I need to speak with you.
I'm sorry. Please, listen.
You only need to raise 25,000.
I told Nagle I won't take my share.
I don't want it now.
If I could make him go away, stop bothering you, I would.
I wish I could... Go back, but I... But I can't.
He wants that money, and he'll make things ugly for you if he doesn't get it, I promise.
Do you hear me?
It's not so much now.
- Why are you doing this?
- Please just do as I say.
Just get the money.
Are you there?
Do you understand?
Yes, I think so.
Meet me in Reno tomorrow, 3:00.
Harrah's, outside.
- All right.
- Can you find it?
- Harrah's Casino?
- Yes.
Tomorrow. It's not much time, I know.
No.
If you keep giving it gas, you're gonna flood it.
Paige, can you do something?
Where are you going?
The car, sweetheart. I'm late.
Okay. Pop it.
- Problem?
- It's nothing.
My daughter'll fix it.
Make somebody a great husband someday, huh?
- Can I help you?
- Hope so.
Talkin' to the residents around the lake about the murder at Buck's Cove.
- You heard about that?
- Okay, try it, and don't...
I know.
Okay!
Yes, we heard about it.
It seems the victim was killed with an anchor. Pierced his lungs.
And we were thinkin' that anchor could have come from one of these houses around here.
Well, our dinghy doesn't have an anchor. We tie it to the dock.
- Always?
- Yes.
All right. Like I said, just checkin'.
If you think of anything, give us a call.
Okay.
I'm stumped. What did he want?
You can't fix it?
I don't know.
No, I guess not. You probably clogged the fuel lines.
- You know, Beau's car...
- So I'll call a taxi.
- Where are you going anyway?
- Just some errands.
I'll be back before dinner.
Well, how am I supposed to get to ballet?
Sue's stopping by.
7087 Lakeshore Court.
Tahoe City.
Yes. I'll wait outside. Thank you.
You look nice.
- What's going on?
- Nothing, just some errands in town.
You're taking a taxi?
Yeah. The Jeep won't start.
You know, I could drive you.
No, I prefer to be alone.
You sure you wanna hock this stuff?
Yes. How much do you think?
Uh, I could go at 8,500, maybe 8,600.
Well, I w... I was hoping that you could give me more.
8,600 is more.
Margaret, stop!
- Where's your car?
- It wouldn't start.
I don't have all the money.
I could only raise 12,000, a little more than 12,000.
Here. Please say it's enough.
- I need to talk to you.
- I've gotta go.
Just for a minute.
Jack's waiting to be picked up.
I'm already late.
I'll drive you back to Tahoe.
No, thank you. Could you help me find a cab?
I need to talk to you, please.
Things have changed.
The seat belt is above the door.
- The hospital, not the house?
- Yes.
No, thank you.
I took you for a smoker.
They, uh, arrested someone for Darby's murder.
- That's impossible.
- It's more than possible.
- Who is it?
- It doesn't matter.
Who is it?
- His name is Donnelly, Martin Donnelly.
- He didn't do it.
Like I said, it doesn't matter.
Nagle's lost the advantage, but he'll make a deal, with you.
He'll want to make a deal.
Donnelly didn't kill Darby.
- What?
- I know that.
- You don't.
- I do.
- How? How?
- It's not important.
Darby...
Darby came to our house that night, to see Beau.
I'd gone to his nightclub earlier in the day.
Beau had been in a car accident.
He'd been drinking with Darby.
You see, my husband...
He won't understand as it is, his son being...
I don't know how to talk to him about it.
He's away at sea so often.
It's not that...
I must sound very silly to you.
I just wanted him to stay away from Beau, but I failed.
He came to the house that night.
They fought in the boathouse.
I don't know why.
I heard these noises, and I came down.
Beau had run back in.
I met Darby on the dock.
We argued.
I pushed him, and he fell through the railing.
- You pushed him?
- Yes.
- And?
- And the railing...
It just gave way, and he fell onto the anchor.
- And I moved the body.
- You?
Yes. In the boat, in the morning.
- Alone?
- Of course, alone.
- Stop this. I don't believe you.
- I don't care what you believe.
It is what happened.
- And I have to tell them.
- Tell them what?
- That you killed a man?
- Yes!
This is crazy.
Whatever happened that night is over, done.
- It can't be undone.
- Not "undone," but...
I can put an end to this, to Nagle's threats, to all this!
Listen, stop it! J... Just stop it!
It's too late for that.
Whatever happened, it's too late.
Listen to me. You have your family to think about, the life of your family, not Donnelly.
Forget all of this. Forget Donnelly, forget Nagle... And me.
Go home.
Put all this behind you as if it never happened.
Do you hear me, Margaret?
Margaret.
Hello, you've reached the Halls.
Leave us your name and number, and we'll get back to you.
Thanks for calling.
Hi, it's mom. I'm running late.
If the hospital calls, just...
Never mind. I'll be home...
I'll be home soon.
Hi. Um, I got a call that my grandfather was waiting?
Mm-hmm?
- To be picked up.
- Name?
Jack Hall. I think my mother was supposed to come and get him. Is he...
Great, thanks.
Are you sure you don't want to keep the wheelchair?
Don't be ridiculous.
It's bad enough they saddled me with this.
This thing's a wreck.
Want me to take your cane? I can put it in the back or something.
No.
- How will you get home?
- I'll get a taxi.
You know, I never thanked you for your help with Jack.
I was there. That's all.
His heart had stopped.
It happens.
Nagle, it's Alek.
I don't know when I'll hear.
Columbia sent back my tapes, and Wesleyan asked for another one, so...
- What about Annapolis?
- I didn't apply to Annapolis.
Shame. It's a fine schoo...
Why don't we go... Let's lie down.
I think he was in 3-1-3.
You already told me that.
Well, he can't have disappeared.
Take a breath, huh?
He was checked out to a Beau Hall.
It's time to stop this, that's all.
She came up with 12,000.
There is no more.
No, the husband's on a boat somewhere.
It won't happen through him.
We got what we could.
Let it go now.
Battleships.
I never liked carriers.
Who was the guy who used to give us those helicopter rides?
You know, in Virginia.
No one ever gave you helicopter rides.
Yeah, don't you remember?
You know, the tall guy?
- That's hogwash!
- I'll be right back, all right?
And no helo rides!
Not on my watch.
So, explain it to me again.
Maybe I'm stupid.
Yeah, well, I already told you.
Donnelly will be out by tomorrow, in which case we have what we had all along.
You've got most of what you wanted. It's over. It's enough.
I don't want most. I want all.
Why is it so hard for you to understand that?
I'm warning you, Carlie, don't be greedy.
It's not your place to warn me.
You should know that.
It's not your place.
Jesus. What the hell is she doing in a taxi in Tahoe?
I asked you to handle this. You did not.
I don't know why. I'm confused.
- But I'm gonna do this now.
- Who are you?
- I think you know my partner.
Please go. I can't talk to you. Not here.
You'll talk to me.
- What do you want?
- Just the money.
I just want the money.
- I gave it to Alek.
- Part. You gave him part.
- I don't want part.
- He said that Donnelly...
Donnelly didn't kill Darby.
It's idiotic.
The police will know soon enough.
Just get out of my house!
This is a problem, and I would like to resolve it now.
I'll try and be clear. I think you've been lying to Al.
I think you've put ideas in his head.
I think you have the money.
I think you haven't been altogether straightforward with us.
If you want to know the truth.
What kind of a fool do you think I am?
Would I risk anything if I had the money?
Maybe.
Where's your husband?
I'd like to talk with him, because
I don't want this going on any longer, and I can't seem to get any kind of straight answer from you.
Carlie.
Alek, go away.
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
I told you not to come here.
That was not your right.
- You lost control.
- That's not important.
Al, please. Please, go. Go away.
- This woman's made a fool of you.
- Think what you want.
Yes, a stupid, stupid fool.
A weakling...
- You've behaved like a stupid weakling.
- Shut up.
Are you fucking her?
Is that what's going on?
- Is that it? You're fucking her?
- I said, shut up.
Don't talk to me that way!
Get out of here.
- Don't push this, Al.
- Get out.
Alek.
Alek, I...
Alek, please...
I...
- Alek...
- Be quiet.
- No!
- Alek, please, I beg you, don't.
I'll go to the police.
I'll tell them about Darby.
I'll tell them you killed
Nagle in self-defense.
Oh, Margaret.
I'll go to the police, Alek.
I'm sorry.
It shouldn't have come to this.
Alek.
Alek.
We have no choice now.
Please. You gotta let me tell 'em.
Please.
Listen to me. Go inside.
No one can be near the windows.
Think of something... Anything.
Just keep your family away.
Meet me in the driveway.
We'll go together. Take my car keys. In my coat.
On the right, in the pocket.
I'll drive Nagle's car.
You follow in mine.
But you must go inside.
I'll wait in the driveway.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
No.
No.
Mom?
What's going on?
- Your lip. Jesus...
- Beau, I need you to help me.
Where are you going?
I can't drive this. The shift...
- Mom. Mom...
- I need you to drive the car, please.
Please, we need to leave now.
Can you help me? Just...
Please, just help me.
It's a gray car. Did you see it in the driveway?
No.
There. Is that it?
He shouldn't have left like that.
He should have waited.
It's not what you think.
How do you know what I think?
- He's a friend.
- Yeah.
That's all. He's just a friend.
Did you see that?
Beau! Beau, please, call for help!
Alek! Alek!
- You shouldn't have followed me.
- Alek, Jesus!
Why did you follow me?
You didn't wait!
Why didn't you wait?
I lost control of the car, Margaret.
My arm. Margaret, stop. Stop!
Margaret, stop. Stop!
- I'm gonna get you out of here.
- No. Don't! Just leave.
Someone will come.
Oh, Alek.
They'll think he died here in the crash.
- Please go.
- I can't leave you.
But you must. They can't find you here. Think!
Please, no.
Margaret, the tape...
And the money... Look for them.
They were on the seat.
Can you see them?
Get them out.
- I can't see where...
- Just try.
- Now go.
- No, Alek.
I can't.
Please go.
I'm sorry, Margaret.
I'm sorry for all of this.
Margaret?
Yes?
I think I'm...
I'm not...
Alek?
Mom?
Do you want me to call somebody?
No.
Could you just be here with me?
All right.
I'm here.
I don't know how...
I don't know what to say.
So, don't.
I don't need to know.
It's not important.
I love you, Beau.
Yeah.
Me, too.
Mom, it's Dad. Can you pick up?
{5729}{5837}Get the hell out of my house!
{6247}{6287}Put that down.
{6288}{6336}What the hell's wrong with you?
{6337}{6392}Don't! Please!
{6393}{6443}No! For heaven's...
{6473}{6510}No. God. No! Please!
{9129}{9167}I'm gonna miss you.
{9438}{9520}I think you should cancel|your trip to LA.
{9521}{9553}I really do.
{9554}{9625}I will if you'll|cancel your trial.
{9626}{9722}If I do, Mr Murphy goes|to jail for 30 years.
{9723}{9785}He deserves it.
{9786}{9878}How could you defend|that son of a bitch, anyway?
{9879}{9925}Ever hear|of the Sixth Amendment?
{9926}{9996}He's entitled to the best|counsel he can buy...
{9997}{10028}I mean get.
{10060}{10121}You got it right|the first time, honey.
{10146}{10199}You have to|understand something.
{10200}{10279}Mr Murphy doesn't see himself|as a son of a bitch.
{10280}{10327}He gives to charities.
{10328}{10399}He reads bedtime stories|to his kids.
{10424}{10479}You're breaking my heart, Matt.
{10504}{10574}Getting slow|in your old age, Gavin?
{10697}{10747}Thank you for inviting me.
{10748}{10795}It was Matt's idea.
{10796}{10832}It was?
{10833}{10934}He couldn't believe you never|went to a black-and-white ball.
{10935}{10983}I had other priorities.
{10984}{11025}Really?
{11026}{11072}Is everything Matt's idea?
{11123}{11158}You look beautiful.
{11192}{11228}Thanks.
{11380}{11432}It's past your bedtime, David.
{11636}{11681}I love you, Trina.
{11682}{11736}Telephone call|for Mr Corelli.
{11737}{11825}Mr Corelli, there's a phone call|for you in the lounge.
{11958}{11989}Where's your phone?
{12211}{12244}What?
{12245}{12274}How?
{12321}{12371}OK. I'll be right there.
{12522}{12581}David, was it something I said?
{12636}{12671}Kyle Medford's dead.
{12672}{12717}What?!
{12742}{12817}Oh, my God.|I just saw him today.
{12818}{12851}You did?
{12852}{12930}Yes. We talked about the new|Matisse for the museum.
{12931}{12967}What happened?
{12993}{13047}He was murdered.
{13492}{13552}- It's a freak show.|- I'm not here.
{13553}{13627}- Who's in charge?|- Hargrove and Vasko.
{13628}{13683}- You on call?|- Yep.
{13684}{13742}You just hit the jackpot.
{14049}{14131}We guess time of death|about four hours ago.
{14132}{14168}Want to look upstairs?
{14213}{14262}Get these people out.
{14263}{14313}They're stepping on evidence.
{14376}{14441}Black tie, Mr Prosecutor?
{14442}{14505}Four separate cuts.|Two to the jugular.
{14506}{14554}Take a look|at this little goody.
{14555}{14633}Some kind of an African hatchet.
{14634}{14753}It's a fertility mask.|The maid says he collected them.
{14754}{14809}He was wearing it|when she found him.
{14810}{14885}The maid came back about eight|after seeing a movie.
{14886}{14926}She found him like this.
{14927}{14972}The weapon belongs to him.
{15008}{15064}It'll be tough|to show premeditation.
{15188}{15236}This is rage.
{15272}{15357}Make sure we get|some random blood samples.
{15358}{15426}Let's print the toilet.|Maybe he took a leak.
{15427}{15452}Or she.
{15644}{15682}Get anything in here?
{15683}{15758}I got some prints|off the tea set.
{16270}{16346}We'll wrap it.|It won't be a problem.
{16347}{16442}I'll send the ID tech guy|the prints.
{16443}{16484}The lab clear this room?
{16485}{16513}Yeah, they're done.
{16564}{16666}See if we can get|a hit this time.
{16667}{16696}That bothers me.
{16697}{16772}See where he is with his work.
{17528}{17558}Karen?
{17559}{17612}Let's get these to the lab.
{17613}{17653}What are they?
{17654}{17719}Well, either he|collected pubic hair,
{17720}{17815}or he's auditioning|for a Clairol ad.
{18828}{18892}We're all done.|Paramedics are finishing up.
{18893}{18938}- We're heading out.|- Right.
{18939}{18998}Don't log this until I say, OK?
{18999}{19070}- What is it?|- I'll tell you later.
{19071}{19106}Prints on the hatchet.
{19107}{19142}Perfect 14-pointers.
{19143}{19198}Do I get a warrant|on phone records?
{19199}{19228}His privacy's gone.
{19229}{19294}The media will make it|into a gangbang.
{19295}{19342}Everything goes through me.
{19343}{19386}You gotta be loving this shit.
{19387}{19416}I'm sorry?
{19417}{19476}Next year's an election year.
{19477}{19527}Good to see you.
{19570}{19620}Good to see you, too, Corelli.
{19653}{19711}Better bring Clifford|up to speed.
{19712}{19779}- What are you laughing at?|- I'm not.
{19780}{19842}Next year is an election year,|isn't it?
{19843}{19913}Is it? We'll talk later.
{19914}{19961}Yeah. See you.
{20994}{21025}David, Mr Wong.
{21064}{21138}Ask Mr Wong|if he recognises this.
{21372}{21413}It was bought at his store.
{21414}{21474}It's good silver|from Chiang-Su in China.
{21475}{21523}Did he do the engraving?
{21618}{21677}No. It was done in Hong Kong.
{21678}{21704}For who?
{21872}{21932}It was made for a rich man here.
{21933}{22002}A gift from a beautiful woman.
{22027}{22105}Ask him what this means.
{22189}{22239}It means jade.
{22280}{22315}Jade.
{22718}{22798}- Morning, Hal.|- Morning, Mr Gavin.
{22799}{22843}Thank you.
{22899}{22955}See you in a couple of days.
{22956}{23031}OK. I'll call you.
{23032}{23060}Be good.
{23061}{23115}Always. You be careful.
{23116}{23163}- Morning, Mrs Gavin.|- Morning.
{23164}{23224}Would you care for breakfast?
{23225}{23261}Just some coffee.
{23367}{23420}We're ready, Mrs Gavin.
{23421}{23478}Father, you are holy, indeed,
{23479}{23566}and all Creation|rightly gives you praise.
{23567}{23646}All life, all holiness|comes from you,
{23647}{23717}through your son Jesus Christ,|our Lord,
{23718}{23769}by the working of|the Holy Spirit.
{23794}{23882}From age to age, you gather|people to yourself
{23883}{23935}so that from east to west,
{23936}{24037}an offering may be made|to the glory of your name.
{24062}{24128}And so, Father,|we bring you these gifts.
{24129}{24225}We ask you to make them holy|by the power of your spirit,
{24226}{24282}that they may become for us
{24283}{24410}the body and blood of your son|our Lord Jesus Christ...
{24411}{24451}What are you doing here?
{24452}{24537}I took Trina to the airport.|Free for lunch?
{24538}{24585}You see the papers?
{24586}{24639}It's the case you've been|dreaming about.
{24640}{24722}It will put your ambitious ass|into the big office.
{24723}{24809}You'll be the next DA|of San Francisco.
{24810}{24847}Where did she go?
{24848}{24946}- LA for a few days.|- Think she's coming back?
{24947}{25030}Maybe when we get a divorce,|you can marry her.
{25031}{25079}Cool.
{25080}{25150}She said you were|a terrible lover.
{25151}{25218}She lies to protect|your frail ego.
{25219}{25274}She said that's why|she chose me.
{25275}{25307}Everybody makes mistakes.
{25308}{25383}You finally admit that.
{25384}{25441}- You still playing?|- Sure.
{25442}{25506}- See you at 1:00?|- Take your best shot.
{25568}{25642}Medford had money problems.
{25643}{25715}Last year he lost $8 million|on the yen.
{25716}{25790}That's what he gets|for betting the yen.
{25847}{25935}And there's something else.|We've got a problem.
{25936}{25996}Only if we make it a problem.
{25997}{26088}We found a roll of film|in Medford's safe.
{26875}{26938}- This a gag?|- No gag.
{26939}{27046}Those pictures are not relevant|to this investigation.
{27047}{27090}Who's the girl?
{27091}{27167}Now, that|is a relevant question.
{27192}{27218}Let's find her.
{27219}{27270}We don't know anything|about her.
{27271}{27316}It's a waste of time.
{27317}{27364}We know one thing...
{27365}{27413}she's not a nun.
{27464}{27567}What about the, um... gentleman?
{27568}{27631}You want to bring him in?
{27632}{27688}I'm not making that call.
{27689}{27774}I'll take care of it, OK?
{28022}{28109}You've got pictures of the|governor with some hooker?
{28110}{28150}Keep that to yourself.
{28185}{28270}- What will you do?|- I'm seeing him tomorrow.
{28271}{28321}He could turn you|into road-kill.
{28322}{28351}No shit.
{28352}{28404}Why don't you come downtown?
{28405}{28437}As a partner?
{28438}{28476}Eventually.
{28501}{28531}What for?
{28557}{28607}Money. Real money.
{28608}{28674}I'm having fun doing what I do.
{28675}{28765}There's only three fun things|in life-money, sex and power.
{28766}{28815}Two out of three's not bad.
{28816}{28896}Be careful your dream case|don't blow your brains out.
{28939}{28988}What's this divorce stuff?
{28989}{29013}Oh, that.
{29014}{29074}I was just yanking your chain.
{29153}{29201}You guys OK?
{29202}{29237}Yeah.
{29238}{29298}Don't look so disappointed,|David.
{29354}{29415}You're a cynical|son of a bitch, man.
{29416}{29466}Yeah, that's why we're friends.
{29828}{29873}Governor, Mr Corelli.
{29938}{29988}Morning, sir.
{29989}{30073}David. Good to see you.
{30074}{30128}Always good|to see our rising stars,
{30129}{30201}even if they're plotting|headaches for my friends.
{30202}{30249}I like your boss.
{30250}{30358}Word is that you were thinking|about opposing him.
{30359}{30440}None of us ever run|for anything, do we?
{30441}{30509}We just allow the party faithful|to draft us.
{30510}{30559}You know my AA, Bill Barrett?
{30560}{30601}- Sit down.|- Thanks
{30602}{30693}I don't know how I can help|with Kyle. I liked him.
{30694}{30747}I've got a meeting|in 10 minutes.
{30748}{30797}I hoped to see you alone.
{30798}{30850}I have no secrets from Bill.
{30851}{30929}He knows where all|the bodies are buried.
{30930}{30990}There's something|I need to show you.
{30991}{31049}Show me, but quickly.
{31464}{31535}Push the fucking meeting back|a half-hour.
{31536}{31568}Yes, sir.
{31569}{31633}I'd like to be alone|with David...
{31634}{31679}with the distinguished|Mr Corelli.
{32629}{32669}Where did you get these?
{32670}{32714}Kyle Medford's safe.
{32739}{32773}Son of a bitch.
{32825}{32909}The miserable cock-sucking|son of a bitch.
{33079}{33107}Who knows about them?
{33108}{33171}The investigating officers.|My people.
{33254}{33329}And you, of course.
{33330}{33367}And me.
{33368}{33464}If you drag me into this, David,
{33465}{33573}if my name even shows up|on the periphery of this,
{33574}{33637}you better get the fuck|out of California
{33638}{33702}because you'll have as much|future as Jerry Brown.
{33764}{33823}Who's Jerry Brown?
{33869}{33929}Wouldn't it be an awful shame
{33930}{34030}if one little pussy|and a thimbleful of sperm
{34031}{34097}were to affect the future|of this state?
{34098}{34157}Was Medford blackmailing you?
{34190}{34276}I don't get blackmailed,|Mr Corelli.
{34302}{34381}I do the fucking.|I never get fucked.
{34382}{34464}I have my answer, then.|Thank you for your help.
{34465}{34531}Any time.|I enjoy dispensing advice
{34532}{34587}to those who care to listen.
{34639}{34694}You have other copies,|I presume?
{34695}{34735}That's correct.
{34736}{34798}Then I'll just hold on to these.
{34799}{34901}Fine. Good to see you again.
{35024}{35048}Dr Gavin is a psychologist
{35049}{35107}who specialises|in the causes and treatment
{35108}{35162}of violence in the workplace.
{35163}{35258}Her work's been published in the|National Review of Psychiatry
{35259}{35341}and in her two best-selling|works of non-fiction.
{35342}{35417}Ladies and gentlemen,|Dr Katrina Gavin.
{35604}{35636}Good afternoon.
{35637}{35728}Today I'll examine situations|common to your company
{35729}{35782}and others|in the changing workplace.
{35783}{35824}It's important to distinguish
{35825}{35917}between someone having a bad day|that ends in a tantrum
{35918}{35990}and someone whose failure|to resist aggressive impulses
{35991}{36069}results in serious|destructive acts.
{36070}{36177}These people are in many ways|no different from you and me,
{36178}{36250}but they can no longer|control their urges.
{36251}{36314}They disassociate themselves|from their actions,
{36315}{36388}often experiencing|an hysterical blindness.
{36389}{36461}They're blind to the darkness|within themselves.
{37032}{37089}You have reached the law offices
{37090}{37141}of Gavin, Terry, and Klorinda.
{37142}{37209}Office hours are 9am to 6pm.
{37210}{37291}After the beep,|please leave a message.
{37292}{37333}Hey, it's me.
{37393}{37481}I thought maybe you were working|late, but I guess not.
{37482}{37550}I'm so tired|of these things, honey.
{37551}{37635}I feel like I'm disassociating|myself from my own actions.
{37685}{37762}Maybe I'm reaching|hysterical blindness.
{37763}{37851}Hey, be careful. I might give in|to an uncontrollable urge.
{37852}{37941}Anyway...
{37942}{37984}I miss you.
{38089}{38156}How does that make you feel?
{38158}{38190}Be nice.
{38216}{38299}You don't give a shit|about anyone, do you?
{38300}{38366}That's none of your business.
{38524}{38582}Governor Edwards called me.
{38641}{38686}Oh, yeah?
{38699}{38765}Are you out of|your fucking mind?
{38811}{38895}The next time you go there,|check with me first.
{38968}{39034}I want you off this case.
{39035}{39084}Cliff, I am onto something here.
{39085}{39135}I need a little more time.
{39136}{39216}I want you off the case.
{39290}{39383}You take me off this,|and I will go public.
{39384}{39454}I don't think the governor|would appreciate that.
{39542}{39617}Why don't you work it out|and try it yourself?
{39618}{39665}Maybe I will.
{39666}{39749}You haven't tried a case|in 10 years, Cliff.
{39782}{39856}Will there be anything else?
{39925}{39982}Here's the governor's|lady friend.
{40009}{40054}She's 17 here.
{40055}{40125}Had to get|into juvenile files for this.
{40126}{40180}Patrice Jacinto, 21.
{40181}{40243}Works for a beauty parlour|in Chinatown.
{40244}{40370}One arrest for solicitation|when she was a juvenile.
{40371}{40462}- You talk to her yet?|- No, not yet.
{40463}{40516}Her bank account shows|two $10,000 deposits
{40517}{40542}in the last six months.
{41521}{41595}Medford's had this place|a couple of years.
{41596}{41666}His investment company|leases it.
{41776}{41821}- Hi, John.|- Vasko.
{41822}{41909}I bet you can't wait|to see the bedroom.
{41910}{41960}- Corelli.|- Morning.
{42028}{42084}Deep-seated massage oil.
{42118}{42203}And over here we have|a harmony pillow.
{42204}{42260}"This pillow allows|deeper penetration
{42261}{42342}"by positioning both partners|most advantageously.
{42343}{42421}"It raises the female hips,|facilitating male entry.
{42446}{42491}"You can inflate the pillow
{42492}{42563}"to varying degrees|of hardness or softness
{42564}{42660}"while enjoying the thrill|of floating action."
{42727}{42760}Here in the nightstand,
{42761}{42822}we got about|three grams of coke...
{42823}{42894}Some poppers, some assorted|children's vitamins...
{42895}{42963}My best guess is ecstasy.
{42964}{43041}This is the room the governor|was photographed in.
{43042}{43111}Maybe it's his bridal suite.
{43112}{43151}You look in here?
{43152}{43205}Yeah. It's been photographed.
{43206}{43303}Cristalle, Beluga,|Wolfgang Puck...
{43304}{43389}- It's a fuck-house.|- Not just a fuck-house.
{43390}{43451}He's got a nice|little camera over here...
{43452}{43506}and there's another one|up here...
{43507}{43563}low-light, high-density.
{43564}{43640}Neighbour saw|a lot of women come here.
{43641}{43715}Did you check out these jammin'|jellies and cliterrifics?
{43716}{43758}I was thinking about you.
{43759}{43842}Honey, I'd rip off|some of those butt plugs.
{43843}{43895}They're designed for|the perfect asshole.
{44016}{44049}Inspector Vasko.
{44145}{44199}Take a look at this.
{44200}{44255}You think the lab can do|anything with that?
{44256}{44334}- They can try recycling it.|- Great.
{44372}{44421}What about this neighbour?
{44422}{44501}Name's Guy Henderson. Claims|he never saw Medford here,
{44502}{44548}but saw women at the house.
{44549}{44582}Can he identify anybody?
{44583}{44640}I think he saw more|than he says.
{44641}{44718}His bedroom faces the house|and he's got a scope.
{44719}{44795}I didn't spy on them|or anything.
{44796}{44855}I'm sure you didn't,|Mr Henderson.
{44856}{44920}A lot of women came up.|Men, too.
{44921}{44996}How many different women|you see over there?
{44997}{45065}I don't know.|Five or six, maybe.
{45066}{45156}Did you ever see any|of these women over there?
{45287}{45323}Yeah. Yeah, l, uh...
{45324}{45354}I think I saw her.
{45416}{45429}Patrice Jacinto.
{45430}{45520}She's been working in this|beauty parlour for six months.
{45521}{45604}Fifteen jobs in two years.|Waitress, actress...
{45605}{45697}You wonder how she put so much|dough in her account.
{45808}{45843}Ms Jacinto?
{45844}{45872}Yes?
{45873}{45899}Could we talk to you?
{45900}{45947}Yeah. Just a second.
{45973}{46015}An, shit!
{46132}{46164}Patrice!
{46512}{46560}Watch it!
{47478}{47503}Watch out!
{48059}{48096}Patrice! Stop!
{48097}{48141}Patrice! God damn it!
{48142}{48193}God damn it, hold still!
{48194}{48255}God damn it!
{48281}{48319}Here. Here.
{48320}{48379}Shut up, sweetheart.|You're going downtown.
{48415}{48471}- Fuck!|- Come on, damn it!
{48996}{49026}My name is David Corelli.
{49027}{49098}I'm the assistant DA|in charge of homicide here.
{49099}{49126}Congratulations.
{49127}{49157}Thank you.
{49182}{49241}Something to drink or smoke?
{49242}{49311}No. They said I couldn't|smoke in here.
{49312}{49352}They were wrong.
{49472}{49530}Let me tell you how this works.
{49531}{49617}I know, damn it!|I'm fucking calling my lawyer!
{49618}{49684}I can't believe|you did this shit!
{49685}{49748}Look at this!|Look at my face!
{49749}{49812}Sit down, Patrice.
{49813}{49872}Now, sit down.
{50065}{50151}You're right. Call your attorney|and say I have a witness
{50152}{50252}who'll identify you visiting|Kyle Medford's Pacifica house.
{50253}{50375}Sound familiar? I have pictures|of you fucking the governor
{50376}{50469}and those pictures will ruin|the governor's career.
{50470}{50542}And you know what's going to|happen then, Patrice?
{50543}{50673}Your attorney will tell you|to go fuck yourself and hang up.
{50865}{50969}The pay phone is|right out there in the hall.
{51033}{51079}Wait a minute.
{51158}{51249}Wait a minute.
{51250}{51369}I met Kyle at a party|and he knew I was broke,
{51370}{51455}so he offered me 500 a pop.
{51456}{51549}I mean, I fuck guys for less.
{51550}{51598}I'd go to the Pacifica house,
{51599}{51669}a guy would come|and we'd spend the night.
{51670}{51742}They wouldn't know me.|I didn't know them.
{51743}{51826}A couple of creeps|didn't even want me.
{51827}{51893}They wanted this other girl|they'd fucked before.
{51894}{51929}They called her Jade.
{51996}{52065}One of those guys|was the governor.
{52066}{52133}Jade must have rocked his world,
{52134}{52225}because he wanted me to|bend over and turn around,
{52226}{52295}but I don't take it that way.
{52296}{52358}He told me that Jade|took it any way.
{52359}{52425}She couldn't get enough.|She loved it.
{52426}{52523}I saw her once|leaving Kyle's house.
{52524}{52689}She had long, beautiful hair|and great legs.
{52690}{52742}I think it was her.
{52767}{52835}I never met her.|I'd like to, though.
{52836}{52884}I'm into women, mostly.
{55452}{55515}Somebody sawed|through your brake line.
{55516}{55585}There was no fluid|in your wheel cylinders.
{55586}{55625}His blood count's low.
{55626}{55692}He's lost consciousness,|could have a concussion.
{55693}{55743}We'll have to run some tests.
{55792}{55861}Somebody up there|loves you, Corelli.
{55979}{56034}They want to subpoena|my records.
{56035}{56084}They talked to my CEO.
{56085}{56171}He's pleading to two felony|counts and telling everything.
{56196}{56261}- What does he know?|- Everything.
{56297}{56403}You know Vince. He's my closest|friend - 20 years.
{56404}{56435}Who's representing him?
{56436}{56460}Lawton.
{56461}{56513}- Harry Lawton?|- Yeah.
{56538}{56592}Has he signed a plea agreement?
{56593}{56626}I don't know.
{56627}{56674}I know Harry.
{56675}{56715}Don't worry about it.
{56716}{56762}What do you mean?
{56763}{56798}He's a bullshit artist.
{56799}{56881}If it wasn't for me,|he would have been disbarred.
{56882}{56937}What am I going to do, Matt?
{56938}{56988}I've got four kids.
{57018}{57122}- A trial will kill Sara.|- You will not go to trial.
{57123}{57192}You will not do one day in jail.
{57193}{57231}You have my word.
{57232}{57270}Listen to me.
{57271}{57337}When they find out|I'm representing you,
{57338}{57400}this will all go away -|everything, OK?
{57462}{57491}We made the prints|on the hatchet handle.
{57492}{57516}Patrice?
{57517}{57554}No, but we got lucky.
{57555}{57604}An arrest in Palo Alto in 1980.
{57605}{57657}Some animal rights protest|at Stanford.
{57658}{57689}No charges ever filed,
{57690}{57736}but the Sacramento computer|held prints.
{57762}{57819}Anna Katrina Maxwell.
{57820}{57912}We're trying to locate her|through the admissions office.
{57938}{58000}- You OK?|- Yeah. I'm fine.
{58001}{58046}Nice work.
{58495}{58561}I appreciate you doing this,|Mr Henderson.
{58562}{58646}I want to show you|one more set of pictures.
{58741}{58795}OK. Anybody look familiar?
{58796}{58841}None of these are familiar.
{58842}{58889}Nobody from that set. OK.
{58915}{59012}One more group.|One, two... One more.
{59084}{59144}Yeah. I've seen her.
{59145}{59223}- The one in the middle?|- Yeah.
{59310}{59355}Paisan, get in here.
{59356}{59382}It's about time.
{59383}{59449}Tell Judge Licaldi|I'll ring him later.
{59450}{59487}Come on.
{59540}{59607}She told you|she saw Medford that day.
{59608}{59659}They were looking at a Matisse.
{59660}{59726}Matt, her prints|are on the hatchet.
{59727}{59785}I got to start at the beginning.
{59786}{59870}She probably looked at his|collection while she was there.
{59871}{59901}What are you saying?
{59902}{59970}To eliminate her,|I need to speak to her.
{59971}{60031}Fine. She'll be back|from LA tomorrow.
{60032}{60108}- Talk to her.|- Officially.
{60142}{60222}Come on, David... You know her.
{60223}{60326}You know her as well as I do.|You loved her.
{60327}{60363}- Still do.|- Cheap shot.
{60364}{60444}You think she'd take|a fucking hatchet to somebody?
{60445}{60532}No, I don't, which is why|I need to talk to her.
{60533}{60629}Fine. Come to the house,|have lunch, then talk to her.
{61722}{61769}Yes? Can I help you?
{61770}{61824}Inspector Vasko,|San Francisco Police Department.
{61825}{61917}- In the living room, please.|- Thank you.
{61918}{62011}- Hi, Maria.|- Mr Corelli. Nice to see you.
{62263}{62291}Cosy little pad.
{62292}{62363}Yeah. Kind of like|Candlestick Park.
{62498}{62545}Sorry to keep you waiting.|Hello.
{62546}{62594}- Inspector Vasko.|- Trina Gavin.
{62595}{62678}- Hi, Bob Hargrove.|- Hi.
{62704}{62770}- Matt said you had an accident.|- I'm fine.
{62771}{62803}Let's get something straight.
{62804}{62916}Mrs Gavin is only talking to you|because she is not a suspect.
{62917}{63009}The investigation does not focus|on her at this time.
{63010}{63072}I think we can live with that.
{63073}{63145}What's your relationship|with Kyle Medford?
{63146}{63241}I'm on the board of the Pacific|Museum. Kyle was chairman.
{63242}{63352}He felt we were too conservative|in our acquisitions program.
{63353}{63419}I supported his efforts|to be more active.
{63420}{63465}Did you see him socially?
{63466}{63505}No, not really.
{63506}{63579}My husband and I saw him|at various functions.
{63580}{63630}Did you ever meet alone?
{63668}{63741}Yes. One time. The day he died.
{63742}{63890}He called me to talk about|acquiring a new Matisse.
{63891}{64044}I was leaving town, so I agreed|to meet him at his house.
{64045}{64081}That was last Saturday?
{64082}{64120}Yes.
{64121}{64184}What time did you get there?
{64185}{64237}I got there around 4:00.
{64238}{64285}We talked about the Matisse.
{64286}{64353}He gave me some tea.
{64354}{64405}He showed me his collection.
{64406}{64441}Was he alone?
{64442}{64477}Yes.
{64478}{64529}Did anyone see you there?
{64530}{64580}No. I don't think so.
{64605}{64679}What sort of things|did he show you?
{64680}{64779}He showed me this God-awful mask|from the Cameroon -
{64780}{64906}I think it was a fertility mask|- And a hatchet.
{64907}{64976}He said it was over|100 years old.
{64977}{65022}Did you touch anything?
{65049}{65094}I touched the hatchet.
{65095}{65173}The mask, he held it up.
{65174}{65285}I can't remember|whether I touched it or not.
{65286}{65347}What did you do|after you left?
{65348}{65389}I went home.
{65390}{65425}Was your husband here?
{65454}{65519}- No.|- Was anyone here? Staff?
{65520}{65575}- No.|- Did you use the phone?
{65576}{65670}I had the machine on.|I was preparing a speech.
{65713}{65772}Look, I have no alibi|until 9:00,
{65773}{65833}when we went to the ball.
{65834}{65936}- Is that what you're asking?|- What else do you need?
{65937}{66010}Have you ever been|to Medford's beach house?
{66036}{66150}Only his house in the city.|I didn't know he had another.
{66151}{66217}Ever give Medford|a silver jewellery box?
{66218}{66260}I never gave any gift.
{66261}{66316}You never had sex with him?
{66317}{66356}What kind of question is that?
{66357}{66386}That's why they're here.
{66387}{66453}You don't have to answer that.
{66542}{66625}I said I had no social contact|with him.
{66626}{66726}I do consider sex|to be a social contact, David.
{66727}{66782}As you know, I'm married.
{66828}{66860}I think she did it.
{66861}{66895}Why?
{66896}{66946}No alibi. Prints on the hatchet.
{66947}{67003}- And she lied.|- Typical shrink.
{67004}{67049}They pull your strings.
{67050}{67125}She was pulling your strings|pretty good.
{70575}{70645}The guy almost|had them convinced...
{70646}{70692}Morning, Corelli.
{70693}{70765}Hey, Dave, how you doing?
{70766}{70831}Got something to show you.
{70832}{70891}How we doing?
{70892}{70984}Now this... is what you gave us.
{70985}{71074}We were able to enhance it|using software algorithms.
{71099}{71146}Let's see...
{71204}{71251}This is how it looked|when we got it.
{71252}{71313}Medford's beach house.
{71401}{71471}At least it's not|the governor again.
{71472}{71515}Or the president.
{71516}{71564}Thank God.
{71565}{71624}I can still believe in hope.
{71625}{71710}There's some jump cuts,|but we saved a few minutes.
{71818}{71888}You ever take it|like that, Corelli?
{71889}{71938}Is that an offer, Inspector?
{71939}{71974}You wish.
{71975}{72063}We cleaned it up|a lot more from here on.
{72064}{72117}Right. Keep working on this,
{72118}{72168}you'll have a PG rating.
{72217}{72287}Boy, it's a wonderful|country, isn't it?
{72425}{72473}Freeze it right there.
{72519}{72559}Magnify it.
{72720}{72762}Jesus.
{73621}{73651}Got a minute?
{73652}{73676}Yeah.
{73677}{73770}Miss Jacinto called. She wants|to meet you at 5:00 today.
{73771}{73825}Tell her Fior d'ltalia,|Washington Square.
{73826}{73883}OK. She said it's about Jade.
{76899}{76972}Hey, you asshole!
{77152}{77202}Get away from her!
{77237}{77313}Call an ambulance.|Call 911. Code three. Do it!
{78976}{79023}Hey, you asshole!
{79879}{79952}Fuck! Fuck!
{87981}{88006}Shit!
{88618}{88710}Man, you fucked up!
{88843}{88908}Medical examiner's|case number 3209.
{88909}{88970}March 16, 1995.
{88971}{89026}Patrice Jacinto.
{89027}{89087}There are abrasions|to the chin.
{89088}{89133}The abrasions|are minimally haemorrhagic
{89134}{89200}and red to purple in colour.
{89201}{89308}The neck wound is|of a "y" configuration -
{89309}{89411}the horizontal line|being five inches long
{89412}{89456}and half an inch in width.
{89457}{89524}We don't have|a talking head any more.
{89525}{89590}Somebody knew|she was talking to us.
{89591}{89649}I didn't know|you knew the governor.
{89650}{89715}I don't.|I know Bill Barrett. Why?
{89716}{89805}- Want me to introduce you?|- Go fuck yourself.
{89806}{89912}- Glad you made her talk?|- What did you say?
{89913}{89951}You heard it.
{89952}{89992}What?
{90017}{90102}I am onto you! I am onto you!
{90128}{90170}Get off me, Petey!
{90171}{90227}I am onto you.
{90289}{90345}You want to tell me about that?
{90371}{90415}I can't yet.
{90457}{90498}What is it?
{90524}{90627}- It's a cuff link.|- Don't play with me.
{90628}{90686}I want to know what it means.
{90687}{90727}I don't know.
{90782}{90856}What if this comes|up in trial, David?
{90857}{90895}There'll be questions asked...
{90896}{90978}I would never put|you up for grabs.
{91012}{91082}You are taking|a huge chance here.
{91083}{91176}- So are you.|- Yeah. No shit.
{91216}{91280}There was something between|you and Mrs Gavin...
{91281}{91322}A long time ago.
{91323}{91373}And you're OK with that now?
{91434}{91479}I hope so.
{91513}{91621}People who commit these acts are|no different from you and me,
{91622}{91690}but they can no longer|control their urges.
{91691}{91750}They disassociate themselves|from their actions,
{91751}{91844}often experiencing|an hysterical blindness.
{91845}{91905}They're blind to|the darkness within themselves.
{91949}{92073}This is from a speech she made|in LAjust a week ago.
{92074}{92130}We have her prints|on the hatchet.
{92131}{92202}We have her lying to us|in her statement.
{92203}{92306}She was in Medford's house|just before he was killed.
{92307}{92408}- She's got no alibi.|- We don't have a motive.
{92409}{92444}What about blackmail?
{92445}{92526}The murder weapon wasn't hers.|No premeditation.
{92527}{92615}Matt Gavin's wife -|he'll eat us for breakfast.
{92616}{92694}It was her. She did it.
{92730}{92788}What make of car killed Patrice?
{92789}{92842}Black Thunderbird.
{92843}{92895}You didn't ID the plates?
{92896}{92930}No. No plates.
{92931}{92974}What does Mrs Gavin drive?
{93012}{93091}They've got three cars.|A Jag, a Range Rover...
{93092}{93160}And a black Thunderbird, right?
{93277}{93339}All right, bring her in.
{93873}{93922}Just who I wanted to see.
{93923}{93992}Those photographs|you left in Sacramento,
{93993}{94067}I thought maybe now|that you won't need them,
{94068}{94130}you could help me|find the negatives.
{94156}{94218}Why don't you help him, Pat?
{94219}{94289}- Yeah, right.|- Excuse me.
{94290}{94396}Are you putting me on?|What do you need them for?
{94397}{94460}They're not relevant any more.
{94486}{94511}Beat it.
{94605}{94679}Aren't you going|to read me my rights?
{94680}{94735}You can leave any time.
{94736}{94829}I've told you about Kyle.|What else is there?
{94830}{94887}This is about Jade.
{95125}{95206}A couple of creeps|didn't even want me.
{95207}{95264}They wanted this girl|they'd fucked before.
{95265}{95318}They called her Jade.
{95319}{95388}One of those guys|was the governor.
{95389}{95449}Jade must have rocked|his world.
{95450}{95526}He wanted me to bend over|and turn around,
{95527}{95582}but I don't take it that way.
{95583}{95683}He said Jade took it any way.|She couldn't get enough of it.
{95684}{95749}What does this have|to do with Katrina?
{95750}{95828}Could I have|that other tape, please?
{97241}{97305}Mrs Gavin, is that you?
{97306}{97346}That's not her!
{97371}{97455}- Mrs Gavin?|- You don't have to answer.
{97511}{97539}I'm sorry, Matt.
{97540}{97585}Fuck you, David!
{97663}{97689}All right,
{97690}{97747}let's get on with it.
{97821}{97896}I met Jim at the museum.
{97951}{98034}I'd never cheated|on my husband before.
{98035}{98157}He took me to a house.|I spent the night with him.
{98158}{98202}Where?
{98203}{98259}Pacifica.|Some place on the beach.
{98260}{98314}Did you have sex with other men?
{98315}{98340}No.
{98386}{98480}I cheated on my husband.|I didn't know I'd be arrested.
{98481}{98517}You're not under arrest.
{98518}{98611}You never called yourself Jade|or used Medford's house?
{98612}{98670}Look, bring that girl in here.
{98671}{98723}She'll tell you|I'm not that person.
{98724}{98765}The girl is dead.
{98899}{98935}Excuse me.
{99007}{99058}Would it surprise you to know
{99059}{99124}that Medford owned|the Pacifica house?
{99125}{99151}Yes, it would.
{99177}{99253}What if a witness|saw you several times?
{99254}{99308}I'd say your witness|was mistaken.
{99309}{99337}Would you?
{99338}{99427}Where were you yesterday|between five and six pm?
{99428}{99525}In the city. I met Matt|for a drink around 5:00.
{99526}{99578}Then I went to my office.
{99579}{99689}I returned a few calls|and I got home around 7:45.
{99690}{99758}- What about Medford?|- What were you driving?
{99759}{99840}- I asked a question.|- I'll do the questions.
{99841}{99884}- What were you driving?|- My car.
{99885}{100000}- Black Thunderbird?|- Yes. Anything else?
{100001}{100066}Can you be|in a line-up tomorrow?
{100067}{100095}That's enough!
{100096}{100159}If you're charging her,|do it right now!
{100488}{100558}Well, I think she had|an uncontrollable urge,
{100559}{100627}coupled with|hysterical blindness.
{100788}{100865}It's time you took yourself|out of this.
{101043}{101094}I don't understand something.
{101095}{101167}How could you do this to me?
{101168}{101229}How could I do this to you?
{101230}{101297}- What did you expect?|- Expect?
{101298}{101354}I didn't expect to go downtown
{101355}{101467}and sit and watch a tape|of my wife fucking somebody!
{101468}{101542}You think I don't know|about you?
{101543}{101571}Know what?
{101572}{101604}I know everything.
{101605}{101650}I know their names.
{101651}{101754}I know about the Fairmont|Towers, sometimes your office.
{101780}{101830}I'm not stupid, Matt.
{101946}{102003}Is that why you did it?
{102277}{102359}We'll check if that's blood|on the tyres.
{102360}{102409}You'll get a comparison|with Patrice's?
{102410}{102435}Yeah, right.
{102460}{102513}What about this?|This looks like blood.
{102514}{102579}Could be paint transfer|from an impact.
{102580}{102628}This is the car, Petey.
{102629}{102704}This car was reported stolen|about a week ago.
{102705}{102770}Belongs to some|computer company executive.
{102771}{102834}Not Mrs Gavin's car.
{102835}{102897}Maybe somebody wants us|to think it was.
{102969}{103028}This is the car, Petey.
{103029}{103077}This is the car.
{105899}{105985}What, did the tape|turn you on?
{106203}{106269}Don't ever talk|to me like that again!
{106270}{106320}Do you understand me?
{107229}{107274}What are you doing here?
{107275}{107328}I need to talk to you.
{107329}{107373}I can't. You know that.
{107374}{107431}I need your help, David.|I'm afraid.
{107432}{107472}Afraid of what?
{107499}{107549}Who am I speaking to?
{107627}{107672}Can I come in?
{107735}{107771}Come on in.
{107969}{108022}I didn't know Kyle|was taping any of it.
{108023}{108146}I knew they were powerful, but|I had no idea he was using them.
{108147}{108227}He told me they were|friends of his.
{108228}{108278}How many were there?
{108319}{108401}A lot. I don't know.|I lost track.
{108402}{108464}How could you let them do that?
{108465}{108508}They didn't do anything.
{108509}{108562}It was my choice. I liked it.
{108563}{108637}- And Matt?|- I don't fuck him that way.
{108638}{108728}That's not what I mean.|What did you tell him?
{108754}{108798}Nothing.
{108799}{108891}He only knows|about the man on the tape.
{109094}{109147}Who were the others?
{109148}{109201}Men with money...
{109202}{109234}reputations.
{109266}{109360}I didn't have to fall in love|with them, David.
{109386}{109441}It was safe.
{109442}{109492}At least, I thought it was.
{109554}{109622}David, I know too much.
{109664}{109726}One of them killed Kyle|and Patrice.
{109727}{109794}- I could be next.|- You should go.
{109795}{109890}I know too much!|I know you love me.
{109891}{109967}Don't do this. Don't do this.
{111229}{111258}Nothing's changed.
{111284}{111330}Everything's changed.
{111331}{111372}What?
{111373}{111418}You killed Medford.
{111587}{111635}Where are you going?
{112269}{112301}San Francisco DA.
{112302}{112331}All right.
{112450}{112485}No.
{112511}{112567}There's our last link to Jade.
{112568}{112607}Anyone who's ever|seen her is dead
{112608}{112663}or suffering|from penile amnesia.
{112664}{112707}Jade doesn't exist any more.
{112708}{112776}Careful. You nearly stood|on the murder weapon.
{112777}{112835}He was obviously|killed with that.
{112836}{112897}There doesn't appear|to be forced entry.
{112898}{112989}His brother came for dinner,|found the body...
{112990}{113040}The brother has a key.
{113071}{113097}He's still warm.
{113098}{113146}He's only been dead an hour.
{113147}{113193}- How long?|- An hour.
{113194}{113281}- Where's the phone?|- It's right up there.
{113306}{113353}Your friend Trina|sure gets around.
{113354}{113396}She couldn't have done this.
{113397}{113483}- Why not?|- She was with me.
{113484}{113542}Maria! Maria, it's Mr Corelli.
{113543}{113609}Yes. Is Mrs Gavin home?
{113610}{113696}No. OK. How about Mr Gavin?
{113697}{113826}OK, would you tell Mr Gavin|that I will be at my apartment?
{113827}{113866}Right. Thanks. Maria.
{113867}{113917}Where are you going?
{115969}{116023}Stop! Stop!
{116086}{116126}Stop!
{117521}{117593}Hello? Hello? Hell...
{117637}{117685}You fucked her, didn't you?
{117686}{117736}Matt, where is she?
{117737}{117795}Matt, where is she?|She's in trouble.
{120303}{120358}Maria, are you in your room?
{120599}{120647}Anybody here?
{123619}{123705}This is Katrina Gavin,|1100 Hillsborough.
{123731}{123766}No. Hillsborough.
{123767}{123827}Talking to one|of your boyfriends?
{123931}{123963}David, watch it!
{124473}{124547}You like it like this,|don't you?
{124585}{124631}Let her go!
{125501}{125527}Who's there?
{126443}{126534}It's a tragedy for justice when|law enforcement people go bad.
{126535}{126609}They were cleaning up your shit.
{126643}{126738}They were just|two loyal supporters...
{126763}{126832}Two supporters|who got carried away.
{126833}{126943}They wanted to see if she had|more pictures of the governor.
{126944}{127017}They acted on their own|out of misguided loyalty.
{127018}{127123}Kyle Medford was shaking|you down and was killed for it.
{127124}{127186}Patrice was in those pictures.|She was next,
{127187}{127238}then Henderson,|who could ID everybody.
{127239}{127289}That left Trina Gavin.
{127290}{127347}Why are you wasting|the governor's time?
{127373}{127412}Anything happens to Trina Gavin,
{127413}{127484}I have film|of you and a dead hooker.
{127643}{127703}And what if something|happens to you?
{127835}{127896}Leave her alone.
{128015}{128105}Get the fuck out of here.
{129606}{129640}Ready, darling?
{129641}{129688}We're going to be late.
{129736}{129793}Where did you get these?
{129794}{129878}Kyle Medford showed me|the day before I killed him.
{129879}{129956}You knew, and you killed him?
{129957}{129999}He was a scumbag.
{130000}{130070}He would have taken us|both down.
{130096}{130155}I told you...
{130156}{130226}I will never let|anyone hurt you.
{130300}{130371}But I don't remember any of it.
{130372}{130431}You know what I think it is?
{130432}{130492}Hysterical blindness.
{130588}{130647}Do me a favour, Trina.
{130648}{130729}Next time we make love,
{130730}{130811}you introduce me to Jade.
Where are they?
I don't know.
Dad!
Uncle Merrill!
Dad!
Morgan!
Bo? Bo?
Bo, where's Morgan?
Bo?
Are you in my dream, too?
- This is not a dr...
- Dad!
Hey...
Honey...
Morgan?
What's happening?
The dogs were barking... woke us up.
Are you hurt?
I think God did it.
Did what, Morgan?
Look, Lee, I don't even care if it was him.
And you can just have a word with him, and that'd be enough for me.
See, it was strange finding the crops that way.
The kids were confused by it, and, uh, it'd sure take the strangeness away if I knew it was just Lionel and the Wolfington brothers messing around, that's all.
At the movies?
Are you sure?
All right, then.
Uh, thanks for your patience, Lee.
Yeah. Bye.
Houdini peed.
I think he's sick.
Why don't you take him outside?
I'll call Dr. Crawford.
He doesn't treat animals.
Well, he'll know what to do.
Oh. That was quick,
Caroline.
I only called you folks two hours ago.
Old Mrs. Kendleman twisted her ankle, as she puts it, diving for her life when a bunch of school kids rode down the sidewalk on skateboards.
She went down to Thornton's store this morning and started spitting on the new skateboards.
Spitting!
By the time I got there,
Mrs. Kendleman had sprayed the whole damned place.
And she must have had a cold or something.
I'm telling you,
I won't eat for a week.
So, what happened to your crops?
Dad's gonna burn these again.
It's contaminated.
You don't even know what that word means.
It's not contaminated.
It's just tap water.
Pour it in his bowl.
It tastes funny.
It does not.
And besides, he licks his butt every day.
I don't think he'll mind.
Houdini?
Bo, don't run.
What's wrong, boy?
Stop it, Houdini.
Look at where it's bent over, Father.
It's not broken.
Now, what kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without breaking it?
Can't be by hand.
It's too perfect.
It doesn't sound much like Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers.
They can't take a piss without wetting the front of their pants.
I don't think anyone else around here has had any problems.
I was over at Theo Henry's farm yesterday afternoon, and he would have mentioned something.
Why were you at Theo's place?
Some animals around the county have been acting funny... and some of them violent.
What is it, a virus?
I don't think so, Father.
They're more edgy, you know, and alert.
It's almost like they act when they smell a predator around... peeing on themselves and everything.
Caroline... please stop calling me
"Father."
What's wrong?
I don't hear my children.
He fell on me.
He wanted to kill Bo.
Did he hurt you?
No.
I'm so sorry, Morgan.
Where were you?
Houdini's sick.
Tie Isabel up to the back of the shed, please, and make sure the knot's very tight.
What's the matter?
There's a monster outside my room.
Can I have a glass of water?
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
It tastes old.
What are you thinking about?
Why do you talk to Mom when you're by yourself?
Makes me feel better.
Does she ever answer back?
No.
She never answers me either.
What?
Lionel Prichard and the
Wolfington brothers are back.
It's time for an ass-whupping.
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Lee is a friend of mine.
This is his son.
Yeah, we'll be doing Lee a favor.
All right, listen... we both go outside, move around the house in opposite directions.
We act crazy, insane with anger... make them crap in their pants, force them around till we meet up on the other side.
Explain "act crazy."
You know, curse and stuff.
You want me to curse?
You don't mean it.
It's just for show.
What?
Well, it won't be convincing.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Just make noises, then.
Explain "noises."
Are you gonna do this or what?
No, I'm not.
All right, you want them stealing something in the house next time?
On the count of three...
- All right.
Aaah!
I'm insane with anger!
We're gonna beat your ass, bitch!
We're gonna tear your head off!
I'm losing my mind!
It's time for an ass-whupping!
I cursed.
I heard.
How did he get...
Are you sure this is Lionel Prichard?
You like that?
You got an old baby monitor around?
Bo had an old baby monitor.
You can use Bo's baby monitor as a walkie-talkie.
- You can?
- Mm-hmm.
It only works one way, but that'll do fine.
That is, until someone gets you an old walkie-talkie left over at the station.
Stop! It's hideous!
Get it off!
I-I know what to do.
Hey, Bo... turn that down till
Officer Paski leaves.
Doy-da!
You're too old to still be doing this.
You take a glass of water, and you finish it.
Now, what's wrong with this one?
It has dust in it.
This one?
A hair.
This one?
Morgan took a sip, and it has his amebas in it.
My turn.
So, how are you, Merrill?
Fine.
How is work at the gas station?
Stimulating.
I never got a chance to tell you, but I-I thought your moving in here with your brother after... it was a nice thing to do.
Well, I don't think
I'm helping much.
You are.
Sorry.
Okay, so far I have,
"It was very dark."
Yes, it was.
You can't describe him at all?
Don't you think that's kind of odd?
A little.
I don't know whether to look for a giant or a midget.
No, he definitely wasn't a midget.
Okay.
So he was tall?
I-I would say so, yes.
Probably.
Over 6 feet?
It was very dark.
Yes, it was.
How certain are you that this was a male?
Oh, I don't know...
I don't know any girls who could run like that.
I don't know, Merrill.
I've seen some of those women on the Olympics.
They can run like the wind.
This guy got on our roof in, like, a second.
O-Our roof is 10 feet high.
They have women's high jumping in the Olympics.
They got these
Scandinavian women who can jump clean over me.
Caroline, I know you're making a point here, but I just don't know what it is.
An out-of-town woman stopped by the diner yesterday afternoon and started yelling and cussing because they didn't have her favorite cigarettes at the vending machine.
She scared a couple of the customers.
No one's seen her since.
And my point is, we don't know anything about the person you saw, and we should just keep all possibilities available.
Dad, where's the remote?
I don't know, baby.
Why don't you check in the sofa cushions?
Excluding the possibility that a female Scandinavian
Olympian was running around outside our house last night, what else might be a possibility?
I'm not done asking questions, and I don't appreciate sarcasm.
Do you two have anyone who might have a grudge or something against you... maybe a-a church member who... who might not have liked the fact that you left the church?
I don't think so.
Okay, I was out of line with the whole female-
Scandinavian-Olympian thing.
It's just,
I'm pretty strong, and I'm pretty fast.
And I was running as fast as I could, and this guy, he was... he was just toying with us.
There's only food under the sofa.
Baby, why don't you just change the channel on the television?
I did.
And?
Same show's on every station.
Every station?
Bo, turn up the volume.
Crop signs first emerged in the late '70s with renewed interest in extraterrestrial life.
They died out by the early '80s, dismissed as hoaxes.
This new resurgence is wholly different.
The speed and the quantity in which it has appeared implies the coordination of hundreds of individuals over many countries.
There are only a limited number of explanations.
Either this is one of the most elaborate hoaxes ever created, or basically... it's for real.
Extraterrestrials.
What in God's name is going on?
I did some research after I saw your crops.
Two or three guys can make a design the size of the one in your field overnight using just boards and ropes.
Really?
That's how these things have been done in the past.
But there are so many now.
How could so many people be in on it?
I can't think straight.
I'm... I'm gonna go back to the station and have a cup of Edgar's coffee and... and try to think clear.
And after that, I'll...
I might make some calls.
But I'll tell you something... what I said in there, it still goes.
Your... your family has been through a lot.
And the last thing these children need to do is worry about some crazy things happening in the world.
Now, take them into town and get their minds and your mind on everyday things, hmm?
Good medicine.
That's good advice.
And you take care of yourself...
Graham.
The footage you're watching was shot yesterday afternoon by a 34-year-old local cameraman in Bangalore, a southern city of India.
It's the 18th reported crop sign found in that country in the last 72 hours.
Uncle Merrill, will you turn on the radio?
They are signs intended to be seen from the sky...
No radio either.
Just for a while.
Book money?
Sure.
Just one.
Be back for pizza in 15.
It's just a bunch of crock.
They're trying to sell sodas.
It's plain and simple.
Been watching these reports since morning.
I have seen 12 soda commercials so far...
You have any books on extraterrestrials?
Now, don't tell me you believe this horse manure.
As a matter of fact,
I think we have one.
Came by mistake in a shipment... decided to keep it for the city people.
Last row, third book on the left, honey.
Why is no one saying the obvious?
These are just copycats.
Someone somewhere does the first one...
It was asthma medicine, right, Father?
For Morgan Hess.
And it's not "Father" anymore.
In less than an hour, a couple hundred people get the same brilliant idea, and here we are, on the verge of mass hysteria.
Can I ask you a favor,
Father?
I need to clear my conscience.
Will you listen to me?
Tracey... I am not a reverend anymore.
I haven't been for six months.
You know this.
All this stuff on TV... two girls came in here talking about the end of the world...
I'm just a little scared.
Please, I need to clear my conscience.
I've got it figured.
You do?
I've had two separate folks tell me there have been strangers around these parts last couple nights.
Can't tell what they look like
'cause they're staying in the shadows... covert like.
Nobody's been hurt, mind you.
And that's the giveaway.
I see.
It's called "probing."
It's a military procedure.
You send out a reconnaissance group... very small... to check things out.
Not to engage but to evaluate the situation... evaluate the level of danger, make sure things are all clear.
Clear for what?
For the rest of them.
Yeah?
You got a pamphlet or something I can read?
Sure.
Thanks.
You didn't used to play baseball, did ya?
Shit, I know you.
You're Merrill Hess.
I was there the day you hit that 507-footer over the left-field wall... set the record.
Man, that thing had a motor on it.
It's still the record, right?
Got the bat at home o-on the wall.
You've got two minor-league home-run records, don't ya?
Five.
Why weren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting your toes licked by beautiful women?
'Cause he has another record most people don't know about.
He has the minor-league strikeout record.
Hello, Lionel.
Merrill's a class-A screw-up.
He would just swing that bat as hard as he could every time.
Didn't matter what the coaches said, didn't matter who was on base.
He would just whip that bat through the air as hard as he could.
Looked like a lumberjack chopping down a tree.
Merrill here has more strikeouts than any two players.
You really got the strikeout record?
Felt wrong not to swing.
It's contaminated.
Carl, there's something wrong with our water.
Your water's fine.
Bo has this thing about her drinking water.
She had it her whole life.
It's like a tick people have, except it's not a tick.
Is that right?
## Don't give me that so-so-soda ##
## That same old cola ##
## I wanna pop ##
- ## Pop, pop I wanna... Shasta ##
- I'll take it.
I cursed 37 times last week.
I said the "F" word a couple times, but mostly..."shits" and..."bastards."
Is "douche bag" a curse?
I suppose that would depend on its usage.
How about, "John, you're a douche bag for kissing Barbara"?
It's a curse.
Then it's not 37.
It's 71.
Pharmacy crowded?
I don't want any one of you spending time with
Tracey Abernathy alone.
Is that understood?
Is that him?
Yeah.
Who is he?
What is it?
It's Bo's baby monitor.
I found it in the basement.
I'm gonna use it as a walkie-talkie.
What if it's catching a signal from them?
It's not.
But it wasn't working.
Morgan, this crop stuff is about a bunch of nerds who never had a girlfriend in their lives.
They're, like, 30, and they work up little codes together, and they analyze Greek mythology and make up secret societies where other guys who never had girlfriends before can join in.
They do stupid crap like this to feel special.
It's a scam.
Nerds were doing it
25 years ago, and new nerds are doing it again.
It's just static, Morgan, all right.
Turn it up. See.
It's a code.
Why can't they get girlfriends?
Can I see that, please?
It's noise.
It's broken, Morgan.
It's just gonna keep doing this.
Maybe some new batteries...
We might lose the signal.
This is exactly what the nerds want.
I'm getting out now.
Nobody move.
Voices.
Did you hear that?
Not English, though.
You heard the voices, right, Uncle Merrill?
I heard them, Morgan.
Probably picking up another baby monitor.
That's right.
Let me see it.
Stop!
See, this is why we're not watching TV.
People get obsessed.
I'm letting go now.
No, Dad!
Don't do it!
You'll lose the signal.
Don't let go.
It gets clearer the higher you hold it.
I got it.
Bo, honey, I don't want you climbing on the car.
Come here.
Stop!
There's two of them talking.
Isabel, you're gonna feel very silly when this turns out to be all just make-believe.
You're wasting your time here!
I'm not gonna report this or anything you do to my crops to the news or TV or anybody!
You're not going to get famous!
Okay.
Let's turn on the TV.
It first appeared
52 minutes ago.
Mexico City officials as well as U. S. Officials have confirmed that these are not aircraft from either government's air force.
The first sighting was made by an Air Mexico 747 en route from Mazatlán to New York as the unidentified crafts entered Mexico City air space.
They were not detected by radar by either country.
The nerds were right.
We have to tape this.
My ballet recital.
Listen, Bo, this is very important.
Everything people have written about in science books is going to change.
The history of the world's future is on the TV right now.
We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there.
For your children, Bo.
My ballet recital.
Dad!
Find another tape.
Uncle Merrill,
I'm using your tape.
You are seeing a live feed from our affiliate down here in Mexico City.
This image has not been adjusted or enhanced in any way.
What you're seeing is real.
It's unbelievable.
Everything they wrote in science books is about to change.
I told you.
Some people are probably thinking this is the end of the world.
That's true.
Do you think it could be?
Yes.
How can you say that?
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
Couldn't you pretend to be like you used to be?
Give me some comfort.
People break down into two groups when they experience something lucky.
Group number one sees it as more than luck, more than coincidence.
They see it as a sign... evidence that there is someone up there watching out for them.
Group number two sees it as just pure luck, a happy turn of chance.
I'm sure the people in group number two are looking at those 14 lights in a very suspicious way.
For them, the situation isn't 50-50.
Could be bad, could be good.
But deep down, they feel that whatever happens, they're on their own.
And that fills them with fear.
Yeah, there are those people.
But there's a whole lot of people in the group number one.
When they see those 14 lights, they're looking at a miracle.
And deep down, they feel that whatever's going to happen, there'll be someone there to help them.
And that fills them with hope.
See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person are you?
Are you the kind who sees signs, sees miracles?
Or do you believe that people just get lucky?
Or look at the question this way... is it possible that there are no coincidences?
I was at this party once.
I'm on the couch with Randa McKinney.
She was just sitting there looking beautiful, staring at me.
I go to lean in and kiss her... and I realize
I have gum in my mouth.
So I turn, take out the gum, stuff it in a paper cup next to the sofa, and turn around.
Randa McKinney throws up all over herself.
I knew the second it happened it was a miracle.
I could have been kissing her when she threw up.
That would have scarred me for life.
I may never have recovered.
I'm a miracle man.
Those lights are a miracle.
There you go.
So, which type are you?
Do you feel comforted?
Yeah, I do.
Then what does it matter?
I never told you the last words that Colleen said before they let her die.
She said, "See."
Then her eyes glazed a bit.
And then she said,
"Swing away."
You know why she said that?
Because the nerve endings in her brain were firing as she died, and some random memory of us at one of your baseball games just popped into her head.
There is no one watching out for us, Merrill.
We are all on our own.
What do you know?
Well, there was an accident... drunk driving, they weren't sure...
He wasn't drunk.
Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
- Is he okay?
- Yeah.
That was the first thing
Colleen asked, too.
She's talking.
What ambulance is she in?
She's not in an ambulance,
Father.
For the kids' protection.
All they were doing was watching TV from 5:00 a.m.
I felt like they were getting obsessed, like you said.
They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something.
What's furry, furry rabbit?
It's a game, isn't it?
Anyways, they closed the schools.
And there's been some interesting developments.
What time is it?
They're gone, but they're not really gone.
We just can't see them.
Early this morning, a bird flew into the area where the lights were hovering last night.
It stopped dead in the air and fell straight down.
They caught it on tape.
They've been playing it all morning.
The footage looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.
They found the bird. His... his head was crushed in.
They think they have some kind of invisible-shield thing going, l-like an optical illusion.
They're still there, hovering.
Some people think there's more of them now...
All over the place, over us, even.
There's a theory about the c... the crop circles.
They could be some kind of... some kind of landmark, visual mapping system so they could navigate, coordinate... makes sense.
Want to hear a story?
Is it true?
So the aliens can't read our minds.
Oh.
Oh, of course.
They tell you everything in this book.
It says they're probably very small, like my height, because as their brains develop, there was no use for physical development.
It also says they're probably vegetarians because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
Who wrote this book?
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
That means they're unemployed.
If you're gonna make fun of it, then forget it.
This is serious.
I don't know what got into me.
There are pictures.
Dr. Bimbu, one of the authors of the book...
- Bimbu?
- Dad.
I just asked his name.
You had a tone.
He said there are two reasons why extraterrestrials would visit us... to make contact in the spirit of exploration and furthering the knowledge of the universe, or the other reason... they're hostile.
They've used up all the resources on their planet, and they're looking to harvest our planet next.
Here.
Looks a little like our house, doesn't it?
Same windows.
That's weird.
Yeah, oh, yeah.
That's enough from
Dr. Bimbu for now.
Everybody in this house needs to calm down and eat some fruit or something.
Hello?
Father?
Hello?
Hello?!
I'm going out for a few minutes.
No one leaves this house... no one.
Where you going?
Ray Reddy's house.
Why?
I think he just called here.
You don't think something bad will happen, do you, Morgan?
Why? You have one of your feelings again?
Is it bad?
I won't let anything bad happen to you.
I don't want you to die.
Who said I was gonna die?
Who said I was gonna die?
Hello, Ray.
What happened?
I wrote your number down to call you.
It's been sitting next to the phone for 6 months.
When I knew it was inside the house...
I couldn't think of any other number to call.
I panicked.
Thank you for coming,
Father.
You're welcome, Ray.
I worked so long that night.
I've never fallen asleep driving before... never since.
Don't.
Most of the ride home, there wasn't a car in sight in either direction.
If I'd have fallen asleep then,
I would have ended up in a ditch with a headache.
And it had to be at that right moment... that 10, 15 seconds when
I passed her walking.
It was like it was meant to be.
I guess if this is the end of the world,
I'm screwed, right?
People who kill reverends' wives aren't exactly ushered to the front of the line in Heaven.
Wh... Where are you going, Ray?
To the lake.
The way I see it... these places marked in crops and such... none of them are really near water.
I don't think they like water.
Can't be any worse than here.
Did you see something, Ray?
I know what I've done to you.
I made you question your faith.
I'm truly sorry for what
I've done to you and yours.
All right.
And don't open my pantry, Father.
I found one of them in there and locked him in.
The startling footage we're about to show you was photographed by a
42-year-old, Romero Valadarez.
This video was taken yesterday afternoon at his son's 7th birthday in the city of
Passo Fundo, Brazil.
It was sent to the local news bureau there and sent to us via satellite just a few minutes ago.
All initial opinions are this is genuine.
What you're about to see may disturb you.
Move, children!
Vámanos!
Oh!
Hello?
The police are here.
I am with them.
I am a police officer.
I just want to talk with you.
We know all about the hoax.
We already took some of your friends downtown in a paddy wagon.
Just tell us your name and why you did it, and we'll give you the same deal we gave the others.
Don't throw your life away, son.
Oh! Ah!
Oh!
Their skin changes colors.
That's why we couldn't see them that night.
Tell me something, Morgan.
Uh... in this book of yours... did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
Yes.
It said they would probably invade.
They would use ground tactics... hand-to-hand combat.
They wouldn't use our technology or fight an airborne battle
'cause they know eventually we would use nuclear weapons.
Then the planet would be useless to them.
How could anyone possibly know that information?
It's ridiculous.
What else did it say?
They said there are one of two outcomes of an invasion.
One, they fight and are defeated and have to return again with full forces hundreds, maybe even thousands, of years later.
What's two?
They win.
I'm sorry, what... what book is this?
Is this really happening?
I heard a theory that, uh, they don't like places near water.
Maybe we'd be safe from them near a lake or something.
Sounds made-up.
I saw one of them at Ray Reddy's house.
I can't be sure, but I got the distinct feeling he wanted to harm me.
So... we can choose to believe this lake idea, pack up, and go, or we can stay here, hide inside our home, wait it out.
We might be overreacting, but
I'm willing to live with that.
Either way, at least we'll be together.
All those in favor of the lake idea, raise your hand.
Yeah.
All those in favor of home, raise your hand.
Okay.
My vote counts as two.
That's bullshit!
You're cheating!
Morgan, calm down.
I get two votes because
I represent two parents here.
We don't know anything yet.
We'll be safe here anyway.
I don't want to leave home.
This is where we lived with Mom.
That's got nothing to do with this.
I change my vote.
You can't change your vote.
All those in favor of home, raise your hand.
This is ridiculous.
You lose, 3-2.
We're going to board up every window in this house.
How do we know boards will do anything?
Because they seem to have trouble with pantry doors.
The information we're receiving comes from our affiliates across the world.
Dad, Uncle Merrill!
Amman joins Nairobi,
Beijing, and Jerusalem as the latest to confirm the appearance of lights.
There are lights in over 274 cities.
They think it'll be
400 within the hour.
They're appearing at or within one mile of crop signs.
They were for navigation.
They made a map.
They're gonna be within a mile of us.
Dad?
Yes?
They think these are staged immediately preceding an attack maneuver.
I was wrong.
They're hostile.
It's like "War of the Worlds."
Ground forces have been assembled in countries throughout the globe.
Hundreds of thousands have flocked to temples, synagogues, and churches.
God be with us all.
I'm going to get back to the windows.
Hey, you guys okay?
Some guy had a sign saying it was the end of the world.
Don't worry.
You won't let anything happen to us, right?
No way.
I wish you were my dad.
What did you say?
Don't you ever say anything like that again.
Ever.
There's too many windows in the bedrooms.
We don't have enough boards.
We'll board up the bedroom doors.
Where are we gonna sleep?
In the family room.
What about Isabel?
We'll tie her up in the garage after dinner.
I'll make some sandwiches.
I want spaghetti.
We'll just eat fast, Bo.
Spaghetti sounds great.
What do you want, Morgan?
Anything?
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
Now we're talking.
How about you, Merrill?
Chicken teriyaki.
Good choice.
I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.
Extra bacon.
What's the matter with everyone? Eat.
Maybe we should say a prayer.
No.
Why not?
We're not saying a prayer.
Bo has a bad feeling.
I had a dream.
We aren't saying a prayer.
Eat!
I hate you.
That's fine.
You let Mom die.
Morgan.
I am not wasting one more minute of my life on prayer.
Not one more minute.
Understood?
Now we are going to enjoy this meal.
No one can stop us from enjoying this meal, so enjoy it!
Stop crying!
- Graham...
- Don't yell at her!
All right, since you're all not gonna eat.
I'm gonna try some of everything.
It's happening.
Graham, hurry.
Did I ever tell you what everyone said when you were born, Bo?
You came out of your mama, and you didn't even cry.
You just opened your eyes, and you looked around the room at everybody.
Your eyes were so big and gorgeous.
All the ladies in the room just gasped.
I mean, they literally gasped.
And they go,
"Oh, she's like an angel."
And they said, "We've never seen a baby so beautiful."
And then... you know what happened?
They put you on the table to clean you up, and you looked up at me and you smiled.
They say babies that young can't smile.
You smiled.
Let's go down now.
We forgot Isabel.
Should we turn off the lights?
They already know we're here.
Dad...
Do you know what happened when you were born, Morgan?
You came out, and your mama kept bleeding, so the doctors rushed you out of the room before I even had time to see you.
They're on the roof.
While they were fixing her up, all she kept asking about was you.
They're in the house.
I wanted your mama to see you first because she had dreamed about you her whole life.
Then she got feeling better, they brought you in, and they placed you in her arms, and she looked at you, and you looked at her, and you just stared at each other for the longest time.
And then she said real soft,
"Hello, Morgan.
I'm your mama.
You look just how I dreamed."
The attic door.
Let's go.
Come on.
We forgot our foil helmets.
Have we got anything to wedge against the door knob?
They'll read our minds.
You're scaring your sister.
I'm already scared.
Merrill.
I'm looking!
They'll know our secret thoughts.
I'm not ready.
Merrill!
Got it!
Dad!
Where's Bo?
I'm okay.
What's happening out there?
I can't even imagine.
I hope they're doing better than we are.
We don't even have helmets.
They're only making noises.
They're not trying to get in.
Why would they do that?
They want our attention on the door?
They're distracting us.
From what?
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
They'll find a way in.
Morgan, give me your flashlight.
They used to pour coal down in this basement.
There's a coal chute in here.
I can feel air.
Me too!
It's getting stronger.
I'm close.
What?
Hold him!
I got him!
Hold him!
I got him!
Hold him!
We don't have his medicine.
Don't be afraid, Morgan.
We'll slow this down together.
Feel my chest.
Feel it moving in and out.
Breathe like me.
Breathe like me.
Come on.
I dreamed this.
Stay with me.
I know it hurts.
Be strong, baby.
It'll pass.
It'll pass.
Don't do this to me again.
Not again.
I hate you.
I hate you.
The fear is feeding him.
Don't be afraid of what's happening.
Believe it's going to pass.
Believe it.
Just wait.
Don't be afraid.
The air is coming.
Believe.
We don't have to be afraid.
It's about to pass.
Here it comes.
Don't be afraid.
Here comes the air.
Don't be afraid, Morgan.
Feel my chest.
Breathe with me.
Together. The air is going in our lungs.
Together.
We're the same.
We're the same.
We should save the flashlights.
Ray's truck swerved off the road and hit Colleen and then a tree, and she was pinned between the two.
What does that mean... pinned?
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
What did you say?
She won't be saved.
Her body is pinned in such a way that it's alive when it shouldn't be alive, and the truck is holding her together.
And she doesn't feel much, and she's... she's talking almost like normal, and we didn't pull the truck out
'cause we... we wanted you to come down here and be with her as long as she's awake.
And that won't be very long.
Now, Father, do you understand what I've told you?
Caroline... is this the last time I'm gonna talk with my wife?
Yes, it is.
People think they came here to take over the planet.
That's bull.
I don't think that.
My friend and I saw them.
I found a pack of light bulbs.
They poisoned his family.
They dragged them away.
Nobody believes it, but they didn't come here for our planet.
This is a raid.
They came here for us, to harvest us.
We're lucky as hell they're leaving here.
They're leaving?
That's what they're saying.
How long have we been sleeping?
12 hours or so.
He said they had poison gas... they secrete in small amounts.
A lot of people died.
But they're leaving.
They left real fast this morning, like something scared them off.
They left some of their wounded behind.
Why are they going?
People must have figured out a way to beat them.
Everyone has a weakness, right?
You didn't think we'd make it through the night, did you?
No.
Listen... there's things I can take and a couple things I can't.
One of them I can't take is when my older brother, who's everything
I want to be... starts losing faith in things.
I saw your eyes last night.
I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again.
Okay? I'm serious.
Okay.
He's been like that for a while.
He needs his medicine.
Have they said anything about our area?
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared... but who knows for sure?
He's not strong enough.
If he has another attack right now...
I know.
We'd have to be sure before we opened up that door, Graham.
It's good enough for me.
Me too.
Get the syringes' well.
We may need to give him an epinephrine shot.
The atmosphere here is cautiously optimistic.
- People are celebrating.
- They're doing this on TV.
There's a great sense of relief.
- They're dancing.
- Yeah, like this.
As we begin evaluating the loss of life,
- Do you want to see it?
- We will be left with a lot of questions.
- I'll bring the TV in here.
- I see the same expression on every face.
We know the battle turned around in the Middle East.
Three small cities there found a primitive method to defeat them.
We have no further details at this time.
Merrill, wait.
Hi, sweetie.
Hi, baby.
I was... just taking a walk before dinner.
You love walks.
It was meant to be.
Does it hurt?
I don't feel much.
Good.
Tell Morgan... to play games.
It's okay to be silly.
I will.
Tell Bo to listen to her brother.
He'll always take care of her.
I will.
And tell Graham...
I'm here.
Tell him... see.
Tell him to see.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person are you?
Are you the kind that sees signs, sees miracles?
Or do you believe that people just get lucky?
Is it possible... there are no coincidences?
Swing away, Merrill.
Merrill... swing away.
That's why he had asthma.
It can't be luck.
His lungs were closed.
His lungs were closed.
No poison got in.
No poison got in.
His lungs were closed.
His lungs were closed.
Don't touch him.
Give him a minute.
Graham...
Give him a second.
D-Daddy...
Don't touch him.
Graham...
Don't... don't.
Dad?
What happened?
Did someone save me?
Yeah, baby,
I think someone did.
-Package for Robert Garfield.
-Yeah.
-Sign here.
-Thanks.
Whenever it wants, the past can come kicking the door down.
And you never know where it's gonna take you.
All you can do is hope it's a place you wanna go.
You've reached the Garfield family.
Jill and the boys are away.
You can reach them on their cells.
I'll be on the road for a few days.
Be back Tuesday.
On behalf of the president of the United States...
...l present this flag...
...for the honorable service rendered...
...by your husband,
Major John Sullivan.
-Hey, Sully!
-Hey!
Bobby, I decided what I wanna be.
A magician.
-I'll pull rabbits out of a hat.
-Rabbits will shit in your hat.
But I'd be a cool bastard.
Admit it.
There's cake at the Veterans Hall.
Of course you're all welcome.
-Mr. Garfield.
-Mr. Oliver.
-Thanks for sending the glove.
-Been Sully's lawyer forever.
Couldn't see why a baseball glove had to go through probate.
-You and Sully were kids together?
-Yeah, there were three of us.
Me and Sully, and a girl named Carol.
-Carol Gerber?
-That's right.
I'm hoping she'll be here.
You didn't hear about Carol?
No.
I'm afraid she's dead.
I'm so sorry.
This street is where it all happened.
It's not much now.
Why do we always expect home will stay the same?
Nothing else does.
It's funny how when you're a kid, a day can last forever.
Now, all these years seemjust like a blink.
Bobby? Bobby-o?
Time to get a wiggle on.
Wake up, Bobby.
Hey, wait for me!
Come on, Johnny.
Happy birthday, Mr. Eleven. Ta-da!
Oh, wow. Library card.
A grownup's library card, if you please.
Thanks, Mom.
-Is--?
-Don't.
Don't you think I wanted to get you a bike? I can't afford it.
Iknow how that makes me feel?
Your father didn't leave us well-off.
He did leave us three months' unpaid rent...
...a life insurance policy that lapsed before he died.
He left a rather large stack of unpaid bills...
...which I managed to take care of.
People understand our situation.
Mr. Biderman is a good example...
...but it has not been easy.
Do you get that?
Your father never met an inside straight he didn't like.
-What's an inside straight?
-Never you mind, Bobby-o.
Don't let me catch you playing cards.
I've had enough of that.
Come on, then.
That must be the new upstairs apartment tenant.
I don't trust people who move their things in paper bags. It's slutty.
-He has suitcases.
-Yes, but they don't match, do they?
Oh, hello, folks. I'm Ted Brautigan.
I'll be living upstairs.
I'm Elizabeth Garfield.
This is my son, Robert.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Brattigan.
Tempus fugit.
It's Brautigan, but Ted is fine with me.
It's nice to meet you.
I hope you like it here.
Thank you, Robert.
Birthday boy!
Carol, it's hard enough being friends without that.
You loved it. Here.
-Is this gonna be gushy?
-I don't know.
Better not be.
Whoa.
-Just like it.
-Yeah, that's great.
-Thanks.
-Sure.
-Didn't get the bike, did you?
-No big deal. Mom can't afford it.
She buys new dresses.
She has to look nice for the office.
Are you coming?
-Yeah.
-Come on.
-Hey, Sully!
-Hey!
-Get the bike?
-No.
Well, I got nothing for you.
But happy birthday!
Hang on! Wait for me!
-What's an inside straight?
-Something to do with gambling.
Poker. You draw a middle card.
It's dumb, strictly for suckers.
This neighborhood is getting terribly run-down.
I think I'll have to move.
-Yeah?
-Is that how we answer the phone?
Hi, Mom. I'm sorry. I was just excited about dinner and all.
Mr. Biderman has to work late and needs me to do the same.
So birthday dinner at the Colony is off.
Okay, Mom.
There are leftovers.
I'll be home to tuck you in.
Oh, make sure to turn off the gas ring...
... when you're done with the stove.
-I know.
-See you soon.
Evening, Robert.
Or should I say Bobby?
Oh, Mr. Brautigan. Hi.
It's Ted.
Sorry. Ted'll be hard for me, but I'll try.
You going out later?
I was supposed to have a birthday dinner.
Mom had to stay at work, even though she didn't want to.
Are you a rich man then...
...from your birthday gifts?
A library card?
No, an adult library card. Oh, my.
All the master storytellers waiting for you.
You know why she picked it?
Because it was free.
That doesn't matter.
Don't you give up on this card.
Because books can be solid gold.
The great ones have gotten us through the nights for centuries.
Give a writer an hour to hook you.
If he can't, find someone else.
Think you can try that?
If I don't have anything else to do.
Fair enough. Don't be afraid.
A Tale of Two Cities ends with a beheading, great stuff.
Lost Horizon, magic and places unknown. Can't beat that.
Where'd you live before you came here, Mr--? Ted?
Some other place that wasn't as nice as this.
You l¡ved here long?
Yes, sir. Since my dad died.
-When was that sad day?
-When I was 5.
Six years, huh?
You must know everything happening on this street.
Sure do. Because nothing happens on this street.
-Six years.
-That's just a blink.
Someday you'll agree.
You know, Ben Jonson called time the ''old bald cheater.''
What?
Ben Jonson called time the ''old bald cheater.''
I like that.
I think I do too. Who's Ben Jonson?
He's an English writer, dead these many years.
Brilliant, but foolish about money.
And given to flatulence.
What's flatulence?
Yeah, kids always think farts are funny.
Might have a job for you.
Have to think about it first.
Really?
Yeah. If it works out, you might get that bike.
How'd you know I wanted a bike?
All kids want bikes.
Hey, Mom. I took another look at that bike.
It's a Phantom, 26-incher. Real swell.
No, perfect. Perfect is more like it.
Start saving those pennies.
Ted? It's me.
Hi, kid. Come in.
Thanks for making the skyward journey.
An icy root beer awaits you as reward.
Colder, the better.
One feels them first at the back of one's eyes.
Feels what?
One feels them first at the back of one's eyes.
Yeah.
Hey, I did like you said.
-What?
-I gave him a couple of hours.
Oh, yeah. Lost Horizon.
What do you think?
Better than the Hardy Boys.
Yeah, sure is.
Tell me, Bobby, how'd you like to make a dollar a week?
Would I ever?!
Well, my eyes are beginning to fail me...
...and if you will read me the Harwich Journal every day...
...headline stuff, sports, comics, want ads...
...l'll give you said dollar.
What do you say?
What else?
What do you mean?
There's got to be more to it than that.
Yeah, there is.
So, what's the real job?
IKeep your eyes open.
-For what?
-Low men.
That's right, Bobby.
I use the term ''low'' in the Dickensian sense...
...meaning dangerous. Men who stop at nothing to get what they want.
Your real job will simply be...
...to walk around the area...
...and if you see them or find evidence on them...
...you'll alert me immediately.
Okay. And why are they hot on your trail?
A certain something I have.
Let's leave it at that.
What do they look like?
Well, they wear dark clothes, dark hats.
They're kind of anonymous...
...but you can recognize their cars...
...loud and flashy.
When they move, they move in packs...
...like animals closing in on the kill.
And they cast long shadows.
Oh, what a world.
They're not cops, are they?
Or secret agents?
Are you asking me if I'm a bad guy or a commie spy?
I've scamped my share of fines...
...and if there were library police...
...l'd be one of their
10 most wanted.
But I never robbed a bank or stole a military secret.
So who are they?
They're thugs, relentless...
...when they're after something.
-Like this something you have?
-That's right.
And what they want is me, back under their control.
Look out. When they're closing in...
...they leave strange signs in code...
...in obvious places like telephone poles...
...posters and notices for lost pets and lost dogs.
If I knew what they'd do, they'd never catch me.
-What do I do if I see them?
-Run and tell me what you've seen.
I asked if you knew what was going on around here.
-Sure.
-That's why you're my man, kiddo.
Don't worry,
I won't let the bogeyman get you.
-Bobby?
-She can't know what you're thinking.
You think she can, and that's a mother's power.
Mrs. Garfield.
Well, it's very cozy in here.
Mom, Ted-- I mean, Mr. Brautigan...
...he's gonna pay me a dollar a week to read him the paper.
Well, that's very generous.
Do you always have boys read to you,
Mr. Brattigan?
It's Brautigan, ma'am.
And, yes, I need someone to do it.
My eyes aren't what they used to be.
And what did you do before that?
I worked up north. Various places.
Well, come along, Bobby.
Time and tide wait for no man.
-Bye, Mr. Brautigan.
-Bobby.
Mom, guess what Mr. Brautigan--
-Something doesn't make sense.
-What?
Why would a man his age wanna spend time with a kid?
I don't know.
I do know that he said
I must be some lucky kid...
...to have a mom who'd let me...
...have a grownup library card for my birthday.
I don't know. I trust him...
...about as far as I could sling a piano.
That's right, spoil it for me.
You never want me to get that bike.
I do, and I wish I could've gotten it for you.
But your father didn't exactly leave us well-off.
It's only reading.
All right, what's the harm?
Yes, yes, yes!
But only on the porch, mind, in the fresh air.
Okay.
-Bye, Bobby.
-Bye, Carol.
Sorry I'm late. I forgot the time.
That's all right.
We're all time's captives, hostages to eternity.
Ben Jonson?
No, Boris Pasternak.
He was a Russian of no account, I think.
What's going on in the world?
Something scurrilous.
''Vice President Richard M. Nixon...
...after having won the Republican nomination...
...on the first ballot, confers with Henry Cabot Lodge--''
-We're going for ice cream.
-Can't. Earning my daily bread.
-Afternoon, Mrs. Gerber. Carol.
-Hi, Ted.
I never, ever saw a girl as special as Carol Gerber.
There's millions.
Oh, yeah?
-Have you kissed her yet?
-Yuck!
-Well, you will, I promise you.
-Stay away.
You will. It will be the kiss by which all others...
...in your life will be judged, and found wanting.
Are you done?
Yeah. Come on, read to me. Go on.
-Come back here and do your job.
-Okay.
But you will kiss her.
Oh, my God!
Nice going.
Get in! Get in, Bobby!
Come on. Come on, Sully.
Sully!
''FBI announces new measures to combat Red infiltrators.''
-Hey, Bobby.
-Yeah?
Tell me what Dale Arden's wearing in Flash Gordon.
What is it with you and her?
When I was younger I thought she was a real hotsie-totsie.
Okay, before comics, we've got sports, baseball.
''Maury Wills on the way to break Ty Cobb's record.''
I saw Cobb.
My dad saw Babe Ruth.
He saw him point for the home run.
Against the Cubs.
He told me all about it.
He tell you of Nagurski's comeback game?
I know he saw it, though.
Were you there?
-Yeah.
-You and Dad were at the same place.
You know about Nagurski?
He was my dad's hero, that's all.
The greatest football player ever.
He came to Chicago...
...played eight years to make the Bears champions.
Then he retired.
When he was old, six years retired...
...the Bears brought him back.
Last game of the season, they played...
...the Cardinals, sworn enemies.
The Bears had to beat the Cardinals to win.
Nagurski wasn't supposed to play.
Third-string fullback.
In the first half the starter went down.
-The second half there was a pileup.
-Oh, no.
If your dad was here he'd say he was frightened.
-He was just so scared.
-But why? Nagurski was in the game.
I was scared too. We all were.
We wanted a miracle, you see, Bobby.
We wanted him the way he was, the old Nagurski.
We wanted him the way he was in the old days.
Did he do good?
I don't wanna hear this if he didn't.
The quarterback gave him the ball...
...and Nagurski ran slowly up to the line...
...and the Cardinals crushed him.
But somehow...
...somehow, he gained a few yards.
Next play, the same.
They just kept giving the ball to the old man...
...and the Bears began to move down the field, five yards, seven more.
If he could score for us, we'd be champions again.
Go on, Ted! You can't stop!
Ted!
Come on. I gotta know what happened.
Come on.
You know what your dad did then?
No, what did my father do?
We were all screaming. We couldn't believe what was happening.
My God, what was it? Go on.
It was our miracle, you see, because he was crawling.
Bronko Nagurski was crawling toward the goal line...
...and they did everything they could to stop him.
But nothing could stop him.
Yeah, that's right, Bobby.
Not on that day.
Not when your dad and I saw the miracle...
...when the old man brought us home.
He scored. He scored for us.
We were champions again.
I just knew he would.
Then he was gone again, back to the North where he came from.
Bronko Nagurski.
Bobby? Bobby-o!
-Ted?
-Yeah?
Well, I know the low men don't exist...
...but if they started driving around here...
...and the signs started appearing on the poles....
Well, we both know that couldn't happen.
But if it did...
...would you have to go away?
It wouldn't be safe for me here.
And wishing cannot make it so.
Bobby!
Bobby? This Ted of yours...
...did he say where he's from?
Someplace not as nice as here,
I think.
Well, that doesn't tell us much, does it?
-Anything else?
-Nope.
Bobby?
-Does he...?
-What?
Nothing.
You'll tell me if anything unusual happens?
Hello?
Hi.
You promised.
I really need the--
Who was that?
Nothing, honey.
Just a wrong number.
Son of a bitch!
-I know it's you!
-Your mom says she's almost ready.
-Think Ted would come?
-To the fair?
-Don't you think we should ask?
-I guess.
-You do it. I'll get Sully.
-Okay.
-Do you like being beaten by a girl?
-Hey, no fair.
-Mr. Biderman needs me to go in.
-On Saturday?
-Some people have to work for money.
-Mom, you promised.
These are just IKools.
Read the advertising:
''IKools. They cool the throat.''
They're hardly cigarettes at all.
-Mom?
-What?
Can I have money for the rides?
You never stop, do you?
Aren't you earning money now?
For the bike.
If you want to spend it on rides with your girlfriend, that's your business.
Ted? It's me.
You wanna come to the fair?
Ted?
Is everything okay?
Ted, wake up.
Ted, you have to help me.
Ted, I don't know what to do.
They draw west now.
Who? Jesus, Ted, please.
They draw west now, but they may be back.
Ted, please.
You can't die on me.
Please....
Oh, my God.
What just happened?
Went off again, did l?
-You mean, like at the fridge?
-Yeah.
No, way worse.
I thought you were having a fit.
It's all right.
If it happens again, don't touch me.
Nobody should touch me, that's all.
Sorry.
-Is it safe to leave you alone?
-Yeah.
It's okay.
Okay.
Mrs. Gerber's taking us to the fair.
Carol and I thought you might like to come.
Thank you, Bobby, but I think just now, it's not wise.
-Okay.
-Okay.
The cigarettes are on the table.
Thanks, kiddo.
What's so funny?
You run along now. Enjoy yourself.
Don't fall out of anything.
Yes! That one.
No!
Yes!
What are you gonna name it?
All right. Step right up!
Hey, who feels lucky?
Find the queen of hearts and win.
-It already happened!
-Just once.
Easy peas-y Japanese-y.
Just find the queen of hearts.
-Put down your bet. I'll do it again.
-A quarter.
See, a jack.
We got the king and we got the queen.
Tell me where she lands.
-Fortune awaits you.
-That one there.
-Yes!
-Genius.
-I told you!
-Wait. Double and add a half-dollar.
Okay.
That one there.
-Heartbreak.
-That's enough. I have to stop.
-I can spot his moves.
-I better give up then.
-Just a quarter.
-One, okay.
Up and down, all around.
In and out, all about.
Now they're back...
...side by side.
Tell me, mister.
Where's she hide?
It's on the right.
No. It's the one on the left.
Right there.
-Okay, enough.
-There she is.
-Bobby was right.
-A prodigy, huh?
-Why don't you win it back?
-I could, but I can't play for money.
A boast-y boy.
Says he can win, but afraid to back it up.
I could have my money back.
Come on. Beat him.
-I can't. Your mother won't be happy.
-Beat him, come on.
My mom's never happy.
It's all I got.
This is the move that stunned the sheik of Araby. Behold.
This one here, in the middle.
-All right!
-That's it!
A lucky guess.
Double your bet.
That way we all go home happy.
Fine.
This one is five years of my life.
This one here.
Nobody ever beat that shuffle.
Well, mister, is it or isn't it?
-Yes, that's it! Okay.
-All right!
-It was a fluke.
-You bet ¡t was a fluke.
Now beat it, kid.
Okay, gang, let's go. That's enough.
Come on, Bobby.
Step right up!
We had a winner!
It's easy as can be.
Easy peas-y Japanese-y!
Yes, yes.
Don't be afraid.
When we swung out, I was afraid we would fall to our doom.
We're as safe as can be.
What do you think you're doing?
Well, I thought you wanted me to.
I just wasn't ready, that's all.
Okay.
-Bobby, do it again.
-I better not. You'll tell.
No, it'll be our secret.
Hurry, before we go down.
Bobby, I'm dying here.
Thank you.
That was the nicest thing.
It'll be the kiss by which all others will be judged.
What?
Sounded better when Ted said it.
You knew, didn't you, where the queen of hearts was.
I could tell what was going on in his head.
Every thought he had, I knew, and he couldn't fool me.
Can you tell what's in Sully's head?
Sully's head's always empty.
Oh, yeah? Maybe I'm thinking of getting a new glove.
You are?
Well, what about that one?
-Want it?
-Are you kidding? I love it!
-Then, Bobby, it's yours.
-It is?
I'll leave it to you in my will.
-Sully, you just love doing that!
-I got you again.
You know, when you're young...
...you have moments of such happiness...
...you think you're living in someplace magical...
...like Atlantis must have been.
-Carol, I owe you $75. It's your turn.
-Okay.
-Here, give me $25 back.
-Twenty-five.
-Here. $22.
-Okay. Wait, no!
-No! Hold on.
-Oh, yeah. No.
Then we grow up...
...and our hearts break in two.
-Yes! I own it!
-Wait, no!
-What? No, I do.
-No! He does.
-Come on.
-Hang on.
What is it?
I wonder what it means?
It means somebody lost their pet, goofball. Come on.
Yeah, but maybe it's a secret code.
What are you talking about?
-Fairy. I'll take that!
-I'm not a fairy!
-Don't talk to them!
-How are your tits?
-Go away!
-Grow up, Harry Doolin!
The Lone Ranger.
-Hi-ho, Silver!
-Bobby, how was school?
-Good.
-You'll never guess.
Don-- Mr. Biderman has invited me to a seminar...
...on the weekend.
''Real Estate in the '60s.''
Mr. Cushman and Mr. Dean are going, but I was amazed he asked me.
Bobby?
I so want to be an agent.
This is a big chance for me.
Great, when is it?
Friday. Just for two nights.
-You can't go to your girlfriend's.
-She's not my girl--
Whatever. You can't stay there...
...so I'm gonna ask
Sully's mother to put you up.
That won't work.
But it has to.
They're gonna visit his grandma.
Just my luck.
Just my rotten luck.
Why don't you ask your friend to come down for a cup of tea?
Okay.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Garfield, but no.
I wouldn't be much of a babysitter for Bobby.
But I've never been invited to a real seminar before.
You could sleep on the couch, and you could go to the diner...
...and maybe even take in a movie.
I'll tell you what.
If Bobby wants me to, I will.
Bobby?
How come you get to have all the fun?
Don't you want me to better myself?
Yeah, but what about me?
I never get what I want.
Who knows?
Maybe I'll get a raise after this.
Who knows what I can afford then?
I guess, if it's only a weekend.
-Thank you.
-Good.
-Have you ever heard of privacy?
-Sorry.
Wait, you can't just leave.
-What do I do, then?
-Tell me, how do I look?
You look like my mom.
The dress!
Wow!
Be an angel.
-Guess it must have cost a ton.
-Don't you start on that.
''And in this reporter's opinion...
...the Haywood-Albini fight could tarnish a sterling record.''
I'd back Hollywood Haywood any day.
Ted, you listening?
Their senses grow keener.
Hey, kiddo, you're too young to smoke.
So how long this time?
Breaking records left and right.
Well, they're coming closer.
They're doing a good job of hiding from me.
-Haven't seen a single thing yet.
-Good.
I've been wrong before.
So go on about the fight.
Okay. So this old guy, Albini...?
He's gonna take on Hollywood Haywood tomorrow in New York.
-Sounds like Albini's gonna get beat.
-It sure does.
Well, I might place a bet.
We may go into town after your mother leaves.
Get a bite to eat.
See a movie.
Ever hear of Village of the Damned?.
It's about evil, little kids taken over by alien forces.
There you go.
What's up?
Oh, no, your bike.
Stay right there, Bobby.
Thank you.
Hey, Gerber Baby!
-Still with your fairy?
-Yeah.
Come on, let's go home.
-Where you going?
-This isn't funny!
It's a riot, Gerber Baby.
Hey, lay off her!
Hey, the little guy's a hero.
Stop me, fairy.
Be a man.
I asked how your tits were.
I wanna feel for myself.
Get away from me!
Leave her alone!
She's just a Gerber baby.
-Bastard!
-Hey, guys?
-Let's beat this queer up.
-Yeah.
-Ted, go home.
-We're all going home, Bobby.
Who's that, your fairy godfather?
Richie O'Rourke, Willie Sherman, and Harry Doolin.
The unholy trio of St. Gabe's.
How do you know us?
Come over here.
Find out what I know.
You're going to apologize.
-I don't think so.
-Shall I tell you why?
Because I know your dark secret.
-And I will tell the world.
-I got no secret.
You like calling people queer and fairy and such words?
Look in my eyes, Harry Doolin.
Tell me what you see.
Do you see someone in your mother's clothes when he thinks no one is looking?
Tell the whole, wide world.
Now say, ''l'm sorry, Carol.''
I'm sorry, Carol.
-What did he say?
-Yeah, what?
Nothing.
Thank you, kind sir.
What did you say to him?
Just intellectual chitchat among men of goodwill.
-Ted?
-Yes, sweet Carol?
-You're a very strange person.
-Tell no one.
All right, here we go. Come on!
Settle down.
Sully's got the ball!
-Oh, no!
-Oh, touchdown!
-Get in.
-All right.
-Get the dog!
-Come on!
-And away we go!
-Bye!
-Bye! See you.
-Have a good trip. See you.
Oh, my gosh. The low men.
Where's the little lady?
There he is. On time.
Give me a little kiss.
Get the bags, dear.
-Good afternoon.
-You look great.
-How are you?
-Fine.
-Here, I'll take that.
-Thank you.
-Need a hand with those, sport?
-Nope.
A real helpful kid there.
He's a good boy.
I'm sure he is.
-What a beautiful day.
-Yes, it is.
-Mr. Cushman, Mr. Dean.
-Liz.
-Good day for a drive.
-Yes, isn't it?
Women.
Always have to bring the farm.
Well, you know what they say.
Can't live with them, can't live without them, can't shoot them...
...outside of Montana.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
But if you do, name it after me.
I trust him about as far as I can sling a piano.
Yeah, I'm worried for my mom.
I'm worried for us all.
-So scary!
-Oh, I know!
-What now?
-Had enough to eat?
Are you kidding, after those hot dogs?
So, what do they call this part of town?
I've heard it referred to as ''down there.''
You see, every city has a place where...
...your last name doesn't matter.
Wine comes in a paper sack, and you can buy anything...
...if you've got cash in your pocket.
Hey, come on.
-Stay close now.
-Don't worry about that.
You shouldn't be in a place like this, but I can't leave you here. So...
...let's go.
Hollywood Haywood versus Eddie Albini, tomorrow night, New York.
I've got money to burn.
What do you say?
Not one step.
Making good on thatpromise, look how he piles into Freon.
Hey, kid.
What's your name?
Bobby. Bobby Garfield.
Been in before?
No, ma'am.
You look familiar.
Did I know your father?
My father's dead.
He died years ago.
Was he Bobby too?
Bobby Garfield. Yes, ma'am.
He was just like me.
Yeah, he was a good customer.
I liked him.
Yeah, he used to...
...stop in for a beer now and then.
Like on Mondays, when it's just dead in here...
...and in no time flat we were all laughing.
Yeah, not a mean bone in his body.
He was generous too.
Not too many like that in here.
He'd never buy a drunk a drink.
I admired that.
He also never met an inside straight he didn't like.
Who told you that?
I remember the big losers.
Most nights he walked out of here...
...with a little more than he came in with.
Yeah, he was a hell of a card player,
Bobby was.
IKeep that, if you want.
He's handsome, don't you think?
You've got that to look forward to.
You got a girlfriend?
Yes, ma'am.
Pretty?
Yes, ma'am. Her name's Carol.
She's a real hotsie-totsie.
A what?
Let's go. Taxi's waiting.
My dad came here!
He didn't lose our money.
He was generous and funny and people liked him!
-Good.
-Isn't that a thing?
Yeah. Lucky for us we came in here, I'd say.
Yes, it is a wonderful thing.
-How much did you bet?
-All I've got. $200 on Albini.
-You think Albini can beat Haywood?
-I think he can knock him out.
I bet 10-to-1 odds.
-Do you know anything about boxing?
-Nothing.
149 Broad Street.
It'll be on the radio.
We'll listen tomorrow night.
I hope you're right.
-Oh, no. Here they come! Get down!
-What is it?
Take your mind away! Don't be scared.
Think of something else.
-How?
-Carol.
Think of Carol. Don't let her go.
Think of a happy memory.
Take your mind away!
Think ofa happy memory.
Don't let her go.
Good night, kiddo. I'm proud of you.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you about the low men.
I know.
Ted, my father never bought a drunk a drink.
What does that mean, exactly?
It means he was a good man.
He was honest.
And he never added to the troubles of the world.
Okay?
-Good night.
-Good night.
There's the bell.
Haywood coming out...
...throwing punches, running in.
Now attacking Albiniat will.
Albini, arms hanging like weights, occasionally throwing a weak punch.
The punches are flying! Hollywood--
Oh, my goodness!
Out ofnowhere, a right by Albini hits Hollywood to the head...
...and to the mat!
They're counting him out. 8...9... 10!
Oh, my goodness!
One of the most improbable fiinishes to a fight, ever!
Albinihas beat Hollywood Haywood!
This one has got to be reviewed!
Wow.
You just won 2000 bucks.
Hello?
Mrs. Garfield.
Yes, fine. I'll get him.
Bobby? It's your mother.
Okay.
-Hi, Mom.
-Hi, honey.
-Have you missed me?
-Ofcourse I have.
But I'm trying not to be too sad.
Oh, good.
-Brush your teeth.
-I did.
Good boy.
I can't chat all night. There's a cocktail party for us delegates...
...down in the ballroom and I'm--
Are you there?
I dropped the phone.
I love you, Bobby!
Don--!
That's funny.
Got cut off.
That 2000....
-It's traveling money, isn't it?
-Yeah, it is.
I lied to you. I didn't tell you about the lost pet sign I saw.
I know.
When will you leave?
Tomorrow, when your mother gets back.
Collect my winnings from Len Files at the Corner Pocket....
Then go.
Will I ever see you again?
No.
And wishing can't make it so.
I don't want you to go.
It's all for the best, kiddo.
It's all for the best.
''ln yet another startling development in Washington...
...J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the Federal Bureau of lnvestigation...
...today issued a statement denying the Bureau was involved...
...in recruiting psychics in the battle against Communism.''
That's really what all this is about, isn't it, Ted?
Want a root beer?
That's the only good thing about you going. I can't stand that stuff.
Yeah, I know.
-Do you know everything?
-Nope.
So what happens when you touch people?
I pass on a kind of window into other people's minds.
Is that why they want you?
This window?
Yeah. I know certain things, see certain things.
Some see it as a gift, but to me it's always been a burden.
What I see has a value for some.
Maybe I escaped them this time.
Thanks.
Cheers.
To good health.
Oh, well.
We're all just passing through, kiddo.
Just passing through, that's all.
Tell Carol I'd like to say goodbye to her.
Sure.
-Hey, Bobby!
-Yeah?
I think you should go find her now.
Okay.
-Hey, Bobby.
-Is Carol home?
No, she went to the ravine to read...
...by the tree.
You don't scare me, Bobby Garfield.
If it isn't the Gerber baby.
No! Please!
Harry?
Carol! Carol!
Is everything okay?
He hit me, Bobby. He hit me hard.
It's okay.
-I'll go get help!
-No, please!
Don't leave me alone.
He might come back.
It'll be okay.
Can you walk?
I don't know.
-Just try, okay?
-Maybe, I don't know.
It'll be okay.
It's okay.
Here, try and stand up, okay?
You have to get on my back, okay?
-Bobby, I can't!
-Yes, you can.
You can.
You have to think about something else, okay?
Here, get on my back.
Remember at school how we rode piggyback at recess?
-Yeah.
-This is just like that, okay?
-Bronko Nagurski.
-Nagurski.
Ten yards...
...seven yards....
Nothing could stop him.
Ted!
Help.
I think her arm's broken.
Come on, Carol. It's all right.
It's all right.
My arm.
Bobby, take her hand, all right?
Oh, yes.
One great, big boy against one little girl.
He's probably so afraid of you.
Thought you had the heart of a lion.
He hurt me, Ted.
I know. Believe me, I know.
Now listen. I've got to look at your shoulder. Understand?
I don't want to hurt you.
Oh, my.
He broke my arm.
No, I think it's just dislocated.
And I think I can fix it.
Are you a doctor, Ted?
No, I'm not a doctor.
But as you noted, I'm very strange.
So who knows what I can do?
Do you have the heart of a lion?
Just close your eyes and try and relax.
Bobby, give me your belt.
Now, Carol, do you know what pain does?
It rises and travels up the body.
That's it. Thank you.
Listen to me, Carol.
Just listen and relax.
I want you to bite down hard on the belt.
You're going to bite down on Bobby's belt and catch the pain.
Now relax.
Close your eyes.
IKeep them closed.
You're safe. Just breathe in.
Breathe out. That's it.
There's no pain.
Just listen to my voice.
I can sense them closing in on me, Bobby.
I know. There's signs everywhere.
Here we go.
Bite down hard and catch-- Here we go.
All right.
There.
Ted?
It doesn't hurt anymore.
You do have the heart of a lion.
You did well, Carol.
What the hell is going on in here?
Mom, what happened to you?
-Take your hands off that little girl!
-Mom, he didn't do anything bad!
How dare you touch her!
He didn't hurt her!
I brought her so Ted could help her!
Go to your room!
And you! You are going to jail!
What happened to you didn't happen to her.
-Why's her blouse open?
-Her shoulder's hurt!
I said, go to your room!
What Bobby said was true!
Let's clean you up in the bathroom.
He carried me up the hill.
Ted took my pain away.
Don't you touch her!
Go in the bathroom.
I'm calling the police to tell them everything.
Tell them what happened to you.
You weren't there. You couldn't know.
I know.
I know you didn't realize the seminar would involve that.
And I know he's growing up while your mind is on other things.
I'm taking that child home. And you better not be here when I get back.
-Be careful.
-I'll be fine, don't worry.
Where will you go till it's dark?
The diner near the Corner Pocket,
I guess. Pick up my winnings later.
I want to go with you.
Bobby, come inside, please.
Do as she says, kiddo.
Yes, is this...
...Housitonic-5837?
Yes, well, I have some information for you...
...about Brautigan.
You can find him at the Corner Pocket tonight...
...in Bridgeport.
Yes. Now, there's a reward--?
Hello?
Hello--
Bastards.
When your mother writes ''bad''...
...under a mental picture of someone, she writes it in ink.
I mean, I knew that, but
I didn't think she'd betray me.
See, I need the money to survive...
...and I can't go back to the Corner Pocket.
And I need time to think...
...and there isn't any.
Here's what you do.
Write a note for me.
A note?
Yeah, to the Corner Pocket.
I'll get you your money.
I'm not sure this is a good idea.
Ted, take my hands.
Don't worry. I won't let the bogeyman get you.
Hello?
Can I help you?
It's about Brautigan.
He took the train. I saw him go.
Stay out of this, kid.
Brautigan's our business.
Don't hurt him.
Please don't hurt him.
Go home, Bobby.
Ted, I got the money!
Ted!
I wouldn't have missed a minute!
Not a single minute!
Not for the whole world!
Where have you been?
I've been worried!
I'm all safe and sound.
Do you have any idea what you just put me through?
You only think about yourself!
-Bobby--
-Ted's gone.
I'll never see him again.
So you got everything you wanted.
Happy?
There's no money. I don't have a job.
There's plenty of money now!
See how great it worked out, turning him in?
I did it for you. For your own--
You lie! You always lie.
My father was a good man and people liked him.
Everyone liked him except you.
You never liked me either.
Then I find a grownup friend of my own, and you know what?
I loved him.
You didn't just betray him; you betrayed both of us.
Bobby?
Ted got it right.
It isn't alIAtlantis.
My mother got ajob outside ofBoston.
And I was upset, ofcourse, but one thing....
I wasn't afraid.
I had Ted to thank for that.
Hey, get out of here.
This is my place now.
You can't. This is everybody's park.
Yes, I can.
Little Bobby Garfield.
Where's your fairy godfather when you need him?
That was for the Gerber baby!
Do you need any help?
I'm fine.
Do you think you could ever see your way to forgiving me?
I'm working on it, Mom.
Carol, we're leaving now.
Oh, no.
Here. It's where I'll be in Massachusetts.
-Will you write to me?
-Of course.
I'll write to you.
I'll probably be homesick.
I'll never forget you.
Was it you who beat up Harry Doolin?
Good.
Good.
-Carol, wait.
-I can't. Not now.
-But l--
-I love you too, Bobby Garfield.
But I have to go make the salad.
9:35, 25 minutes before 10 on WKMD...
...serving up the biggest hits with the Platters.
So, what are we gonna do?
The best we can, Mom.
The best we can.
Well, time and tide wait for no man.
Ben Jonson called time
''the old bald cheater.''
-Who was Ben Jonson?
-An English writer.
Foolish about money, and given to flatulence.
Flatulence?
Bobby Garfield!
Hey!
I don't think you should be in there.
It's not safe.
I used to live here when I was a kid.
-Have you lived here long?
-Only my whole life.
Oh, wait a minute! Wait, wait, wait.
Was your mother...
...was she...?
Was she Carol, Carol Gerber?
-My mom's dead. She died years ago.
-I was sorry to hear that.
We never kept in touch like we said we would.
My God.
You're the boy on the Ferris wheel?
-Mom told me about that.
-She promised she'd never tell anyone.
She said you were beautiful.
One of us was.
You can keep that, if you want.
I'm Bobby.
-Molly.
-Molly.
She had the heart of a lion.
I never heard from
Ted Brautigan again.
Not that I didn't think ofhim.
I always have...
...and always will.
Because that summer was the last of my childhood.
And though I never again saw whatpeople were thinking...
...there was an enduring gift that he left me.
What Ted did was open my eyes...
...and let the future in.
I wouldn't have missed a minute ofit.
Not for all the world.
Shall I tell you something?
Time ruins everything.
I just made that up.
What happened to you?
I will tell you.
I spent some time in prison because... because I had sex with my daughter.
The western syndrome.
I think about it all the time.
It was everything I had left,
I had nothing else.
I never had anything.
It was cute.
Easy now.
We`re all... mefisto`s.
I want to bring you some fun.
Guys who fool around a bit and then hear it`s something bad.
That it`s dramatic.
But you can`t forget the joy and the happiness.
There are no...
There are no crimes, only actions.
I have to start over.
I have to quit, I have to live.
Keep on fighting, staying alive.
I understand you completely.
Do you have something to drink?
No, I don´t have anything to drink.
I have no penny.
Oh what...
What´s that noise outside?
Nothing.
The assholes from downstairs.
They give their usual show in the Rectum.
Right.
- Rectum!
What kind of crime?
- With blood.
Blood? Does someone have her period or something?
May I wait here for a while?
They still owe me money.
What happened?
I told you those bastards wouldn`t pay.
Step aside please.
Morad, check out that guys fucked up face.
Is your leg fucked up, pal?
Your ass too, I hope.
Like Alex. I hope you bleed a lot.
And that you`re in a lot of pain.
His asshole must have bled a lot.
Fucker. Fag.
Because of those two guys the fuckers got us.
They will be happy in the street.
But I want my money.
Why are we still standing here?
We`ll get our money or go.
Fucking fags.
There are gays all over here.
It`s god damn impossible, they are everywhere.
Clear the path.
Get rid of that asshole.
And cuff him.
They will fuck him in the ass in prison.
I`m waiting for my money.
- Move it.
I hope you`ll be miserable in jail and that they fuck you in the ass.
Fucking history and philosophy teacher.
Fuscking moron.
- All philosophers are fags.
I hope they get you hard.
To the station.
- In prison there are no condoms.
You`ll get aids straigh away, fag.
What are you doing?
- I`m looking for The Tapeworm.
You have to pay.
- I`m already paying.
Go ahead.
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?
We`ll find him, we`ll find him.
You`re not human anymore. Even animals don`t revenge themselves, Marcus.
It`s going totally wrong.
Leave me alone.
- You won`t survive.
It`s none of your business.
- It smells like shit here.
Quit it, Marcus.
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?
- No.
Marcus, come back!
I won`t save you.
Marcus, stop it now.
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?
- No.
Pierre!
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?
Do you know The Tapeworm?
The Tapeworm?
Pierre!
It goes on downstairs.
We`re going once.
We`re going down once.
Come on, one time. Help me, Pierre.
Do you know The Tapeworm?
Why are you smiling?
The Tapeworm...
Do you know The Tapeworm? No? let me go! Don`t you know him?
Do you know The Tapeworm?
- Do you want to suck my cock?
No.
Do you know where The Tapeworm is?
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?
Do you want to suck my dick?
Come back. You want to fuck?
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?
He`s here often.
Maybe upstairs.
The Tapeworm...
Are you The Tapeworm?
Let me go.
Do you know The Tapeworm?
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?
He`s here often. - Doesn`t ring a bell.
Do you work here often?
- Yes, but it doesn`t ring a bell.
Don`t you know him either?
- Search. You won`t find him far from here.
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?
The Tapeworm? No.
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?
Do you know The Tapeworm?
- I have him in my stomach.
Do you know The Tapeworm?
You there. Do you know The Tapeworm?
Yes, he`s my pal.
- You know him?
He`s my friend, I said.
- Where is he?
Take me to him.
- He`s fucking a fag.
Forget The Tapeworm. Fist me.
- Don`t touch me.
Come on fist me.
- Keep your hands off me.
Shut up. Take me to him.
- Fist me.
Fist me then!
- Take me to him.
Fist me! What kind of guy are you?
Keep quiet! I`m not a fag.
Where is he? Come on.
- I`ll take you to The Tapeworm.
Take me to him!
- Two hands up your ass!
Stop it.
Are you sure you want to see The Tapeworm?
Fist me, that`s much better.
Are you sure you want to see him? Fisting me is much better.
I like you.
You make me think about someone else.
Take me to him, I said.
Take it easy.
Take me to him. Where is he?
Give me a drink.
- Give him a drink.
Drink! Where is he?
One Pepsi.
- Where is he?
The Tapeworm? In your ass.
The Tapeworm is in your ass. You know?
You want my fist against your yaw, fucking fag?
Where is he? I know him.
I know him. Bring me to him.
Damned parachutist.
- Take me to him.
You should fuck their brains out.
Show them you`re a hero.
Dammit, is that what you want?
Take me to him.
Take me to him!
- I confess!
Take me to him!
- I confess!
Take me to him!
- I confess, dammit!
Go on! Go on!
Where is he?
Hurry up dammit!
- The Tapeworm is dangerous.
Are you sure you want to see
The Tapeworm?
Hit me one more time.
Where is he?
- There he is.
Fuck off.
What`s happening?
- Who`s The Tapeworm here?
Are you The Tapeworm?
I asked you something.
Who`s The Tapeworm?
Who`s The Tapeworm?
Who`s The Tapeworm?
I asked you something. Gone with that.
Who`s The Tapeworm?
You know him?
Who`s The Tapeworm?
Who?
- What do you want from The Tapeworm?
I´m looking for him.
Are you The Tapeworm perhaps?
Are you him?
Come on, fuck him! Fuck him!
Stop it!
Fucking fag!
Fucking fag!
Stop it!
Nice work. Good.
Fucking slit-eye.
Quit your insanity.
- We`re getting near.
Stop it.
- Wait, I`m asking.
Well, I`m waiting.
Where`s the Rectum?
- Which Rectum?
A fag bar.
- Do you need one?
Is it a whore bar?
Do you want my cock up your rectum?
Don´t you know The Rectum?
- I only know this here.
Aren`t you a fag?
Where`s The Rectum?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
- Who are you going to hit now?
Come on.
- Yes, I have nothing else to do.
Do you know a place that...
The Rectum, do you know it?
The Rectum, a gay bar.
You know it?
That way, I think.
- There?
It`s over there! Come on!
What are you doing? Come on!
We`re close!
Are you coming?

Are you being pussy too now?
You`re crazy!

Hurry up.
Drive!
Who`s followinf you?
- Drive, I said!
Are the whore`s after you?
You`re not even telling where to,
We`re going to The Rectum!
- The Rectum! That`s clear.
Everyone knows where The rectum is.
Could you show the way, please?
It`s a gay bar.
If you took care of Alex with that much energy, nothing would have happened.
Picture that with your little brain, moron.
With your damned inhibitions!
Are you done preaching?
The Rectum is a gay bar.
Could you point it out on a map?
It`s a fag bar.
Do you know what that is?
Are you gay?
- No! I`m looking for a gay bar.
Don`t you know some bars?
A lot.
- Well, take us to a gay bar.
You are gay.
- No! And now shut up.
Be quiet now and leave me alone.
Sorry, sir.
- Take us to The Rectum.
Take it easy, marcus.
I`m going crazy here.
I don`t know a Rectum.
Don`t you have a phone?
Cal then!
Don`t you have slit-eye friends?
Don`t insult me or I will beat you up.
Bring me to The Rectum.
I will beat him up too, sir.
Don`t take it ill of him.
He`s crazy. It`s a moron.
- Doesn`t matter.
Okay, take it easy. Easy.
One bar with guys.
- Guys?
Try to get your brain working, fucking asshole.
Take me to The Rectum.
- Get out now.
Shut up and get out.
Just try to get me out, fucker.
Get out, please.
I am fed up with it.
Alex would be ashamed.

Drop dead, filthy Chinese.
You`re insane!
- We`re going to The Rectum.
Stop it now with your stupid revenge.
We`ll pay, we´ll pay.
- Only whore´s are here.
It`s the whore street.
They don´t know anything else.
That´s not your business.
- Stop it! Why, not my business?
Stop it! What, did you want to hit me?
Don´t stay here.
We will give you money.
We´re going to Alex in the hospital.
Which girl do you know?
What do you want to do?
Being more stupid than...
You don´t know who it was.
Don´t you want to know?
Nobody knows who it is.
And you´re not helping Alex with that.
I will give you money.
- Well, who do you know?
It´s a bit further.
- What will you get with anger?
What kind of crazy revenge is this?
Come to Alex in the hospital.
You want to hit me? Is that it?
What´s wrong with you dammit?
Then go to the hospital.
You know those two?
- Ask those whores.
What´s his name?
- Guillermo Nuñez.
Do you know Guillermo Nuñez?
What?
What does she say?
- Ask the other one.
Donna, I know her.
I meant her.
We deliver better work than the cops.
Drunkards with a gun.
Zuipschuiten met 'n pistool.
The police, they are morons.
De politie, dat zijn eikels.
What do you know, teacher?
The human stupidity, that´s what I know. In a mass.
Which one is it?
- There.
She?
- Donna!
Stop it!
- I didn´t do anything!
Do you know Guillermo Nuñez?
- No. you don´t know Guillermo Nuñez?
He´s my friend.
- You don´t know him?
Nobody knows Guillermo Nuñez.
Who is it? Tell me.
What does she say? Concha?
The blonde?
Thank you, Donna.
Concha, are you Concha?
Do you know Guillermo Nuñez?
Do you know Guillermo Nuñez?
Keep your hands off her.
Leave her alone.
We won´t do her anything.
Marcus, she didn´t do anything.
Who do you think we are?
- Fuck off.
Are you crazy, Marcus?
Answer me!
It´s about a rape.
Please!
- Rape, you hear?
Marcus, please!
- Rape!
Are you totally?
- Easy now.
Leave her alone or I won´t pay.
Take it easy. Stop it, stop it.
Let go!
- I will push!
Come on, dammit. Alex...
- Tell him to stop,
Stop it now, Marcus. Please.
Are you crazy?
You´re fucking insane!
Do you know Guillermo Nuñez?
Tell me.
Who is Guillermo Nuñez?
Who is Jo? I don´t know a Jo.
- I am Guillemo. lk ben Guillermo.
You have become a transvestite, great.
I will pay you now.
- That will tell she was there.
No.
- Did you see it?
Pick up! Go on.
Stop it, Marcus.
- What did you see?
Cut out her eye.
- Come on, stab!
Fuck off, you.
- Tell me.
It´s The Tapeworm. I know him.
The Tapeworm is a pimp.
Where can we find him?
Where? I will rebuild your transvestite face.
Where is he?
- Where can I find him?
What´s the name of that club?
- Rectum.
A Tapeworm in The Rectum?
Are you playing me?
It´s a nightclub for gays.
There´s a taxi!
Taxi!
Did you use alcohol?
No. No drugs either?
No drugs?
But according to your so-called colleague... you used drugs regulary.
He can say whatever he wants.
- Is it true or not?
I didn´t use anything.
And the victim?
I don´t know.
- No? Didn´t you live together?
Did you live together?
Don´t you want to answer?
You don´t make it easy for us.
Did you leave before or after the victim?
Pull yourself together.
- After, after.
After? how much after?
- 15 minutes.
Now that´s an answer.
15 minutes.
And when did Mr. Marcus go outside?
He came in the alley with me.
He came in the alley with you.
Did he leave sometime earlier in the evening?
I don´t know.
- You don´t know?
Did you notice something special?
Were there people around the victim?
Did she talk to certain people?
Did she have a fight with someone?
No? With you maybe?
With Mr. Marcus?
And didn´t you have a fight with Marcus?
You didn´t have a fight with Mr. Marcus?
I will need a phone number where I can reach you.
I´m listening
Good. Is that your private number?
Is it your private number?
Give him back his papers.
Take your papers back.
Take your papers.
I will contact you when
I need you. You may go.
Go ahead, it´s allright.
You may go.
Good evening.
Are you allright?
The woman who was attacked... is she someone you know?
You don´t feel very good, huh?
It´s tough.
You always think it only happens to other people, but if it happens to you, you are helplessly lost.
Are you counting on the cops?
What do you think the police will do? Nothing, and you know that.
Will they find the perpetrator?
Will they put him in jail?
Will they give him food and clothes?
Will they wash him?
Will they give him a doctor?
Your girlfriend didn´t get a doctor.
Who are you?
Who I am?
As a matter of fact...
I could become your best friend.
I can help you find the perpetrator.
You look honest.
Nicely dressed.
Obviously you have money.
If you have some money, we could help you get revenge.
The perpetrator spilled blood.
Blood shouts for revenge.
Revenge is a human right.
Laïd, come over.
You understand it right away.
Explain who we are.
This here is our neighbourhood.
We find everyone, faster than the morons over there.
Exactly.
- Listen to him.
Not very long ago someone was raped here.
We have found the perpetrator.
We made him clear not to do it again.
Do you want revenge or not?
Or do you want him to go to prison?
You hesitate?
- Do you know him?
Ofcourse. We found a hand bag with identity.
The name was Guillermo Nuñez.
Are you in?
Pay and we deliver him.
You shouldn´t hesitate.
You´re hurting yourself.
What´s wrong? You´re shivering.
This is only for men.
Don´t be a pussy. Okay?
Are you in or not?
Man yourself.
Take me with you.
- Are you in?
We´ll leave the cops for what they are.
- Come.
Go home then.
- You don´t realize your luck.
Shall I...
- You´re ruining it with Alex.
I´ll give you money for a taxi.
You´re ruining the party the whole evening.
What´s happening?
- A whore got raped.
You won´t get through
- We want a taxi.
No, gentlemen.
- We only want a taxi.
No, gentlemen.
- Don´t act so stupid.
Something happened, the street is blocked.
Alex!
Wait!
Alex! What happened?
Sir, take it easy.
- What happened?
She has been raped and is in a coma now.
Sir, please.
Let us do our work, sir.
Sir, take it easy.
Just let us do our work.
Take him away.
- Sir, please.
We can´t work like that.
- Take him away.
Who are you, sir?
Is she your wife?
- Do you know that man?
I will have to ask you some questions.
Who are you?
She´s my wife.
- Do you know that man?
Sir, please.
- She is my wife.
Keep him on a distance.
It´s dangerous.
Please go around the tunnel.
Thank you.
Here! Filthy bitch.
Filthy bitch, you´re dead.
Hold on, you.
Wait!
Wait!
- Leave me alone.
Wait, I said.
Would you just shut up?
I won´t do you anything.
Shut your fucking mouth.
You want to taste this?
Will you shut up now?
Fucking bitch.
Shall I give you a pretty smile?
Fucking whore.
Does that excite you?
Tell me.
Does it make you horney?
Well, well.
You are pretty hot.
Please...
- Shut up.
Leave me alone
- Shut up, I said.
Lift up your skirt.
Leave me alone.
- Lift up your skirt.
Shut up.
Dammit.
- Leave me alone, please.
Please.
Go sit on your knees.
On your knees!
On your knees! I´m going to fuck you . On your knees!
And now lie down.
Lie down.
Shut up.
Well, well.
You have a nice ass.
I´m going to fuck you, whore.
Who pays for your clothes?
Your guy?
What an asshole that he lets you walk around like this outside.
You little whore.
Shut up!
Shut up or I´ll kill you.
Understand?
Shut up or I´ll kill you.
Dammit!
Open your legs! Open your legs!
Open your legs, dammit!
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up!
Lay still... Don´t move.
I´m going to fuck you in your ass.
I will fuck your ass untill it bleeds!
I will fuck your ass like you have never fucked.
You little whore.
Don´t move.
You´ve been fucked in your ass before, huh?
Does your guy do it in your ass?
Do you like it?
Dammit.
Don´t move, dammit!
Lay still, don´t move.
Don´t move, don´t move.
Don´t move, dammit!
Dammit!
You have a nice tight ass.
I will fuck your ass untill it bleeds!
If you dare to shit, you die. Understand?
Fucking bitch.
You have such a tight ass.
A nice fag ass.
Usually I don´t like that.
Bitch. But this time...
Will you shut up already?
Whore! in your ass!
You´ve never been fucked in your ass like this, huh?
Dammit, is that blood or cum?
Your ass is getting bigger, huh?
Are you bleeding?
Dammit.
Oh yeah, nice.
Damn, that´s nice.
Tell your daddy it´s nice.
Tell daddy it´s nice.
Say daddy to me.
Say daddy.
Say daddy, bitch!
Shut up!
Dammit.
Dammit.... God damnit
Good.
That was nice.
Where are you going, bitch?
Where are you going?
Where are you going like that?
Did you think I was done with you?
Little whore.
Look at me.
Look at me when
I´m talking to you.
Look at me, dammit.
Filthy bitch, look at me.
Little whore. Fucking bitch.
Come here!
Ugly bitch!
Bitch!
You think you can do anything, huh?
You think you can do anything because you're beautiful, huh?
Dirty cunt! Dirty...
Come here!
I'm gonna hit your face real hard!
I'm not finished with you!
Come here! Here! Here!
Fucking bitch! Here!
Are you happy now? Or do you want some more?
Want some? Fucking whore!
Please!
Little cunt, that you are!
Over here!
This is for your rotten face!
Now I'm all finished with you.
Fucking cunt.
What do you want to say to me?
You do not care about my sexuality.
But you engage me in it.
-You never talk about yours.
Because there is nothing to tell.
What is it then?
-There is always something.
What are you doing with your dick?
Don't bitch about it.
-Are you gonna keep it to wanking?
Don't be like that. I think about
Alex and you, and that's painful.
You are alone for 3 years now.
-So what?
What do you do?
You are sent by God, because my pal Pierre... has a problem.
-What about it?
We must find a way to losen
Pierre a bit up.
I want to take care of that.
-You see...but how?
You are with two and I'm not alone either.
In the toilets.
-Now shut up.
That's where it happens all the time.
-Alex is alone.
Come on.
-Go, Pierre.
You are saying that I bitch about your sexuality, and what about you?
Are you afraid?
-Pierre is very nice.
Forget it. I know how it goes.
We make fun, we get completly stoned... but I did that 15 years, 30 years ago.
Hello.
-Don't do that.
Stop it, Marcus.
Leave me alone.
You can't do that to Alex.
Leave Fatima alone.
Fatima, come on.
Don't do it. You are going to regret if you sober up.
Forget about it. Come on.
Go with me.
He's very nice.
First a present.
Don't do that shit.
Leave it.
Stop it, Pierre.
Stop it. Don't do it.
You are a pain in the ass.
And, girls?
Delicious.
I got to go see Pierre who only loves rats and may not be left alone.
Are you coming back?
Soon?
-Yeah. Thanks, girls.
Are you going to leave us alone?
This is Pierre and he needs your love.
Alex is dancing all alone.
Don't be an moron.
Give him some pleasure, ladies.
-Piss off.
You are saying that I bitch about your sexuality and what do you do?
I know. Come on, Marcus.
I really hate it when you act like that.
If you are not doing it for me, then do it for her.
No, Marcus stays here.
Come on. Don't be such an idiot.
Alex has to dance all by himself.
Come on.
Leave him.
Here I am!
-Come on.
Marcus, you are fantastic.
-It's rotten, Marcus.
That's life, mate.
Then it didn't have any sense to bring her along.
Why did you bring her if you are doing it that way?
Why are you doing it that way?
Come on, have a drink.
You are in need of a glass of water
You don't have to act like that.
You take her with you and...
-Look at the ladies.
You can be a dickhead without being with her too.
Stay with her.
You need to have some fun.
-Do you call this fun?
Yes, this is fun.
You are just like a priest.
I feel like a nanny.
-Our little priest.
I go with a teenager loaded with drugs.
Have some water. Come on.
Have a drink.
Here, drink the water. From the sink.
Give me a shot of water from the sink.
There was a queue at the john.
I couldn't piss.
Stop it, Marcus.
-I opened the tap.
Leave it.
-Come on, quit it.
Quit it, Pierre.
Before you fuck up everything.
Come on.
-You are not funny.
It's not funny like that.
They'll see you.
You are even more fierce then an animal.
You are not funny.
Did you come for that, dickhead?
-What, dickhead?
I came to watch them dance, therefore I'm a dickhead.
Don't be like that, Marcus. Really.
Look how beautiful she is.
Look how she dances.
Look how gorgeous. Brunette, blonde, brunette, blonde.
Behave like an adult.
-We'll fuck'em all.
Found your girlfriends?
-So?
Hello.
- What's your name?
Joanna. Is that you?
- Vincent.
Hello, Vincent.
- No, my name is Marcus.
And you?
- Aurèle.
Aurèle? This is Alex.
No, that's Alex.
- I know.
I'm Marcus.
Marcus.
Come on.
-I've had it with that cunt.
Don't be so annoying.
-He brings misfortune.
I give him some pussy.
He doesn't want them.
I give him coke, he doesn't like it.
I present him a glass, he says no.
Such a bore.
You picked a weird one as lean as a lath, Alex.
No, I rather watch you.
I bear heavy secrets.
-Dance with me.
Let me have a look at you.
You didn't use to dance.
There is the hairy monkey.
Stop it, Marcus.
Do something.
What has he swallowed?
Stop it.
In the past you never danced.
-I dance with you.
You dance to forget, huh?
Your Marcus is out of his mind.
What are you doing?
You didn't use to dance like that.
In the past you didn't dance that way.
Let yourself go.
-I'm completly relaxed.
Dance with me.
-You scare me. You're never like this.
I never saw you like this.
There you have got him again.
Do I scare you?
-Funny, huh?
Do you think that's funny?
I can do it too.
Please. Dance with me.
I'm with you. I look at you.
You are in great shape.
Remember? Be careful.
You are playing a dangerous game,
Alex.
Marcus has a lot of fun.
-Come with me.
Very nice to see you.
-The pleasure is all mine. How are you?
I'm going to say hi to a few mates.
Everything okay?
Sorry.
Everything okay?
How about you?
And?
-And, does it grow?
He never knows when to quit.
I'm happy. You look hot.
Quit it.
I really enjoy it to see you
I'm completly wasted from the dancing.
I've also danced alot.
-Everything okay?
I'm happy.
I'm in a very special period.
I'll tell you about it.
I'm here with a guy.
Pierre?
- No.
I'm with Marcus.
I think he's completely insane.
-Yeah, it looks like it.
I want to have dinner with you one evening.
Thank you.
-Then I'll tell you all.
She must tell me everything.
What does she have to tell?
-I don't know.
Are you alright?
-Yeah, of course.
Okay. Will you call me?
-Promised.
Well...
See you later.
Stop it.
- What?
What did you take?
Nothing. Nothing at all.
I'm sober as water.
My name is Jean-François.
Did you see your eyes?
-What's wrong with them?
You don't control your mouth.
You don't control your breasts.
Quit it, I want to rest.
-I've been looking for you for a while.
I was dancing.
Why do you have to swallow pills to make fun?
I don't know. It's fun.
-You are no longer 15.
Sometimes you can be very sweet... and soft, and at other moments you can be a real moron.
Quit it, Alex.
-I want to go home.
I want to go home, I want some rest.
I'll bring you home.
-You look like a ghost.
Stop it, you are annoying me.
-Wait, I'll bring you home.
Don't touch me.
Come on!
I'll bring you home, I told you!
Alex, goddammit!
I'm leaving.
- Where are you going?
I'm tired.
- But you're only here for an hour.
I want to go home.
-A minute ago, you were still dancing.
What's wrong?
-He's completely stoned.
I know.
-Take care of him.
He doesn't need me, you do.
-No I don't.
Don't worry.
I'll call you tomorrow.
No. I came for you.
To see you.
It has been months. I have to make up something to see you.
To see you dance.
-Don't torture yourself like that.
I don't.
I can take it.
It's from esthetical pleasure.
From nostalgia to see you again.
Don't go away.
I'll call you tomorrow. Promised.
Why?
-You are a darling.
No, I'm not a darling. It's uncareful to leave you alone.
I'm reading a very good book.
-How long?
Months.
-How many pages? 43?
It's really good.
After the index it's with each page...
What's it about?
-Well, it says...
The book?
-The book says...
It seems to be that the future is completely decided already. Everything is fixed.
And the proof is the prophetic dreams.
Beautiful. That gets us asleep at least.
Who knows what we are going to dream.
-You should write...
Sometimes I dream that I'm asleep.
My only dream.
Come on.
-Then you get relaxed.
Very suspenseful.
-Direction Louis Blanc.
Isn't that our stop?
-No, the next one.
You have to sleep.
Do you sleep 2 hours?
How many times did collapse, after hours of work.
Was it good? Tell me.
You can't do it either, huh?
Terrible, huh?
What will make you come?
Stop it.
Why do you say something like that?
It's your own fault, if you go out with your ex boy-friends
You can't make her come, huh?
We'll explain it to you one time.
-No, seriously.
What?
-Does he really make you come?
I don't say...
-You don't have to say anything.
Quit it. He with his monkey face.
Tell me.
Come on.
Don't be like that.
"Yes, we come."
You see how you are now, Pierre?
You want to explain everything.
Do you come or not?
I haven't been able to for years.
Don't excite yourself.
Everything is fine.
That's why you're in the back and I'm up front.
No, seriously. There is nobody.
-Stop it.
Did he do something nice or not?
You don't talk about that stuff.
Shall we do them then?
In turns.
That way we'll see if it works on them.
-It's complicated.
Did it work or not?
You held against me that...
I've been thinking for a long time...
I had results.
Excellent results, since...
Can he do it?
-We're not talking about sex.
Why not?
-You can talk about everything...
We can talk about sex, just not with you.
He wants to explain everything.
Like sex. Sex is an act, you don't talk about it.
But you can say how it is?
Did you enjoy a bit, yes or no?
It's a vulgar question.
For me it was finished.
Why do you say that?
- I had to, from my cardiologist.
He said I would die from it.
"Her orgasm or your heart," she said.
Seriously.
- Stop it now. there, a metro.
And it's blue with colors.
Did you achieve something or not?
Pierre!
- No, seriously.
We will explain everything.
Liar.
Liars have a big nose, you have big ears.
Do I have a big nose?
- No, big ears. Your nose is nothing.
By the way, with the wind... look.
What an airflow.
Ladies and gentlemen, a couple that cums.
One time...
One time she screamed.
- In four years, very good.
Because she bumped into the pedestal.
Why are you acting like that?
The only tangible proof of an orgasm.
And I believed in it.
I thought: Finally.
She cried. And it was bleeding.
You know what people say?
There are no women who can't come, only men who can't fuck.
And that's it.
-Why are you hurting yourself?
I am not. Tell me the truth and
I swill accept it.
I was too cerebral to make her cum.
Then she follows a diet of banana's and testosteron, and it's done.
You are trite.
- Seriously.
Do you do it for a banana diet?
Bravo.
Look at that couple going to a party who don't share their bed secrets.
You have to be able to be tender.
- And you were so progressive.
I'll write it down, you never know if I find the one.
It has been long that..
A knot, thank you.
No, I kept it for you.
How are those things called again?
Go on, tell me.
A tender gesture.
- No, for you it's hopeless.
You won't succeed anymore.
- Tell me.
You take care of your rats.
You can still do that.
I can't make them cum.
That's illegal.
I'm going crazy or I'll rape children.
How do you do it?
- Don't make jokes about that.
Alex, what was the problem?
- What do you think?
His onomatopoeia?
His skin? His smell?
Or was it the tarzan yell?
Unimaginable.
You're saying I'm too intellectual.
Now I'm asking for something simple.
She gives a stroke, she goes like...
Maybe you can sing at the same time.
What's that to me?
Am I annoying?
- No.
I am annoying. Sorry.
Sir, madam.
Excuse me.
Madam is coming.
Madam is coming, but keeps it to herself.
How far are you with Sylvie?
- Like with the others.
After a few hours of extreme effort...
Sylvie doesn't interest me.
- You know what your problem is?
You act like it's a big achievement.
-What?
To you it's a achievement.
-What?
Sex. You do it, but you´re not participating.
What do you tell me now?
-It's true.
The details of your private life is none of my interests.
Excuse us, your honor.
-He started.
Later at the party you can continue your discussion in the toilets.
Unbelievable.
What did you do more that I couldn't do?
You are too old for that stuff.
I'm 2 years older than you are.
-A little bit more.
Mister starts cavilling.
You think too much about the pleasure of the other.
You have to let yourself go lose.
-You are an altruist.
Get relaxed and think about yourself.
-That's selfish.
It's better like this.
Otherwise you get blocked.
You think too much about the pleasure of others.
You get blocked because you are not focusing on yourself.
In the end the pleasure of the woman, is the pleasure of a man.
If I feel that the man isn't enjoying ... his own pleasure...
-Wait a moment.
If I feel that the man doesn't go up in his own pleasure...
You are not enjoying it because
I don't enjoy it?
No, I get blocked.
-What a bad thing to hear afterwards.
After all these years...
-I couldn't do it. No.
All this effort I took to temper myself... for hours.
I have been sweating from it.
Let me explain.
-And it was wrong? It had to be fast.
And you came two hours later, while I was in the shower or asleep.
This is really fucked.
No, it's not like that.
-You push me too...
I wanted...
-He fucks and she comes hours later.
You can't explain.
-It's not rational.
Your problem is that you want an explanation for everything.
But sometimes there is no explanation.
It's like that talking for centuries.
Sometimes you just have to fuck.
And afterwards everything is solved.
I don't know why.
The bodies talk.
-Don't I have to talk?
I talked during fucking.
Remember?
But the bodies.
-And everything I said got you excited.
It was just a chat.
But it interested you.
It was never a real extacy, but once or twice ...
Say it. He isn't listening anyway.
-More often.
Really? More often, mate! More often!
Mate!...more often.
You always talk like an intellectual.
-Me?
But after all it's always terra terra.
It's about sex.
That's good, isn't it?
-But you say he's an animal.
It's an essential need.
He doesn't possess the language.
"I fuck, I eat, I Marcus"
But I diverse.
I many trouble, because I not speak the language very well.
The language.
-Come on now, "Language".
Are we there?
-I stay so I can wank myself off.
Well ok.
What a bullshit.
More often.
That's not bad at all.
Hello, Alexandra.
Pierre here. I've got car trouble.
I´ll come and get you with the metro.
In 20 to 30 minutes.
I had a dream.
It was weird.
I don't have any feeling in my arm.
I walked through a tunnel.
A tunnel... completely red...
And afterwards...
The tunnel broke in 2 pieces.
I think... it's because of my menstruation.
Are you over time.
Remember?
A lot?
No, just a few days.
We'll see.
We had a long sleep.
We have to get up.
I have to buy a new bottle. for the party tonight.
Pierre...
I have to be kind to him. because in the end I stole his wife.
What?
And I have to be too...
-No...
You didn't steal anything from anyone, honey.
I'm ...
I'm not a thing.
You have not stolen anything from anyone.
I have done it.
I have decided everything.
It's always the wife that decides.
Really.
But then again...
It's true that you decide.
By the way...
What do you get for me? Do you give me parties with your ex?
He may be a friend.
But he is crazy about you.
He likes you.
Whatever, you will pay.
-I won't pay shit.
You decide and you pay for it.
-No, stop it.
No, wait. I'm not awake yet.
You'll pay for this.
If you hurt me, you'll pay.
You will pay.
The revenge of the elephant.
-Stop it!
Who kills children!
Stop it.
You know I don't like that.
Then I will revenge myself too.
With a kiss.
You crushed me.
-That's not true.
Wait, you...
-No.
Did I hurt you?
You're exaggerating.
You crushed my balls.
Dammit, Alex.
That can't be.
Did I hurt you?
You're a pig.
You're a dirty pig.
Then I will go away. I'll make sone coffee. That will teach you.
Stop it.
Quit it.
I'll make some coffee.
-Make some coffee?
You know...
You should buy some booze.
Go on.
Okay.
Take a look,
I have something here that hurts.
No, really, I have something here.
Will you play some music?
No.
Alex...
- What?
I think I... feel like fucking you in the ass.
No! I thought you were going to say something romantic.
It is romantic.
- Oh? No, you know...
I love you.
I love you too.
And what if I were pregnant?
That wouldn't be so bad.
Yes, please.
Take a shower.
Hey, well...
I'm going to buy a bottle.
You have money?
Come on, stop it.
- What?
Do you ever have money?
Alright. Do you have some?
I'll get some from your purse.
See you later.

Can't you? l thought l saw you considering it.
-What the hell is that?
-That's a wedding ring, sir.

You've been around long enough to know that.
-Thank you, sir. My name's Curtis--
-Do l need to know? lf l want camaraderie, l'll join the Masons.

That's a stiff dick and bubble gum.
And guess what, l'm out of bubble gum.
Are you deaf or are you just trying to try my patience? Get those numbers off!
Let's go.
Number nine and number 12.
Who the fuck is that? Stand up, now!
You two are the first two.

Nothing more, nothing less.
On my command, execute.
The last man standing, walk out that door.
You will be admitted to the unit.
Execute.

-Why not? lt seems she got a makeover today.
We're working on it.
-Four p.m., Cut n' Curl?
-They gave her a crew cut, dyed it blond.
-Any idea why?
-Nope.
And then met with the boyfriend at 9.
-Then?
-We don't know.
But your man was on post till he turned her over to night watch.
-He says he was.
-What else you got? l gotta get you on a landline.
We got the boyfriend, Michael Blake.
-Where is he?
-We're shaking the trees.
And Professor Gerald Sloane, notably chummy with his female students...
...of which she was one.
Weekend home, Martha's Vineyard. l'm light. l'm light, people. l need another team on the professor.
-l need an over-watch on the boyfriend.
-ls the phone up? Get the phone up.
Got it. We're up!
-You just come from Cadre?
-Yes, sir.
-How long since you've slept?
-Not significant. l don't have the bodies.
Call them in. Call them in.
His post was Harvard Yard.
Harvard Yard, northeast corner,
Lowell House, across from her dorm.
Night watch relieved him there, midnight.
Want to help me out?
-You understand?
-Yes, sir.
-l'm making myself clear to you, right?
-Yes, sir.
Okay, then. Once again.
She had lunch with her father.
Lunch with her father.
You were seconded to that?
-No, sir, l just had her.
-You just had her? l had her all day.
Tucked her in at 10. And she--
Yeah, she had a tiff with her boyfriend,
Michael Blake.
-What was it about?
-l think it was about her....
-Her haircut. So it wasn't a serious...?
-No, no. No.
-And then l held the post until relieved.
-Well, then we've got a little problem. l was there.
2312 hours, 19 May, Harvard Yard, northeast corner, Lowell House...
...reveals no Secret Service presence.
Neither his post, nor adjacent.
A second tour, 2330, reveals similarly.
-l was there, sir.
-Who's lying, you or him?
You son of a bitch, l got 15 years in. l got two kids.
You're not gonna sit there and lie away my pension.
-l was--
-Do not say you were there. l was on post.
Get up, motherfucker!
Don't you say you were on post!
Get up! You son of a bitch!
-Get up! You motherfucker!
-Get the fuck out! Get the fuck out!
Okay, sit down.
Shall l tell you what's gonna happen to you when we find you out?
Were you fucking her?
-We're gonna find out.
-No, l--
Where is the girl?
Where is your principal?
We're gonna have to take this from the top again.
-Okay, Mr. Gaines?
-Yes, sir. l want the clock up.
Let's get the clock up, please.
We got until her Monday-morning class, then it's Meet the Press and ''Where is she?''
The professor.
Who's got the professor?
-Where is he?
-Martha's Vineyard.
-Who's got him?
-Parr and Shannon.
Wake him up, shake him up.
He don't wanna talk...
...here's what we have him doing with his female students. Show them to his wife.
-We got the state cops on the scrambler.
-The photo.
This is the last known photo of the girl.
Sir! lt's the professor.
-You had him at his home.
-We were in error.
-Where is he?
-Best guess puts him on his boat.
Last seen, West Tisbury,
Martha's Vineyard.
-Show me.
-Right here.
Find him. Put the guard on him.
Get me an overflight.
-l hear you.
-l'm 25 men light here.
-Who's got the Coast Guard?
-l got them. l need an overflight.
Coast Guard Search and Rescue.
Coast Guard on the red phone.
New Bedford!
-What's the name of his boat?
-The Colophon, out of West Tisbury.
Sir.
-lt's the boyfriend. He's moving.
-l need a stalker on the boyfriend. Now.
-l've got him.
-Call it out. Hold surveillance. l've got two days to run in before the press wakes up.
Yes, sir.
Let me see your hands, son.
Right now.
Drop it.
Did you lose your mailbox key, son?
-You a student here?
-Yes.
Can l see some identification, please?
-Section 12, this is--
-No, please. Please.
Calm down. lt's gonna be what it's gonna be.
Can l talk to you for one minute?
Just one minute, all right?
This-- lt's not what it looks like. l broke up with my girlfriend.
This is her mailbox. lt's Laura.
-Laura Newton.
-Laura?
-Yes.
-Newton?
The Laura Newton?
That's right. We broke up.
-They know who l am.
-They?
-The Secret Service.
-Secret Service?
That's right.
They know who l am.
They cleared me.
They didn't clear you for this.
Let's go.
-Okay--
-Let's go.
-l was just trying to retrieve the letter.
-This is not very nice language.
''You deserve everything that's gonna happen to you.''
What's gonna happen to her?
Did you hurt her?
Did you hit her?
Hit her? No.
-l called her a whore.
-What's this sign?
What does this sign mean?
Right here.
She signs all of her letters with that. lt's because she...
-...sees things cockeyed, like Picasso.
-Picasso.
She says they call her Picasso.
Why did you fight with her, son?
She got her hair done.
Dyed it blond. She cut it off. l called her a slut.
Wait. We've all seen the pictures.
Beautiful young girl like that...
...what do you care what color she dyes her hair?
Now why does that make her a slut?
She's fucking another guy.
You want to talk about it? lf you want to talk about it, l will give you one minute.
Nothing hurts worse than that, if she's sleeping with another guy.
There's this....
This teacher that.... l shouldn't be telling you this.
She's sleeping with a teacher?
Well, she says she isn't. l said if she wants to fuck old men, she should go to the Back Light, go all the way.
-Back Light?
-Yeah. lt's this club by the Fenway. lt's like a joke at school, like a rumor.
This girl or that girl went with a businessman for one night...
...made a thousand bucks.
This is a lovers' quarrel, all right? l said something that l regret. l sent a note that l regret. l can assure you, officer...
...if you see your way clear to give me a break, it'll never....
The Back Light. lt's a club in the Fenway.
A club in the Fenway.
No morgue. No hospital. No note.
The parents?
The mother, you know where she is.
She's a drunk. He's holding up.
-He was in town yesterday to see her.
-He was?
-We snuck him in and out.
-How long were they together?
-Parker.
-One second.
-He copped to it.
-Copped to what?
Left his post. Punched out early to go boffing his girlfriend.
Hope she was worth it.
-Sir.
-All right. Let's get back on it.
Okay. Back Light.
A restaurant, The Black Night...
...The Black Light, a bar, a supper club.
Black Light, that's it.
Put up the graphics on the girl.
Take a look at this.
We ran it up from a description of the colorist from the beauty parlor.
Show him what we got.
Transport is under command of State.
We refer to section two.
Yeah, l understand.
-May l have your jacket?
-Right, l got it.
Yeah.
Get their guys off the perimeter.
Get our guys in. l need $5000.
-Annie.
-l heard it, $5000.
-Scraping the bottom of the barrel, huh?
-Yes, sir.
Five thousand dollars.
Need you to sign for it.
You sign for it.
All right.
-What happened to your wedding ring?
-l took it off.
Did you go off your wife?
No, sir, l'm working.
Keep your mouth shut, your eyes open.
And form on me.
Move aside. Move aside!
Oh, Jesus.
All right, then. Who saw it? l believe he had a hideout piece.
Who frisked him?
Who frisked the son of a bitch?
The girl he went to see, get her in.
The one he was fucking.
-Two guys to her house, right now.
-Seal the room off.
Check out the file.
Seal the room off.
He was off post when he snatched the girl?
Yeah, well, apparently he felt bad about it.
-Show me a set of keys.
-l ain't got them.
Here, you take the chain.
You've got the over-watch.
Swing the chain.
You're a guy walking the dog.
Loosen your collar.
Told me 2:00. lt's closing time, gents.
Time to pack it up.
Don't gotta go home, but you can't stay here.
Closing up.
Can't sell booze after 2 a.m.
No, l just wanted to pay you that money l owe you.
-How about them Sox, huh?
-Yeah, what are you gonna do?
Yeah. ''Curse of the Bambino,'' isn't that what you call it?
That's right. Where are you from?
Yeah, well, actually, l was just trying to find my niece.
Oh, that's what you're looking for?
Because a lot of guys come in here looking for someone else's niece.
No. Girl like that...
...been in tonight?
-Pretty girl.
-Yeah, that's my type.
Girl like that been in?
You sure you're looking for your niece?
Because a lot of guys come in here and go home with some rather younger girl.
No, no. Why--?
Why would...
...a younger girl like that want to be with a guy like me?
Howdy, pard. l was wondering if l could ask you a favor. l love you, baby, but the season's over.
Your friend said you were sort of a matchmaker.
Look, you can't believe everything you hear.
-Catch you later.
-You know it.
Okay, lock it up.
Drive safely, now.
-Yeah?
-l was looking for a girl.
For a young girl.
Well, aren't we all?
My question was, why would a young, pretty girl like that...
...go out with a guy like me?
And if you could answer that....
Look, bub....
What is this?
What's this? lt's Rohypnol, is it? ls this Ro? ls this Roofy? ls this a one-sided conversation? What's his name?
-Jerry Zimmer.
-Jerry. Jerry.
Where's the girl?
Where's the girl, Jerry?
-Jerry, where's the girl?
-What girl?
Dose her? You dose her, Jerry?
-Hey.
-What?
-About 10, 15 thou.
-What's that for?
-l think you broke my arm!
-Where's the girl? l think you broke my arm!
Now it's broken.
Where is the girl, Jerry? l never saw that girl.
Where's the girl?
Where did you take her?
Where did you take this girl, Jerry?
That's not the girl.
Where did you take this girl, Jerry?
Take your knife out.
Where did you take the girl, Jerry?
Take his eye out.
You bet your life.
Wait! Wait! Wait! l took the girl. l took the girl to....
Three units remain on the perimeter until further instructions.
The sniper is to stand down.
Plainclothes, transport in the south alley. l got it.
-ls that right?
-Yes.
We run an escort service. There is no impropriety here. There is no illegality.
-Who is she?
-Nadya Tellich.
Serb. Green card, five years ago.
They sign a contract with us for personal services...
...and they pay us so much for each call, and the girls pay us.
-They show you proof of their age?
-Of course. What do you think?
-Have you seen this girl?
-l have not.
Here's the first one.
Was this girl here?
She's new.
This is her first night.
How about that?
Put some fucking clothes on. l want my lawyer.
You don't need one.
We need the girl. Give us the girl.
This girl was not here. l'm entitled to my lawyer.
You're entitled to shit.
You're entitled to tell me what you know. lf the girl was here...
...if you cooperate, l'll see what l can do. l think l can help you, if you tell me now.
Why would l not tell you if the girl was here?
The girl is new.
They told us that it was her first night.
But look here.
There's two pinholes in the photo.
They moved it over.
Photo's missing.
Where is she?
-l don't want to get in trouble.
-You don't know what trouble is. l'm not even sure that was her.
She was sick.
She was not very well.
-She came in here and....
-She came here?
They took her. l told Nadya she shouldn't be here. They took her.
Who is ''they''?
They took her?
Where did they take her?
Honey, you got all the slack in the world until l leave this room.
And then l'm going to zero you out.
Two men.
They gave her a shot. l think that was her.
-Where is she?
-l'm entitled to my rights.
-l'm entitled to my phone call.
-You don't understand.
You'll leave your life, or you'll leave the information in this room.
Where is the girl?
They'll kill me.
Who did you call?
How did you know to come pick her up?
How did they know to get her?
Who did you call? lt's just a number--
Write it down.
Write it down. l'm gonna see what l can do.
Just give me the number. l don't understand.
She's just some girl.
Oh, my God.
They don't know who they've got.
Sir.
Where's the girl?
Sir, we believe she was abducted from this club.
That she was taken to--
That she was taken to a bordello.
-Here in Boston?
-Yes, sir, and that-- That--
-Let's hear it.
-She may have been delivered for sale.
May have been sent down the pipeline, overseas.
-To get to her father?
-No, sir.
We believe they don't know who she is...
...that they just took some girl.
-Just some girl.
-Yes, sir.
How certain are you she was the girl in the whorehouse?
-We--
-She dyed her hair.
They see that red hair....
What do they do, her hair grows out, when they see that red hair...
...somebody recognizes her?
What do they do when they realize who they took?
They kill her.
You're fucking-A right, they kill her.
Okay.
Now, let's talk some common sense.
Who is he?
What can you do for me?
What can you do for me? l need it now. l need it before the press gets it on
Monday, because they will kill her.
The press gets this, the jackals start a feeding frenzy, and she's dead. Help me.
This is the number of a public phone in downtown Boston. lt's a cutout between the bordello and the abductors.
A call is placed when they have a package.
-Stake out the phone.
-We have a watch on the phone.
But more importantly, NSA reports calls placed to that phone regularly.
-They can track calls to the pay phone?
-Yes.
-How?
-They were made from a federal prison.
This is Tariq Asani.
He's a Lebanese national serving life without for kidnapping.
He's the second man in a sex-slavery scheme.
And where is he?
He's in Florence Federal Penitentiary.
He placed the calls to the pay phone.
-We have a plan. l hesitate to--
-Give it to me.
Got some action on the pay phone.
Who's walking up on us?
He's Boston P.D. ln the city, always a reflection. ln the woods, always a sound.
What about the desert?
You don't want to go in the desert.
Let's go. Let's go.
We're moving.
-Where's he going?
-Hold on. Hold on.
One-five-four-nine Alpha-Sierra,
Mass. registration, William Barak.
-Somerville, Mass.
-ls that where he's going?
Owner of record in Essex. ls he heading toward Essex?
What kind of place would it be? lt'd be a beach house.
Get me there.
Get it on the Net.
Everyone off.
Call everyone off. Just me.
Just me and him. lndicate you heard me.
State Police, standing by.
Turn off the white car.
Turn off the white car.
The shooters are going to the beach.
Team of two going to Essex.
Confirm, assault team of two to the beach.
-Withdraw and hold at condition two.
-State Police, request verify.
We believe the hostage is--
Six-five and Mobile 4 are RTB.
Acknowledge.
Stand down and squawk on your A VX.
Get me there. lf the girl's in the house, l'm taking her out. lf it ain't me or her, kill it.
Clear.
Well, I hope you both feel better in the morning. Good night.
-Yes?
-Does an Alan Palmer live here?
-Yes, my husband's at work.
-This is just a routine check, Mrs. Palmer.
We have a license-plate number, but we're not sure of the accuracy.
May I come in?
-What the fuck?
-l heard the TV, so l came in.
Why the hell do you got the TV on?
There's no one here. l don't want to hurt you. l just want to know why the TV's on. l just came to--
That's what l want to know. l'm telling you why l came in.
What do you make of that?
That's the thing. This time of the night....
Do you hear what l'm telling you?
--question.
Even it up. Where's the girl?
Where is the girl? lt's not too late.
Look at me. Look at me.
Where is the girl?
Where is she? lt's Curtis. l'm coming in.
Abort. Abort. Abort.
Cold LZ. Cold hole.
Stand by. Await instructions.
She sets the styles.
She brings us smiles.
She's Betty Coed in college and she's in the news again.
-Shit.
-She had her hair restyled, cut and dyed.
-We caught up with her stylist...
-Turn it off.
...and have reconstructed that new look.
And you're looking at it. l'm out of time.
Keep it locked up.
What about if we had to go off the meter? l need a man, a man who can unquestioningly follow orders.
The door is closed, sir. l need to ask you to do something. l am here to get the girl back, sir.
And there is nothing l will not do...
...to get the girl back.
This man...
...placed a phone call yesterday...
...from the phone bank at Florence to the Copley pay phone.
Here's the cutoff point. Here it is.
This man, Tariq Asani, is to be transported tomorrow...
...with another convict, a man on death row.
A man on death row...
...for their medical procedures. l'll take you step by step through what we've envisioned is gonna happen.
Dispatch acknowledges Florence Unit 5 is Code 7 at Highway 15.
You fellas all right?
Hey, help me. Help me, man.
Buck me up, man.
-Hey, l need some help.
-Yeah, l'll help you out. Get out.
Me and my brother need some shit right here.
-You marked him paid in full.
-Yeah, that's what l did.
Hey, give me a cigarette, man.
Wait over there. l'll be right back.
Yeah, but break me out of this.
Hey, yo, just throw me the keys, and l'll do it. l gotta do some cleaning first.
Motherfuckers want to hook me up to some injection machine, man.
Motherfuckers want to take my life who just got well here, you know?
Who just got well.
Then the hand of God came down with an outstretched arm and freed my ass.
You know?
Hey, baby, pass me some my way, you know?
Sorry, my man. Traveling light.
No, wait. Wait. Don't shoot me.
Don't shoot me. l can get us out of the country tonight.
Oh, God, please don't shoot me! No! l swear on my mother.
Look at me. Please.
No. l swear to you. A seaplane, tonight.
Help me.
Please, believe me.
Now, why in the world would l believe a lying convict like you? l can get us out. l swear.
Help me. Help me, and l will treat you like a brother.
My brother used to beat me.
Nice guess, though.
No, no, hold on! Wait.
Just make one phone call.
One fucking phone call. Go into the house and make one phone call.
An aviation company.
Tell them the word l say, and they will say the plane will meet us tonight. l swear. The plane will meet us tonight.
You a fag, my friend?
-No, l'm not.
-Then what are you looking at me for? l was just thinking how fucking surprised you're gonna be.
Because, baby, you just did that fucking good turn. l'm gonna make you rich, fat and happy for the rest of your life.
No, just get me on the plane.
You like girls?
Better question: Where you been so long, do you like girls?
We have-- You will have...
-...the most beautiful--
-Yeah, beautiful women.
Not women, baby.
Girls. You got to trust me.
All young. All blond.
And this all takes place where? ln Dubai. ln Yemen.
When we get to Maskala.
And now, what's Maskala?
-When we get to Dubai.
-What's Maskala? lt's where we clean them up.
We ship them rough...
...we make them nice and smooth, and everybody's happy.
You're just a philosopher, then, huh?
How about making me happy tonight? lf there's a girl in the pipeline tonight, you shall have her.
What do you say to that? l say you're a stone-cold whoremaster.
Fuck. l'm bleeding bad, my friend.
--what you need?
Need some tailoring tools.
If I had a wish list, I'd get you to a drugstore. I'd get some morphine.
That'd get you back on Happy Street.
Then you get me on that plane tonight.
-Where's the gauze, ma'am?
-Right behind you.
The helo just went down.
Don't whisper. lt draws heat. The helo?
The assault helicopter.
You'll be alone for the first few minutes. Then....
That's it. You'll have no backup at the house.
Well, there you go, then.
You said never go in without an over-watch.
Yeah, that's fine, pal, but this is the fleet.
You deliver him in the door, you know they're gonna waste you.
Give me all your magazines.
Give me all your magazines.
Give me your piece.
Okay.
Just this, ma'am.
Fourteen ninety-five.
-Keep the change.
-l want to talk to you.
Give me your ammunition.
Hey, mister, you forgot your change. lt's a cop! lt's a cop!
Don't move. Stay still.
Call 9-1-1!
Get back! Call 9-1-1!
No hostage, no hostage. We're in recovery.
Our 10 fast ropers....
Kill it.
Get us the fuck out of here.
All right, break it down, pack it up.
Now, now, now. Move it!
They hit the house. Girl wasn't there.
They found some signs.
She may have been there.
So we're going home to deploy to Dubai.
Pack it up, strap it down.
The girls are taken from the house.
A holding facility, a compound? lt is my understanding, a compound.
-Drugged?
-He said.
''We ship them rough.
We clean them up.
Taken from Maskala to the Royale Hotel in Dubai.''
-All right. That's it.
-l've got you.
Affirmative.
Affirmative. No, keep the line open.
They'll have satellite photos of the Maskala house...
...and the Royale Hotel, Dubai, on the ground.
You'll restage, wheels up for Dubai two hours after touchdown.
How many teams?
What? Three.
Three teams for Dubai.
Press has the report.
She missed her first class.
-Punch out the TRX....
-How you doing, chief?
Five by five.
All my readings are nominal.
Six two. Seven two.
What time is it?
What do you care? l fucked up.
Hey, you want a...?
You want some more dope?
Want a Dr. Pepper? l tried to help.
Yeah, well...
...that's usually when people do fuck up.
Listen.
You're gonna take that fight to bed with you for a long time.
You don't gotta do it all now.
Where's the girl?
We gotta get the girl back. l saw the sign.
What? l saw the sign.
Then you are truly blessed.
Yep, all set up.
All right, let's get your flight plans.
-There's one on the thing.
-Yeah. l got three pallets for the lead plane.
You still carrying that?
Yeah, l suppose l do.
Black, Jacqueline A. 24341924.
Can you get me on, sir?
Can you get me on?
-l'm just a worker bee.
-Two fellas in green.
Man-to-man, can you get me on the plane?
Why would l want to do that, sergeant? l mean, if you owed me money or something...
-...might want to give you a job.
-They're gonna need a woman there.
For her.
They haven't thought about that yet, but they will.
Can you get me on the plane?
Thank you, sergeant.
Stand by, number five.
-All right.
-Keep on top of the tac air navigation.
Everyone's gotta be in the loop.
Guard frequency is 1727.9.
All right, gentlemen, may l have your attention for one moment, please.
We'll be going through it on the plane.
The mission is to safely extract the hostage.
To safely extract the hostage. ln outline, this is a smash and grab. lt is a straightforward extraction.
The hostage will be in transit.
One team will assault the vehicle.
One team will secure the perimeter.
Who's got the girl?
One team ready to lay supportive fire.
And exfil as per your ops plan.
The rules of engagement are: weapons free.
-Weapons free.
-Go.
We expect slight, l repeat, slight opposition.
Okay, let's pack it up and put it on the bus.
Sir!
It is confirmed.
The death of Laura Newton.
We have word from the Coast Guard that the bodies have been identified.
Reporting from Harvard Square, this is Jody Snider.
-Can there be any doubt?
-The Secret Service, for obvious reasons...
...keep meticulous records, the DNA, the fingerprints.
-Yes.
-And she had just been in the water...
...for four hours, apparently.
And she had been sailing with one of her professors, Gerald Sloane.
We are gonna have some video coming in just now.
And we see the body bags being removed from the water.
This is off of Martha's Vineyard, here.
The divers, the Navy divers in the water, who recovered her body...
...and that of Professor Sloane.
As we look at these-- This video, shocking video of....
You might want to eat something.
Real deal is:
The boat went down...
...girl and the professor washed up naked.
Coked out.
Coast Guard dresses them up.
Nice knife.
Yeah.
Got it off an East German fella.
He give it to you for a gift?
No.
As l recall, he was...
...rather reluctant to part with it.
Yeah, l always knew you Marines were a weepy bunch of motherfuckers. l got something in my eye.
--tragedy such as this.
Yes, particularly coming right at the start of his reelection campaign.
Hey, Joe, come take a look at this.
-How you been?
-Here you go, Dad.
-Working hard.
-Bet you have.
-Morning.
-Howdy, kiddo.
How you been, Billy?
-Gallon gonna be enough?
-You been looking at my house?
Nope. Just trying to sell paint.
But now that you mention it....
-John.
-Hey, Mr. Reese.
-How's life on the road?
-Made some sales, missed some sales.
-Yeah.
-Those new seeds come in?
No, John, they have not. l beg your pardon. l know that little plot is your baby. l'm gonna call them up and make it right. l want to plant them in the dark of the moon.
-That's the old ways, isn't it?
-ls it? Yeah, l suppose it is.
-Expected to see you a few days ago.
-Yeah. Took the long way home.
How'd you find me?
Well, didn't l just draw down on my luck.
-Bobby, l need to talk to you.
-My name ain't Bobby. l need to talk to you.
What's the matter, you got post-traumatic stress disorder? l hear they say there might be environmental causes.
-Are they going to Dubai?
-How would l know?
Because there's a slave trade going on of American women.
-They sending you in?
-We'll leave that to our betters.
-Why don't you ask them?
-Why would l want to know? l ain't a planner, l ain't a thinker. l never wanted to be.
You got to set your motherfucker to receive.
Listen to me.
They don't go through the door, we don't ask why.
That's not a cost, it's benefit.
Because we get to travel light.
They tell me where to go.
-Tell me what to do when l get there.
-What about--?
You wanted to go through the looking glass.
How was it?
Was it more fun than miniature golf?
-Who frisked the son of a bitch?
-What son of a bitch?
The Secret Service agent, shot himself?
Screwing his girlfriend.
Killed himself in shame.
-Shot himself with a hideout pistol?
-Yeah.
Who frisked the son of a bitch?
You'll have to go half-speed, baby, because l don't follow you.
-ls there an operation in Dubai, sir?
-Pal...
...the girl fell off a boat. She's dead. l'm on leave. l don't know nothing about Dubai. l don't know what the hell you want with me.
There's a Army depending on us for the truth.
You can lie to anyone else.
Never lie to a Ranger.
Okay, so that's you calling me a liar.
Sir, l saw the sign!
-What sign is that?
-At the beach house. She was there.
She wasn't there. She died on a boat. l saw the sign.
Sir.
You saw the sign?
You were up for a week.
You don't know what you saw your first time out.
Sir, l know what l saw.
You didn't see no sign because she wasn't there. The hardest thing?
You know what it is? lt isn't going in the door, it's coming out.
You ever come down off of drugs?
The most powerful drug in the world is adrenaline.
-l told you everything l know. Stand down.
-Look in the bag.
-Stand down!
-Sir, under my mat!
This got caught in my mat at the beach house.
Would you tell me what that is?
The girl is not dead, sir.
Would you show me where you found the earring? l laid the mat down right here.
What?
The house looked closer that night.
Barometer's falling.
Low pressure, objects appear farther.
Watch the weather, baby, because it's going to change.
Yeah.
Will you show me where you saw the sign?
Yeah, hold on.
Hey, it was over here!
Let me speak to the Chinaman.
You tell him, ''The only man ever heard him call on Jesus.''
Yeah.
Yoke me out.
New set of clothes from the skin out.
Full set of papers. l don't care where, but now.
You gotta get me to the tall corn. l'll get you the money.
All right.
Two hours.
No.
Wait.
Not two hours.
Something later. l'll get back to you.
The original building, of course, dates to 1928.
The center for the treatment of alcoholism, later, of substance abuse...
...takes its current name, The Clearings, from the original Johnson farm.
Would you please follow me to the right.
The farm and its 2000 acres were a gift from the Johnsons....
-What could be worse than losing a child?
-Yes.
You'd like to comfort them, but you don't know how. l always think it's best just to--
-What is it?
-Security breach. Probably a phone threat. lt's all right. They're moving her down to transport now. lt's okay, l'm with Secret Service.
Guess again. l'm Secret Service. And you'll follow my directions, or l'll shoot you dead.
-Yes.
-Step away from the door.
Yes. l have a message for her.
-l have something to tell her.
-Take two steps to your left.
Yes. l have a message for Mrs. Newton. l'm sure you do. Spread your arms, please, out to the sides.
Open your hands.
-Open the box.
-l.... l'm 10 minutes from the bomb squad. lf it's happy birthday, let's do it now.
Open the box.
They took her protection.
Her father was in town.
They took the Secret Service detail off her to take him tomcatting.
He didn't come to see her, he came to get laid.
He's been doing it for years.
He took her protection.
She got snatched.
The girl on the boat, how do you fake the DNA?
-Laura Newton's alive.
-l don't know if Laura Newton's alive. l know they lied.
How do you fake the DNA?
You don't fake the DNA.
You issue a press release.
-Her father would let her die?
-Did you try to contact him?
-l did, yes.
-And you still don't get it, do you?
You don't get it.
These people are savages.
They don't know how many children they have.
She was snatched while he was cheating on his wife. lt comes out, they lose the election.
So they said, ''Let her go.''
-Who?
-His handlers.
-What does he know?
-What they tell him.
-What did they tell him?
-That she was dead.
-Why?
-So he'd stop looking for her.
Oh, baby.
Where are you going?
-l have to get a lot of running room.
-Wait. Who will get her back?
-What?
-Who will get her back?
-l did my part.
-What part was that?
-They gotta get her back.
-There is no ''they.''
-l'm just a worker bee--
-She'll die.
-Then go through the mother.
-l'm her mother!
She gave birth to her. l raised her. l'm her mother.
She's just a little girl.
You have to get her back. l have nobody.
Nobody ever loved her but me.
She's just a little girl. lt's been quite a long while since my last confession.
We were getting shelled in the open.
And l confessed that l was frightened.
So l suppose l'm.... l suppose l'm frightened now.
There was a king...
...and he had a daughter...
...and she was abducted.
He vowed to protect her, you see, but...
...while he was indulging himself, shamefully...
...she was abducted.
They tried to get her back and failed.
Now, his advisors realized that if the girl returned...
...it would reveal the king's shame to the country.
So they told him that she was dead.
Ain't nobody here but two people in green. lt goes beyond that.
Nothing goes beyond that.
This girl, they told the king that she was dead...
...and everybody grieved.
But she was alive.
Then you better go get her.
We know this house.
Maskala is a suburban villa in Dubai.
Some people operate a halfway house there...
...for young women they have coerced or drugged...
...into spending their short lives as whores for Arabian tourists.
Of late, the girls have been, in the main, from the former Sov bloc.
Now and again, a North American girl, if she is exceedingly lovely...
...blond, usually blond...
...will unfortunately find her way to Dubai.
They travel drugged.
They are tidied up and sold. For some reason, most of them are sold to Yemen.
The girls are generally held in Dubai till the end of the month...
...when the merrymakers fly in to examine their purchases and take them home.
-And then?
-That is ''and then.''
-This is an American girl?
-And if that were so? lf that were so, why don't your people go and fetch her?
-Why don't they go and get her, Bobby?
-Your intel, two men. lnfil, exfil.
-Hardware and comms.
-And comms to what? l cannot give you.
-You could when you were a Boy Scout.
-l'm not in Scouts anymore.
You heard of the private sector?
That's where you found me.
Well, then sell me something.
What the fuck are we talking about?
-That's what it costs?
-That's what it costs you. lt's a straight-up snatch.
We got one, two guys take down the car.
Then what are we talking about?
A Conex container? One guy for a day?
Who's looking for a whore?
This job's a gimme. This job's nothing.
Then why don't your people go and get her?
-l could hire anybody.
-So go hire them.
You talked to me. That's my price.
-There's another alternative.
-What?
As l said, we know this house.
-There are some people in this house...
-Avi.
...that if you were to go while you were there...
...if you said hello to them for me, l could cut your price.
-What do you think l am?
-l don't know what you are.
You ain't a planner.
You're a shooter. l don't know what you are doing here. l think you're off the reservation.
And l think there are people looking for you.
You call, ''Yoke me out.''
Then you call for information.
You don't need information.
You need advice.
You wanna get this girl?
Are you sure she is there?
Are you sure she is alive?
You let me make a call, and l will tell you. l will see if l can make peace. lf l cannot, l will help you disappear.
Because you heard me call on Jesus.
Let me help you to see if you can go home.
Excuse me. Fasten your seat belt.
We're landing soon.
Thank you.
Sir, your container is booked out on Transgeneve.
Flight 562.
1340, tomorrow.
Good. Thank you very much. l appreciate your help.
Mate, can l have a quick word? l've got an outbound at 8:15.
-l'm in a bit of a hurry.
-Just a moment.
-Yes, sir. Let me see your form.
-Thanks, man, l really appreciate it.
Let me see your form.
-Sir? Sir?
-Yes, l'll seal you in.
-Sorry to press you.
-No, no. lt's been a very busy day.
Same wherever you go.
Guess that's just human nature, but no need to tell you your business.
There you go. Your container is all sealed for you.
-Thank you for your patience.
-Thank you.
Have a great day.
Hey, mate.
Hey, mate.
Are you Mr. Brown's cousin?
No, Mr. Jackson couldn't come.
-l was expecting you on a later flight.
-How about that?
Yes, this is good work.
Your job tomorrow is put us in, seal us in, walk away.
-And in Geneva?
-Let's go look at the ground.
About 25, 26 yards from the corner, l want the gasoline.
Tomorrow, the car comes around the corner--
How do we stop the car?
-We slow it down with two Bedouin women.
-What do you want the gasoline for?
-Do you speak Arabic?
-Yes, sir. l want the women here.
At your signal, they go in the street...
...start a screaming match. l shoot the tires out.
The driver comes out. You cap him. l get the girl.
-What if he doesn't come out?
-l got five gallons of gasoline. l douse the car. l throw a match.
They're coming out.
When you get me the two women...
...pay them half now, half tomorrow.
Then l want you to show me the hive.
We'll lay low till tonight.
Then show me the house where they keep the girl.
All right. Limousine, usually. lt makes a turn, comes down
Abu Baku, where we were today.
My job is the hostage.
Your job is the opposition.
You come in on the driver's side.
You cap the driver.
The map's wrong.
This isn't north. lt's flipped.
You have to be on the east side. l need the sun in the driver's eyes. l've gotta come in on the opposite side.
How did you know that was north?
That's Cassiopeia.
That's my girlfriend.
They're moving the girl.
Looks like it.
-Did you burn me?
-Can't say l did.
-You wanna prove it?
-Well, the Lord hates a coward.
We're taking the girl now.
Keep your eyes on me.
We're gonna fight the girl out. lf l go down, get her to Geneva.
There's money in it for you. l'm gonna grab the girl.
You keep them off my back.
You wanna gossip or you wanna shoot somebody?
Stop. Wait, wait.
Shut your fucking mouth.
-Where am l?
-l'm here to take you home.
You got to keep still. l'm here to take you home.
Drink it.
-Who are you?
-Drink it.
How are you? l'm sick.
No, it's just a formal question.
Cover your head.
-What, you don't like blondes?
-The whole world likes blondes.
That's why you're here. Put it on.
Put it on.
And stay away from the window.
-l need a smoke.
-You can't smoke it.
What's it gonna give me, cancer?
Smell of American tobacco carries in the desert air.
That's why you wanna stay out of the desert. l could make you give me the smoke.
Keep it together.
Keep your voice down.
We're gonna get you home.
Fuck it. l don't wanna go home.
Nobody there cares about me. l'm just a whore. l'm just a little whore.
Yeah, how'd you get like that? l was raised by wolves.
What are you crying for?
We're going home.
Did my father send you?
That's right.
Why?
Why? He wants me dead.
He sent me.
One man.
''One riot, one Ranger.''
You ever heard that?
Leonidas, King of Sparta...
...when a neighboring state would plead for military aid, would send one man.
-Well, there you go.
-You ever hear that?
No. l think we went to different schools.
You ever hear the one about the king who turned his daughter into gold?
Yeah. He turned his daughter into gold.
America's sweetheart.
His fucking trick pony. His election ad.
Fucking cocksuckers.
He took the guards away. l just wanted to talk to him.
He wouldn't even come and see me.
He said he would come and see me.
He sent a man.
''Here's what you tell the press.
Don't talk. Don't tell anybody.'' l told him l was gonna tell.
He had to come and see me.
And he wouldn't even come and see me.
He sent me. l don't wanna go home.
Look, you go home...
...some wave their hats, some turn their backs. lt's all the same.
None of them know where you've been. lt's all the same.
You tough, honey? l think you're tough. l'm cold. lt'll be fine, baby.
You're gonna take a little flight in here.
-You're coming with me.
-No, l've got to seal you in.
You want a cigarette?
-Can you produce one?
-Believe l can.
Sit down.
You said they couldn't violate their airspace.
-What?
-They couldn't violate their airspace.
That's right.
They couldn't violate their airspace.
-That's why you had to come alone.
-That's why l had to come alone.
But l tell you what...
...when this plane touches down...
...you will be in the bosom of a company of United States Marines...
...all straight up and down and vying for your attention.
What could be better?
Do you have a comb? l don't believe l ever carried one.
Thank you.
For what?
For coming for me.
Well, what the hell.
What's that? l believe it's an apple seed.
-Johnny Appleseed.
-Yeah, that's me. Just a man of peace.
Get on the phone. Get to our people.
See if they can seal off--
There she is. Get her!
Cut him off. Cut him off!
Laura Newton!
Laura!
You! The man.
Step away from the girl.
Walk to me, Miss Newton.
Walk to me.
My name is Stoddard.
You've seen me in your home...
...with Mr. Burch.
You're almost home. Walk to me.
This man is a rogue agent.
He came here to take you...
...for the ransom.
Even if it was true, you're coming with me.
-Get up.
-Laura?
This man was sent to harm you.
He knows l'm not leaving here without you.
Give her up.
Give the girl up...
...and we can talk.
We have control of the airport.
Let her come forward.
We leave in a minute.
Let me see what's going on.
-Okay.
-Mr. Scott.
-Robert Scott.
-One more lap. Okay?
We're gonna go get you on that plane.
You're gonna make it. Okay?
-Okay. Here we go.
-Laura, walk away from him.
He knows the game is up.
He knows it's over. You're safe.
-Get on the plane!
-Bring out the camera.
-What do you see?
-l'm getting it!
Get it out! l'm not leaving until l find out what's going on.
-Find it. What do you see?
-Hold on. Hold on.
We've got you. We've got you now.
We've got you.
Thank God we found you.
Here you go. Come get her!
Thank goodness we found you.
Hey, get her out of here!
Clean this mess up. l'm at the airport. lt appears to be a gunfight.
A gunfight!
No, l don't know who. l'm staying to tape it.
Hold the plane!
You could have come home!
You know that?
You dumb son of a bitch!
We needed you! lt's World War lll out there!
World War lll!
Do you read the papers?
And that little whore wanted to bring the man down. At this time!
-l'm going home?
-That's right, honey. You bet you are.
And just one more thing.
-l'm getting in the car.
-No, honey, there is no car.
We have to get you out of here.
No. Who are you?
Me and Mr. Scott came to take you home.
Do you know what we've had to do all these years...
...to keep her under wraps?
You shortened her life, pal!
We would have let her go to the desert, but you had to put on your thinking cap!
Hold on one minute!
-Go on, what do you see?
-Okay.
-Are you getting it?
-Get on the plane.
Oh, my God.
-l got her.
-Hold the plane! Laura Newton!
Get her on the plane!
Get her out of here!
-Call the tower!
-Wait! Wait!
-Laura!
-Get us out of here.
Get her on the plane!
Get this girl on the plane!
Get her on the plane!
Get her on the plane!
Get us out of here!
Get us up!
Oh, baby.
Oh, baby. ls she safe?
Yeah.
She's safe.
We brought the girl back.
Yeah. She just took the long way home.
CSV World News International.
And as we return again...
...the administration, forced by this terrible abduction--
-Thank God they had that ability.
-That's right.
To capitalize on the drowning deaths, to capitalize on the unfortunate deaths...
...of those two people sailing.
Here is the arrival of Laura's father.
Who can forget these images?
-Laura Newton in the United States.
-Yes, indeed.
Many believe that Robert Burch is due not only the thanks...
...but the admiration of the entire American people for his role.
Terror takes many forms.
I can conceive of no act of terror greater than the unforgivable...
...the ultimate destruction, that of a human soul.
The kidnapping of Laura Newton has revealed to us...
...has allowed us to confront and will allow us to eradicate...
...the international traffic in souls.
It was brought about because of a family's love for their daughter.
A simple American act.
The love of Americans for all our daughters...
...who are the soul....
Who are the soul of this great country.
-We thank God...
-Time to go home.
...this one daughter has returned home.
We vow that we will not rest...
-Lucky man.
-...until all who have suffered her fate...
...are once again reunited with their families.
Thank you.
<b>I'M NOT SCARED</b>
- Michele!
- Maria!
I fell!
Where are you going?
- They broke.
- I told you not to come.
Now what?
We'll tape them.
Let's go.
Come on, run!
- How gross!
- They passed by here.
There's a house!
Congratulations, you finally made it.
My sister hurt herself.
- The others?
- They're down there.
- Who won?
- Skull.
- This place is mine.
- Why?
Because I saw it first.
Finders keepers...
Who's the rotten egg?
You, because you came last.
I had to stop because my sister got hurt.
- You lose.
- Who has to pay up?
She does.
No fair, why always me?
Let's vote on it.
He can't always decide everything.
Let's vote, I say you lost.
- Me too.
- Me too.
- Me too.
- Me too.
See?
So what do I have to do?
- Show it to us.
- No way!
What does she have to show us?
- You lost, so do it.
- No.
No?
Aren't you going to say anything?
Alright, but I won't play with you anymore, jerks!
- Are you crying?
- No.
Stop!
I'll pay up, I came last.
Fuck!
Walk across that.
He was the Lizard Man,..
He could walk on walls.
Then he became the Glass Man, if he falls he breaks.
- What are you saying?
- Nothing.
Leap onto that branch and climb down.
Michele,..
Give me my glasses.
- I lost them.
- Mom will kill you.
Wait here.
A cave filled with gold and gems.
- Did you find them?
- Run, we're late.
There's Mom.
Where'd you go?
I was searching for you!
How many times I gotta tell you to stay nearby?
Michele, this time...
- We went...
- Home, right now!
Dad's here!
Dad!
You're heavy!
Daddy's doll, gimme a kiss.
Where were you?
Playing by the stream.
How long are you staying?
For a bit. You broke 'em?
- Again?
- She fell.
We can fix them with tape.
- Michele, what did I tell you?
- Never mind.
Did you do your push-ups?
- No, he didn't.
- Yes, I did.
We'll see, if you don't beat me, no present for you.
- A present? What present?
- What present? - You'll see.
So...
Christ, are your muscles made of butter?
Come on.
You're a sissy.
Maria, help him out.
Give us the present now!
Anna, get the box.
Easy!
- A boat.
- No.
It ain't no boat, it's a gondola.
- What's that?
- A boat you only find in Venice.
- With only one oar?
- What's an oar?
A stick that moves the boat.
- Pretty!
- No.
You can't play with this.
The Police from the Artistic Heritage Unit..
Recovered two precious
16th century sculptures..
Attributed to Benvenuto Cellini.
Whose turn to get the wine?
- Maria's.
- I don't feel like it. You go. - No!
- It's your turn.
- I'm not going.
- Why not?
- My head hurts.
That's what you always say!
Shut up, let me hear!
Knock it off! Go, Michele.
It's not fair.
After the defeat of the fencing team in Hamburg...
What happened?
It's her turn to get the wine.
In war, know how they'd decide who went on deadly missions?
Whoever picks the broken one, has to go.
It's your turn!
You lost, go get the wine.
So they bury him..
And he remains in the belly of the earth..
Among secrets, corpses, bones, skeletons, and darkness.
Where were you?
Your Mom's looking for you.
They're mad.
Are the shoes comfy?
We'll buy them.
Hope I can convince my Mom, they're really cute.
- Anna, what do you think?
- Let me see. What do you think?
How much you want for these?
- How much are they?
- It's a good brand.
I've got other models, too.
Pino, your son's here.
- Where were you?
- Wandering around.
Wandering like hell!
You know what time it is?
It's almost 2!
No one knew where you were.
Your Mom went looking for you.
You gotta stop doing whatever the fuck you please!
If you wanna do as you please, then leave.
Get lost.
Get lost!
Michele, come down!
- What do you want?
- Dinner's ready.
Tell them I'm not their son anymore,
I'm not coming back.
- You're not my brother either?
- No!
- Then can I have your comic books?
- No.
That has nothing to do with it.
Mom will get mad.
- Where's Dad?
- He went out, he'll be back late.
- What's for dinner?
- Mashed potatoes and eggs.
Good morning!
Did you fall out of bed?
- I had lots on my mind.
- What was on your mind?
Give daddy a kiss.
- I thought you were mad.
- What was on your mind?
- Tell us.
- Sad thoughts.
Get ready 'cause tonight we're gonna arm wrestle.
Anna!
Buy me some sausages.
- Dad, when will you be back?
- Late!
Michele.
One, two, three, red light!
Michele.
- What are you doing?
- I'm not playing anymore.
Want me to come along?
Forget about him.
Water...
Are you alive?
- Water...
- What did you say? I didn't understand.
- Water.
- You're thirsty! You want water?
- Thirsty.
- Wait.
Hungry.
You're hungry?
I don't have anything to eat.
I have to go home now.
If you want,
I'll bring something tomorrow.
Are you a child?
What are you doing here?
I know you.
You're Amitrano's son, right?
You better not come here no more.
If I see you again...
See them things?
They're always hungry, they even eat bones.
Michele...
- What are you doing?
- Nothing, just playing.
Put everything back.
- I don't want anymore.
- Eat your meat.
It gives me a headache.
- I can't take this anymore!
- Anna... If she doesn't want it...
No big deal.
Someone's coming in a few days.
So no fuss and no whining.
Who is it?
A friend.
- What's his name?
- Sergio.
What a funny name.
A Dad and Mom are expecting a baby.
But instead, two are born, one blond, one brunet.
The brunet is normal, the blond is crazy.
When she nurses him, he bites her and draws blood.
The Mom doesn't want him anymore.
So she tells the Dad to kill him.
The Dad takes him up to a tall mountain,..
But he can't stab him because it's a sin.
So he digs a hole and puts him in it.
He brings him water and food so he won't die.
So he..
Won't... die.
Hi, Michele.
What do you need?
What can I buy with 500 liras?
Don't know, depends on what you need.
- Something good, do you have chocolate cookies?
- No.
Sweets are over there.
A doughnut, a chocolate bar...
Or a Kit Kat.
They're all good.
- Assunta...
- What is it?
If someone's hungry, what can they buy with 500 liras?
They can buy bread.
When someone's hungry, they buy bread.
I wanted to ask you:
Do you know Felice,
Skull's brother? Felice Natale.
I hate him.
Is he the one who feeds you?
I saw him driving away from here,..
So I thought...
I'm going home now.
Okay?
Bye bye.
Are you deaf?
Listen. Sorry.
I thought of something.
If you won't eat the bread, will you give it back?
Let me explain. If Felice comes and finds it, he'll figure it out.
Then I'll come get it.
Listen...
What's your name?
What's your Dad's name?
Mine is named Pino.
Is your Dad named Pino too, by chance?
- I'm leaving.
- Coons...
Did you say something?
I don't understand.
- Coons...
- Coons?
- What do you mean?
- Raccoons.
If you leave the window open, raccoons will come in..
- And steal cakes, cookies...
- There are no coons here.
Raccoons can bite people.
Did you eat a piece of meat yesterday?
It's very important.
Are you my Guardian Angel?
I'm not an angel.
What's a Guardian Angel?
The one who says true things.
You can tell me,
I won't tell anyone.
I'm not an angel.
I'm Michele.
Michele Amitrano, fifth grade.
Dead?
- What?
- Am I dead?
- Dead? What?
- I'm dead!
I'm dead! I'm dead! I'm dead!
I'm dead! I'm dead! I'm dead!
Remember when Mrs. Destani..
- Told us about the miracle of Lazarus?
- Yes.
When Lazarus came back to life, did he know he'd been dead?
No, I guess he thought he felt ill.
Do you think only Jesus can bring the dead back to life?
Dunno, but my Aunt told me a true story.
Once, someone's son died all mangled under a car.
The Dad couldn't handle it, he cried all day.
He gave a psychic all his money to bring his son back to life.
So the psychic said: "Go home, your son will return tonight".
The Dad waited, but the son didn't return,..
So he went to bed.
Then he heard steps in the kitchen.
He got up and saw his mangled son,..
With his brains dripping out.
His son said he hated him, it was his fault he died.
He left him in the street to go chase after women.
And then?
So his Dad set him on fire with gasoline.
- He did good.
- Sure did.
- What are you doing?
- I have to pee, go to sleep.
- What do they say in Milan?
- What the hell do you want them to say?
They said it would end soon,..
It's been months! What's going on?
I don't understand!
You don't need to understand. The less you think, the less you'll screw up.
It'll take time.
It might take six months.
- Six months?
- Six months, a year, whatever it takes.
My ass!
Shut up!
They ain't telling us anything!
You don't need to know anything.
You just have to keep the kid hidden.
Hide him and stay cool.
You've fucked up over and over again.
He's the stupidest of all.
Like I said, you're not capable.
Relax.
Relax? They ain't paying!
They said Carducci had money coming out of his ass.
Bullshit!
Shut up!
You're the worst here,
'cause you think.
- Me?
- Yes.
Fuck you, expert my ass.
You're an idiot, let me tell you!
The news!
Anna, turn off the light.
Turn up the volume.
Good evening.
Human rights defense..
And patience in negotiations,
Carter says in Berlin.
In Bonn tomorrow, the industrialized
Countries Summit begins.
Alarm in Trent for a toxic cloud...
I'll have one.
They ain't gonna talk about it today either.
- They didn't yesterday.
- Well?
I can't hear a thing.
Here it is!
Throughout the whole region, the search continues..
For little Filippo, kidnapped in Milan.
The Police are following new leads which seem to be promising.
We will now air Luisa Carducci's appeal to the kidnappers.
What the fuck does she want?
I'm Filippo's mother.
I'm speaking to my son's kidnappers.
I implore you, don't hurt him.
He's a good boy, well mannered, and very shy.
I implore you, treat him well.
The sum requested is steep,..
- Even for our family.
- They'll cough up the money.
You threatened to cut his ear off.
I beg you not to do it.
I must make another request:
Tell Filippo his Mom and Dad love him dearly..
- And always think of him.
- We'll cut off two ears!
Two!
Who are you?
I'm Michele, Michele Amitrano.
Sounds like the name of a singer.
I'm Materia Sergio.
Pleased to meet you.
Didn't they ever teach you to knock?
Sorry.
- Are you Pino's son?
- What?
- Are you Pino's son?
- Yes.
You're a quiet kid.
I like quiet kids.
Are you obedient, too?
Then close the door and piss off.
- What?
- Close the door and piss off!
Mom!
Mom!
- Who's that in the bathroom?
- Let go of me!
It's Sergio, your Dad's friend, he told you already.
- How long is he staying?
- A few days.
Pass me the other stuff.
- Where will he sleep?
- In your sister's bed.
- And her?
- With us.
Pass it here.
- And me?
- In your room.
I don't want to sleep with him!
I want to sleep in your bed, too.
Don't be silly.
You're too big, how are you gonna fit?
- I'll make myself small.
- Enough already!
Come here.
Come.
I can't take it anymore.
If you only knew...
Don't you make it worse, do it for me.
- Come on!
- It's not fair.
But it's not for long.
Damn it!
You're Filippo, right?
Your Mom says she loves you and misses you.
She said it on TV yesterday, and she said not to worry.
- My mother is dead.
- What?
It's a lie! Mommy is dead!
So is my Dad and my Grandma, they're all dead and live in holes!
Is your Mom blonde?
Is there a painting of a boat in your house?
It's not a boat.
It's a sailing ship.
See?
Your Mom was on TV, you could see the sailing ship.
She said that she and your Dad love you very much.
Then why don't they come get me?
- I don't know.
- And why am I here?
I don't know.
You don't know anything!
- Go away! - Stop it!
- You're not my Guardian Angel!
- Leave me alone!
- Stop it!
Stop it!
Go away!
I came here for you!
- I came all the way here for you and you're throwing me out.
- Go away!
Alright, I'm leaving and never coming back.
You'll be all alone and they'll cut off your ears!
I'm not your Guardian Angel!
- Wait.
- What do you want?
Please, stay.
- But if you act crazy, I'm leaving.
- I won't.
- Why don't you open your eyes?
- Come here.
I knew you'd be back, the raccoons told me so.
Not the raccoons again!
Open your eyes.
- I can't.
- Just for a second.
- You're small.
- Well, I'm ten.
- Me too. What grade are you in?
- Fifth, and you?
- Me too! We're the same!
- Yes.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing, she's swimming.
- She'll die like that.
- She's broken anyway.
- Where are the others?
- By the stream.
Salvatore was asking for you.
Michele, come here!
You upset your mother.
She says you don't wanna sleep with Sergio.
What'll Sergio think?
I don't care.
- Is Sergio your boss?
- What are you saying?
- He makes the decisions?
- No, he decides nothing.
He's a friend, that's all.
Ain't you glad I came back?
- Yes, I am.
- Well then?
I want to leave here.
How come?
You don't like it no more?
Yes, but...
Let's arm wrestle.
Let's see.
- What's your problem?
- Nothing.
If you're good, when I'm done with everything,..
We'll go to the beach.
I promise. Really.
I know you're awake.
This is my home in Brazil.
You can't see shit because my friend Paco's in front.
He's dead.
This is my wife, my lady.
You have a Negro wife?
Colored.
Brazil's some country!
Life costs nothing.
Served, venerated...
It's not like this shitty country.
- Is Brazil far away?
- Very far. Very.
Sleep now.
- What?
- Sleep!
FILIPPO CARDUCCI IS ALIVE!
- I made a cake.
- With cream.
Come gimme a kiss.
Go eat.
Dad?-
He's out with Sergio.
He's taking us to the beach next week.
We'll go eat mussels in a restaurant!
Michele!
It's Salvatore.
Go ahead.
Bring him a piece.
- Is it good?
- Yes..
Look what my Uncle sent me.
- Nice, huh?
- Really nice.
This has an extendable ladder.
This one even has a bed.
This is a police car, it opens and has a siren.
- He gave you all of them?
- Yes.
- This is nice too.
- It doesn't open, I don't like it.
I like it though.
- Will you give it to me?
- I can't, my Uncle will get mad.
- But he's in America.
- I can't.
I'll give you some "Tex" comic books for it.
I already read them all.
Will you give it to me if I tell you a secret?
A secret isn't worth a van.
This one is, I swear.
But you have to swear to God..
You won't tell anyone, not even Skull.
- What are you doing?
- Leave us alone! Come with me.
Know that house we went to?
There's a secret hole in the courtyard.
There's a boy inside, he's alive and he's crazy.
- What's he doing in there?
- Some grown-ups put him in there.
His Mom went on TV, but they don't want to give him back.
Actually, they want to cut off his ear!
- I don't believe it.
- It's true!
His name is Filippo.
I'll show him to you.
- No, it's too far.
- You don't like this secret?
Not really.
So you won't give me the van?
Take it, I don't like it anyway.
They cleaned you up!
Who did it?
- They came down and washed me.
- They took off your chain.
Look what I brought you.
It's crumbled, but...
More!
Give me more!
I don't have anymore.
I gave you all of it.
If there's any left,
I'll bring it tomorrow.
I have an idea.
Want to go out?
- Where?
- Outside.
- Where?
- Out of the hole.
- What hole?
- Here, where we are.
- This isn't a hole.
- Then what is it?
It's where you go when you die.
How can I explain?
This is a hole in the ground.
Outside there's air, fields, everything.
Let's go.
Try, at least!
I can't do it.
I can't!
- Just for a second.
- It hurts.
Try!
The sea's down there, but you can't see it.
Look. Do you like it?
Watch.
Listen...
I have to go home now
I'll bring you back down.
I have to go home soon because I have to set the table.
- I'll stay here, but you'll be back tomorrow, right?
- Yes.
- Promise?
- Promise.
- What's that?
- It's me.
Will you bring me a sandwich with cheese spread tomorrow?
- What's ch...
- Peek a boo!
I see you! From the nest it flew, now it doesn't go coo.
Holy shit, it was Michele!
Every fucking time
I found things out of place.
You wanted to set him free, huh?
Get up, dumb ass!
You're lucky you're your father's son.
Really lucky.
Don't move. Go.
Get in!
Good Salvatore, you were right..
I gave you my word.
Take the wheel and show me your stuff.
- Now?
- When else?
Follow the slope and remember to brake.
It's a perfect place for learning.
A smooth start.
You hold the wheel good.
You're a real pro.
Relax.
Go slow!
Rock!
Ditch
Salvatore, look ahead.
Salvatore, the rock!
Brake, you're gonna smash my car!
- What happened?
- He was there, with the kid.
What happened to you?
He hit me.
You did what to him?
- Bastard!
- I did nothing to him!
How dare you hit my son?
I'll kill you!
Stop it!
He wanted to set him free!
Calm down!
Let her go!
Let her go!
Let her go!
Get off!
What the fuck?
What are you doing? You hurt him!
Enough! Everybody piss off!
- Anna...
- Get out.
Come on! Out!
- What the fuck were you doing?
- Nothing! She wanted to hit me!
It's nothing.
Rest now.
Michele, listen to me.
Promise me that when you're big you'll leave this place.
Michele!
Michele!
Wake up.
- What did you do today?
- Nothing.
Nonsense.
Felice said you wanted to set that kid free.
No, I swear, I pulled him out and put him right back in.
- How many times did he see you?
- Three.
- How many?
- Four.
- Would he recognize you?
- What?
- Could he recognize you?
- No, he can't see well.
He always keeps his head under the blanket.
- You talked to him?
- No. A bit.
- What did he say?
- Nothing.
He talks about odd things, it's hard to understand.
- What did you tell him?
- Nothing.
Listen carefully.
I'm not joking.
If you go back there again,
I'll beat you silly!
If you go back, they'll shoot him and it'll be your fault!
I won't go back, I swear.
You gotta say:. "I swear on my father's life that I won't go back."
I swear on my father's life that I won't go back.
Forget about him, he's not there.
Don't talk about it to anyone ever again.
Christ!
What a mess!
- Can I ask one thing?
- What?
Why did you put him in there?
I don't get it.
There are things that seem wrong when you...
Don't think about it.
Forget about it all.
Go to sleep.
Sleep.
- What are you looking at?
- There's a dog.
- Where?
- There.
I don't see it.
Then only I can see it.
I thought you'd see it too, but I guess not.
Hush!
What'll we do now?
Let's go back there.
- Where?
- To the abandoned house.
Near Candela's farm.
That's far.
What if it starts raining?
What if it starts raining?
We'll get wet.
Plus, no one asked you to come anyway.
Want to go?
I'm going, come along if you want.
- So long as we don't race.
- No races.
You're not coming?
Michele, are you going?
Let's go home.
If you shit your pants for a bit of rain, go home.
Let's take cover!
- He's gone!
- I know where he is.
Where? Tell me!
- I'll tell you if we make peace.
- Tell me!
They put him in the caves near Candela's place.
- Who told you?
- My Dad was talking to yours and that guy from the north.
Peace?
Peace.
Hey!
- No one's home!
- Same here!
- Where are they?
- Is anyone at your house?
- No!
- What'll we do?
- They left.
- All the better
I couldn't wait for them all to fuck off!
Maria!
- Where are the grown-ups?
- At Assunta's shop.
- What are they doing?
- I don't know.
Helicopters passed by and they all went out.
They went into the shop and Mom said we can't go in.
- When will they be done?
- How should I know!
I'm bored.
Barbara, what are you doing here?
Go home!
- When are you coming?
- Now. Go.
Damn!
- When will our Mom come out?
- Soon.
Let's go home.
- But I won't go to sleep.
- Then don't.
There are two tomatoes.
Put salt on, it tastes better.
Hurry, it's late.
What are you still doing up?
Get to bed!
But we haven't eaten!
It won't kill you.
Go to bed!
We got here just in time.
Why aren't you sleeping?
Can't you tell them to shout softer?
- I brought you some food.
- What's going on?
Eat and go to sleep.
- Mom...
- What?
- He's dead, isn't he?
- No one is dead!
No one! Got it?
You're too young.
Enough, now eat.
It's fine if you don't want to,..
But sleep.
I'll be back in 10 minutes, if you ain't sleeping, I'll show you...
- Are you crazy?
- Quiet!
I won't fucking do it!
I ain't going to jail for you!
The terms were clear:.
You'd deal with the kid.
Whether things went good or bad,..
- You'd deal with him.
- Let's give him back.
What do you think?
It's the only solution.
Let's set him free.
We'll abandon him in the street, and that's it.
What the fuck are you thinking?
Shit for brains!
We have to eliminate the kid!
You fucking bumpkins.
And you have no balls.
Who do you think you are,..
You fucking Milanese prick!
What the fuck are you doing?
Are you crazy?
Why do I gotta do it?
Weren't you the courageous one?
- You faggot!
- Piece of shit!
Put your hands on me again.
I'll show you how easy it is to blow a head off!
Give me the gun!
Enough with this crap!
- What are they doing?
- Scram.
- Come on, touch me again.
- I got an idea.
We'll do what they do in war,..
To decide who goes on deadly missions.
We each pick a match.
Where are you going?
Spider with hair, and owl flying in the air,..
Slimy slug and blind snake, our children do not take.
Nighttime creatures, darkness seekers,..
You who only sleep when the sun gleams,..
Watch over this boy in his dreams.
Spider with hair, and owl flying in the air,..
Slimy slug and blind snake, our children do not take.
Nighttime creatures, darkness seekers,..
You who only sleep when the sun gleams,..
Watch over this boy in his dreams.
He discovered everything and the monster couldn't stop him..
Because he had powers.
Who's there?
Shut up, no one's there!
Filippo!
Filippo!
Filippo, is that you?
Filippo!
Filippo!
Wait, I'll take it off.
Are you alright?
Come on, let's go.
Stand up.
Stand up, I can't do it alone!
Don't you understand?
If you stay, they'll shoot you!
I came to save you!
Get up, stupid!
What?
I can't.
What did you say?
I can't.
Sorry.
No excuses, you've got to, understand?
Come on, we're almost there.
Come on, you're strong.
Now climb up, I'll push you, but you have to climb up.
Come on, you're doing great.
Come on!
Move it, they're coming!
Come on!
Come on!
Good, now jump.
I'm afraid.
Jump, they're coming!
You have to jump!
Good. Good job..
- Come on, I'll wait for you.
- No, you have to go.
Leave! Leave!
Dad!
Talk to me, Michele!
Open your eyes!
Michele!
Look at me, don't be afraid.
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes, Michele.
Look at me.
Don't be afraid.
Pino!
He ran away!
Talk to me, Michele. Talk to me.
Hey! Hey!
I'm sorry.
I didn't know it was you.
I didn't know it was you.
Pino, I can't find him!
He ran away!
Don't worry about him, he's fine.
The kid ran away!
You have to kill that kid!
You shot him instead of me.
Good boy!
I'm glad you came back.
Come here.
Come.
Good boy!
<b>I'M NOT SCARED</b>
Mercy is the compassion we feel for someone else's misfortune.
Mercy compels us to alleviate that misfortune.
Mercy is a child of charity, but the sister of justice because both are about the invisible link that exists between people.
Mercy is spontaneous because misery is involuntary.
At approximately 3:15 P.M., as your children were walking home from school with four classmates, a blue van pulled up beside them.
A male Caucasian stepped out.
The man approached Gary and Holly saying that you, Mrs. Beecher, had asked him to pick them up.
Gary was reluctant at first, but eventually, the man persuaded him... using Pokemon cards.
The van then drove off to the East side of town.
So what's being done to find them?
Kidnapping is a waiting game, Sister.
We have to wait to be contacted.
- And what if you're not?
- Milk cartons.
- Toby.
- Come on. Schillinger did this.
- We have no proof of that.
- Oh, for fuck's sake. Who else?
You come from a wealthy family.
Most likely we have a ransom situation.
You are fucking this up, you asshole.
Find my goddamn kids!
- Oh, my God!
- Find my goddamn kids!
Get him out! Out!
Find my kids! l don't know anything about a kidnapping.
Beecher seems to think you do, that you're behind this.
He and l have had a lot of shit happen between us, so l can understand him saying that.
But Beecher and l have one thing in common, too.
We're both fathers. l lost a son. l know what he's going through. l'm sorry about what happened in the library. l just got so frustrated. l know. l know.
You might want to call your mother.
She's pretty upset.
We talked about it in the car.
Toby, the reasons you're in here, the-- the alcoholism and the hitting the little Brockwell girl, your mother and l can't help but think that we're... to blame for so much of it.
- Dad, no.
- We failed you growing up.
Look, as much as l'd like to blame you for the miserable shithole my life has become, what's wrong with me is inside me. l own it, and either l have to control it or it will control me.
Right now, l just want to hold my babies.
So our sweet young things are safe and sound?
- Yeah.
- All right.
Time to kick this thing into overdrive. l want you to send the package.
Dad, you sure?
- Yes.
- 'Cause l been thinking.
Like you know l've never had a problem with breaking the law. l'm talking about at most a couple stolen Çamrys.
This kidnapping...
Keep your voice down.
This kind of thing is really not my style. l'll pay you double.
Okay.
- Are you Les Hibitz?
- Yeah.
Tobias Beecher.
Mind if l join you?
- You want to sit with me?
- Yeah.
Nobody ever wants to sit with me. l understand you did some fed time for kidnapping, right?
- Yeah, l was framed.
- Yeah, l'm sure you were.
But l don't know if you've heard, but my two children were abducted recently.
- l had nothing to do with it.
- l know.
What l'm asking is-- l was wondering if you might be able to look into it.
Find out if somebody was hired to do the job. l could ask around, see what l could find out, but l wouldn't hold out much hope.
So, do you like Def Leppard?
Years and years and years ago, the Catholic Church made a list of all the ways we can show mercy.
Feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, clothe the naked, shit like that.
Another of them was ransom the captive. ln those days, pirates and infidels and such would abduct fair maidens and Christian pilgrims.
God-fearing people were expected to pay for their return.
Who gets to ransom the captive in this day and age? lnstead, we're expected to visit the imprisoned.
That's right.
Come on down.
Break it up, you two.
- Are you ok?
- Oh shit yeah.
Hey, man, they stab me, they shoot me, l ain't going down.
How you doing?
- My kids.
- l heard.
That's fucked up. l'm sorry. l feel so goddamn helpless. l bet.
At least the baby,
Harry, is safe.
Toby, they're gonna be all right, you hear me?
They're gonna be ok.
They're gonna be fine.
Oh, man. l missed you.
Me, too.
Keller's back in Emerald City.
Two love birds have reunited.
And l hope they enjoy their evening together. lt's gonna be the last night of sleep... or peace... that Beecher's gonna have for a long, long time.
Chris?
Sorry, did l wake you?
Hey.
What's the matter?
Toby, l died... and there's no white light. l was there, but they brought me back.
But l was there, Toby. l was in hell and l felt everything. l felt the pain and l felt the fire for all eternity.
Hey. Hey. lt's gonna be ok.
No, it's not gonna be ok.
Don't fucking lie to me. l was there, Toby.
They're bringing me back.
You know what's funny?
You got pissed at me for talking to Said about God, but that's what l was talking to him about.
'Cause if all that's left for us in this life is Oz, we better start thinking about what's next, what comes after.
Don't let go.
Okay, okay.
Tobias. l didn't expect to see you here today, given what's going on.
Well, work helps keep my mind from caving in on itself.
Oh, l hear that. lt's a madhouse outside, though the crowd of protesters is smaller. l'm afraid people are getting used to capital punishment.
Sister Pete, l need to ask you a favor. lf l can, you know l will. What?
Talk to Chris.
Now how is it that you ask me the one thing that l won't do?
He feels terrible.
Tobias, he tried to use me to get to you.
Now he's using you to get to me. l will not play his game.
He's afraid that if you leave the convent, he's gonna burn forever.
He's gonna burn all right, but not for that.
He's gonna burn for all of the other people he's hurt, all of the other lives he's destroyed, including yours.
We've been going through the records of various prisoners at Emerald City.
One pops out as a potential connection to the kidnapping.
- Who?
- Christopher Keller.
No. Chris is my friend.
Let me see that.
Keller broke every bone in your body.
- He's the one?
- He saved my life from Schillinger. l'm telling you,
Schillinger is responsible.
Armed robbery, assault, kidnapping.
- He wasn't convicted.
- Police suspect him of raping, torturing and murdering several homosexual men? lt can't be him. lt's not him.
How can you be so sure? l know Chris, Mother... intimately. lntimately?
He's my lover.
Holy shit.
Vern, you better come see this.
What you got?
A package for Tobias Beecher.
Look.
Jesus Christ.
Officer Howell?
We got a problem here.
What the hell is that?
A child's hand.
Leave us alone.
How you holding up?
A few days in the hole only increases my credibility with Pancamo, Adebisi and Morales.
Ever spend any time in here?
No.
Good.
You look like shit.
- So l'm in?
- ''So l'm in.''
Adebisi ain't convinced, man.
Looks like you're gonna have to take another test.
Oh, yeah.
We going to box?
We want to see if you can take a punch... or two.
You got a problem with me, man?
Yeah, you're weak.
Give me gloves.
Well, actually we're not gonna spar.
- No?
- No. l'm gonna use you for a heavy bag.
And the rest of us bet on how long you stay standing.
Ready?
- Yeah.
- Ding, ding.
That was it.
Fifteen seconds. l win. Pay up.
Ow!
Yo, real impressive.
Yeah, thanks.
- Your bruises must hurt.
- Uh-huh.
Brought you a little something to soothe your wounds.
Later.
Yo.
What the fuck is you doing?
The breakfast of champions.
You wanted to see me?
We just took a straw poll on you. l voted yes.
- l voted no.
- l abstained.
- A tie.
- How do l break this tie?
There's a final test.
Which is?
You gotta kill somebody.
- Who?
- Anybody.
We don't care.
All right. l'll do it.
Pete, l have terrible news.
- Oh, my God. What?
- The Cardinal is coming.
Cardinal Abgott is coming to Oz?
He wants to say a mass, meet with the staff and then with some prisoners.
You're friends with him, right? l worked with him in his office until he transferred me here. l... disagreed with him once too often. l'm taking the day off.
Oh, no. You can't.
Ray, l have one foot out of the convent door. l think hobnobbing with the Cardinal would be just a little hypocritical, don't you?
Yeah, well, he specifically asked to meet you.
Me? Why?
Apparently this whole thing started because his eminence received a letter from a prisoner.
Which one?
Chris Keller.
Chris Keller.
Of course.
Raymond.
Cardinal Abgott, it's good of you to come. lt's a pleasure to see you, son.
Let's suit up.
Do you know why l transferred you to Oswald? l had too many opinions?
You had too big an ego.
Probably.
Something tells me that's changed.
- Body of Christ.
- Amen.
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.
- The body of Christ.
- Amen. l spoke to the head of your order
Sister Liocarria.
She says you're questioning your own vocation.
Yes, l am.
Welcome to the club.
You?
My first parish was way out in the country, a desolate area.
The pastor was old, the housekeeper even older.
When winter hit, it was lonely. l cried... and l prayed. l cried some more... and prayed even harder.
Well, that's what l'm doing.
Good.
Then whatever you decide will be the right thing to do.
Thank you.
God bless you, Sister.
God bless you, Sister.
As you already know, the jury has ruled in our favor.
They recognize that the State was guilty in all injuries and deaths caused after the riot.
So they have made recommendations that we receive the full settlement.
45 million.
Oh, yeah!
Before you all go spending that money, know this, the State has appealed the decision.
- Appealed?
- Yes, appealed. lt is an election year.
There is no way that Devlin will write us a check, not before November.
Said, you can't goose this thing along?
As we are all aware, the legal system moves very slow.
There's no way we can know when our case is gonna be coming before the appellate court.
Took almost 30 years for the prisoners of Attica to win.
30 fucking years?
Christ. l'll be ancient.
Like you, Rebadow.
Look, l know this is frustrating, but l want you all to see the court decision this week, it was a huge hurdle, a huge victory.
We must remain resolved. l'll inform you of anything else.
Yes?
Have you ever killed anyone?
No.
An extraordinary experience watching the life fade from someone's eyes.
Even as he was dying,
Hernandez's instinct was to kill me for killing him.
Survival meant less to him than revenge.
And this preamble is taking us where?
Jason Kramer. You've successfully gotten him a new trial.
Yes. l know you've been under a lot of pressure from the other Muslims not to get involved with the case.
- Yes?
- l think you should listen to them.
And you think this because...
Last night l had a premonition.
Kramer will go free.
Rebadow, l'm gonna tell you something. l'm gonna explain to you.
Jason Kramer is guilty of murdering his lover. l have seen the trial transcripts and all the evidence.
He will be convicted again.
Then why did you fight to get him a new trial?
The jury voted against Kramer because he was gay.
So this whole thing is theoretical for you.
There is nothing theoretical about justice.
And if Kramer goes free...
That's not gonna happen.
You'd better pray you're right.
We have a request for a meeting regarding your case.
Yeah?
A meeting with who?
The homicide detective who arrested you.
Robert Stransky.
Here's the deal.
You got this cocksucker a new trial, right?
My doctor tells me l got three or four more months to live.
Now before l die, l want to make certain things straight. l want you to know l tampered with the evidence. l couldn't find the murder weapon, so l went to the kitchen. l opened a drawer and took out a kitchen knife, l smeared it in the blood and l dropped it next to his body.
His fingerprints are all over that knife.
No.
No, they weren't.
My pal in forensics doctored up the tests.
And you would be willing to give a deposition?
To go into court and say this? l know this fucker's guilty as shit, but l want to buy back a piece of my soul.
Yeah, if you want me to, l'll yell it from the prison roof.
Ok, sweetheart?
We go public with this information, the press will get a seven inch boner.
Yes.
And you say the only witness, the guy at airborn, is dead?
Yes. l don't know, man. l'm feeling like maybe this could swing in my favor.
Yes. Kramer... l'm recusing myself from the case.
What's that mean? lt means l am resigning as your lawyer... immediately.
To instruct the ignorant, counsel the doubtful, to admonish the sinners. ln order for these works of mercy to happen, you need two things: someone in distress and someone with the capacity to help them. ln other words, an ignoramus can't instruct another ignoramus, and a sinner can't admonish a sinner.
Today in the retrial of Jason Kramer, who had previously been convicted for the murder of his lover, the jury reached a verdict, finding Kramer not guilty.
The Adamsville native, who has served nearly two years, is expected to be released from the Oswald Correctional Facility sometime this week. ln other news, the state's jobless rate fell slightly over the past month 3.8°/%.
Preliminary figures released yesterday by the state's labor department show that employers created nearly 1,000 new jobs.
Allah is not listening, brother.
He is deaf to you.
Warden, a word? l know that you've been having meetings recently with members of the local community regarding possible replacements for Tim McManus.
- Yes.
- l also know that you talked about hiring an African-American for the job.
- What, you got my office bugged?
- l want to come and see you, warden.
Discuss with you the kind of man who you should consider.
Well, l'd love that, Said, but l've already hired someone. ln fact, he's on his way in now.
His name is Martin Querns. l want to thank you for this opportunity. l've heard about Emerald City for years now.
Well, the place started out as an experiment, but unfortunately it pretty much failed.
Well, l don't know.
Maybe the first stage failed, but like any worthwhile experiment, we need to try different methods till we figure out what works.
Well, for me the most important elements are, one, keeping a lid on the racial tension; and two, keeping a lid on the violence in general.
Those are my priorities as well.
Do l have your permission to do what l feel is necessary to keep the peace?
Yes. l'll let you have a fairly free hand... until you fuck up.
Well, l can't ask for any more than that.
Okay, everybody, listen up. l want to introduce you to Martin Querns, the new unit manager.
He has a vast range of experience, having worked in both federal prisons as well as state detention centers.
The warden is correct. l have served in many correctional facilities, but what he didn't say was that, like most of you, l come from the streets. l'm not some candy-ass, white liberal looking to turn you into better citizens. l intend to meet with each of you individually, but until that time, keep one principle in mind: don't fuck with Querns.
That's all. l wanted to meet with you first because as l understand, you're one of the leaders around here in terms of the drug trade.
As a teen-ager l worked for Slim Sam Colby.
You know him?
Slim Sam weighed about 300 lbs, of course. l worked my way up through his organization until Ricky J. Lee blew Slim sam's head off. l decided the moment had come to retire.
And the point of all this?
To let you know l know every trick you got.
To let you know l'm smarter than you.
- You smarter than me?
- Oh, yeah.
'Cause unlike you, l never got caught.
How do you keep that thing on your head?
Now what are you gonna do? Hit me?
Sit down. l want you to listen to me good,
Simon Adebisi.
To my mind, drugged-out prisoners make for a quiet cell block, so you can sell whatever the fuck you want to whoever you want to sell it to. l don't care. l'm gonna be looking the other way.
On one condition, man.
Jeez, you are smart.
One condition: no violence. l mean none, zero.
Agreed?
- That's it, no violence?
- Yup.
He just want me to make sure that everybody obeys all the rules all the time.
This could be a trick.
- Yeah.
- l don't think so.
Like the way things were back in the old days.
We Sicilians controlled our own streets so the cops backed away.
Little ltaly was the safest place in the city.
- Look, l vote yes.
- Me, too.
All right. l'm glad you called. l've actually been meaning to call you.
Well, Leo... after the shooting and after Diane left, l admit that l went south. l mean, singing at Officer
Howard's memorial service, that was just crazy.
But l've had time to rest and relax and think.
- Tim--
- l'm ready to come back.
- Come back?
- To run Emerald City.
You can't.
The job's not available.
- What?
- l've hired someone to replace you.
- Well, unhire him.
- No.
Leo, l took the heat for that gun coming into Em City, but l read in the papers it was actually Clayton Hughes, your little protege, that brought it in.
Yes, and he's been charged.
He's out on bail until his trial starts in a few weeks.
- l want my unit back.
- How many times you want to hear no?
Leo, this is my life. l'm well aware of that. l do have another offer.
Holt's retiring. l need someone to run Unit B. l'll take it.
Well, well. Look who's here to join the party.
The arrest of Busmalis and the Cardinal's visit can clearly help the situation.
Our most recent poll shows that 42°/% of the public now believe the prison system is well run.
That's up 16 points since after the Em City shooting.
We're not getting any backlash because of Bellinger's execution?
A little.
But capturing Miguel Alvarez would balance it out.
Unfortunately, there's still no sign of him.
Our biggest concern right now is Clayton Hughes.
He's out on bail and he's been making a lot of speeches condemning the Governor. l know.
You have a relationship with Hughes, don't you?
Clayton's father and l were both rookies at Oz.
His dad died in my arms, killed by a prisoner back in 1982.
Well, we could use that.
You need to talk to the man, Leo.
Tell him to shut up.
Time for me to charm the D.A.
Desmond... get me Clayton Hughes.
What l'm asking is for you to cool the rhetoric.
Rhetoric? l speak the truth.
Devlin represents all that is evil in white society, l can't understand how you could even think of running with him as Lieutenant Governor.
Clayton, you lived a very protected childhood.
Oh, here we go.
Not everything is tied to my father's death.
Yes, it is.
You only see the world as black and white.
Trust me, life is gray, as gray as these fucking walls.
Now, l don't love
James Devlin, but l don't see him as Satan either.
Somebody must stop him, and soon. lntegrity. lt's what sets real leaders apart from typical politicians.
One man running for governor has...
You Americans think just because you have democracy, you're better than everybody else.
Elections are not what makes a country great.
Yeah? And what does?
Vodka?
How do you say it?
To be ruthless.
- Who's Ruth?
- Huh? l don't know anybody named Ruth.
Listen, Nikolai, l've been thinking.
You and me, we can make a lot of money renting that cell phone out to the slugs around here.
- ''We?''
- Yeah. We're partners now, right?
No. The phone is mine, O'Reily.
The more people know about it, the sooner someone blabs to the hacks.
So just keep your mouth shut tight.
God, l wish l could find where his fucking hiding place is.
Fuck.
- Like a treasure hunt?
- Yeah.
Yeah, like a motherfucking treasure hunt, Cyril.
Listen, l want you to search every square inch of Em City, see if you can find that cell phone.
But the trick is, you can't let anyone know, especially Stanislofsky, what you're doing.
- Okay?
- Okay. Can l start now?
Right now. Go ahead. l did just what you wanted. l didn't say anything to anybody.
Good boy. You didn't find the cell phone, though, did you?
- Nope.
- And you looked all over?
- Yup.
- Where does he keep that fucking thing?
Hi, how you doing? l'm gonna kill that motherfucker. l'm gonna fucking kill him.
Yes?
- Dr. Nathan is here.
- Send her in.
Gloria.
May l hug you?
Yeah.
- Sit down, please.
- Thanks.
Can l get you anything, do anything?
Yeah, you can stop being so goddamn nice.
All right.
No, l didn't mean that.
Leo, l know you know what i'm going through, with your daughter getting raped.
Well, she's better now. ln time you'll get better, too. l want to come back to work.
So soon? lf l don't come back now, l never will.
Gloria... l don't want you to quit, but l also don't want you to rush yourself.
Healing is a process, a slow process.
Not for me.
There's only one thing l need to do to make myself feel better.
And what's that?
Confront Ryan O'Reily. l know you're responsible.
For what?
For me getting raped.
- No way!
- Don't deny it. Don't fucking deny it.
- Gloria.
- l know. l know.
You called somebody and asked them for a favor.
Why would l do that?
Because the session the other day didn't go your way.
Because you couldn't manipulate me.
Because you're a twisted fuck.
You want me to say that l called a pal of mine and l had him beat you and rape you? ls that what you want me to say?
Yes.
Fine. l did.
You happy?
Yes.
The one thing through all this shit you've said over and over again is that you love me and all you wanted was for me to say l love you back.
Well, l came today to tell you, to see your face when l tell you that'll never, ever happen. ln fact, it's the opposite. l hate you. l will always hate you until we're both dead in the ground. l will hate you!
Fine.
Then tell me something else.
When he was fucking you, did you think of me?
- Gloria!
- Stop it!
Stop!
Back off!
Officer!
Did you think of me, huh?
Did you fucking think of me?
Did you fucking think of me?
Come on, Gloria!
Were you thinking of me? Huh? Huh?
Another work of mercy: to comfort the afflicted.
But you see, there are a lot of ways to comfort somebody, and a lot of afflicted just don't want to be comforted.
Gloria Nathan has decided to press charges against you, so you might be looking at another five years added onto your sentence.
Five years. Gee.
And l have to file a report.
Fine. l know you pretty well, Ryan.
And it may seem crazy, but l have to tell you that l think you're lying. l don't think you had anything to do with Gloria's rape. l said l did it. l did it.
Okay?
Okay.
When do we see Dr. Nathan and those nice people again?
We're not. lt's over.
Oh.
They still hate me?
No, Cyril, they don't hate you.
They hate me.
Listen, that man that you killed...
- Dr. Nathan's husband?
- Yeah.
That wasn't your fault, okay?
Okay.
And Hamid Khan, that was my doing, too.
All right?
You gotta know that, Cyril. l'm guilty, not you. l remember when l was little
Mama used to take us to confession and we'd go in the big wooden box and tell all our sins.
And Mama said by telling God, our sins were washed away.
Remember?
Yeah.
Yeah, l remember.
Bless me, Father, for l have sinned.
Today, l lied. l told someone l did something that l didn't do.
Why?
Because it's what she wanted to hear.
Because it's what she needs to know to make herself whole again.
Fugitive Miguel Alvarez continues to evade capture as police widen their search across the state.
Alvarez, along with another prisoner,
Agamemnon Busmalis, escaped...
Look who's out of the hole.
Agamemnon was recently captured and returned to Oswald earlier this week.
- How are you?
- What are you doing?
Anybody here from Cleveland?
All right.
Being free, even for a few hours, was so wonderful. l mean, l had no money, no overcoat, it was cold out there, but man, oh man, l was so happy, l stopped in the middle of the street and did a little dance.
Of course, that's when they caught me.
You were standing outside
Miss Sally's house.
Yeah, l was hoping to catch a glimpse of her in the flesh, maybe even exchange a word or three.
- What the fuck happened to Alvarez?
- l don't know.
Soon as we crawled out of the tunnel, he vamoosed.
You know what l miss more than anything about being free?
Taking a bath. l hate showers.
To sit and soak in a hot tub,
- Bubbles everywhere.
- Bubbles. l'll bet you even had a little rubber ducky, huh, Nikolai?
Rubber ducky?
- Yeah.
- What is rubber ducky?
Product of capitalist imperialism.
What do you miss most, Bob? l have nothing to say to you.
Bob, please, talk to me.
This silence is grueling.
Why are you mad at me?
The fact that you don't know makes the offense worse.
You're pissed off that l tried to escape? l'm pissed off that you didn't ask me to go with you.
- Oh.
- That you never ever told me you were digging another tunnel.
- Oh, well. l had my reasons.
- Which were?
- Well...
- What? l thought you'd slow me down.
- Slow you down?
- l'm sorry, Bob.
- l'm as vital as l ever was.
- l know.
- l killed a man.
- l know!
Fuck you.
Oh, shit.
Tomorrow at dawn,
Shirley Bellinger will be executed for the drowning of her eight-year-old daughter.
State law allows Bellinger the right to choose her own means of death, and Bellinger, the first woman executed by the State since 1841, has asked to be hanged.
Man, l can't listen to this fucking shit anymore.
Yeah, depress the fuck out of me.
Adebisi, weren't you in love with Bellinger?
No.
Yeah, you had a little crush on her.
She had a crush on me. lf l had to die, l'd go lethal injection, man.
Me, l'd O.D.
An ounce or two of heroin, straight up.
The State is not going to give you drugs.
Ain't lethal injection a drug?
They get a doctor to decide where the knot on the noose should be, depending on the person's height or weight, so that the noose snaps the neck in the right place? l remember the day of my execution l was terrified.
But then when l didn't die, l felt like such a coward.
Anti-capital punishment protesters continue to march outside the prison, though officials claim the number is considerably smaller than was expected.
Bye-bye Bellinger, huh?
Yeah. l was kind of hoping to see her one more time, but the hacks have delayed all mail deliveries to death row till after the execution.
She was quite a gal.
Reminds me of my late wife.
My Arlene.
She showed me her cunt. l was mopping up the floor outside her cell and wham, bam.
Showed me her cunt.
Next item:
Shirley Bellinger's execution is scheduled for dawn tomorrow.
- Bye.
- Peter Marie...
No, no, no, Leo. l agreed that l wouldn't protest publicly again, but that doesn't mean l have to sit here and listen to the grim details.
But Bellinger has asked you to do something for her.
What?
After she's dead, she wants you to collect her personal possessions.
She doesn't want anyone else touching her things.
What am l supposed to do with them?
Well, she says dispose of them as you wish.
Okay. Can l go now?
Yeah.
Ray, she's asked for you to pray with her.
Right.
Shirley, have you any thoughts
- as the hour approaches?
- Thoughts?
Of course l have thoughts.
How could l not?
- Would you share them with us?
- Sure. l'm wondering why anyone cares what my thoughts are.
Sure as hell didn't care when my husband was drunk and beat me or when my father-in-law raped me.
No, it wasn't until l killed my daughter, till l did something horrific that what l think matters.
All l wanted was for someone to pay attention, and now that you finally are, l see that my life, then or now, isn't worth shit.
Oh, if l say shit, you can't use this, right? l'm not supposed to say,
''shit,'' on the air, am l?
Aren't you curious to know who got
Shirley pregnant here in Oz?
No. lt's time.
Good morning, sugar.
How you doing?
Woke up with a crick in my neck.
Must've been sleeping funny.
- Maybe it's stress.
- ln any case, the hanging'll take care of the crick.
- What'd l-- what'd l miss?
- Nothing yet, Natalie.
- And Miles is sleeping?
- Yeah.
Man has no sense of propriety.
So what'd you have for your final meal?
A nice Slim-Fast milkshake.
Girl's got to protect her figure, even if she's a corpse.
Ready?
Quite.
Sorry to get you up so early, Father.
Warden, Officer Lopresti has been coming to my cell every night and fucking me.
- That's a lie.
- You and l will talk later.
Yes, sir.
- Bitch.
- You know that--
- Would you mind solving a mystery?
- lf l can.
When you got pregnant here in Oz, who was the father?
- Was it Lopresti?
- Oh, no.
He wasn't working death watch then.
My lover was Satan in the form of a man.
Which man?
A lady never reveals such secrets.
But l'll give you a hint.
Neither rain nor snow...
- Goodbye, Moses.
- So long, Shirley.
See you around, kiddo.
Save me a seat at the beauty salon.
- The Lord is my shepherd...
- l shall not want.
He makes me lie down in green pastures.
He leads me beside still waters.
He restores my soul.
He guides me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake.
Even though l walk through the valley of the shadow of death, l will fear no evil...
You prepare a table before me in the presence of mine enemies.
You anoint my head with oil. l will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
Amen.
No. No, no. l changed my mind. l don't want to die this way.
- l don't want to die.
- lt's too late.
- No. No.
- Shirley!
Please, please! No!
Please! Please.
No! Please, please!
Oh God, oh God!
Not yet!
Not yet, not yet, not yet!
Oh, sweet heaven.
Oh, sweet Jesus. l'm sorry for all l've done.
Please, please, please, intercede for me now.
Oh, sweet Jesus.
Help me, sweet Jesus.
Help me, sweet Lord. l'm sorry for all l've done.
Please, please, please intercede for me now.
Oh, sweet Jesus.
Oh, help me, Mary, Jesus.
Hey, Sister.
Can l have her mirror?
Sure. l'm the next one to die, you know.
Yes. l know.
The final act of mercy, to bury the dead, to pray for the dead and the living.
We are merciful, not just for humanitarian reasons.
We are merciful because we ourselves want to be saved.
God expects mercy from us.
God demands it.
And how much mercy does he show us?
''Kyrie eleison.''
That means
''Lord have mercy.
Christ have mercy.
Please.''
Shit.
I see.
Is that right?
Well, have you ever seen "Starlight Express?"
-Daddy, of course I have.
-Well, face it. It's no "West Side Story."
You don't know what kind it was?
It was a mix.
There's English.
There's Rednose.
There's Staffordshire.
There's all kinds. There's American--
That's what she says:
"It was a longhaired pit bull."
-There's no such thing.
-That's what I'm sayin'.
- It's an obvious discrepancy.
-One of you guys gonna get that?
I'm not attacking him-- just working this out.
Carlucci. One second.
Feege, you gotta call on two
We okay here? Because this is just--
It's formality.
- I might have to do it all over.
- Lieutenant Gruman speaking.
"Lieutenant"?
How can you say that?
Rita Moreno was fabulous.
-At least she wasn't on roller-skates.
- "Makin' fun of me 'cause I like Xanadu?"
-What?
- Lucinda just called.
Let me call you back.
-You know Mona Dearly?
-What about her?
She was proceeding southbound on Route 9... when apparently her vehicle was involved in a 2-1 1-07.
-What?
-She drove into the river.
She's dead, Wyatt.
So what happened to your hand?
This thing? It's nothing.
What are you gonna do?
-So what'd you say your name was again?
- Maria Lasala.
-That's a nice name.
-Thanks.
-So are you married or something?
- Maybe.
-She's 13, man.
-Yeah. Finally.
- I'm picking you up tomorrow at 9:00.
- For what?
-What do you mean, "For what?" For work
-That's early.
- But it's Carlsson's.
-So?
- It's Carlsson's Nursery.
I heard you the first time, Bobby.
I ain't mute.
I'm just saying, Carlsson's Nursery is gonna make us a lot of money.
I mean, it's gonna save the business.
I get half.
I know.
And none of that "50%" bullshit.
That's it!
What do you think? Should I do the
Yellow Apple Six report or Apple Seven?
-What's the difference?
-The Yellow Apple Six involves water.
Feege, the car is submerged in water.
What do you think?
- Let's go with Yellow Apple Six.
-Yeah.
I think that's a good idea, Feege.
She's dead.
Thank you, Dr. Schwartz.
There he is. Here they come.
So... you wanna tell Jeff about his mom, or do you think we should do it, or--
Yeah.
That's--
We'd be more than happy to do it, Phil.
It's just that coming from you, it may cushion the blow.
Being that he's your son and all.
Well, in that case, it might be best if one of you did it.
Right.
-We could do that.
- Do you wanna? I could do it.
-Are you-- I could do it.
-Who's gonna do it?
-Jimmy's gonna do it.
-Yeah. Yeah, I'll handle it.
I got it.
Hey, Jeff. I'm afraid I got some bad news. How you doin', Bobby?
-Where's my car?
- It's more serious than your car, Jeff.
Would somebody mind tellin' me what the hell's goin' on here?
It's-- I'm afraid--
Your mother was in a car accident.
I'm afraid she's dead, Jeff. She's dead.
What was she doin' in my car?
Where you been? Oh, you gotta talk to Mark we were goin' over the menu... and I mentioned the boneless breast of chicken, and he's, like, "Boneless"?
"You never said you wanted boneless."
Can you believe that?
I'm, like, "You don't serve chicken bones at a wedding."
God forbid someone chokes to death.
It'll cost an extra five bucks a plate, and at a hundred plates we're lookin'... at half a grand, $500, just to get rid of the bones.
Like we got that.
What's wrong?
Mona Dearly's dead.
What? You're kiddin' me.
No. I mean, yeah. I mean, no.
No, she's dead.
My God. What happened?
It was just a car accident on the road, I guess.
Well, we gotta celebrate.
What? God, Ellie. Jesus.
She's a human being.
"We gotta celebrate." Have some respect.
I don't gotta have respect for no one in that family.
Bobby, think about how they've treated you.
- How they'd treat me?
- Badly. They're horrible people.
They're a houseful of freaks.
Hey, Philibuster, check out how fast I'm doin' this.
-Cut it out, would you?
- No, I'm on a roll. Look at it.
Cut it out, you little shit, or I'll kill ya!
All right.
Geez.
Now, about the name of this business.
You given any thought to it yet?
Well, I thought we should call it "B.J. Landscapin'."
"B.J."?
- I don't get it.
-You know.
"B" for Bobby and "J" for Jeff.
"B.J. Landscapin'."
Well, I think "J.B." has a nicer ring to it.
Besides, you don't want anyone calling you "Blow Job Landscaping," do you?
Well, then, what if we call it "J.P.'s," right? That's good.
- "J.P.'s" ain't an option, Jeff.
- How come, smarty two-shoes?
'Cause his name don't start with "P."
-Yeah.
-Oh, Jesus.
-What's that, Mr. Dearly?
-You say something, Phil?
-You gonna contribute or what?
-Yeah, what do you think?
I think that it's--
Whatever you two decide is--
All right. Thanks, Mr. Dearly.
For what?
He didn't say jack!
-Why you kissin' his ass?
- I wasn't kissin' his ass.
I thought you were done kissin' ass.
He was totally kissin' ass.
- Kiss-ass!
- Look at the little kiss-ass!
-You disgust me, you little kiss-ass.
- Little kiss-ass.
Get out of my sight.
She deserved it. I bet property values go up. So, you gonna fire Jeff?
What? No. Why would
I want to fire Jeff?
'Cause you been wantin' to for years.
No, I haven't. I stopped wanting to fire him a long time ago.
Well, what about him killin' the Schneider dog?
He didn't kill the Schneider dog.That was an accident when he killed the dog.
Bobby, he ran over it with a lawn mower.
Yeah.
I don't want to talk about it right now.
The guy's mother just drove off a cliff.
Yeah. Too bad Jeff wasn't ridin' shotgun.
That would've been funny.
Ever so gracefully... the yellow Hugo-- sort of floating--
It was almost slow motion-like.
And it did a swan dive right into the river.
-A swan dive, huh?
- It was tragic and frightening... yet beautiful in an obtuse way.
-What'd he say?
-Clarence?
He said she drove into the river.
You know, Feege,
I was looking around up top... and there was something very odd about this.
-What's that?
-There are no skid marks.
She never hit the brakes.
We should do some checking to see if she suffered from any medical conditions... like narcolepsy or something.
Could've been "Barstein" syndrome.
Yeah.
Rash, she was a lousy driver.
It probably caught up with her.
-You knew her pretty well, didn't you?
-Our paths crossed time to time.
Juliet, Echo, Papa, Hotel.
You had that little thing with her a while back? A bit of an altercation?
Let me see your hands!
Let me see your hands!
-Why'd you pull us over, Feege?
- Let me think about that for a second.
A: You're riding on rims. And B: Just went 2,800 on an officer of the law.
And C: What the hell's the matter with you, Jeff? Oh, boy!
Look what you did!
- I didn't do nothin'!
-You scared him half to death!
- He's drunk!
- No, he ain't!
Get out of here, ya jerk!
That's okay, baby.
Everything's okay. Mommy's here now.
Yes. Okay, baby.
You're gonna pay for this, Feege.
You just lost a lawn service, pal!
It's a real shame, though. Him and Bobby did a fabulous job on my place.
So what do you think, Lucinda?
What do I think? I think she took a turn for the worse and broke her stupid neck.
A fitting end toa less than laudable life.
I'm talkin' about the car.
- I'll have her fixed in no time.
- Lucinda.
Look, dude, if somebody rigged it, you'll know.
- I'm countin' on you, all right?
-All right. It'll cost you.
-You gonna charge him double?
-You know it.
-She's dead.
- I know.
I can't believe this.
I mean, it's just--
Man, I mean--
This is it, right, Rone?
I mean, this is it. I'm--
- I don't like it, Phil, one bit.
-What's the matter?
I have to ask you something, and I want you to be honest.
Sure.
-What?
- Did you do it?
- Did I do what?
- Did you kill her?
- How could you ask me that?
- It looks suspicious, Phil.
It was an accident.
It was a stroke of good luck.
Good luck doesn't happen to people like us. Good luck happens to Madonna.
Tony and Jimmy said it could've been slippery on the road or something.
- I don't know.
-Sure.
Couple of months, they're gonna find me floatin' at the bottom of the Hudson.
Don't talk like that, baby.
Don't talk like that.
'Cause if you're down there,
I'm down there.
I'll go down with the catfish.
I'll go swim in the murk
- Phil?
-Yeah.
-Are you okay?
- I'll live.
No bacteria. Honest.
I am a priest. A priest.
You can't cut me off.
Padre, stow it. You're breakin' my concentration, for cryin' out loud.
Threats not with standing, cut the sermon and give me goddamn beer!
What? You want me to squirt you in front of God and everybody here? I'll do it.
Murph, what's all this about the chicken?
The chickens? We got bigger fish to fry.
Get your ass over there. Come on.
-Tell me you didn't do it, Bobby.
- Do what?
What do you mean?
Come on. They were killing your business, Bobby.
That whole family was ruining your life.
No, they weren't.
They weren't ruining anything.
I didn't do it. Are you crazy?
What are you talking about?
I'm just sayin' there's a lot of people that wouldn't blame you if you did.
-Come on, Murph. Jesus Christ.
-All right.
I'm just doin' the big brother thing, you know?
I'm just-- I'll back off.
Guess who got in an altercation last night.
-Who?
-Valerie Antonelli.
- Big talk! Big talk from the big man!
-You talkin' to me?
Where's Bobby Calzone when you need him?
What are you gonna do, hit me?
Come on, Murph. She's a girl. You don't let her get slapped around like that.
-What's the matter with you?
-She wanted to be a landscaper.
Sue me.
All right. Listen, Murph, what's up with the whole chicken thing?
-You gonna help us out?
- Look, if you want somebody to sit... and yank the bones out of a hundred chickens, it's gonna run you money.
You know, you're the best man at the wedding, Murph.
I'm not making any money on this weddin' as it is.
You're my brother. Can't you do a brotherly deboning or something?
Okay.
How long is this gonna goon?
I'm frontin' ya for your business.
I'm helping with you weddin'. Last year
I declared you a dependent on my taxes.
I'm havin' a hard time at work, and I'm a little short handed with Jeff.
Well, maybe due to the untimely demise of Mona Dearly... you can finally get rid of that one-armed bandit partner of yours.
Bobby, come on.
I can't let you carry me like this.
Wait a second.
I have to close the door.
I'm not ready.
You're no fun at all.
You have one new message.
Hi, honey...
It's your old dad callin'.
Just wanted to see how plans for the big day are shapin' up.
I thought we could hop over to the diner for some breakfast.
Tomorrow's no good, but maybe Saturday... Okay.?
Say. "hey" to Bobby...
Be good,
-What do you think he wants?
- I don't know.
Sounded pretty cryptic.
Something about breakfast, Saturday.
Hard to say.
What's wrong?
Nothin'.
Up a lazy river with a robin's song
Awaits the bright new morning
We can loaf along
I just thought I'd stop by and pay my respects.
-Your dad's not home, is he?
- No.
I know this is trying times for the two of you.
-You want a beer or something?
- No, thanks.
You don't happen to know where he went?
Did your mother suffer from any medical conditions you might know of?
I think she had a personality disorder.
No, not necessarily like that. It's--
It's just there are some aspects to this accident that--
You think someone killed her?
-Well, I didn't do it.
- I never said you did.
But if you were to know if somebody had a grudge against her... or something like that, you know.
Yeah. I don't wanna point any fingers and what not, but Bobby Calzone did it.
I find that hard to believe.
He doesn't have a violent bone in his body.
Why don't you see how Peaches feels about that?
Peaches? The Schneider dog?
Yeah. With the lawn mower.
-Great job with Peaches, there, Bobby.
- Drop dead, asshole.
"But, Bobby, that poor little dog."
"Poor little dog."
It was in the way.
You were the one chasin' after it with the lawn mower, not me.
It wasn't my fault.
- It got in the way.
- Now we lost that account.
Blame me. Blame me like you blame me for everything else.
- I don't care.
-You killed Peaches.
- I would've fired us for that.
- Like you never killed a dog?
If you keep losin' our accounts, pretty soon we'll be out of business.
-Then how you gonna take care of Ellen?
- "Take care of Ellen."
- Ellen freakin' schmellen.
- Honey, I hate to see you guys--
What are you saying?
I can't hear you, Mrs. Dearly.
-What?
-You're hurting me!
Shut up! One step closer, Jeff, and
I swear I'll tear out your ovaries!
- Don't you talk to my boy like that.
-Your boy has the IQ of a garden pest!
And so do you, you dumb wench!
- Bobby, I don't think--
-What? You don't think?
That's your problem!
You don't think!
You don't think!
I've had it!
I can't take it anymore!
Especially you, Mona Dearly!
What's that supposed to mean?
You know what it means!
You know what it means!
He said "ovaries"?
-Yeah, all the time.
-And he threatened your mom's life?
-Why didn't you report this?
-'Cause everyone threatened her life.
"Ovaries."
She took a turn for the worse
You know she swam with the fishes
You know she dug in the dirt
Why did she have to die, die
Why did she have to die, die
Catchy.
That was nice.
Thanks.
How's that daughter of yours?
-She's great. Thanks for asking.
-Yeah? Wedding plans going smooth?
- Like silk on glass.
- I want you to take a look under here.
If somebody were to sabotage the brakes--
- "If"?
- "If." It's a conditional clause.
"If."
If somebody were to sabotage the brakes, he's got two options.
He can be smart and puncture a hole in the brake fluid tank... or he can be a total freak and cut all four of the brake lines.
I'll show you.
These here are the brake lines.
-They've all been cut.
-Total freak.
-That rules out accident--
-Slow down, pal.
We're just gettin' started here.
All right. Now... know what this is?
- I don't know shit about cars.
-That's the brake fluid tank.
-What's that hole?
- It's a hole.
So I figure the perp... used some kind of sharp instrument-- a screwdriver, an awl, what have you-- took it, drove it through the tank with a hammer.
Just, bam, bam! See this?
This here?
Fetzervalve.
- I'm not familiar with the fetzer.
- Nor should you be. Serves no purpose.
-So what's the problem?
-Somebody poked a hole in that too.
- Is that bad?
-This car was done to death.
- "Done to death"?
- Fixed to kill.
"Fixed to kill."
This was no accident.
"Sorry to bother you.
I just wanted to express my sorrow over the loss of your tragic--"
"Hi, Jeff and Phil.
I'm really sorry to bother you."
"Hi. Sorry to bother you.
Listen, I just wanted to express my sorrow over the loss of--"
Mr. Dearly.
I just wanted to express my sorrow over the loss of your tragic loved one.
My loved one?
-Your wife passed.
-Yeah? Who'd she pass?
What do you want?
Bobby came by to express his loss over our sorry loved one.
-Yeah, I ain't workin' today.
- No, you shouldn't work
You're definitely on a grievance leave... and I'm just coming by to say that I'm really sorry.
That's great, if that's what you wanna tell yourself.
If you ask me, he sounds real broken up about it.
- I mean, look at him.
-Yeah, no kiddin'.
-All right. So--
- Listen, Bobby.
If you're tormented by this, you should come by Cubby's Funeral Home tonight... and have a full release.
Yeah. We're havin' one of them
"wake and bake" services.
Yeah. Sure.
I'll come by Cubby's.
You do that, you little kiss-ass.
Yeah. Make sure you wear them kiss-ass shoes too.
And that landscapin' kiss-ass T-shirt.
"I'll mow your lawn, I'll trim your hedges and I'll kiss your ass!"
-There he goes. Look at that.
-Yeah.
Little hesitation before the kiss.
Careful. Don't kiss the dog's ass.
All he talks about is how much the wedding's gonna cost... and how Jeff's ruining J.B.'s.
I'm worried about him, Dad.
It's like he's obsessed.
Well, I'll talk to him, see ifI can help.
No. That's all right.
You've already done enough.
You know, this is gonna sound terrible, but with Mrs. Dearly dyin'... this is the first break he's caught in a while.
Okay, folks.
Shame about Mona Dearly, huh?
I mean, so young. Tragic.
- It's taken everybody by surprise.
-Yeah. Poor family.
-So, what can I get ya?
- I'll have the usual and a cup of joe.
And you, hon? You want the heart attack special, just like your daddy?
The vegetarian plate.
Back in a jiff.
A box of friggin' meat for my wedding.
Like I'm registered at a deli.
What do you think about "Ice Castles" for a spotlight dance?
-You can't go wrong with "Ice Castles."
-That's what I was thinking.
It looks like there's going to bean investigation into this thing.
I have to tell you that this wedding of yours is all anybody's talking about.
And the fact you two even considered having me there-- Well, forget about it.
Yeah, well, me and Bobby really want you there, Rone.
Well, I just want you to know it moved me, down deep.
- Really. It moved me.
-Good.
Enjoy your meal.
-So where was I?
-You said you were gonna investigate.
Right.
-What I was thinkin' was--
- "Goddamn it."
Don't give me that shit, Phil.
I am not overreacting. He was there.
He was talkin' to Ellen.
-Come on, sweet nipple.
- "Don't "sweet nipple" me, Phil."
But we got nothing to do with it, honey.
I'm dumpin' her stuff right now.
What does that have to do with anything?
Do you know why our prisons are so overcrowded?
- I don't know. Too many criminals?
- "Wrongful imprisonment, Phil."
Erroneous convictions Eleven percent of all inmates currently serving time... are counterfactually incarcerated for crimes uncommitted.
Did you ever see Tom Selleck in An Innocent Man?
-Yeah. Was that with Kurt Russell?
- Phil, look.
Rash is askin' a lot of questions about all of you... and I don't like one bit what he's insinuating, not one bit.
Relax, Vanna.
He's just doin' his--
Oh, shit.
- Rash is here.
-What?
I gotta go.
- Hey, Chief.
- Hope I didn't catch you at a bad time.
I was just gettin' ready for Mona's wake. How you doin'?
I'm fine.
That's a really nice picture of the two of you.
I can't tell you how sorry I am about Mona.
She was a passionate and committed woman.
This is probably the exact wrong time to ask you--
Whatever I can do to help.
I mean, you know me. I'm a team player.
I need to ask you a couple of questions about your wife.
Yeah? What about her?
Phil, sweetie, you got a minute for me?
Honey, they're lookin' for the shooter.
Get in here, Phil.
You should've seen this guy, taking potshots in his skivvies.
He looked like Father Tom.
-Yes, dear?
-Where were you this afternoon?
- But--
-Where the hell were ya?
I called the warehouse.
You were MIA.
You sure you had the right number?
-Oh, boy.
-Who is she, Phil?
-Who's who?
-What's her name?
Sweetness. Oh, Jesus, honey, you could hurt somebody with that.
I don't wanna hurt someone, Phil.
I wanna hurt you!
-What's gotten into you?
-You.
-You don't find me attractive no more?
-Of course I don't--do.
You got something goin' on, don't you, Phil? Don't you?
You've been playing Wheel of Fortune with someone else.
Don't tell anyone, but...
I was a battered husband.
Phil, that was the Wednesday night prior to the accident?
That's right.
And at no point during the evening did you leave the house?
No, I was watching TV the entire evening.
What about Jeff?
Well, him and Mona had a fight earlier that night.
- Do you recall what was said?
-Yeah.
He said she was an embarrassment to the family and then took off.
The kid was lit up like a Christmas tree. I've never seen him so drunk.
Yeah. Yes.
I was talkin' to Ellen earlier.
She told me you were worried about finances.
And I just--You know, you and I are practically family now... and, you know, you shouldn't have to bear that burden alone.
If ever you wanna talk or get something off your chest--
I appreciate that.
Just imagine that you're Annie and I'm Daddy Warbucks.
- Daddy Warbucks.
-Yeah.
Or I'm Auntie Mame, and you're little Patrick.
Yeah?
Well, tell me something, Bob.
What did you think about Mona Dearly?
She was the worst person
I ever knew in my entire life.
How you doing?
- I just came to give Jeff his pay.
- How come you're all dolled up?
- I'm taking Ellie to dinner theater.
-Come on.
-What you gonna see?
- "Oh, Calcutta."
Get over here. Give me my money.
Look at this guy.
What is this? You trying to tell me it's what I've been bustin' my anus for?
For287.50?
- It's always 287.50.
- He's tryin' to rip me off.
-You holdin' out on us, Calzone?
-Where's the rest of it, you dick?
- Looks to me like he's wearin' it.
-Yeah.
Nice shoes.
-This is a joke, right?
- No, you're a joke.
-You guys are kidding, right?
- Kidding?
You feel like laughing?
Laugh at this.
- Kick his ass, Mom, yeah! Get in there.
-You're payin' for that headlight!
-What are you doing? Get out of there.
-Take it out of Jeffrey's pay!
Yeah.
Get out of there.
What are you doin'?
- Let go!
-God! I mean, enough's enough.
All I wanted was a nice, professional business so Ellie and I could have--
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know what this is?
This is the world's smallest tambourine.
-And it's playin' some song.
-Shut up!That's a violin.
Give me that thing.
Give me that.
I think it's time we start talkin' about dissolvin' the business.
- Nothing personal. It's business.
- No way.
- Don't even think about it, scumbag.
-Yeah.
As I see it, you got two options:
- Buy us out or pray for an early death.
-Yeah, get out of here, you mooch.
Go enjoy your dinner theater.
But, you know, she probably had her good points too.
Well, most people have two sides.
Yeah, well, she just showed me the one.
-That Jeff Dearly, man.
-What about him?
You gotta hand it to him.
Jeff, what's your handle?
-Jeff, hands up.
-What's your handle?
Speaking of which, guess what I heard.
-That's not a logging accident.
-What's the difference?
Why? What'd you hear?
What about that fishing accident?
-Are you serious?
-See?
Wow.
"It's a terrible loss."
"It's a terrible loss."
What a void in my life.
All right.
"Father Tom, it has been difficult."
"Father Tom, it has been difficult."
"It's been really hard."
Jeff, come on.
We don't wanna miss this.
- Let's go.
-Yeah. Right.
-What's wrong?
- Nothing.
-What did your dad wanna see you about?
- Nothing.
He just asked me some questions about Mrs. Dearly.
What about her?
What kind of questions?
-About the accident.
-What does he think?
He doesn't think anything.
Really? I mean, you'd tell me, right, if he said something?
For chris sakes, Bobby!
All right. I'm sorry.
I don't--
I don't care.
I don't know why I'm asking.
With Jeff not at work,
I'm shorthanded. I--
I'm just really tired.
-What did you want to talk to me about?
- Forget about it.
Do you imagine the Dearlys were like us when they were our age?
No. She was always fat.
What time is it?
-Jesus. I'm dyin' over here.
Keep in mind we're remembering a lifetime.
Yeah. All right.
Ten more minutes, then.
To hell with it.
Let's go.
Hey, Cubby.
Me and Jeff don't think there's much point hangin' out, you know.
In my experience... wakes aren't very well attended.
I've found that often times the tragedys so recent... that loved ones are, in effect, paralyzed... by their grief.
Listen.
Who are we kiddin', huh?
No one's gonna come, not with the game on.
Oh, shit.
I got money on that game.
Yeah. You and everyone's mother.
- I thought you were comin' by.
-Yeah.
You know, yeah.
You know,
I can't say your mom was good people--
-Are those pies fresh?
- No.
-Shame about Mona.
-Yeah, well, you snooze, you lose.
Hey, guys. How you doin'?
All right?
-Can we sit down already?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Take that booth.
Thanks, babe.
What?
-Good evening, friends.
-Jesus, Cubby!
You've got--
You've got nice pictures in here.
- I appreciate that. Thank you.
-Yeah.
-Where is everyone?
-Jeff and Phil are at the Palace... getting some grub, but if you care to look at the deceased--
Sure.
-Wow.
-Yeah.
-She looks so peaceful.
- In death, one finds serenity.
I guess.
Beautiful.
Dynamite stuff.
That's fantastic.
-Some turnout.
-Yeah.
So who showed up?
Bobby and Ellen stopped by about an hour ago.
Otherwise, it's just been me and my dinner date.
Tell me something, Cubby.
You notice anything odd lately?
Other than the fact that noone seems to care about this woman's death?
-Along those lines.
- Hell, Wyatt...
I've seen people more upset over losing change in a candy machine.
Who says you can't catch nothin' in the river?
Feege is right.
We should show a little respect.
Jeff, why don't you say a word?
-Jeff, why don't you say a word?
-About what?
About your mother.
To Mom. Yeah, she was kind of mean, but she was still my mom.
Someone had to be.
All right, everybody...
Let's hear a nice round of applause... for our final contestant,
Mona Dearly.
All right. Nice grouping.
Everybody, give her another round of applause.
Now we await the judges' decision.
The judges are deciding who will win the coveted Golden Angel.
The winner of Verplanck's knife-throwing contest is...
Bobby Calzone!
Oh, my God!
I never win anything.
Just a goddamn minute!
-You didn't vote for me.
-Well, sorta.
"Sorta"?
They all say "Bobby."
- Really?
- Phil, you're my husband.
-You're supposed to support me.
-Yeah, but Bobby had really good form.
-Thanks, Mr. Dearly.
-You're welcome, Bob.
-We're just having a little fun here.
- Fun?
I lost, Wyatt. I'm a loser.
Does that sound like fun to you?
- Mona, I'm sorry that you lost, but--
-Yeah.
It's just a lousy little contest.
I know.
- Everybody can't be a winner, Mona.
- But I've never been a winner.
- I've never had my chance.
-You're blowin' this out of proportion.
- It's just a knife-throwing contest.
-To you, maybe.
But not to me.
I really wanted this-- just for one day, oneday, to be a winner.
To have everybody look at me and say,
"Yo, way to go, Mona."
Would it have killed you to let me take home that prize, huh?
Just for one day, to let me feel good about myself?
I don't know what to say.
You can have the trophy.
I'm gonna have a second chance.
Why don't you take that trophy and shove it up your ass, Calzone?
Mona, Bobby's just trying to help.
- I don't need his sympathy.
- Know what my mother used to say?
"Life gives you potatoes; make potato salad."
Well, life handed me a pile of shit.
What am I supposed to make out of that?
Shitsalad?
Just shut up.
The whole pack of youse just shut up!
Come here.
Look. I've been thinkin'.
Oh, no. Don't.
Listen to me.
Jeff Dearly's key chain is on a rack in his kitchen.
-Great. Wonderful.
- But where's it supposed to be?
- I have no idea. Why don't you tell me?
- Hanging from the ignition... of the victim's car.
-What about Mona's keys?
-That's what I'm sayin'.
Mona's keys were on Jeff's keyring in the kitchen.
Jeff's keys were on Mona's key chain in the car.
So somebody switched their keys?
- Definitely.
- No, I don't think so.
Oh, you don't think so?
As far as I'm concerned, "Ding-dong, the witch is dead." End of story.
One less ain't gonna kill her.
It's kinda weird, you know, seein' the tombstone and all.
"Devoted wife, mother and dressmaker."
I didn't know your mom was a dressmaker.
Me neither.
Guess what. They're callin'
Mona's accident a "case"... which means they don't think she died because of some slippery road.
-So?
-So that means there's an investigation.
It means they have leads.
Phil, I watch A&E.
I understand the way a cop's mind works.
You see, they see you standin' here touchin' me... and the next thing you know, there's the background check and the profile... and the psychological workup.
- I just came for lunch.
- Phil, these are smart guys.
These are really, really smart guys.
They have tools.
-Tools?
-Yeah. Of the trade?
So what are you tryin' to say?
Just stop bein' so damn conspicuous, would you, please?
Okay.
Good. I'll see you later at the Charm.
-Yeah.
-Stop it!
-What's up?
- Light beer, please.
So Chief Rash has been snoopin' around a bit.
What do you think he's lookin' for?
Hard to say, Phil.
What do you think?
- Been gettin' much sleep lately, Bob?
-Yep.
Any nightmares or bad dreams?
Listen. There's a lot of talk goin' on... you know, the kind where things get said... fingers get pointed, landscapers get incarcerated.
- Hold on a minute.
- I want to say something to you.
You did the greatest favor anybody's ever done for me.
I just came by to say thank you.
Thank you, Bob.
Would you like a beer? I'll have one.
Can I have a beer, please?
Cheers.
"Fingers get pointed."
"Fingers get pointed."
"Landscapers get incarcerated."
Landscapers.
Always a little kiss-ass.
Look at the little kiss-ass.
-Get outta my sight.
- Kiss-ass.
- Pray for an early death!
- Don't.
Laugh at this!
Bobby, he ran over it with the lawnmower...
Jeff, don't do that!
Don't! Peaches!
Man!
-What's the matter with you?
-What are you doin' here?
Listen. I was tryin' to tell you somethin' last night, and--
What? Wait.
It's a mistake.
I mean, she wasn't supposed to die.
- Excuse me?
- I don't know what happened to me.
They were driving me crazy. Every single day, they were haranguing me.
-What are you saying?
- I snapped.
I thought I was killing Jeff.
I punctured--
I didn't know I was puncturing things, but I thought it was Jeff's.
I didn't know I needed to--
What did you do that for?
You killed Mona Dearly!
- I know.
- But why?
Because I thought
I was killing Jeff.
- My dad is the chief of police!
- I know.
- But I wasn't gonna go through with it.
- It doesn't matter.
-You killed someone!
- I know, but I was doing it for us.
Jeff was killin' the business, and Mona wasn't gonna let me out, so--
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
" A good idea at the time"?
Cut the grass at 6:00... lay the sod at 7:00, drown the Dearly's at 8:00?
I was doin' it for us. It was for us.
It was for our perfect life...
'cause everything we wanted--
That's just great.
- I'm sorry.
-Yeah, well, I'm pregnant.
What? You're pregnant?
- It's mine?
- Mm-hmm.
-That's fantastic.
- I thought so too until a minute ago.
I can't believe this. How could you?
We're not killers. We're good people!
- I wasn't gonna go through with it.
-You're not supposed to get to that.
You're supposed to have that thing that goes off in your head that says...
"bad fuckin' idea," Bobby!
I have that thing. I have it.
It just didn't go off.
I'm sorry. Please.
Please. I love you.
Man, I can't believe you killed someone!
-Where are you goin'?
- Home!
We need milk.
Hey, Chief. Please come in.
Thanks, Phil.
Have a seat.
Thanks for comin' by, Chief.
What's on your mind?
It sure seems clear to me... that my Mona was a victim of an act of treachery.
There's no doubt in my mind that she's been murdered.
-What makes you so sure?
- I saw it happen.
You saw it happen?
Now, granted, this ain't easy for me to say... and it's something
I should have said before--
You been playing Wheel of Fortune with someone else!
I would have told you before, but when family's involved... things can get a little dicey.
I appreciate your discretion.
What can you tell me about Rona Mace?
- Rona?
- Mace, yeah.
Well, that's--
She's--
She's a good friend... who's been real supportive since the tragedy.
Was she supportive prior to the tragedy?
Chief, I may not have been happily married... but I did take an oath.
-The usual, madame?
- If you'd be so kind.
Good luck on your free spin.
I'm a Wheel watcher
I'm a Wheel watcher
I want it, baby.
Oh, yeah. Come on.
Free spin, honey.
Free spin.
I'm a Wheel watcher
Will you cut the shit and get down to business?
Okay. Can I buy a vowel?
You know what, Phil? I've really been a good sport about this.
I really have.
I've really tried to do what you want.
You wanted to buy an "o"?
So I let you buy a vowel. I did.
Because you wanted to buy a vowel.
So I let you buy an "o."
But that wasn't good enough.
You had to have the free spin.
You wanted to have the trip to Acapulco.
You know what?
You've landed on bankrupt, buddy.
But I wanna solve your puzzle.
Please, Phil, please. I beg you.
Please tell me I didn't spend all this time with you to end up like this?
Don't do this!
I'm a 33-year-oldwaitress... at a friggin' diner that doesn't encourage tipping!
Thirty-three?
What the hell are you doin' here?
Me and Rona here were--
Jesus Christ. Bea man.
Jeff, whatever you think is happening in here is happening.
You're cheatin' on Mom?
Mom's dead, son.
But, baby, how could you do this to me?
Excuse me.
Did you just say "baby"?
Keep it down over there!
I'm payin' by the hour!
You shut up!
- People!
- Please! Have some respect!
What is the matter with you?
You're a dead man, Dearly.
I gotta get the hell outta this joint.
What's this?
I thought we'd celebrate the baby... but I'm not really in the mood right now.
Who's that?
What am I, Dionne Warwick?
Hang on!
- Dad!
- Hi, honey.
What are you doin' here? Hi!
How are you doin', Mr. Rash?
What's that?
You might wanna sit down for this.
We're pregnant.
Congratulations, Grandpa.
That's just--That's great.
I know it's sooner than we thought, but we're in love.
Starting a family is all we've ever wanted.
- It is. I love you, baby.
- I love you too.
Come on, Dad.
Have a drink with us.
So how's the police force coming--going?
I understand you don't cut the Schneiders' lawn anymore.
No, sir. Not since Jeff killed Peaches.
Jeff killed Peaches? I thought it was the other way around.
That Peaches killed Jeff?
No, that you killed Peaches.
Me? I loved Peaches.
Poor Peaches.
I can't believe you did that!
- It was in the way!
-You chased it with the lawn mower!
Like you never killed a dog.
We lost that account.
Blame me, just like you blame me for everything else.
If you keep losing the accounts, then we're not gonna have a business.
Then how am I gonna take care of Ellen?
Are you trying to screw up
Jeffrey's business?
You're hurting my neck!
What are you doin'?
Don't touch my mom!
What do you think you're doin' touchin' my mom?
You nuts?
You tore my overalls!
- I don't think that's a--
-That's your problem! Ya don't think!
- I've had it with you, Calzone!
-What's that supposed to mean?
You'll see.
Trust me, buddy. You'll see.
You said overalls?
Yeah.
I need to know one more thing, Bobby.
I need to know where you were
Wednesday night.
At the Hideaway.
Are you sure?
Yeah. I'm at the Hideaway every night.
Well, I mean, not every night, but--
Well, yeah,
I'm there every night, so-- so, yeah, I was there.
Hi, Valerie.
Gotta flat?
You need a hand?
How ya doin', Mr. Rash?
That's some shiner.
- It's nothin'.
- It's not nothing.
I got clocked in the eye
Wednesday night at the Hideaway.
Wednesday night.
Ellie never mentioned anything.
I don't think she knows about it.
Herand Bobby weren't there.
What happened?
I was just drivin' when all of a sudden the tire blew out.
- I pulled off the flat and found this.
-Where do you suppose that came from?
J.B. Landscaping.
She was a lousy driver.
It probably caught up with her.
I was a battered husband.
This car was done to death.
Ding-dong, the witch is dead.
End of story.
I would have told you before, but when family's involved...
things can get a little dicey...
I don't think she knows about it.
Her and Bobby weren't there.
I'm at the Hideaway every night.
-"Bobby. Calzone did it."
-"Fixed to kill."
Look, Jeff, I am sorry if I hurt your feelings and everything.
Look, Jeff, I am sorry if I hurt your feelings and everything.
I thought maybe if your dad and I got married, maybe the three of us could--
What? Live together so you could bang the both of us?
Well, sort of.
I can't do this.
I've been going crazy all day just thinking about you and that freak Phil.
If you're worried about me and Phil getting married... forget about it,
'cause it ain't gonna happen.
Then why don't you marry me?
Come on, Jeff. I mean, come on.
Be serious.
I'm totally serious.
I know I don't got no ring or nothing... but I love you, and, like, I always loved ya.
If I lived a life without you... it just wouldn't be a life worth livin'.
Come on.
Can we play Wheel of Fortune now?
No, stop.
Stop.
Stop. Phil?
Where are you goin'?
I can't sleep. Go back to bed.
Okay.
Hey.
Don't kill anyone, honey.
Okay.
Excuse me, Murph.
Give your daddy some sugar.
It's Bobby. Murph, wake up.
-Cuddles?
- No, it's Bobby.
I know you think
I killed Mona, right?
The truth is that I might have done something that--
Hey. Hey!
I touched her once, one time.
That's it.
Listen, hey.
I need you to do me a favor.
Can you cover for me?
Hey.
Yeah, I'll cover for ya.
- Use the lambskin to clean it.
- Hey!
-Chief, how are you doin'?
- How you doing?
Good. I'm fine.
I wanted to ask you a couple of questions about Bobby.
I ran into Valerie, and she had the black eye thing going there.
Yeah, it's terrible times we're living in... when a gal can't even go get a beer... without getting clocked in the eye.
She said to me that if
Bobby was here the other night... he would have kept her from getting beat up.
So he wasn't here, is that it?
Bobby was here. No, he was here.
He was here.
Picked a hell of a time to go to the bathroom.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Drowning. Terrible way to go.
Rather take a bullet in the head.
Rather get thrown off a skyscraper.
Or thrown in front of a truck.
I had a dog drown on me once.
No kidding?
She couldn't paddle.
You think they can all paddle--
Here comes the chief.
We're gonna have to go in now.
Get him out!
What are you standing around for?
We were just trying to preserve the integrity of the crime scene.
- Forensic disturbance of the--
- It's water. Get him out!
We're goin' in. Here we go.
Let's go. All right.
Here we go.
One more.
This used to be such a nice, quiet town.
- He was a battered husband.
-Yeah.
- I'll be right back.
-Okay, Chief.
Don't go anywhere.
Hey, Clarence.
I see you took a little dip in the water, huh?
Every once in a while a fellow has got to cool himself off.
Yeah.
You want to tell me what happened?
Hi, Murph.
- How ya doin', Ellie?
- Not bad.
Guess who's a bad swimmer.
Guess who sleeps with the fishes.
What do you mean?
Phil Dearly wound upon the wrong end of the proverbial beverage.
Speak English.
What happened to Phil?
They found him this morning... dead in the water, so to speak.
-Where's my dad?
-What's going on, honey?
Where's my daddy?
Calm down. Slow down.
Take a deep breath.
What's going on?
Juts found out!
Murph told me!
- I can't. Not tonight. Not tomorrow.
- Bobby's a murderer!
I can't do it.
You got problems, dude.
I covered for you long enough.
-The bodies are starting to pile up.
- Bodies are piling up?
-Get in the car.
-Get--
Okay.
- How ya doin'?
-Shitload better than your dad!
-What--
-What's wrong?
-What happened to his dad?
-What are you turning into?
A serial killer?
Seen Ellen?
Don't go anywhere because you and I need to have a little dialogue.
-Where you going?
- I'm getting the hell outta here.
Listen, if Phil calls, you don't know where I am.
- Didn't I tell you?
-Tell me what?
Phil's dead, honey.
Phil's dead?
Why didn't you tell me?
I told somebody.
We're gettin' married Sunday!
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.
- Breathe.
- I gotta go.
The closer we get to the wedding, the more people he murders.
I've heard of cold feet.
But I can't marry a murderer!
That's not who I am.
That's not what I'm about.
It's gonna be okay.
I really appreciate you doing this.
That's what friends are for.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
Yeah. It's okay.
Everyone says weddings are stressful.
I didn't see it coming.
Maybe we should have eloped.
Maybe I pushed him too hard with the boneless breast of chicken and all.
Don't do this to yourself.
If he really did kill anyone, it's just' cause he loves me.
I'm not saying it's okay.
It's just that's how committed he is to the relationship.
Sweetheart, there are other ways to show you care.
- I know. I love him so much, Dad.
- I know you do.
I'm gonna sort this whole mess out, all right?
Okay.
Was Ma like this before you guys got married?
-That was a little different.
- How's that?
No one died then, honey.
Right.
- Dad?
-Yeah, baby?
You're not gonna tell him about Lucinda, are you?
Of course not.
Besides, I experimented a bit when I was your age too.
Hi, Jeff.
What are you doin'?
What does it look like? I'm gettin' the hell out of here. Want to help me?
That's very funny. You didn't think stumpy was funny last night.
What about last night?
What do you mean, what about last night?
- I told you to stay away from her!
-You're gonna pay for this.
You got the short end of the dick.
She don't love you!
It ain't the meat but the motion.
You don't know how screwed you are, all of you, you, Rona, Bobby.
I'm gonna expose ya all.
-Give me your hand.
-Yeah, yeah! Whatever!
Why don't you friggin' swim home?
You think I killed him?
I'm not gonna stick around and wait for the autopsy.
So you're leaving me?
No offense.
Your family is whacked.
Fine. Fine. I'm leaving, then.
Okay.
This is 002. Come in, 001.
Go, Feege.
- "Remember Rona Mace?"
-Vaguely.
She's about a heartbeat away from scratching gravel.
- "Did you say scratching gravel?"
-Copy that, Chief.
Get Tony and Jimmy over there.
I'm on my way.
Hang on.
Miss Mace? Seen Ellie?
What's the matter?
- Is he apprehending him?
-Calm.
If we take him down--
- I didn't do it!
- Put your hands down.
- I didn't do it!
- Put your damn hands down.
- I didn't do it.
- I didn't do it either.
- Put your hands down.
- I didn't mean to kill her.
Keep your mouth shut.
Move over here and shut up.
-Where you goin'?
- I'm owed vacation time.
I find that highly unlikely.
No son-in-law of mine is going to go to prison.
In case anyone cares, Jeff Dearly is at the cemetery with a gun to his head.
Holy shit.
Nobody move.
Tony, Jimmy, just keep everybody here.
Feege, you come with me.
Come on!
-Stay here!
-Stay calm.
- Don't let them move!
-You got it, Boss.
Come on, baby!
Don't move any closer, Sheriff.
I swear to God, I'll do this!
He's not a sheriff!
I know how upset you are about your dad.
To hell with him!
Everyone knows he's not my real daddy.
-Then why are you doing this?
-She said she was gonna marry me.
-Who?
-She said she was gonna be my wife.
- I don't know who you're talking about.
- Rona!
- I love her!
- I love you, too, baby.
I told you to stay put!
Honey, please, don't make me a widow before we get married.
Do it!
Don't do it!
You've got your whole life ahead of you, unless you blow your brains out.
Don't do it.
I know you all think
I killed my parents.
-We don't think you killed anybody.
-You're full of shit.
Everyone knows I've been wantin' to get back at her ever since that night--
Ma, there's no more beer.
Give me some of yours.
Don't touch that beer.
I said--
-Was I so wrong?
- Bet your ass!
Yeah, but I didn't kill her.
Don't get me wrong. I'm glad she's dead and all, but I didn't do it.
I know you didn't kill her.
I didn't kill my dad neither.
-Then why don't you give me the gun?
-'Cause my life sucks, man!
- Don't do it. It's not gonna feel good.
-Give it a whirl.
Would you shut up?
You know what? To hell with all of you.
This is bullshit.
Damn! Damn!
- Damn!
- I'm all right.
- Is anybody hit?
- I'm all right.
- I got the gun. Come back!
-You got it?
All right.
-You all right?
-Yeah.
Everything jake here, Chief?
Just securing the circumference.
Come with me.
Come on, ya little baby.
Come with me.
-Am I in trouble?
- No.
Listen to me very carefully.
I want you to remember every word I say.
I spoke to Clarence earlier... and these are the exact words he used.
- I'm deeply hurt.
- How do you mean?
All this talk about Ellie's weddin', and I wasn't even invited.
Of course you were invited, you and your wife.
I'm married?
Clarence, now, what the hell's goin' on?
You mean with the damp clothes and the hair?
That's a start.
That's 'cause just last night I killed--
What's his name?
Phil Dearly?
I killed Phil.
Hey, Clarence!
Give me your hand.
-Come on!
- Hold on, buddy. Hang on.
Any reason why?
Any reason?
Well--
You know the night in question?
I was seein' it all go down.
I gotta tell ya, it didn't look good for Bobby...
Phil Dearly knew that
Bobby tried to kill Mona.
Bobby wound up in the hoosegow.
- Pardon?
-The jug, the can, the coop.
If Bobby got thrown in the pokey... what kind of a life would that be for Ellie and the baby?
How'd you know she was pregnant?
The point is, I just couldn't sit there and let Phil Dearly... take down the only decent people still left in this town.
Wow. Thank you, Clarence, for the thought... but you still did a very, very bad thing.
To bad people.
You punctured the fetzer valve.
Phil cut the brake lines.
Then he switched Mona's keys and drove the final nail into her coffin.
I don't know what to say, Mr. Rash.
Don't say anything.
But know this.
I will die before I ever let you ruin my daughter's life.
I will hunt you down, chasing you to the ends of the earth... pursuing you relentlessly until I am satisfied... that you know what it is to suffer the wrath of God.
You will welcome the relief that death will bring.
-Got it?
-Got it.
I just want us to be happy.
You, me, Ellen, the baby.
We're gonna be like the von Trapp family.
You know, "The Sound Of Music," the family from Austria, Julie Andrews... and all the little kids singing.
Come with me.
Marriage is an institution not to be entered into lightly.
So, is there anyone here who feels that this couple... should not be joined in holy wedlock?
Last chance.
Okay, so be it.
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
What are you waiting for?
I'm dying here.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Congratulations.
Way to go.
Where's your date?
I don't have a date.
Then what are you gonna do afterwards?
Nothing.
Unless somebody dies.
Congratulations, you two
Well, Clarence, buddy, it's time.
Ready?
-Things good?
-Yeah.
- How about you?
-Okay.
MALE NARRATOR: Here is where I Iive.
Well, not right here. l move around all the time,
visiting my many friends, keeping an eye on the situation.
l've been doing it for years and years.
And as you can see, l am far from alone down here.
Sometimes it gets crowded.
The ocean is home to countless variations of sea life.
My grandfather used to say,
"Even the camels wandering the Sahara,
"even the mountain goats high up in the Alps are creatures of the oceans,
"for they too depend on the oceans for their survival.
"Without healthy oceans no life, not even on land, can exist."
He'd say that every time he was upset with the way mankind was treating our home.
Now that l am older and wiser, l'm starting to understand what he meant.
And that good-looking fellow there, well, that's me.
lf you'd like to tag along, l'll show you around.
lf you come from the inland,
your first encounter with the ocean is unforgettable.
lf you've ever crossed an ocean,
its vastness, its power and serenity are overwhelming.
But only when you've dived beneath the waves
does the miracle of the ocean and all its beauty truly reveal itself.
The ocean wonderland.
Here, and all around the tropics, is the pulsating heart of the oceans,
the coral reefs.
Now l could go on and on and tell you all about each and every one
of the 800 known species of reef-building corals,
where each coral is a tiny colony of sea life,
or about the incredible diversity of shapes and sizes.
l could even tell you that a small coral table, like this one,
is the home to, oh, about 300,000 inhabitants.
But l won't.
Too dry. Boring.
Okay, but here's a question for you.
What is coral? ls it plant or rock?
lt's a trick question. lt's neither.
lt's an animal.
lmagine thousands and thousands of tiny creatures clustering together,
and sharing a common skeleton made of limestone.
That's what coral reef is.
Skeletons built upon skeletons,
until big, well, sometimes absolutely huge structures are formed,
like here, the Great Barrier Reef in Australia,
which is so enormous it can be seen from space.
Well, that's what they tell me. l've never been.
Like me, corals are sensitive creatures.
They thrive only in clear, warm waters with lots of sunlight filtering through.
Coral is fragile, and it grows ever so slowly.
So, if some klutz breaks off a branch of this staghorn coral,
it would take many years for it to grow back.
Something to think about next time you're tempted to break off a little souvenir.
Big boulder corals seem to live forever.
This one is over 500 years old.
Grandfather told me that our family has been swimming on the reefs for ages,
over 100 million years, actually.
The nooks and crannies, the complex structure of the reef
is something that appeals to a vast number of species.
There are over 4,500 different types of fish on the reefs.
They make the reef their home and playground
and also their battleground.
The batfish,
curious and gentle wanderers in and around the reef.
These are pompano, rather well-behaved during the day, but predators by night.
With their bright colours and their beak-like jaws,
it's no wonder they're called parrot fish.
The giant Napoleon wrasse is a fabulous character,
reaching a weight of 400 pounds,
always inquisitive, always with an eye on the next meal.
Puffer fish, about as fast a swimmer as poor cousin Quincy,
are protected by a poisonous flesh.
Like their name indicates,
they can puff themselves up with water when they feel threatened.
They become bigger and scarier-looking
and not quite as easy to fit between your jaws.
Look closely.
No, closer.
Can you spot the trumpetfish hiding amongst these whip corals?
Shipwrecks, like this one in the Bahamas, are mighty popular down here.
ln many ways, they replicate the complex structure of coral reef
and quickly become home to sea life, as well.
Here, the fish can rest, hide or wait in ambush.
This beautifully coloured queen angelfish, together with a pair of delicate butterflyfish
has moved in and made a home amongst the fan corals growing on the wreck.
With so many different species,
the competition for space and lunch can be fierce.
Struggle and swim, struggle and swim, but never a dull moment!
The strangest alliances have evolved between species in order to survive.
Sea anemones are animals that live attached to the reef.
They capture small fish and kill them with stinging tentacles.
The clown fish, however, is a crafty little fellow
who has evolved a technique which fools the anemones,
and therefore can move freely amongst the tentacles.
The giant reef anemones become their safe haven.
As you may know, l can't stay down here forever.
l must surface for air once in a while,
just like the next creature we're about to meet,
the dolphin.
Actually, they bear quite a few similarities with us turtles.
lntelligence, beauty, style, grace.
Okay, maybe they do get around a bit faster than us.
Dolphins have fascinated humans since time immemorial.
An encounter with one is always a magical moment and a memory for life.
Hey, how often do you get the chance to touch a wild dolphin.
So go on, give it a go!
Showing off his dance moves again.
Reminds me of myself in younger days, actually.
Now, Grandfather, who claimed that camels were sea creatures,
certainly enjoyed his metaphors.
He compared the endless waters of an ocean to the endless sands of a desert,
and the coral reef to an oasis.
The reefs are havens where sea life abounds
and all the different species depend on each other for survival.
Huge schools of yellow snappers thrive on parts of the reef.
Let me introduce you to this wonderful ballet that my friends have prepared for you.
Well, you wouldn't get a bunch of turtles to carry on like that,
but it's rather fascinating, don't you think?
Thank you, my friends. See you later.
Now, no one particularly likes becoming someone else's lunch,
but down here, we're pretty realistic about our place in the food chain.
You eat and you are eaten.
That's just the way it goes.
These sandy plains may seem barren to you,
but just below the surface live countless molluscs and small worms.
And any creature with the right appetite, and the right technique
knows they are down there.
Stingrays are experts at finding and excavating their prey from the sand.
Their mouth is under their body, while their eyes are on top.
To me, this is a little strange.
They have powerful jaws, of course.
Not as strong as mine,
but they are capable of crushing even the hardest shells.
And as always, nothing goes to waste.
The smaller fish feast on the scraps the larger ones leave behind.
When l think of life on the reef, two things come to mind,
abundance and extraordinary diversity.
These are surgeonfish.
They graze on the algae growing on the rocks.
They find safety in numbers
and confuse their predators by travelling together.
Traffic can get heavy at times. lt's okay, l can wait.
Bigeye trevallies are another sociable species,
at least by day.
By night, the dense schools disperse and each fish must find its own dinner.
Although the barracuda exudes elegance and danger,
unless provoked, they are no danger to you humans.
With nightfall, a strange serenity descends on the reef
and a whole new array of life is revealed.
Many creatures filter the water for food, like these feather stars.
The corals themselves extend their tentacles to catch zooplankton.
Sea squirts filter the waters in search of nutrition.
Small fish retreat into the delicate maze of coral branches.
At night, these trumpetfish prefer the man-made shelter
the shipwreck can provide.
This puffer fish doesn't look too happy about our late-night intrusion,
so let's sneak away. Come on.
Sorry, my friend. Go back to sleep.
Here's a creature that always makes me duck into my shell,
one of the deadliest on the planet,
the sea snake.
Let's follow it into deeper water, where the colours begin to fade away.
lt moves through the water like a ribbon of doom,
with a venom so powerful that just one bite is all it takes.
You're dead within seconds.
l think l'd rather wait up here.
Could we get moving?
Everyone still with us? Good.
Luckily for you, sea snakes seem to prefer seafood.
They rarely attack humans.
Here is one of the most important predators to be found on a reef,
the potato grouper.
Some groupers reach truly impressive sizes,
over 8-feet long and weighing more than 600 pounds.
They don't skimp on their meals, either.
The largest ones even dine on small sharks
and, sadly, young turtles.
Yes, poor Quincy ended his days as a rather unhappy meal for a potato grouper.
When two groupers meet for combat or courtship, complex rituals often ensue.
Hard to believe and hard to admit,
but the ocean's most graceful creature is not the turtle.
lt's the eagle ray.
As these gentle giants glide along with the majesty of their airborne namesakes,
it is easy to forget that we are viewing fish beneath the waves
and not eagles above the clouds.
Their wingspan can reach widths of up to 8 feet.
Even in these murky waters, the eagle ray is an elusive beauty.
An encounter with even just one is always a privileged moment.
Sometimes l wish l had wings like those.
But then again, l make out fine just the way l am.
Diving deeper,
you'll meet lurking among the reefs the most powerful predator of them all.
The shark is among the ocean's most ancient inhabitants
and, for me, the scariest, l might add.
So if you don't mind, l'll stay here while you look at them.
350 million years of evolution have honed them to predatory perfection.
Hundreds can find their home in one healthy reef.
Fast, fierce, sleek and agile,
an incredible animal that l prefer to view from afar,
because at feeding time, they behave as if they have a licence to kill.
And l suppose they do.
Unprovoked, sharks rarely attack people,
and yet humans have decimated the shark population
by killing millions of them each year.
Sharks are now rare on most reefs.
Today, another darker reality faces our reefs.
They are endangered.
When a coral reef dies,
all the life that thrives in and around it vanishes, as well.
Since one-quarter of all us marine life depends in some way on the reef for survival,
imagine the consequences.
The health of the planet depends on the health of its oceans.
When oceans sicken and die,
the well-being of our Earth is thrown into peril.
l used to visit this reef every year when l was younger,
a reef that was teeming with life and activity.
Today, this reef is dead.
There is no more life here.
Sewage, industrial waste, pollution,
destructive fishing practices, careless tourism and even deforestation
are some of the man-made elements that threaten the health of our reefs.
ln addition, the massive energy consumption of humans
is altering the planet's climate and warming up the oceans.
One silent victim is the coral.
lf human activity continues on its present course,
most of the world's coral reefs may be dead within 50 years.
The problem is clear.
And many of the solutions are already known.
Modern man must transform himself
from being the threat to becoming the defender.
Around the globe, many organisations,
such as the United Nations
Environment Programme
and the World Wildlife Fund,
are already working hard to improve the health of our oceans.
Together, you can ensure a brighter future for coral reefs
and the millions of other creatures that live beneath the waves.
For yourselves and future generations, please help save the coral reefs
and preserve this ocean wonderland.
McCaleb.
Whatever happens, iùll be his face on the front page.
What do you have?
I've had hemorrhoids for a while. You?
Victims five and six.
Code Killer strikes again.
You're not a vegetarian, right?
How do you like your steak?
Big, red, juicy?
WALLER: Neighbor complained about the noise. He got run over at the door.
Neighbor said he saw this from the door.
ARRANGO: Bachelor number one hasn't been dating lately.
Apparently, he's a bed wetter.
MCCALEB:
You're sick, you know that, Arrango?
WALLER: Neighbor didn't see a thing.
ARRANGO: This might be important too.
The maid quit about six years ago.
She didn't like the neighborhood.
We're calling him Chuck Taylor.
Oh, how's that?
Well, the prints. Look.
Converse. High-tops.
Chuck Taylor.
You get it, right?
You don't know who Chuck Taylor is?
Basketball coach. Stanford Cardinals.
We got the remains of two or three people.
ARRANGO:
One of them could be a midget.
In any case, iùs a hell of a gangbang.
MCCALEB: Once you joke about it, you shouldn't be doing it.
MAN 1: Get the stretcher.
MAN 2: All right.
Another love note.
Maybe the two of you ought to get a room someplace.
MALE REPORTER: McCaleb.
FEMALE REPORTER 1: Another message?
- Why is he singling you out?
MCCALEB: I can't comment.
I can't comment.
FEMALE REPORTER 1:
Are there numbers this time?
He loves it.
What does the message say?
FEMALE REPORTER 2:
Why does he focus on you?
Do we have numbers this time?
FEMALE REPORTER 3:
Were there numbers?
- Why does he single you out?
FEMALE REPORTER 1: What does he want?
Chuck.
You got a motive?
MAN:
Clear.
WOMAN:
Almost there.
Good. Coming out.
Good, Terry. You did good.
Are you taking your pills?
Yeah.
Yeah, all 34 of them.
- No fever at all?
- No.
All clear of that.
- No diarrhea?
- No, nothing.
Good.
- Blood pressure and pulse?
- Right on target.
You're not working too hard on the boat?
No, just enough to keep it afloat.
Thaùs all.
I'll be back in a bit.
I'll check this blood work and get the tissue to the lab.
Okay.
Don't start running laps yet, but I'm very pleased.
No rejection.
All your blood levels are good.
- I might lower your prednisone next week.
- Thank God.
I'm tired of shaving three times a day.
FOX:
Lean forward.
- May I ask you something?
- No, don't talk.
Sit up.
Okay, come around.
All right. What did you want to ask me?
The kid in 218...
...whaùs his blood type?
Iùs different from yours, if thaùs what you wanted to know.
- How long has he been waiting?
- About half as long as you did.
What are his chances?
Maybe 50-50, maybe less.
Whaùs bothering you, Terry?
MCCALEB:
I don't know.
When I was at the Bureau, we had to qualify once a year on the range.
You know, shoot at targets, stuff like that.
We had a thing where you shoot a circle around a heart.
It was called the "10 ring."
That was the highest score.
Typical.
You wait for a heart for two years...
...almost don't make it, then wonder if we shoulÔve given you that heart.
Know what that is?
B. S?
Exactly. Go home and enjoy your boat.
See you next week.
WOMAN: Hey, Terry.
MCCALEB: How you doing?
BUDDY:
Morning, Terry.
Morning?
Iùs 2 in the afternoon, Buddy.
As long as my dad sends those checks, iùs whatever time I say it is.
- Whatever.
- Heads up, by the way.
Somebody's on your boat.
Been here 10 minutes. Looked harmless.
I didn't say anything.
Looks better than harmless!
MCCALEB:
May I help you, miss?
I'm looking for Terry McCaleb.
You're looking at him.
Graciella Rivers.
I have read about you in the paper, in the "Where are they now?" column.
You know, in the Metro section.
You're not the first person to try to find me.
I can recommend a good investigator who won't rip you off.
The article said you're the best and you hate when someone gets away.
If you read it, you know what happened and that I'm retired, Miss Rivers.
Graciella.
Graciella.
I think you could help me.
How's that?
- Maybe even help yourself.
- I don't need money.
I'm not talking about money.
MCCALEB:
Sister?
- And her son.
- Which one?
- Excuse me?
- Which one's dead?
My sister.
Gloria Torres. Glory.
And her son's name is Raymond.
- I don't think I can help you.
- Just look at it again, please.
Just one more time, and I'll leave you alone.
Just tell me if you perceive or feel anything.
Miss Rivers, I'm a retired FBI man, not a psychic.
- Do you want this back or not?
- I have a double.
You know, two for the price of one.
- You'll want to keep that one.
- Why is that?
Your heart, Mr. McCaleb.
It was my sister's.
- How do you know that?
- Newspaper.
You two have the same blood type,
AB with CMV negative.
You were operated on the day she died.
My number's on the back if you change your mind.
Miss Rivers, this is Terry McCaleb.
Yeah, I'm sorry about it being so late...
...but I wanted to tell you I'm going to the police to see whaùs going on.
Don't thank me.
Don't get your hopes up.
I'm just gonna have a look.
I owe your sister that much.
May I help you?
- Detective Arrango and Waller around?
- Your name?
McCaleb.
I'm here about the Gloria Torres case.
Iùs McCaleb.
Down the hall, up the stairs, first door on your right.
Thanks.
Well, Mr. McCaleb.
Detective Arrango.
I thought you were dead or retired.
I hear you want to talk about Gloria Torres.
Can we talk privately?
About what?
- I'm looking into her death.
- Here we go, same old shit.
I'll give you five minutes, thaùs it, before I toss your ass right out.
- My partner will be here in a minute.
- Want a doughnut?
I want to know who you're working for.
Her sister, right?
Thaùs right.
I knew it. Son of a bitch.
Let me see your ticket.
I don't have a license, if thaùs what you mean.
Is it stuffy in here?
Is it hot?
No.
Just get a little air.
Let me give us some air and make it more comfortable.
Okay, let me get this straight. You're conducting a homicide investigation...
...into the Gloria Torres case?
Thaùs true.
You don't have a license to practice as a private investigator in California?
Thaùs right.
Do you know iùs a crime to practice as an investigator without a license?
Will you knock off the crap?
I just wanted to have a talk.
Knock off the tape too.
- He's blocking the microphone anyway.
- Why didn't you say?
In the three years we've interrogated here, maybe I forgot.
Come on, fellas. I'm just here to help. Have a doughnut.
How do you know Graciella Rivers?
She's an acquaintance.
I told her I'd look into it. Thaùs all.
If you guys aren't gonna have one,
I'm gonna have one.
Look.
I don't care what her sister told you,
Mr. Former FBI Profiler.
This ain't the type of case you like.
This ain't a glamorous case that will get headlines.
This isn't Charles Manson or Ted fucking Bundy.
This is an ordinary convenience-store robbery.
Some idiot with a gun...
...with the right ratio of balls to brains pulled the trigger.
I told her I'd check it out.
You've been on this a while, and a fresh pair of eyes won't hurt.
I won't grandstand anybody.
I'll give any information to you first.
I'm not trying to one-up anyone.
What do you want?
A copy of the murder book and a video walk-through of the scene.
I was always good with crime scenes.
- No can do.
- Why not?
- No way, man.
- How often does the sister call you?
Every day, weekends, holidays...
Believe it or not, we got feelings.
It hurts me to tell her there are no leads or suspects.
I can get her off your case.
I tell her I looked into it, you're doing a good job, she stops calling.
You were always good at a crime scene.
But the key word is "were."
Are you still?
You just give me a copy of the tape, thaùs all.
Oh.
We got more than just the crime-scene tape.
We've got the crime.
Bring the doughnuts. Come on.
WALLER:
Thaùs Kyungwon Kang, the owner.
ARRANGO: He's making his last sale.
She comes in to buy a candy bar.
Yeah, for her kid.
And here he is. Ba-da-bing! Pow, pow.
He picked up all the shells.
MCCALEB:
Hm.
Won't see this on
America 's Favorite Videos.
- There's no sound on that camera?
- Right. He's just talking to himself.
- Could you run it in slow motion?
- Hold on. Iùs not over.
This guy coming up we call the Good Samaritan. Watch.
This guy goes up and down the aisles, looking for bandages, I guess.
Couldn't find any, so he used paper towels to wrap her head.
The camera never really gets a good look at him.
After he's finished, he goes outside, he dials 911...
...and splits.
The voice was Latino. We figure he was illegal, afraid to stay.
Yeah. Thaùs too bad.
He probably got a look at the car or the shooter.
We put out fliers, went on all the Spanish stations. Nothing.
- May I?
- Knock yourself out.
Pushing the pause button ain't gonna help her.
$32 in the cash register.
Look at that. He winked.
WALLER:
What?
Yeah.
Huh.
ARRANGO:
Well, there you have it, Mr. FBI Guy.
Tell us something we don't know.
The shooter's been in the store before.
He knew the placement of the camera.
He's from the neighborhood, or he just cased the place.
This isn't the first time either.
No emotion, no panic, policed up his own brass.
This guy's done it before.
What?
How many others?
Let me look at the murder book.
We have to talk to our lieutenant.
We'll be in touch.
- When?
- Give me a number. We'll be in touch!
WALLER: Jesus Christ.
You guys can keep the doughnuts.
We don't need your doughnuts or your shit!
We got enough of our own!
WOMAN:
Okay. Thanks.
MCCALEB: Mrs. Kang?
- Yes? I know you?
No.
I heard what happened here.
Your husband and all. I'm sorry.
Yes, thank you.
The only way to keep evil out is not unlock door.
We can't do that.
- We must have business.
- Yeah.
Thank you, ma'am.
You gonna pay me, or should
I drive you somewhere else?
MCCALEB:
Nearest public library.
Detective Winston said to wait here.
She'll be right with you.
Thanks.
Huh.
Well, well, well, Terry McCaleb.
- Hi.
- As I live and breathe.
Look at you.
Look at you.
I hear you got a new ticker.
Thaùs right. I'm all right, though.
How are you doing, babe?
Me? You know, same old, same old.
So, whaùs up?
You on a private ticket now?
No. Just doing a favor for a friend.
What case is it?
James Cordell. ATM holdup.
Leùs see.
January 22. Newspaper says he was shot by a guy wearing a ski mask.
Who's this friend you're doing the favor for?
Graciella Rivers. Her sister was shot in a store two weeks after.
Also a man in a ski mask.
Am I right? Are they connected?
Yeah. Same guy.
Out of your orbit, though.
Scumbag with a gun.
Three-strikes shit, thaùs all.
MCCALEB:
What do you mean?
Guy has two felonies, third puts him away for life.
So he kills any witnesses.
Robbery, murder, iùs all the same sentence for him either way.
I talked to the boys over at L.A.P.D., and they showed me a tape...
...but they wouldn't copy me the murder book.
Hm.
- I'll bet they copied you, though.
- Hm.
Come on, darling, you owe me just one little one.
I know that.
When you handed me the Cemetery Man bust...
...you were my membership into this boys club. I haven't forgotten.
Does that mean yes?
Terry McCaleb.
Lucky for us the bank had two cameras on this.
The shooter's back there.
I'm betting the mask isn't on yet, or Cordell would have run.
H&K 9mm, same model used in the Valley tape.
Hold that.
Back it up a little bit.
Back up there.
Look, he's saying something.
Like in the Valley tape.
He talked there too.
Yeah, he's a real chatterbox.
Did you get a lip reader in?
I'll get on it.
What about his cartridge?
Did he pick up his brass?
- Yeah, there he is.
- Uh-huh.
James Lockridge.
Pulled into the bank lot, almost got sideswiped by a sedan.
Says it was a white guy, but nothing else.
He called for the ambulance.
Cordell died going to the hospital.
You got any leads at all?
No, I'm following the three-strike thing.
I think the man in the ski mask is one of those.
What about the gun? H&K's expensive for a holdup man.
Thaùs weird he'd keep it after the first killing.
I thought about that. I figure he stole it, but that lead me nowhere.
I don't know. I think we'll need fresh blood to solve this one.
Well, Jaye...
...why don't you get me a copy of the book?
Both yours and L.A. Could you?
I'll ask the captain.
I don't see why not.
He was the lieutenant on the Cemetery Man case.
Yeah, I kind of remember that.
Oh, well. I'm glad someone got promoted.
- Right here.
- Thanks.
Mr. Lockridge, Terry McCaleb.
Thanks for seeing me.
LOCKRIDGE:
Are you a policeman?
No, retired FBI. I'm investigating a related case for a victim's family.
- Good. Because police are stupid.
- Why?
- Didn't they tell you?
- No.
Why would they? When I found the guy, I call 911, right?
MCCALEB: Yeah.
- Yeah.
They sent the ambulance to the wrong place.
Took them 20 minutes.
He might have made it if they hadn't screwed up.
- Those things happen.
- No.
They screwed up. A guy died.
End of story.
I'm busy. I agreed to see you because you're already here, so...
...what do you want?
I thought you'd give your statement to me firsthand.
For the love of God.
I needed cash.
As I pulled up, the guy driving out almost hits me.
All I saw was a car.
There were no plates, no face, nothing.
I walk up to the ATM, and there's this guy bleeding.
I figured he got it right before
I got there, so I called 911.
Ten minutes later, they come, driving right fucking past us. Past us.
Any other details?
It coulÔve been me.
CoulÔve been him finding me...
...with the ambulance driving right on fucking by. Good stuff.
You done?
Yeah.
Hey, Buddy.
Here's to you. Semper fi, auld lang syne, keep on trucking.
You look like a skunk.
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- Same as always. Big, fat goose egg.
I could use a driver.
$ 10 an hour and meals.
- Whaùs up? An investigation?
- I just need a driver, not a partner.
Okay. I'm in. Whose car?
If we take yours, I'll buy gas, or I'll sit in the back in mine...
...because of the air bags.
- Your chest, right?
Yeah.
Leùs take mine. That way
I won't feel like a chauffeur.
See you in the a.m.
You look tired, Terry.
You should get some sleep!
You don't deserve it.
First of all, I have no idea where your heart came from.
All BOPRA tells us is they have an organ...
...with a match to someone on the list.
In your case, we told you what we knew.
Female, 32, perfect health, perfect blood typing, perfect donor.
She was murdered.
- Murdered?
- Yeah.
What are you talking about?
She was shot during a robbery and lived long enough for me to get her heart.
How do you know? You're not supposed to know about the donor.
Her sister found me.
She read about how I had a rare blood type like her sister...
...and that my surgery was on the day she died.
What does she want? Money?
I'm glad you can find it funny.
She wants me to find out who did it.
She wants me to solve the murder.
Shit. Give me this woman's name right now.
- You're not thinking of doing this?
- I started yesterday.
And today you're running a fever!
You are 60 days post-transplant!
As your doctor,
I'm ordering you not to do this.
- Respect the gift you were given.
- I do, I do. It was her gift.
She'd be dead either way.
You don't owe her.
It was supposed to be an accident.
99 out of 100 of these are head injuries that end up fatal.
This one is different.
How is it different?
A hearùs a heart!
An accident is fate. Murder is evil.
Please.
I wouldn't have this gift if somebody hadn't done this hateful, evil thing.
You're not making sense.
She goes into a store to buy a candy bar for her kid.
I can't explain it.
Terry, sit down.
- You know that little boy in room 218?
- Yeah.
He's waiting for a heart that isn't coming. That could be you.
This is your one chance, Terry.
You tell that woman no.
You save yourself and tell her no!
I can't.
You're gambling with your life.
You get infection or rejection, there's nothing we can do.
- I have no choice.
- Neither do I.
I can't be your doctor.
I won't be around for this.
Come on, doc.
I'll have your records ready in the morning.
Good luck, Terry.
Graciella. Make it quick.
- Hello?
MCCALEB: Graciella.
This is McCaleb.
GRACIELLA:
Whaùs going on?
Tell me about her.
What do you mean?
Just tell me something about Gloria.
The more I know, the more
I can get a handle on this thing.
Do you have a kitchen on the boat?
A galley, yeah.
Is it big enough to cook a real meal?
Yeah, sort of.
So...
You want to know my sister, you'll have to meet her son.
He's everything that was good about her. Iùs in him.
I'll bring him by later, and I'll make you dinner.
Good. I'd like that.
Okay. Then you can give me an update.
Look, just so you know it, these cases usually turn on some small detail.
Something someone forgot or didn't think was important.
Thaùs the key.
I'll have to find it.
You have Glory's heart.
She'll guide you.
Yeah. Thanks.
Quick enough?
BUDDY: You okay?
- Yeah.
BUDDY: Huh?
- Dandy.
BUDDY: I'll tell you what. Let me stop by the In-N-Out on Victory.
I don't think they serve hamburgers here. Whaùs up?
The sheriff's office listed all the three-strikes robbery suspects.
They also made a list of every H&K P7 pistol stolen in the last few years.
I charted that list plus the address...
...and the work location of every man on the list.
- A cross-reference to check overlap?
- Exactly.
One guy stands out like a whore in church, and thaùs Mikail Bolotov.
He's a two-time loser, lives a mile from where Gloria Torres was shot...
...and works four blocks from where an H&K was stolen in December.
Why didn't they arrest this Polo, Bolo...?
- Bolotov.
- Bolotov.
Oh, a Russian son of a bitch!
They don't know about the pistol.
It seems he has a good alibi.
Iùs his timecard. He punched out after the Cordell murder.
- A friend could have done that.
- Yeah, true.
- I still don't know why we're here.
- Well...
This is where he works.
I'm gonna go have a talk with him.
- Cool.
- Where are you going?
You go after him, I pull you off.
Good cop, bad cop?
- No. Stay with the car.
- Come on, man. Starsky and Putz.
What are you expecting in there?
Nothing. This is just for show.
Hold this. Thanks.
Can I help you?
My name is McCaleb.
Following up the sheriff's department investigation of February 3.
Just a minute, please.
Mr. Toliver? A Mr. McCaleb from the sheriff's department is here.
- We're awfully busy, Mr. McCaleb.
- I'll get right to the point, then.
A few months ago, some deputies asked you about an employee.
- Bolotov?
- Yes.
I'm on the case.
I'd like to get a few more points.
I'll tell you what I told them.
Bolotov was working that day.
You can see his timecards.
How many employees do you have here at one time?
Eighty-five.
Is it possible that one of them might have punched his timecard for him?
We've been in business 16 years.
Iùs happened.
Is he here today?
Yes, thaùs him over there.
Bolotov. Thaùs Russian, right?
They're good workers and don't complain.
They don't mind being paid shit.
- I'd like to talk to him.
- In here?
You want to maintain your cooperation with the sheriff's office, don't you?
Yeah, all right.
Bolotov, up in the office.
Mr. Bolotov.
Have a chair.
Where were you on the night of January 22?
I told them before.
I worked that night.
I know, but we know things now that we didn't know then.
What things?
There was a burglary on Mason Street, about four blocks from here.
- Is that where you got the gun?
- What gun?
And February 7, I suppose you got an alibi for that night too.
I don't know that night.
'Course you do!
Thaùs the night you went into Kang's grocery store and killed two people.
Who are you?
You're not a cop.
Cops goes twos. Who are you?
I'm the Lone Ranger. Now sit down.
No badge. See? No cop.
"Terrell McCaleb."
Maybe one day, I pay you visit.
Yes?
Not now. I'll get back to him.
Bolotov's alibi isn't solid.
Think about it.
Even if you had a badge, iùd be the wrong one.
I like him for this.
Bolotov's an ex-con. He could have done that for any reason.
- You should still put out a pickup.
- Got you a soda, Terr.
- Who the hell are you?
- Buddy, Terry's partner.
- Sort of.
- Great.
Leùs get back to Bolotov.
I've already sent a car to his apartment. He's gone.
- I hit a nerve.
- I'll say.
Remember my lieutenant, who's now my captain? He's unhappy.
He doesn't want to hear from you again.
Terry has worked very hard on this.
We both have.
- Sh...
- Shut up.
Also...
...he wants the tapes and murder books back first thing in the morning.
Will that give you enough time to copy everything?
I've already done that. Thanks.
Go home, you look like crap.
Wait a minute.
Lip reader is 90% certain the shooter was saying, "Happy Valentine's Day."
Happy Valent...
That doesn't sound like your average three-strikes guy, does it?
Whaùs the average these days?
Not much, man.
Happy Valentine's Day.
GRACIELLA:
Do you see the boat?
I told you.
- How much homework do you have?
RAYMOND: Three questions.
- Hey.
GRACIELLA: Hey.
You forgot, didn't you?
Sort of. I kind of got lost the last couple hours.
- We can do this another time.
- No.
No, we're having dinner.
Come on up.
- Is this Raymond?
- This is Raymond.
This is the man I was telling you about.
MCCALEB: How are you doing?
- Whaùs The Following Sea?
Thaùs the one that you have to watch for, the one right behind you.
- Where's the kitchen? I mean, galley?
MCCALEB: Right in here.
- Can you fish off this boat?
- Yeah, you can.
Come on back,
I'll get you a fishing pole.
Jesus.
I didn't want you to see that.
Was she...?
Was she ever scared?
No, she never knew anything.
What I've asked you to do, it just isn't fair.
Is it?
There's a restaurant in the marina.
Good atmosphere, view of the sunset.
Why don't I just take you to dinner there.
GRACIELLA:
Why do you live on a boat?
MCCALEB:
I hate mowing lawns.
Why do you live onshore?
GRACIELLA: Because thaùs where my warm, cozy apartment is.
You were right, though.
Iùs a great sunset.
Yeah, you never get tired of it.
Does he stay with you?
Yeah. His dad isn't around.
He's a great kid. Your sister must have been a good woman.
Thank you.
So how is it going, McCaleb?
Any hope?
Start thinking about your sister...
...who her friends were, where she went, all of her routines.
- All right. How come?
- Thaùs just an angle I'm working on.
Did she ever know a James Cordell?
- Cordell?
- Yeah.
No.
- You sure?
- Positive. Why?
It may be nothing.
It might be premature...
You think this James Cordell killed her.
No, nothing like that.
Stop, McCaleb, with the prematures and the angles. What?
Cordell was killed at an ATM machine two weeks before your sister died.
We think iùs the same gunman in both cases.
Why would she know Cordell?
They were both in the wrong place at the wrong time.
This investigation's being conducted under the theory...
...that the locations were chosen and the victims were random.
Iùs the other way around. Iùs not where thaùs important. Iùs who.
- Gunman took money, so iùs robbery...
- Bear with me.
Cordell and your sister were connected.
There's some intersecting link between them and the killer.
I'm not following you.
At the Bureau, we used to call this a full-field investigation.
- Thaùs what I'm conducting here.
- Full-field investigation.
Yeah.
Okay.
Come on!
You know, there was one thing thaùs always bothered me.
- What?
- Nothing, but...
What is it?
Glory had this piece of jewelry she always wore. Like a good-luck charm.
She never took it off. When the police brought me her effects, it was missing.
What was it?
It was a single earring, a dangling crucifix.
Okay. So, what does it mean?
Nothing. Some killers take souvenirs, I suppose.
- Thaùs sick.
- Yeah.
Are you okay?
Yeah. I gotta get back to the boat for my medicine.
We have to get going too.
Raymond has some homework.
Raymond?
We've gotta go!
Say thank you to Mr. McCaleb. Come!
Thank you!
- Give me that school bag.
- Okay.
- Say thank you.
RAYMOND: Thank you.
MCCALEB: See you later.
GRACIELLA: Give me the school bag.
And he takes the earring.
Hey, Buddy!
Whaùs up?
You're working tomorrow, 6 a.m.
Cool. Whatever.
BUDDY:
Who wants to go to the desert anyhow?
We go where the clues lead.
Don't any clues lead to the beach?
They lead where they lead. Usually pretty close to where they started.
I have to ask, Terry.
How did it feel?
Back in the day, when you were going up against all those sickos?
That was my job.
Come on, man. I mean, driving a truck, thaùs a job.
All those killers you used to hunt down.
I read in the paper some used to leave you messages. That ain't truck driving.
Only one, actually, ever left me messages.
Sorry, I'm sticking my nose in it, I know.
Connected.
What?
When I was at the top of my game,
I felt connected to everything.
The victim, the killer, the crime scene.
Everything.
Just felt like it was all part of me.
Iùs beginning to feel that way again.
Cool.
I'll tell you what. Driving is okay because I would shit my shorts.
I would.
But thaùs why you're a famous cop and I'm a boat bum. A loser.
Buddy, you're not a loser.
Iùs okay, Terry.
Only my mom has to tell me that.
My friends can tell me the truth.
Mrs. Cordell?
I'm Terry McCaleb. I called you.
Is this a bad time?
- As opposed to a good time?
- Poor choice of words. Can we talk?
Is that your partner in the car?
Yeah.
I wanted to hire an investigator, but I couldn't afford to.
Couldn't afford to find out who killed him.
You work for the police?
No, I'm a retired FBI agent.
I'm also a friend of the family of the woman killed in Canoga Park.
We think iùs the same gunman.
I see.
I'd like to tell you I'm sorry.
Thaùs hard coming from a stranger...
...but I went through the files, and
James seemed like a good man.
Funny hearing him called James.
Everyone called him Jimmy.
And he was a very good man.
How can I help, Mr. McCaleb?
See this photograph?
Does this woman look familiar to you?
- Is that someone he might have known?
- I don't think so.
- Is that the victim from Canoga Park?
- Right.
- Is that her son?
- Uh-huh.
I don't understand.
How could he know her?
Are you suggesting they...?
- No, nothing like that.
- Then, like what?
We think your husband and Miss Torres may have crossed paths with the killer...
...sort of the relationship between the victim and the gunman.
The smallest detail of them coming in contact is very, very important.
Something like dining at the same restaurant, for instance.
- A restaurant the killer went to?
- Yeah.
That sounds like stalking, not robbery.
To be honest with you, we're not sure robbery is the motive in this case.
When they brought back his effects, was it all there?
Was anything missing?
Rings, watches?
No.
You're sure he couldn't have been in the Valley two weeks before?
No, he spent a month in Northern
California, working on the aqueduct.
And when my husband wasn't working, he was home with me.
- Is that his car?
- Yes.
Any personal effects in that?
A picture on the dashboard.
- Still there?
- I don't know. I would think.
The sheriff's department drove it home. I haven't been in it.
Can I...?
There it is.
MCCALEB:
Right here, yeah.
Any of this stuff your husbanÔs favorite knickknacks?
No, sorry.
Could you jot down your husbanÔs routines for me...?
- His sunglasses.
- What?
They hung from the mirror on a cord.
They're missing.
What kind of glasses?
They were Wayfarers.
He had them for years.
- Wayfarers?
- What do you think it means?
I said, what do you think it means?
Probably nothing.
Thanks, Mrs. Cordell.
I'll call you if anything comes up.
Easy, Mac. Whaùs the matter?
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
I saw the killer, Buddy.
At the bank, at the ATM, where Cordell was killed.
Wait a minute, thaùs crazy.
Thaùs the last place he would be.
No, it fits the profile.
Profile? What profile?
Take me to the L.A. County
Sheriff's Office.
No, wait! I don't get it.
Why would the killer go back?
Okay. Never mind, I'll just drive.
- Now you're starting to get it.
- This goes any longer, I want a raise.
How about workmen's comp?
Detective Winston's in the field.
Can I take a message?
- Tell her McCaleb was by.
- Hey.
She wanted to see you, Mr. McCaleb.
How about that?
Iùs McCaleb, Jaye.
WINSTON: I'm en route. You should get yourself down here ASAP.
What was that first part?
I said, we've got Bolotov.
- Stay there, Buddy.
- This sucks!
Trash collectors found him.
We think he's been here since early a.m.
- What are they doing here?
- This alley is the line.
The line?
South side's L.A.P.D., north is sheriff's department.
We're not sure who has jurisdiction yet.
Congratulations, old man!
You shook him out of his tree.
Dumb bastard killed himself.
H&K 9mm.
Same as both murders.
I bet ballistics confirms it.
- What are you talking about?
- He's saying this case is closed.
Bolotov, he doesn't fit the profile.
- Of what?
- A serial killer.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This guy stalks his victims and kills them on camera...
...then he takes trophy items.
- What are you talking about?
I was at the ATM crime scene.
The killer was behind me.
He had Cordell's glasses on, and he had Gloria Torres' earring.
Did they look like these?
This? And this?
I don't care what you call him.
We got him.
- I don't know, his hair was long.
- Maybe it was a wig?
Maybe.
- You wanna sit down?
- I'm fine, goddamn it.
- Why don't you lay down?
- Arrango, shut up!
There's something in his mouth.
- Iùs a bullet.
- No way it came from a 9mm.
- Looks like a.38 to me.
- Why'd he put a.38 slug in his mouth?
Same reason he died on the jurisdiction line.
Somebody's trying to jerk us all off.
Personally, I like being jerked off.
This case is closed in my book.
You're just worried, aren't you?
- Worried?
- Yeah.
About what?
That I might bust this case.
You don't care who gets hurt or killed.
- As long as I don't bust the case.
- What the fuck is it to you anyway?
Gloria Torres, that victim you didn't give a shit about?
I've got her heart. Thaùs what.
Thaùs right.
I'm alive because she's dead.
That puts me in this bigtime.
You're an asshole, and you can't help it, but I'm on this case for a while.
I'll be along until we get him.
I don't care whether iùs you, him or whoever. I'm in this.
Stay out of my city!
Go get yourself a dick transplant!
Conflict of interest.
- Ever think about that?
MCCALEB: Pain in the ass.
- How much do I owe you?
- I don't know, 200 or so.
That sounds right.
- Take a check?
- Yeah, sure.
You look like shit.
You should take a nap.
Yeah, thanks. I will.
- Who do I make it out to? Buddy?
- Jasper. Jasper Noone. N-O-O-N-E.
I know the Noone part. But Jasper?
I look more like a Buddy than a Jasper, huh?
Yeah.
Take a nap.
GRACIELLA: Ray, stay here. Be careful of the edges. I'll be right out.
MCCALEB: Hi.
- Hey.
So is it true?
What?
I heard it on the news. They said that they found a Russian man...
...who may be the killer.
I don't know.
I don't think so, but I don't know.
They said they had evidence that could link this guy to both murders.
That may just be two cops trying to grab headlines.
I don't know. Sorry.
You're starting to sound like L.A.P.D.
I need some answers.
Because no one knows...
No one has a clue what that boy goes through every night without his mother.
I'm sorry.
I did what you asked.
I made a list of all of Glory's routines.
Thaùs good.
She used to go to that market almost every night.
She'd take Raymond to McDonalÔs a lot. Too much.
The one on Ventura and Reseda.
And she would go bowling, but not lately.
She used to visit an aunt every Thursday...
...because our aunt was in a nursing home in Culver City.
Like a responsible person, she never missed a day of work.
She gave blood every month, took her son to school...
...and I wanna understand why she was killed!
What?
She gave blood?
Yes, McCaleb. She's the same blood type as you are.
AB with a CMV negative.
The hospital would have paid her, but she wouldn't accept money.
- Thaùs the connection!
- What are you talking about?
Thaùs the link between Cordell and your sister. Blood.
Wait a minute. Blood?
I'll cover tomorrow's shift.
Yeah, thanks.
- Don't you ever use a cell phone?
- I don't believe in them.
I always stay with a hard line.
Mrs. Cordell wasn't home.
Is there another way to find out?
If he gave blood often, he'd be on the computer.
- Which computer?
- The BOPRA computer.
For rare blood types.
There's one at L.A. Memorial.
- All right. I'm coming with you.
- Get somebody to stay with the kid.
MCCALEB:
What do you think?
What do you mean, babysitting?
MCCALEB: Yeah.
- Fuck me.
How much?
I don't know. Beer.
A case of beer an hour.
You got it.
MAN: They said some kind of blockage.
In about an hour.
MCCALEB:
Hey, doc.
Terry. Whaùs wrong?
Nothing. Is there a place we could talk privately?
I need to talk to you.
You have five minutes.
Who's this?
Graciella Rivers, the one I told you about.
She's the one who put you up to this.
Look at him. Look at his color.
Look at the lines under his eyes.
A week ago, he was perfect.
- I am sorry.
- It was my choice.
Shut up! Sit down.
Open your mouth.
Lift your shirt up.
- What do you want?
- We wanted to know...
- Keep that thermometer in your mouth.
- My sister was murdered.
So was another man.
It was the same killer.
McCaleb found a link between my sister and this other man.
- They both gave blood.
- What?
She was the same blood type as McCaleb, AB with CMV negative.
McCaleb says thaùs 1 in 200.
101. 1. Shit.
What do you want?
I want you to access the BOPRA computer.
If Cordell's on it,
I wanna know his blood type.
Thaùs unethical.
You've gotta help. If I'm right, the killer already has access.
I don't know...
If you can't protect the integrity of the system, there's no system.
All right.
I'll do it on one condition.
Whaùs that?
Let me run blood work on you.
- That will take all day!
- Yes or no?
- Yes.
- Sit down.
I'll get the nurse.
MAN:
Very still now.
WOMAN:
We're almost done.
I want you to stop, McCaleb.
Stop what?
Everything.
I was wrong to bring this to you.
No.
Yeah.
Glory gave another person life.
- Thaùs really all I need to know.
- No.
Look, I got a new heart, but...
...I didn't necessarily get a new life.
I don't know what you mean.
I lost a little something...
...but knowing you and working with you on this...
...I feel a little bit coming back.
Okay.
Iùs a list of the local AB CMV negatives. Cordell's on it.
Same blood type as Torres.
Whaùs the D stand for? Deceased?
No, donor. Organ donor.
They were both organ donors.
Both organ donors?
Cordell died on the scene, and Gloria lived just long enough.
- Thaùs crazy.
- What are you saying?
I missed it, damn it.
I didn't think Gloria had anything anyone wanted, but I missed it.
What did you miss?
FOX:
Her blood.
It made her unique.
It made what was inside her very valuable. To someone.
Someone like me. Anyone who could benefit would be a suspect.
Wait a minute. You're saying that she was murdered for her organs.
The autopsy report had both bullets going through the frontal lobe.
That could leave them brain dead, but not die right away.
Of course, Cordell... 911 screwed up, but your sister had the Good Samaritan.
Who?
Thaùs the customer who came in, bandaged her head and called 911.
- You can't get back until...
- Can I use your phone?
- Terry...
- Get a list of where the organs went.
GRACIELLA:
Terry.
Detective Jaye Winston?
Graciella Rivers. He's inside talking about surveillance and numbers.
This is Arrango from
West Valley Homicide.
Badge 14110. I'd like a 10-20 for a surveillance commencement.
WOMAN:
Thaùs 17: 14:39.
Thank you. 17: 14:39.
I'm out of my jurisdiction, and you're way out. Whaùs up?
The surveillance camera's three seconds behind the CCW clock.
- Thaùs the one 911 uses.
- Okay, so?
So did you bring the tape?
OPERATOR:
This is the 911 operator.
MAN: The girl is shot very bad!
She needs help!
OPERATOR:
Who was shot, sir?
MAN: The girl is shot!
Kang's Market, Sherman Way!
OPERATOR:
Sir, please stay on the line.
Thaùs 10:40:58.
All right. At 22:41:37...
...Gloria is shot.
Jump down to...
...22:42:55, and here comes
Good Samaritan.
That son of a bitch.
What? What is it?
This guy here...
...this unidentified Good Samaritan, who tried to help Gloria.
There's just one problem.
Whaùs that?
The clock on the surveillance camera is three seconds behind the 911 clock.
All right, and...?
We think he made the call before he killed her.
No.
No, that doesn't make any sense, because the numbers...
Wait a minute.
The caller.
Iùs the same guy.
He called an ambulance before he shot her.
Yeah.
See, Cordell, his organs were no good.
This time, the shooter would make sure the ambulance got a good lead.
So he shot Gloria, then he comes back with bandages...
...and tries to keep her alive.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
Could this Good Samaritan be the same guy you saw at the ATM machine?
I don't know.
Put a wig on him, maybe.
A little dark makeup, he's Hispanic.
You got those ATM tapes?
No. You only told me to bring this one.
Yeah, well...
The ATM thing. The shooter probably had them on the way anyway.
They went to the wrong address, so it doesn't matter.
What do you think about
Lockridge for this?
I don't know, maybe.
Whoever got the list of organ donors had to hack into the BOPRA computer.
Lockridge is a computer man, right?
And he lives and works in my jurisdiction. Leùs go.
GRACIELLA:
I have to go with you.
No, get back to Raymond.
Take my car. I'll go with Jaye.
Why don't you pop the trunk?
I'll put this stuff in the back.
Okay.
What the fuck is he doing?
McCaleb! What are you doing?!
You're killing me here.
Whaùs going on?
- You okay?
- Yeah. You okay?
- Yeah.
- Leùs go find Lockridge at work.
What do you mean?
We just shot up the Valley.
Did you hit anyone?
- No, thank God.
- Neither did I. Leùs go.
Fuck.
Mr. Lockridge didn't come to work today.
- Is he ill?
- He hasn't called...
...and he didn't come in yesterday either.
Come here and look at this.
Doesn't that look like probable cause to you?
Leùs go.
See if I remember how they did this.
Shit.
Her throaùs been slit.
She's been here a good 24 hours.
WINSTON:
You okay?
Yeah.
We got an APB out on Lockridge.
I might get suspended, but you did real good, McCaleb.
Real good.
I hope so.
I guess I'd better get home and get my pills.
Want some coffee?
No, go home. Get your pills.
You still got company.
How much beer do I owe you?
Seven cases...
...but since he's a good kid and a great fisherman, I'll take two.
I'll get you the check in the morning.
Thaùs what they all say.
Good night, Terry.
MCCALEB: Hey.
- Hey, Mr. McCaleb.
MCCALEB:
Howdy.
GRACIELLA: Hey.
MCCALEB: How are you?
Me and Buddy caught so many fish he had to get more bait.
- I caught six all by myself.
- Really? It must be a harbor record.
Iùs "Buddy and I."
Finish your homework, Ray.
So?
I'm not sure yet, but iùs looking good.
Okay. When will you know?
Soon, hopefully.
Thank you.
For everything you've done.
I'm impressed.
GRACIELLA:
Thaùs my dad.
He used to take Glory and me fishing.
A lot.
When we were kids.
You know, they're all gone.
But I'm glad I can still smile about her, you know?
I couldn't at first.
This is a cool gun, Mr. McCaleb.
Oh, shit...
GRACIELLA: Raymond...
- Iùs all over. Don't, no.
You never, never touch a gun.
See? You can look at it.
This is an eight-shot
Smith & Wesson.
We don't touch it.
I shouldn't have left it out.
You never play with this, so stay right there. Understand?
Whaùs this?
Oh, thaùs some code I was supposed to break, but I never could do it.
- There's no one.
- What?
There's no 1.
Iùs all the numbers, but no 1.
How about that? No 1 s.
Little man, come on.
We have to go. Iùs getting late.
- Can I stay?
GRACIELLA: No.
- We gotta go. Iùs getting late.
- I don't want to.
We have to. Okay?
Were you just going to let me sit here and eat alone?
Raymond loves this boat, and he was wondering if he could spend the night.
Yeah, there's a berth in front you can both share.
You don't have to hide it.
Show me your heart.
Show me.
- Somebody's up on deck.
- Whaùs wrong?
- I don't know. Somebody's up there.
- Raymond.
No, too heavy for him.
- You son of a bitch!
MCCALEB: What the hell is going on?
Jesus Christ! We came because the captain wants you at the crime scene.
ARRANGO:
When this is over...
...you better get an ass transplant because I'll tear you a new one!
Damn, iùs cold.
ARRANGO:
Out of the way, please.
There's McCaleb. Mr. McCaleb, did you think this was over?
I can't comment, I don't know anything about anything.
- Oh, no.
- What?
This is where I had my attack.
Lockridge.
James Lockridge, the guy who found Cordell at the ATM machine.
Looks like your Code Killer's back.
Happy Valentine's Day.
Way to make a comeback.
Some people get flowers, some people get chocolates.
You get a dead guy.
Mr. McCaleb.
Do you think iùs the Code Killer?
WOMAN: Hey!
MAN: Whaùs going on?
MAN:
Iùs all right.
Paper said something you didn't like?
Ballistics will match this slug with the one in Bolotov's mouth.
It was the Code Killer.
Torres, Cordell, Bolotov, all of them.
What does that mean?
I shot him two years ago. The slug in
Bolotov's mouth is the one that hit him.
Now I'm back...
...and so is he.
Every second we're talking, you could be trying to get this son of a bitch.
We got a lot of good people out there.
You're right.
Better chance of breaking this with you in here.
- Fuck you, Bureau man!
- Enough of that, detective.
ARRANGO: Yes, sir.
- McCaleb.
This Code Killer likes to impress you.
Any idea why?
I had a media profile, so did he.
I guess he missed the matchup, me and him on the news every night.
I thought once these guys started, they didn't stop.
But your Codie's been down for two years.
What do you make of that?
I don't know. I shot him. I always figured he crawled off and died.
- What do the numbers mean?
- Don't know that either.
We ran it by the computers at Cal, by the code breakers at the NSA.
Nobody comes up with anything.
Except...
Except what?
There's no digit number one.
No 1, whatever that might mean.
Guys, step out. Give us a minute.
Okay.
Just cop to cop, whaùs going on here?
Cordell, Gloria Torres...
He did them for me.
Keep talking until I understand.
He missed the action. Me and him.
In order to get it back,
I needed a new heart, so...
...Happy Valentine's Day.
Holy shit.
Now the love letters are gonna start, hot and heavy.
You might have the captain fooled, but not me.
You got Torres' heart.
That makes you suspect number one.
What a waste of a good
Mexican's heart!
Get out of here.
Graciella?
Raymond?
Hey, Ter!
Welcome to Davy Jones' locker.
Have you seen Graciella and Raymond?
They got tired of waiting for you.
They left about an hour ago.
You're all over the news, brother!
How long we been neighbors?
I don't know. I moved into the marina about a week after you.
- Raise up your shirt.
- What?
Raise it up.
Now.
Come on, turn around.
I'm the following sea, man.
I'm the one you need to watch out for.
When did you figure it out?
On the check.
"No one."
I had a little trouble with the Jasper part.
Oh.
I coulÔve killed you if I wanted to.
I was behind you at the ATM.
I followed you to Kang's Market, just like I followed Gloria Torres.
You sick son of a bitch.
I studied her. I chose her.
She was my valentine to you.
I gave you life.
What else you wanna know?
That necklace belonged to a girl named Sunny. Lockridge's wife.
When Sunny gets blue,
I slit her throat.
There's a story for every piece of crap on that tray.
Come on, man.
You're mine forever.
Every breath you take belongs to me.
Every beat of that stolen heart is the echo of my voice in your head.
Every day.
Always.
It depends on you. Pull that trigger, you'll never see them again.
- What?
- Kill me, no one will find them.
They will die. Alone.
In a black hole.
And that will be on you.
You know me. You know I have them.
- What do you want?
- I want you to live.
I want me to live.
I want it all to start again, you know, the battle between good and evil.
Can't you see I've been getting you back to where you need to be?
I'm not interested.
Bullshit. That day in the car, what did you say you felt?
What was the word?
You felt "connected." Shit.
I almost came when you said that.
Because thaùs us, Terry.
Thaùs you and me.
Iùs us. We were meant to be.
We're Cain and Abel.
Kennedy and Oswald.
We are shit in the bottom of somebody's shoe.
I have to leave now.
And you're not gonna follow me.
You're not gonna scrape me off.
You'll sit by that pay phone and wait for me to call you from time to time...
...and when I'm relocated and ready,
I'll let Graciella and Raymond go.
Then you and me, we can start again.
I hope you think of me as often as I think of you.
BUDDY:
Ah!
God. Crazy!
Call an ambulance!
You're gonna take me to them.
Keep that tight. That will pinch the artery, and you won't bleed to death.
- Now, show me.
- Okay.
Whaùs it like having a chick's heart?
You start watching soaps?
Get cranky at the end of the month?
Hear some love song on the radio, you start crying?
Plus iùs a spic heart.
She was a wetback.
You wake up going, "Arriba! Gotta get me some enchiladas for the cholita."
Shut up!
When they were girls going to Sunday school...
...do you think Gloria Torres ever thought that her heart...
...would be pumping blood through some guy that was banging her sister?
You don't look so good, Ter.
You don't look so good yourself there, Buddy.
Ran aground in that storm last year. Remember?
Salvage company's gonna demo it next week.
Till then, iùs a perfect prison.
Better than Alcatraz.
My little shop of horrors.
Just so you know...
...I would never hurt that little boy.
See, he's the same blood type.
He's the backup.
In case anything happens to his mom's heart.
MCCALEB:
Come on.
Do you think you have a chance?
With Graciella?
You think she can love you?
After her sister died for you?
Thaùs tough for her to get around.
Leùs go. Leùs get going.
You can put the belt in your teeth.
Follow me.
In there.
- The key.
- Ah.
GRACIELLA: Hey.
- Hey.
Come on.
- I knew you'd find us, Terry.
MCCALEB: Yeah, well.
He may be on the boat, but I'm not sure if he's dead or alive. Leùs go.
Did your father teach you to run a boat?
- Yeah.
- My boaùs at the end of this gangway.
Wait a few minutes, then go on down there.
Use this knife to cut the lines.
Back off about 100 yards or more and wait till I call you.
- All right?
- Yeah.
If I don't call you in a half-hour, get the hell out of here.
Okay. Get going.
GRACIELLA:
Leùs go. Come on, honey.
BUDDY:
I'm sad, Terry!
GRACIELLA:
Get inside. Hurry up.
Get down below, Raymond!
Come on, man.
We're connected.
Think of what you're doing.
You need me.
No, Buddy.
Remember how you said I was your friend and I could tell you the truth?
Well, I don't need you at all.
Ten ring.
I saved you.
- Right next to you the whole time.
- Yeah.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Never felt better.
You got his ass.
Yeah, there's "no one" anymore.
Give me a day to catch my breath,
I'll write you a full report.
I want to see it.
Two of them okay?
Yeah, if everyone will leave them alone...
...not get them any more involved.
- I'll see what I can do about that.
- Thaùs a pal.
How are you planning to deal with all this?
Well, I've got Gloria Torres' heart.
I'll probably just let that guide me.
- You got anyone, Jaye?
- Excuse me?
Police work can get kind of heavy on you.
You got anyone at home?
Yeah, I got someone.
Good.
ARRANGO:
McCaleb!
Thaùs it! I'm sick and tired of your grandstanding bullshit!
WINSTON:
You're out of your jurisdiction.
Maybe. But because you got a Mexican's heart, it don't make you one of us!
Arrango?
Next time you come around this dock, this Mexican will kick your ass.
What? You're out of your goddamn mind!
ARRANGO:
All my life, I've had the shitty jobs.
You got him talking to himself.
I didn't even know he spoke Spanish.
Poor baby, he's been at this all morning.
I wish I could get a big, fat marlin and put it on his line.

In short, I think that negotiations are well underway.
They've shown losses, but we'll analyse them.
I think they can be written off.
They have a potential for development which they can't finance.
That's why they need a partner.
My decision is subject to examination of the information they've provided us.
It needs to be analysed.
We're walking a fine line, a very fine line.
But we remain within the limits of the law.
Merci.
Mmm...
Sleep well?
Not bad.
I took some Valerian.
It works well.
- Oh, yeah.
- And you?
- Volf doesn't sleep on planes.
- So, is it a deal?
- Everyone wins, right?
- It will require legal acrobatics.
I'll look over the file again and let you know.
- Can you do it soon?
- Yes.
I'm seeing Volf for breakfast tomorrow morning.
Good morning.
We'll have the report from the Japanese lawyer.
Want a ride back with us?
No way. I have my jet-black
Audi TT that I bought last week.
- You left it in the parking lot?
- Of course.
- Did you sleep?
- Not a wink.
Not in economy.
No leg room.
- Next time you'll go business.
- Next time you won't need me.
- Did you try the Valerian?
- I took three.
You take too many pills.
You want a ride?
- Karim is coming.
- I have to drop this off at the office.
Good morning.
Merci.
Are you OK?
I'm sorry...
I'm feeling a bit weak.
It must be the jet lag.
- We didn't sleep much in Tokyo. Here.
- Thank you.
That's true.
I didn't get much sleep.
- Hello, Madam.
- Good morning. How's traffic?
It could be worse.
- Had a nice trip?
- Yes, thank you.
Well...
...say hello to your jet-black Audi TT.
I need cash.
We'll talk later at the office.
OK.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Thank you.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- He's on the terrace.
- Thank you.
Bye, girls.
No clowning around today!
Give your teacher a break.
Goodbye.
Have a seat.
You know, they found Karen in the boot of her car in a parking lot in St. Denis.
She'd been inside it for 18 hours.
I just spoke to the hospital.
She's OK, but she almost suffocated to death.
She'll stay a few more days then take a week to rest.
The briefcase?
Oh... vanished.
It's not so much the files, we'll have copies by tonight, it's the message.
We have competitors who'll do anything.
Which ones?
Who cares?
There are several.
They know we're in negotiation.
They want our information to make a better offer.
Would the Japanese follow?
If the offer's good, and if it's better than ours, why wouldn't they accept it, uh?
- Coffee?
- Please.
So we have to act faster than them.
Karen's out of commission.
You'll take over the case and close the deal.
I don't just mean the Japanese venture.
I mean the entire operation.
- Are you willing?
- I'm willing.
Get ready to go back to Tokyo next week.
- What are you doing?
- Copying your appointments.
- You have them at the office.
- Not all of them.
Are you OK?
- Can I help?
- Come close to me.
- Jean-Paul didn't come?
- He's in Chicago.
- When is he coming back?
- Next week at the earliest.
Who's watching your daughter?
Her father's sister.
- Does she know?
- No one does. I lied to everyone.
I feel dirty... disgusting.
Like I was raped.
It's not the same thing.
Not knowing who did it...
- You weren't raped.
- I was.
Stop, Karen.
- You're shelling out to Ericom again?
- No, my client's off. I'm stuck.
London is giving a press conference on Friday.
Mr Volf will explain the real estate operation in Qatar.
- Yes?
- Do I warn Mr El Hamadi?
He already knows.
He wants to be there.
He's in his jet somewhere between Cairo and New York. You have his number.
Send me a report and I'll decide.
For Mr Olek.
Here are the Japan files, plus the list of stolen documents.
Put them down.
- What about Karen's other files?
- Give them to Hervé.
I can manage with some of them.
Don't manage with anything.
Do as I say.
She's getting on my nerves.
- Did you give Karen a call?
- No time.
She's better. Not 100%, but her Audi TT is unscathed.
- I'll call tonight.
- Yeah, you do that.
- What do you mean?
- She's lousy and you can't stand her.
Come on, the office isn't wired.
It suits us both.
Is anyone home?
- Yes or no?
- Yes.
Thanks for your trust.
I need the Japanese lawyer's report.
- Don't you have it?
- I saw it on your desk.
YOU FORGOT SOMETHING
Merci.
Elise, what's this pile of Karen's stuff?
I'm busy.
Can't you deal with it?
I intended to.
Diane said not to.
- Why?
- I have no idea.
Take them.
If you don't understand, ask me.
- And Diane?
- Don't worry about her.
- You don't like her much.
- Not much. And you?
Me neither. She's cold, inhuman.
But I respect her.
- I can't wait for Karen to come back.
- Don't count on it.
- Diane's staying?
- You'd better get used to her.
She's better than Karen.
And Volf protects her.
I'm exhausted.
I'm out of shape and I smoke too much.
I received Karen's briefcase.
The Japanese file is airtight.
Perfectly legal.
We can't do a thing.
Volf asked me to finalise the contract.
Instead of Karen?
- I'm impressed.
- Isn't that what you wanted?
Do what he tells you.
We have no choice.
Go over the contract with a fine-tooth comb.
If there's anything fishy, we'll act.
- If not...
- If not?
If not, I don't know.
- I need to think.
- Wait!
The money was wired to your Swiss bank.
Sorry, I can't talk.
I'm having lunch with the French people.
All I want is to get out of here.
I'm bored to death.
A typical business lunch.
A real bore.
No, it's not Karen.
Her name is Diane.
A real ice queen.
He has a Sylvie Vartan poster?
Sylvie Vartan and Johnny Hallyday are old news.
Can he sing us his favourite song?
Let's toast to the success of our venture.
Of course, cheers.
Tell Mr Ishegawa that what worries Mr Volf and our legal department is the issue of the models.
- The models?
- Oui.
We want to know whether your artists base their work on photos of minors or have minors pose for them.
Not at all.
We've never done anything like that.
I'm sorry, but your characters are underage.
They have no pubic hair.
It's not legal to show pubic hair in Japan.
In France, the law is very strict on those matters.
If we make the deal,
I say "if", we have to put a... a clause to protect us, you know?
Er... in case of a lawsuit involving child pornography.
OK, child pornography we cannot touch. OK?
Did he understand what I said?
No models.
They're fantasy characters in a fantasy world.
Yes, yes. OK, I know.
But, I say "but", if there are any problems, any lawsuit, our deal is immediately, immediately off.
What's illegal in Europe is illegal here.
TokyoAnime has been making films for ten years.
Good for you.
We are the world leader in adult animation.
With the Internet, we've grown by 60%.
We can't take such risks.
OK, OK, OK.
Well, I said what I had to say.
All right?
What about
TokyoAnime comic books?
We have written contracts with every single graphic artist.
What if they don't respect the contracts?
Then we would terminate the partnership.
Has it ever happened?
Has it ever happened?
I'm sorry, but I need an answer.
Has it ever happened?
Yes, it has, a long time ago.
That's exactly why we are ultra-careful now.
This is the film currently in production.
You know the basics:
Ai and Mai are two ninja sisters who use sex magic to fight monsters in a parallel universe.
This series does really well.
It's a big hit in the States.
She's in a tight fix.
I said she's in a tight fix.
Forget it.
No need to translate.
A film like this is already outdated.
We'll keep producing them for two years at the most.
Then we have to move on to 3D animation.
Or else it's simple: we go out of business.
It's state of the art.
It's what consumers know.
It's what consumers want.
It's the wave of the future.
But it's still very expensive.
It's motion-captured with 12 cameras.
We have the best artists, technicians and skills.
Mm-hmm.
But we need you to help
TokyoAnime move into digital 3D...
...and control our worldwide distribution.
Volf will call at 6pm, Paris time.
- What time here?
- 1am.
- Where will he call?
- Your hotel room.
- It's almost a done deal.
- You think so?
There are no obstacles.
Too bad for Karen.
- You'll reap the benefits.
- Which benefits?
No, thank you.
Volf's trust.
Karen will be back to the legal department, maybe to real estate law.
So her getting mugged benefits me?
- Doesn't it?
- So what?
Nothing.
Don't put words in my mouth.
I'll go get drinks.
What do you want?
- Whisky. Diane?
- Vodka.
- I didn't like your sense of irony.
- Tough luck.
You didn't lay it on a bit thick?
You're oversensitive.
I could find it suspicious.
When someone's listening who doesn't know your irony,
- you're right, I'm oversensitive.
- I, er...
- No, don't play games with me.
- I told you!
Karen is history and I'm glad.
- So you think...?
- I don't think anything.
I couldn't care less.
Stop hounding me.
Relax.
It will do you good.
I'm going back.
I booked a massage.
- The driver is waiting for you.
- Merci.
'...commanding commissioners for their states like work,
'they have risen above parts of the motions...'

Hello?
Not at all.
I was watching TV.
Hmm?
CNN. It sucks.
Yes. I know.
Volf's secretary called.
He's stuck in a meeting.
London?
London again.
Real estate again.
He faxed us a memo.
Do you have it?
I haven't received anything.
- No? It was sent an hour ago.
- I'll go check.
Thank you.
- Do you want a drink?
- No, thanks. I've had enough.
Maybe some water, please.
It's not finished.
It's still coming through.
It's a draft for a contract with TokyoAnime.
- Want to see it?
- No.
- I made a copy of the memo.
- He won't call.
I'm going to sleep.
Slip the contract under my door.
- Mm-hmm. 4522?
- Yes, 4522.
Good night.
- I'm not going to the office.
- Me neither.
I'll go in early tomorrow.
- When do the Americans arrive?
- In the morning.
That's why I want to work on the case.
OK.
'Please leave a message after the beep.'
'It's me. Are you hiding behind your answering machine?
'I'll wait.'
OK, you're not there.
We should talk a little.
Outside the office.
What do you think? Tonight?
I can, but late.
At 11pm in the bar of the Raphael?
'Leave a message.'
I didn't hear from you.
I'm going to the Raphael just in case.
I'll wait there a while.
If you come, great.
If not, see you tomorrow.
- Have they arrived already?
- Not yet.
But it's really important, OK?
Are you listening?
It's got to be not Moroccan but Tibetan rouge.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Elise.
- Hi, I'm Elaine. How are you doing?
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- Rodney.
- Thank you.
Mr Gomez arrived earlier this morning from New York.
He said he'd be waiting for you at the hotel.
- What time is the meeting?
- As planned.
You have your schedule on the fax that I sent you.
Mr Volf is only in Paris for 16 hours.
He's leaving for Qatar in the morning.
How's Karen?
She's doing better, but now it's Mr Volf's personal assistant,
Diane de Monx, who will be handling the matter.
Yeah, so I heard.
What's she like?
How do you mean?
Is she tough?
Well, you'll definitely have a harder time with her than with Karen.
We have a lovely terrace for breakfast on the 7th floor.
- What time is room service till?
- 11pm.
The mini-bar is just under the TV.
My name is Arnaud.
If you need anything, just don't hesitate to call reception by dialling 7741.
- Mercibeaucoup.
- Thank you.
If you need anything, my cell phone number is on the fax.
Oh, yeah. Elise, er... is it hard to get pot in Paris?
- Not so hard.
- You think you can get me some?
- I'll try.
- Thanks.
OK.
Edward? Hey.
It's me, I just got in.
Are you sleeping? Oh.
Sorry. So look, Karen's out.
Looks like we have to deal with this Diane chick.
Well, for the time being, she's not much of a problem at all.
Later on we'll have to figure out a way to control her.
No, I can't say it worries me much either.
Where's the Demonlover contract with Volf's notes?
- Purple folder.
- Has it been here long?
- I re-read it yesterday. It's all good.
- And did you inform anyone?
I re-read it and called to have it picked up.
What more am I supposed to do?
- Can I talk to you?
- Now?
Yes, now.
When I ask for something, you do it, no "maybe", not "sort of".
Why was this still downstairs?
I had to take the Americans to their hotel.
I made sure...
Of course, you'd rather drive them around and lick their boots than do your job, which is a lot less fun!
Listen, Diane, don't talk to me like that. I'm not your fucking maid!
I've had it up to here!
You may not like the fact that I've taken Karen's place, but that's the way it is.
I don't give a shit whether you take Karen's place or not.
If you don't feel right for the part that's your problem, not mine.
I do my job, period.
Well, apparently you don't.
I can't be everywhere at once. Sorry.
I've been here since 7:30am.
I'm working on a case.
I need the info on my desk.
I don't have time to get it myself.
It's ridiculous.
- Everyone's here.
- I'm coming.
- What happened?
- Bitch!
Nothing. She can't stand me.
It's mutual.
You two should try talking someday.
- You think so?
- She's OK.
You have to be a little patient.
As we're speaking, Mr Volf has in his hands a signed contract, which makes us majority shareholders in the TokyoAnime company in Japan.
So discussions can proceed according to schedule.
Here are the results for Demonlover.com and the connected sites since our last meeting.
As you can see, business has increased by 35% and our market share has doubled.
We are now the primary distributors for Japanese comics and animated films, both in the US and the rest of the world.
And we've also acquired new names for the web.
Smaller sites, er...
Mangasex, Sexmanga, Adultmanga,
SMmanga, Japanporno.
They're all directly linked to our main Demonlover site.
They are good sites.
- You visited them?
- Yes, sure I did.
I like them.
Japanporno, excellent.
Well, if you give us the rights to TokyoAnime products, we'll control 75% of the world market.
But the deal has to specify that you'll cut off supplies to all our competitors.
Specially Mangatronics.
Exactly.
Mangatronics cannot get anything.
Not one magazine, not one book, not one tape, not one DVD, nada.
If they lose adult manga they'll wither away and disappear.
And we'll take over their share of the business.
Basically, we have the possibility here to kill Mangatronics.
I say, let's do it!
Well, before we proceed...
...I'd like to clear up a few points regarding some on-going lawsuits.
The lawsuits you're referring to concern the sites Starznaked.com and Lara Croft,
Sexslavelaracroft.com.
Can you describe these sites?
These sites are legally distinct from Demonlover.com and have no bearing on our discussions.
The names are clear enough, aren't they?
Starznaked?
Show pictures of stars... naked.
Huh?
But now due to legal issues they show pictures of naked celebrity lookalikes.
You don't have that in France?
Not yet.
- It does well.
- Verywell.
It's huge. Huge!
And also Sexslavelaracroft shows illustrated pornographic stories involving Lara Croft.
The... the star of the video game
"Tomb Raider"?
Since Eidos is suing us for 30 million dollars in damages, it's preferable to temporarily suspend the service until we get a ruling.
What do you think?
I like the heel and the shape but I don't know about the zippers.
- Hmm...
- I think they wanna make a deal.
I don't know.
They seem incredibly cautious to me.
Why don't you try on the other ones?
They wanna be cold and business-like.
They don't know shit.
What's up with that Hervé guy?
He's such a dick.
- Expect for Diane.
- She seems smart.
Hey, will you try these on?
They're your size.
I'm sure they'll fit.
I think Diane should work with us.
I think we need her.
Elise, do you have any idea how we can approach Diane?
No. No idea.
- You don't like her very much, do you?
- I hate her guts.
- I think I look great with these boots.
- Cute.
- What have you heard?
- The Asian buyers are thrilled.
- The Seibu chain in particular.
- That's what I heard.
The editor of "W" flashed me a big smile.
- Merci.
- Excuse me.
Excuse me,
I'll be just a minute.
This is bullshit.
Can I have some more ice, please?
I'm giving the guy five more minutes then I'm outta here.
Mr Volf appreciates you having waited and he just wanted to take advantage of your presence to clear up a last point.
Do you know this?
Yeah, of course I know.
Hellfireclub.
It's an interactive torture site.
It's, er... very difficult to access.
And very successful.
There are maybe
30 such sites in the world, mostly in Russia, some in Australia.
More or less well made, more or less extreme.
This happens to be a very good site.
- Perhaps the best.
- I'd say so.
What do you think of that?
What do I think of it?
It's like drugs or prostitution, supply and demand.
With organised crime pulling the strings.
Mr Volf has been told you run this site.
Here is the access procedure and all the codes.
It would seem you are the source.
No way! This is a joke.
- This doesn't work.
- It's total bullshit.
Who gave you this?
Obviously Mangatronics.
Yeah, to scare you off from signing the deal with us.
And conserve the rights to TokyoAnime.
It's the only way they can survive.
You didn't come last night.
No.
You didn't call either.
No.
- I have to go.
- Don't leave me like this.
Tokyo was Tokyo.
It's different here.
- That's no reason to avoid me.
- Leave it at that.
Please.
I'll take the receiver and the MiniDisc.
There must be interesting stuff on it.
If you can, just copy the files.
If not, take her computer.
And get the transmitters.
Here's the card.
Mangatronics is paying you a lot.
They want results fast.
For them, it's a question of life or death.
Tuesday, 7pm.
I'll be at the Barbès metro station.
OK...
End of the street to the left. OK.
All right, I'm turning.
First on the right?
Yeah, I can hardly see anything.
What bistro?
OK, I see it.
All right, I see you.
You wanna go somewhere?
The car's fine with me.
- Better than the office.
- Much better than the office.
I have a message from Karen.
Tell her I wanna talk to her too.
Take the next right.
See the Castorama?
Go down in the parking lot.
Lower.
Lower.
Keep going down.
Park over here on the left.
Leave it on.
- I don't understand...
- Shut up!
- Tell Karen I...
- I told you to shut up.
Step on the gas.
Do it!
Again.
Again.
Again!
There.
That was Karen's message.
- 'Hello?'
- Where are you?
- 'Buying cigarettes.'
- Where?
'I have nothing left to say.
'I had a message to deliver.
I delivered it.'
- I have a message now.
- 'I'm listening.'
No, in person. Now!
I have to go, there's a line.
Call me back in two minutes.
Hello?
Fuck!
- Give me the gun.
- It's not loaded.
I don't care.
Give me the gun.
Now we'll talk.
I don't have time.
I have to get home, my babysitter's waiting.
I'll take you there.
Which way?
Keep going straight to Saint-Ouen.
Did you leave the message on my desk with the empty box?
- What do you think?
- I think yes.
- Did you think it was Hervé?
- Mm-hmm.
- Were you sure?
- Yes.
At what point did you understand that it wasn't Hervé?
Before or after sleeping with him?
I didn't sleep with Hervé.
People talk.
- Who, Hervé?
- Yes.
What?
Nothing.
Would you watch the road?
It's just I get nervous in cars especially when it's raining.
Look, Karen is nobody's fool.
She knows you did everything you could to cut her off from Volf.
Why would I do that?
To take her place.
Which you took.
What does she want?
I don't know, maybe just to scare you for now.
And later?
Later nothing.
You're scared, that's enough.
Enough for what?
- To do what she tells you to do.
- Meaning?
I just repeat what I'm told, that's all.
Why should I be scared?
Are you scared?
I don't know.
She told me you'd pretend not to understand.
- Drop me off here.
- Don't you want me to take you home?
Drop me off here!
You didn't hear me come in?
No.
You seemed engrossed.
- What was it?
- Hellfireclub.
I thought so.
- You know it?
- I go there once in a while.
- Does it turn you on?
- Not really.
- It fascinates me.
- You like that feeling?
Very much so.
Don't you?
- You followed me.
- I didn't.
Who?
You've been followed for a while.
You know it.
- Followed and burgled.
- Exactly.
Found what you wanted?
I don't want anything.
You want something.
And you seem to have found it.
Not just me.
Volf did too.
I came to warn you, but I'm too late.
Too late for what?
To help you.
Did you send Elise to help me too?
You're negotiating with Demonlover.
You know the codes to Hellfireclub.
You're a risk for them.
- A risk?
- A risk they must control.
I don't see how.
Watch this tape.
Call me afterwards.
It's a copy.
They have the original.
- Who gave it to you?
- I've been with Demonlover for a while, though I'm not of much use anymore.
Are you ready?
You have something for me first.
- There are no other copies?
- No.
They're not gonna end up in Volf's desk or elsewhere?
It's a deal, you don't have to agree to it.
I don't really have a choice.
I don't know.
- Do you agree to all the conditions?
- Yes.
Just so you won't wanna take off the hood.
If they're too tight,
I can loosen them.
Your identity papers are fake.
All the information on your résumé is made up and your name isn't Diane de Monx.
Do you want a cigarette?
I don't know your name or where you're from, but you were hired a year ago by an intermediary from Mangatronics to sabotage Volf's projects in their market.
In exchange, you receive a wire transfer every three months on an account at SBS, in Lugano.
Watch the steps.
This way, through the door.
OK, there's a step.
Another one.
I'd stay until she comes around.
I know.
I don't know what time.
Work it out with the babysitter.
If you're back by 9 o'clock, it's fine.
I'm at the office.
I'm going into a meeting.
I'll call you later if I can.
Oh, shit!
Oh...
I waited for an hour.
I tried your mobile.
'Mangatronics hasn't heard from you.
They're nervous. So am I.
'I don't know what you're up to...'
Diane? Yes, she's here.
No, I can't bother her.
She's sleeping.
She's fine. Just fine.
But she won't call you back.
Because...
...she no longer works for you.
Who decided? Me.
Close the door.
Of course.
I'll prepare the file for tomorrow.
I'll have the plane tickets sent.
Perfect. Talk to you soon.
Here's Volf's last memo on the Demonlover contracts.
I added the clause you asked for, no one questioned it.
- Will it be finalised in time?
- Yes.
Good.
Diane?
Yes?
I meant to ask...
No, nothing.
You can go.
- We've never gone out before.
- Shrimp tempura.
- You mean, the two of us?
- Mm-hmm.
- I'd rather have avoided it.
- What do you mean?
- I know what you'll say.
- You don't want to hear it?
- I thought...
- It's too late.
That's not the same thing.
It means that at some other time...
- ...in Tokyo?
- Maybe.
- You intimidated me.
- I still intimidate you.
I felt you were there but not there.
- I was there.
- I'm not sure.
Did I say no? Huh?
- Did I reject you?
- No.
So?
You control everything you do.
You seem present, but you watch and calculate.
I'm not in control of anything.
- Merci.
- Merci.
Another one, please.
A beer, please.
A large one.
I saw you move.
I saw you with Volf.
- What did you see?
- The way you operated. I admire you.
You didn't see anything.
No one sees anything.
Ever.
They watch... but they don't understand.
What do you admire?
Go on... say it.
I'm listening.
You set a goal and made it there.
Where am I?
Tell me. I'm interested.
When you're pressed for words, it becomes murkier.
But judging people with rambling generalities...
...yeah, sure... it's easier.
- That's not what I meant.
- Yes, it is.
I'm calculating.
I have no scruples.
It's what excites you... and what scares you.
But you have no idea.
You don't know me.
That's what I'm saying.
So in Tokyo, you didn't trust me.
No. I wanted you.
But you had doubts.
I still do.
You're right.
It's better not to push.
Very good tempura.
- Stop looking at that girl.
- I'm not.
I see her eyes in the mirror.
Mm-hmm...
Kaori came back to my room anyway.
So?
You screw her and worry she'll be jealous?
- I didn't know you knew.
- It was obvious.
Fortunately Kaori doesn't have those scruples.
Meaning?
Meaning when she's with me.
When?
In her car.
In a restaurant bathroom.
At her place, in the bathtub.
Kaori?
Do you prefer women?
I don't know.
What do you think?
I don't believe you.
So I didn't sleep with her?
No, nowhere.
Not in a tub, not on a rug.
- You think I'm testing your reaction?
- I think so.
Objectively, it's a disappointing reaction.
Maybe, but you know how it is.
- Doubt remains.
- Still.
Now I have to look at you differently.
That was sort of the point.
I still don't know what I see.
So look more closely.
Diane...
I wanted to tell you something, but...
But what?
I don't know if you want to hear it.
Say it.
I hope you had a lovely evening.
Merci.
- Finished?
- Yes. Some more sake?
Yes.
Elise works with me.
I mean, Elise works for me.
- I don't understand.
- Yes, you do.
And you let me talk?
You were observing me.
I thought I liked to be in control, but...
...you do so more than I do.
- You don't seem to like it.
- No.
- Why did you do it?
- I didn't have to tell you.
I wish you hadn't.
I find it...
Humiliating?
The sake.
Yes.
- Humiliating.
- Because you don't deceive people?
I'm going home.
I'll drive you.
Wait... wait!
Mmm...
Tomorrow morning at 8?
In the lobby?

You know what happens at that height?
The brain dies from lack of oxygen... cell by cell.
It just shuts down... and the body goes with it.
I can't stop thinking about what it must have been like.
Why don't you start at the beginning?
It's always the easiest.
OK, I'll start at the beginning.
I grew up on the plains in Indiana.
I was a flatlander, through and through.
To be honest...
I really didn't have much to leave behind.
Virtually no family and very few friends.
Anyway, it was January.
I'd already been in London a year and a half.
For the first six months,
I'd been incredibly Ionely.
Then I met Jake.
What I loved the most... was how comfortable we were with each other.
I felt safe.
OK, let's go.
I design CD-roms and websites... for corporate clients.
That must pay well.
It sounds fancier than it is.
Jake was an engineer.
Tunnels and bridges, that sort of thing.
He kept his tube tickets... in a wallet he got when he was twelve.
Same wallet, same inside pocket.
Alice? Alice?
See you later.
Hey, Alice.
You going in?
Yeah.
I'll see you in a minute.
Reconfigure the training program manual... to make it look like a game on the website.
We tried that with the appliance kings.
Yes, but this isn't about washing machines.
Now we're training a worldwide sales force.
You're the new media pioneers.
Think of something.
Alice, you still have the old template, don't you?
Are you with us, Alice?
I'm going out to get my hair trimmed.
I'll be back after lunch.
Oh, shoot!
And you got in?
Yeah...
I got in.
What's your name?
Alice.
Alice.
Don't turn away.
Come here tomorrow.
I have to work.
Then come back tonight.
I can't.
Whenever you want, Alice.
You decide, and I'll be here.
I couldn't believe what had happened that day.
I knew it shouldn't happen again.
I wanted everything back the way it was.
What do you want me to do?
Nothing, just keep doing what you're doing.
That was when
I found out his name...
Adam Tallis... and that he climbed mountains.
He caused quite a stir here yesterday.
He saved six people up there... with no oxygen.
You stop me whenever you want.
Please don't stop.
I bought your book today.
It isn't my book.
I'm just in it.
It looks good.
People died, Alice.
Something went very wrong.
There was a woman named Francoise Collette.
I lost the whole group.
I still don't understand what happened.
There was no room for error.
Everything had been checked.
I was in love with her.
Do you know what it's like over 20,000 feet?
It's like this.
Without air, the brain cells die.
It shuts down.
And then the rest of the body follows.
It's been two years... and it doesn't go away.
I live with someone.
But you're here.
I have to go.
Don't put them on.
Hi. Where are you?
I'm running some errands.
Do you think you could pick up my watch... on the way home?
I'm running behind schedule.
I'm never going to make it.
Of course I can.
I missed you today, Alice.
Miss you.
I love you.
Love you.
Knock it! Not nice.
And give it!
Go in!
A card? Ref, that's a bit harsh.
Yeah. Sorry. I'm just...
There's nobody there!
I have to leave you.
You what?
I can't go on like this.
I'm sorry.
I have to leave.
You have to leave me?
We're together.
We're perfect together.
I want to marry you.
I met somebody.
Who did you meet?
You don't know him.
I'm sorry.
When did you meet him?
I didn't mean to hurt you.
It's not the point...
It's very much the point!
We go to the market together every Sunday!
I buy your fucking tube tickets for you!
Jesus!
Where you going?
You were looking for Adam.
He's not here at the moment... but it's cold out there.
Come in.
Please, come in.
I've been climbing in Chile.
Adam always takes his pictures down... or makes sure his back is turned to them.
Oh, please, sit down.
For me, pictures tell me who I am... but for Adam, they steal his soul.
Want some?
No, thank you.
No, it's quite good.
I'm his sister.
You're his sister?
Yep. I'm Deborah.
We climb together a lot.
He was having some work done on his place... so he stayed here while I was gone.
This... is Mr. Know-it-all.
It's his name.
This is Francoise, right?
That's the real reason... my brother takes the pictures down... because it's... too hard for him to see her.
My brother's a brave guy, but sometimes... he's afraid of remembering.
What he forgets... is that he's not the only one responsible.
I was up there, too.
She was my best friend, Alice.
Yes, I know your name.
You're very beautiful.
I can see why he'd fall so hard for you.
The thing about my brother... is you're either with him or you're not.
And once you've made the jump and you're with him... that's it... there's no discussion.
Can I have his address?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
I left him.
You're hurting me.
Morning.
Alice, this is Joanna.
Joanna, Alice.
Joanna Noble from "The Guardian."
I'm interviewing Adam about his Himalayan clean-up project.
Nice to meet you.
Where can I find a shirt?
Your phone?
Would you get that for me?
No one there.
In some respects, it's just become... a playground for the rich and inexperienced.
Thank you.
I have to go to work.
Will you think about me today?
Yes.
What are you doing today?
Thinking about you.
Do you want to learn how to climb?
Sure.
Come and see me after work.
That's good.
He's not as strong as he was last week.
It's lovely to see you.
I see you've got a harness.
Do you want to put it on?
Just put your feet in there... and pull it up like a pair of trousers.
That's great.
That's right, double-back in.
There we go.
It suits you.
Thank you.
It's OK. I'm helping her.
How are you?
OK, fine.
I'm sorry.
Let me check your harness.
Seems to be good.
She's my sister, but she drives me mad.
I swear it's chemical.
You ready?
I don't know. Maybe.
Come on.
Well, finally, Alice.
The flatlander captured the mountain boy.
Alice, meet Klaus.
Klaus, Alice.
I liked your book.
Well, thank you.
Well, nice to meet you.
This looks hard.
It's all in the mind.
I mean, my taste in clothes has completely changed.
Really?
I bought this practically transparent pink T-shirt.
And I won't even tell you about the lingerie.
No. Probably best not to mention the lingerie.
I'm still in the big white cotton panties.
I'm sorry.
I'm a little manic.
Have you seen Jake?
Of course I have.
He's been my friend for 15 years.
How is he?
What can I say?
He's smoking like a fiend... and he's completely fucked up.
It's not like there's no reason, is there?
Sorry.
I think that you're destroying both of your lives.
I'm sorry.
You had somebody who loved you.
You loved each other... and you let him go for good sex.
Love isn't just a good fuck, you know?
This is more.
More what?
More everything.
When I'm with him, everything is more.
Oh, God, Alice.
You could write greetings cards.
You really bloody could.
Sorry.
Right.
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
I could do with some retail therapy myself, I think.
I can't, but come with me.
I'm gonna see Adam at 3:00.
You can meet him.
And there's this really amazing store... and I haven't bought it yet, but I will...
It's OK. She's fine.
Call the police.
Adam! Stop!
When I saw him... oh, Jesus.
That'll never happen again.
I won't let it.
Are you OK?
Yeah.
I'll always be here, Alice.
Yeah.
I'll protect you.
Say you believe me.
I believe you.
Marry me.
The sooner the better.
Tomorrow.
The day after, as soon as possible.
- Marry me!
- Yes!
Sir, can we ask you some questions, please?
"Use your head, Alice.
"What do you really know about him?"
Hey, you ready?
Look at this.
Someone's trying to scare you.
There's been a call this morning.
There was someone there... but they didn't say anything.
Makes me sick.
If anything else happens like this again... make sure you tell me, OK?
You'll be fine.
Do you, Alice... promise to love and cherish Adam... for as long as you both shall live?
I do.
And do you, Adam, promise to love and cherish Alice... for as long as you both shall live?
I do.
May the Lord bless this union... and secure it from all harm.
How do you know the priest?
This is my family church.
You have a family church?
Wow, I have a mother who doesn't talk to me... and a dad I've never met.
It doesn't matter.
My life began when we first saw each other.
Come on.
I need you to see something.
What?
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.
Now, I want you to see this... through my eyes when I was six.
Look. Like this.
You know the story that we're broken into two pieces?
And we spend our lives searching for our other half.
You're it.
OK, here we are.
We're getting dressed here?
Yep. Here.
No! No, no, no, no.
Don't do that.
I need to remember you like this.
Come on. I don't want you to freeze to death.
Come on.
This is the only way station... for hikers in the whole area.
The church has kept supplies up here for years.
You went hiking on your wedding day?
That's his idea of romance.
I thought a honeymoon was lying in bed... with room service.
Oh, I'll give you a honeymoon you won't forget.
I promise.
No, no, sit down.
Choose your rhythm and then commit to following it.
Count if you have to.
I'm gonna make you strong!
I wanted him to be proud of me... so I followed the trail for hours.
You made it.
What's that?
It's an anchor... to catch a falling body.
Catch.
Do you trust me?
Yes.
Don't move.
I gave up all control.
I let him decide when I could breathe... and when I couldn't.
I loved it.
God, I love you!
We returned to London... and Joanna Noble's article came out.
I was happier than I'd ever been.
Excuse me.
- There you go.
- Thanks.
Hello, Jake?
No, it's Sylvie speaking.
Hello, Alice.
Sylvie?
I must have dialed wrong.
I thought I was calling Jake.
Oh, no, no, that's fine.
I just happened to be over, actually.
Jake's going to be back soon, I think.
Look, Alice, this is gonna sound a bit weird... but I was definitely going to tell you... but Jake and I have actually been... seeing each other.
You and Jake?
Well, it... just sort of happened.
Did you move in?
Yeah. Yeah, I did, uh, sort of.
Oh, Lord.
How cliche is this?
Old friend moves in... to console jilted boyfriend... and then these two find themselves together.
You gonna be OK with this?
Yeah, I'm OK.
We're gonna be late!
Hurry up!
Yeah, I gotta go.
We'll talk about it later, OK?
Here we go.
How you doing?!
Hey, Alice, Alice,
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
How you doing?
It's really nice to see you.
It's Alice Tallis.
My rhyming sister-in-law.
Are you OK?
I have a headache and was looking for some aspirin.
Oh, no, give me your hand.
Can you feel that?
Yeah, it really hurts.
Close your eyes.
Breathe.
Slowly.
That's good.
It's the meridian that controls the kidney or the brain or the left big toe.
I forget which.
But... it's whatever works, right?
Thank you.
Close your eyes.
OK, you can open them.
Oh, my God.
I want to drink to that beautiful lady in blue.
Where is she?
I don't think she's ever climbed past the third floor... but she has conquered our Adam.
But what she doesn't know is that to get Adam... she also gets us.
Hear, hear!
Most of the people using the program are women... and we try to sell them a game... but women don't like games.
Women like stories.
Men like games.
Men like to slay the dragon... and get the princess... but women like to know... how did the dragon and the princess... all get there in the first place.
A game is the wrong approach.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
Alice Tallis.
This is Joanna Noble.
Do you remember me?
Yes, I remember you.
I got a weird note about the article.
I'm not gonna do anything with it.
I mean, I'm certainly not going to follow it up.
It's probably stupid of me... but I somehow felt obliged... to tell you about it.
Shall I send it to you?
Yeah, you can send it.
Is it private?
I don't want this sitting in a public "in" basket.
I understand.
You can fax it.
OK, I'll do that.
You have the number?
Yeah, I got it from your secretary.
OK, thanks for calling.
Sorry.
I had to take that.
No problem.
Gave me a chance to think.
We shouldn't be playing games.
It's obvious women don't like games.
I think this project needs a new face.
"Dear Joanna Noble, what you wrote made me sick.
"Your big hero Adam Tallis raped me.
"Why don't you try reporting the truth?"
It's out of paper.
I've decided that from now on... this is Alice's project.
You're the new point man...
I mean, point girl... woman.
Excellent.
Congratulations, Alice.
Thank you.
Open or closed?
Closed.
Fuck!
Alice Tallis' office.
Hello, Claudia, it's Adam.
Oh, hi, Adam.
Hi. Is Alice there?
No, she's just left, actually.
Left? Where'd she go?
I think she went to the doctor's.
So, you thought this woman was sending the notes?
Yes.
Yeah?
Hello, I'm Joanna Noble from "The Guardian."
I called you before.
Yeah.
- Are you Michelle Stowe?
- Yeah, I am. Come in.
It was at a birthday party.
I asked him to dance... and then, I don't know... we start kissin'.
I mean, I was shit-faced.
I came and put my hand in his shirt... then we went outside.
Guess at the end, I was just straightening up a bit...
'cause I remember wondering... what the hell I was doing.
Then he pulled me into the bushes... undid my dress.
It was a zip... in the back.
I was so young.
I started to cry.
He put his hand over my mouth and kept going.
He's strong.
There was nothing
I could do.
I tried to fight him.
When he was done, he shook me... and said something like...
"It's only sex.
"Just sex."
Then he got up... and left the party with his sister.
So, you want to write an article about this, then?
I mean, he's not royal or anything... but it's close enough.
We can make some money out of this, Joanna.
It doesn't work that way.
Yeah, it does.
Everybody's always blabbin'... about who's stickin' it into who.
They make plenty.
You have no proof.
This is a question of
"he said, she said."
Jesus, Alice, I can't believe you did this.
What if she calls my editor?
I could be fired.
Do you think that nosy wives... have immunity from normal behavior?
I knew the minute that I called... that it was a mistake.
Sorry, Alice.
It's OK. I just...
I thought you should know what I did.
It was really just innocent curiosity.
It's never innocent.
Curiosity gets people killed.
What would you do if it was your husband?
I don't have one.
You not only have one... but one who's wild about you.
You're right.
I have to trust him.
People have stories.
You and I, everyone.
But I couldn't tell you one complete story... about my husband.
Practically everything
I knew about him... came from a book or a newspaper... or shreds of information dropped by other people.
I couldn't help myself.
I needed to know more.
"Adele Blanchard."
"It's crazy...
"but I want to show the world my bruises."
"What we're doing is dangerous...
"but I still can't help wanting more."
"The only way to end this is to be brutal.
"We have to stop what we're doing.
"I've decided to go back to my husband.
"I'm not strong enough to live on the edge with you anymore.
"I know you won't fall, but I will.
"I'm sure of it.
"This tears me apart...
"But I have to go back to Michael.
"I love you.
"Adele."
I've been thinking about you.
Me, too.
I called the office yesterday looking for you.
Oh, yeah?
Claudia said you weren't feeling well.
She thought you might be at the doctor's.
I, um...
I had an appointment, but, um...
I never got out of my meeting.
Where was the meeting?
At the, um, client's hotel.
Which hotel?
The Hilton.
I'm sorry for being nosy.
I just like to picture what you do during the day.
Where'd you get this?
Deborah gave it to me.
She has good taste.
I got a call about, um... a weird call about the article.
There was this woman named Michelle Stowe.
She sent a fax.
Didn't happen, Alice.
I never raped her.
I shouldn't have...
I've known her since we were kids.
I think she saw me as a way out.
If you met her, you'd understand.
I'm not surprised she contacted you.
I'm just sorry you had to hear all that.
Good morning.
Hi there.
Are you ready?
I'll just get my jacket.
I'm sorry to barge in like that... but your husband refuses to understand the fact... that sponsors need talk shows... and he would only show up if I drove.
Why didn't you tell me... you were gonna be on a talk show?
It's just a stupid jazz show.
Directory inquiries.
Yes. Adele Blanchard.
Which city, please?
It's London.
Do you have a listing for Adele Blanchard... on Marchmont Road?
One moment.
This train is about to depart.
Please mind the doors.
I'm looking for Adele Blanchard.
I'm her mother.
Is she home?
You must be one of her American friends.
We tried to contact everyone.
She's been missing for eight months.
Missing?
What did you say your name was?
Joanna.
She never tried to contact her husband?
Not even a letter to an old boyfriend... or something?
Eight months and not a word.
And this is from a daughter... who manages to e-mail her mother from Nepal.
Joanna, promise me you'll never think the worst about Adele.
It helps a little... if one tries to be positive.
She was so happy that day.
No jitters, nothing.
Do you know him?
Adam Tallis.
She climbed all over the world with him.
My son-in-law Michael... is a trader in Milan.
At first, he never stood in her way... when it came to climbing.
Then after two years, he got fed up.
It was either climbing or the marriage.
She chose the marriage.
The day before she was supposed to go back to Milan... she went out... and never came back.
I found that in her bags.
It's probably the last picture taken of her.
Today I've had two signs that Adele is close by.
You arrived, and Adam called.
He wanted to know if there was anything new... in the investigation.
Would you like to stay for dinner?
No, thank you.
I just... I have to get home.
It's really late.
I'm disappointed.
He should be here around 5:00.
You and Adam would love each other.
Sit, sit.
I'll get it.
Is it all right if
I set it up for next week?
I haven't managed to get to the bank yet.
Yes, of course.
Mrs. Blanchard.
I'm sorry, I just...
I have to get back.
I don't want to be late.
I was hoping you would stay a little.
I'm sorry.
This train is about to depart.
Please mind the doors.
What are you doing?!
What am I doing?
I'm making you mine.
Sometimes I feel like I don't know you.
Oh, you know me.
You know everything you need to know.
Look at me.
Open your eyes.
Please.
Open your eyes!
You've been with another man.
No.
What are you doing, then?
What's going on in there?
Why do you keep sneaking around?
Is the suspicion exciting?
Do you need it go get off?
What is it?
I found Adele's letters.
You... found... her letters?
Is that how you tell the story?
What, they were just... sitting with my keys on the table... and you just happened to notice them?
Look what I just happened to find!
These and these!
And I found these!
Here, read them!
I have nothing to hide, Alice!
Did you sneak around behind my back because you... need it to get rougher and rougher?
I mean, is that it?
I'm trying to understand you, Alice.
If you do this, will I punish you?
Is that what your goal...
Please untie me.
If you trusted me... you wouldn't be in this position, Alice.
I just...
I wanted to know more... about you.
And I wanted to know your past... and I wanted to know your stories.
I just thought if I knew more... that I could love you more.
I know the only thing that matters is us together.
I know that.
Because when you're not around...
I get lost.
It drives me crazy to think about losing you.
I'm yours, Alice.
What more do you need to know?
I could break your neck,
I love you so much.
Do you want to stay here?
I mean... do you like this?
Adam, I have to pee.
My God.
Alice, please, don't do this! Alice!
Please!
Where are you going?!
Alice, please!
What are you doing?!
And that's when
I came to you.
I want to be clear with you.
In my experience, charges of domestic violence... are usually too little too late.
I want you to reopen the Adele Blanchard case.
It's not easy to reopen a case like this.
Britain is swimming in missing persons.
He killed her.
Mrs. Tallis, any case... missing person or murder, needs evidence.
I have to ask you what you have.
Adele's letters?
No.
Warning notes?
No.
You have... two photos.
Proof of nothing.
He raped Michelle.
She never reported it.
Start without me.
I'll be there in a bit.
I'd like to help you,
Mrs. Tallis.
What everyone else does to be like him.
He can't see you.
She's pretty shaken up.
Is she? I mean, is she hurt?
She... Jesus, she was running into traffic.
Let's get a doctor.
She'll be fine.
I would never hurt her.
I love her.
You brought him in?
He walked in, looking for you.
He brought in a pair of shoes.
He was worried about your feet.
I believe your husband... has the potential for violence.
I believe he's unpredictable.
But is he a murderer?
I don't know.
The truth is, what you two have been doing together... was consensual.
You said it yourself.
You liked it.
Can you close the blinds?
I won't be able to keep him for much more than a few hours.
That's as much of a window as I can give you.
You're accusing a hero,
Mrs. Tallis... and you have absolutely no evidence.
Alice, what's happened to you?
Oh, Deborah, I'm sorry.
I'm not crazy,
I just... I just...
I went to the police station... but no one believed me, and I just... I just...
He came in and he brought my shoes... and they thought
I was nuts... but, I mean, I know he's your brother... but, I mean, you were her friend, too.
Maybe you could, um...
Look, you remember when you said that you were... either with him or not, no discussion?
Well, I'm... I'm not...
I'm trying to understand.
L... I just, I want to ask,
I mean, um... uh...
Was Francoise with someone else?
Yes.
It wasn't an accident.
She left him... so he killed her.
Maybe.
This is the anchor that we used.
It's made of titanium, but the important thing is... it can hold
2,000 falling pounds.
I've got a friend in Kathmandu... who sent me an anchor that they're making locally... with the wrong material.
This is what happened with just seventy-five pounds.
Maybe you're right.
Adam could have switched the anchors... for Francoise's group.
He killed them.
Leave him, Alice.
I know him.
You have to leave him, for your own good.
Deborah... Deborah, it's not the only time.
What?
I think that, um, he was with a woman...
Adele Blanchard, and I think... that she was gonna leave him to go back to her husband... and... and I think that... that he killed her.
Adele was never gonna go back to Michael.
Everyone knew their marriage was over.
I read her letters.
She ended it with Adam.
And, uh, I just, um...
I think that, uh, that she's there.
What?
I went to the police.
The police, they won't do anything.
They need evidence.
I think he buried her here... at Saint Edmund's.
I need you to help me find her.
Do you want to go with me?
I have a confession to make.
I sent you those notes.
I know about my brother's violence.
I've seen it.
I should have done more, but... it's no excuse... but he scares me.
I'm glad you got away from him, Alice.
You'll be OK now.
Can I take that?
Yeah, sure.
I think it's here.
He took the pictures just by the angel.
Oh, my God.
She didn't have to die.
If only she'd told me... she was going back to Michael.
Yeah.
I gave her one, too.
She thought it was beautiful, just like you did.
Why did you do this?!
Who do you think gave him his first piece of silk?
He was just 15!
I'm talking about fucking, Alice!
That's right!
We fucked right here!
Adam is mine!
He's mine!
Why?!
I was never yours!
We were kids. Kids!
It's over.
It's all over.
Oh, God.
She and I...
We used to come here together.
I just thought you had to trust me.
And that's how it ended.
Yet not a day goes by... without at least one thought about the passion.
Maybe I was so blinded by it... that I missed all the clues to his past.
I often wonder... what would have happened... if I hadn't looked up that morning.
Two years later,
I saw him once more.
I don't know.
Maybe a flatlander like me... can't live at that altitude.
Maybe it never would have been possible... to sustain what we had.
Maybe.
Well, that's what
I tell myself.
Planning a vacation, Mr. Sullivan?
No. No. Just - just some reading to pass the time.
Step ahead, Mr. Sullivan.
You're expected in Room 102.
Down the hall and to the right.
Thank you.
- What is your name?
- Um- Morgan Sullivan.
- Where were you born?
- Madison, Wisconsin.
- Are you a spy?
- No.
Are you an undercover operator for Sunways Systems?
No.
Were you paid by Sunways Systems to steal data from
Digicorp Technologies?
No.
Have you ever worked at any capacities at Sunways Systems?
No.
This is a technology firm, Mr. Sullivan.
If we choose to employ you as an agent of Digicorp, you will spy on other corporations, inform us of their business plans, research programs, and counter-intelligence operations.
Thus far, your determination has been very impressive.
Well, if there is anything more
I can tell you about myself, anything that has not been already checked by Digicorp.
Your personal records are fine. You've passed our neuro-graph five times.
I'll take the test again if you'd like me to.
You've been married four years.
You live in a respectable neighborhood.
You've always had stable jobs.
You have an excellent credit history.
No drug habits. No drinking problems.
- You don't smoke?
- No.
No other vices to speak of?
Is there anything else we should know about you?
Well -- It might have taken me quite a while to get to this point, Mr. Finster, but now that I'm here, I'm going to make the most of it.
This is who I am and this is what I want to do.
The stakes in this line of work are very high.
Yes, I understand.
It will be like nothing you've ever done before.
Oh, I'm prepared for that.
You will be sent to conventions across the country.
You will record the speeches.
That's been made very clear.
You'll have to deceive other people about what you do for a living.
- Yes.
- Even your own wife.
Yes.
You don't mind lying to your wife?
No.
No, I don't mind.
That was a good one. Move on ahead to the next station.
- Hello, Mr. Sullivan.
- Hello.
Keep it out of view until the convention speeches actually start.
Press the back notch.
You see the flash? It's now on.
Press it again. It's now off.
Easy, isn't it?
And the transmissions are really clear?
Within fifty yards.
Just keep up front for good reception.
Where do the signals go?
Up to our satellite systems, then back down to our data banks.
I guess the speeches must be pretty important.
The speeches are not your concern, Mr. Sullivan.
Just do your job.
Follow our instructions, nothing else. Do you understand?
Yes, Mr. Finster.
Ready!
Jack Thursby? That's what you'll be called from now on.
As far as Digicorp concerns,
Morgan Sullivan doesn't exist.
We've never met him. We never will.
- What's he like?
- Pardon?
What's his personality?
He's whoever you want him to be.
Buffalo? Why do they need you to go all the way to Buffalo?
They want me to tutor them on that spreadsheet software
I was using at my last job.
And you'll be paid freelance for this?
Sure. Independent contract.
You know, if things work out, there could be more trips down the road.
I thought we agreed you weren't going back to work yet.
Not until that position at my father's firm opened up.
I can do this in the meantime, can't I?
I really need you at home right now, Morgan, with me being so busy with the Williams case.
It's only temporary, honey.
I won't be gone for long.
Hello.
After the convention, you will confirm the transmission on your returning flight.
Yes.
Do you remember the location of the briefcase?
Uh, yes.
Good luck, Mr. Thursby.
We're counting on you.
Thank you.
I left it in the stall.
Something to drink, sir?
I'll have a ginger ale.
- Actually, I'll have a scotch.
- Scotch?
Hmm. Single malt.
- On the rocks.
- Yes, sir.
Welcome to Buffalo, Mr. Thursby.
This is our new mascara line.
- It's hypoallergenic and it's vitamin enriched. - Really? Mr-
- Fred Garfield.
- Hi. Hi. Jack Thursby.
Fairway Fragrance. Where are they located exactly?
Uh
- Tulsa. Tulsa, Oklahoma.
You don't say? I've got family from Tulsa.
You don't have much of an accent.
- I didn't grow up there.
- Oh, where did you grow up?
- I said, where'd you grow up?
- South Pacific.
- I'm sorry, where?
- The South Pacific Islands.
The Tuamotu Archipelago. French
Polynesia. Tahiti. Papeete.
Wow. That's pretty unusual.
Yeah, I plan to go back there someday when I retire.
Water, sir?
- Thanks.
- Well, see you around, Jack.
Sure thing, Fred.
The conference room will be open in five minutes.
Good morning, everyone.
My name is Robert Tuttle.
I'll be your first speaker.
I will first discuss shaving cream distribution outlets in North American markets.
Let me begin by acknowledging what has become axiomatic in the field of shaving cream distribution.
Mainly that shaving cream, indeed almost all personal hygiene products for men, is what we call fashion resistant.
The overwhelming majority of shaving cream users will adopt a brand and remain loyal to it.
It is especially interesting to note, the difference in methods used to penetrate that market.
Because these two methods employed by the respective companies really illustrates the essential strategic choice that faces-
- The Mediterranean.
- Yes.
The Mediterranean is beautiful, of course; but if it's real sailing you want,
I recommend the Sunda Islands in the Banda
Sea. I was there on a trip last spring.
- Your cigarettes, sir.
- Thank you very much.
Hmm, Cohibas, my favorite brand. Thank you.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Thank you.
Would you excuse me?
Good evening, sir. What'll it be?
Give me a scotch. Single malt, on the rocks.
You got it.
Haven't we seen each other before?
You'll have to come up with something more original than that.
I'm here for the convention.
That's fascinating.
- You're in marketing, right?
- Uh-uh. Sales.
- Is there a difference?
- What about you?
I do health inspections of hotel restaurants.
- That sounds interesting.
- No, it doesn't.
- Do you have an answer for everything?
- Yes.
Rita Foster.
Jack Thursby.
So what do you do besides travel to dull cities and talk to women in hotel bars?
- I- - uh- play golf.
- Are you any good?
- No.
- Honesty. I like that.
What else do you like?
No commitments. No bullshit.
- And no rings.
- No rings?
You might want to take yours off?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll leave you alone now.
Your transmission came through, Mr. Thursby.
The signal was clear.
I can do something else on my next trip.
I think I'm ready to handle a bigger assignment.
We'll be sending you to Omaha next Wednesday.
Omaha?
You'll perform the same job that you did in Buffalo.
Omaha? Why can't they find someone in Omaha?
Why do they need to fly you all the way out there? It doesn't make sense.
Morgan.
Morgan, are you listening to me?
Since when did you ever care about golf?
You're not going on this trip, Morgan. I'm sorry.
What do you mean, I'm not going?
My father wants you to come to his office tomorrow.
Getting a position with his company is more important than a silly freelance job.
I said I'd go.
You're not going,
Morgan. End of discussion.
You're staying here. I'll call my father tonight and we'll-
Tell your father to go fuck himself.
What did you just say?
Say you're sorry, Morgan!
Morgan!
If you don't apologize, I want you out of this house.
Morgan! Are you listening to me?
What in God's name has gotten into you.
Since when did you start smoking? Morgan!
Morgan, what's going on? I think I deserve an explanation.
Your scotch, Mr. Thursby.
Turn around slowly, please.
What is your transmission device?
I thought you were a health inspector.
I'll ask you again: what is your transmission device?
The pen, in my jacket pocket.
Do not turn the pen on.
What?
When you're inside the convention room, keep the pen turn off.
Do not send the transmission to Digicorp.
If you tell Digicorp you met me, they'll kill you.
Take two every six hours, it will get rid of the nightmares you've been having.
Your headaches will go away, too, and the pain in the back of your neck.
How do you know that I'm having nightmares?
We'll be in touch in Boise.
What will they do if
I don't turn on my pen?
Just remember who you are. You are
Morgan Sullivan. You are not Jack Thursby.
Wait!
Good morning, everyone. I'm Alex
Chen. I'll be your first speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm here to address the controversy that's been raging around new techniques in the preparation of process cheese.
Now at the risk of oversimplifying the question facing the average manufacturer of process cheese is this:
Given an increased consumer prejudice against chemical additives, how do we stem the tide away from natural or organic based products and instil in the cheese buyer.
I'm glad to hear that there were no problems at the convention, Mr. Thursby.
I'll call down to the lab to make sure the transmission went through.
Excellent work, Mr. Thursby.
Thank you.
Your transmission came through perfectly, just as clear as the last time.
I want you to take another trip. Boise, Idaho.
Boise?
We scheduled a connecting flight for you to board when you landed.
You won't have time to go home.
That's not a problem, is it?
No. No problem.
Room 1493, Mr. Thursby.
The convention room will be open in an hour.
Thank you.
Mr. Thursby! One last thing: the first letter from each word is the phone number to call her.
Hello, Mr. Sullivan.
You dialed a special number that can't be traced or monitored.
Now, listen carefully.
Take the service elevator at the end of the hall down to the basement level.
You'll be clear for the next five minutes.
Wait a minute, wait!
Keep moving.
Roll up your sleeve, please.
We don't have much time.
Are you insane? You're not sticking that into me!
He has medical training, Mr. Sullivan.
I don't care if he's a fucking brain surgeon!
You're not gonna drug me.
We're undrugging you.
The shot will block out the Digicorp narcotic.
What?
The chemical they're putting in your bloodstream at every convention.
Do you normally drink something inside the convention room?
Mineral water.
The drug is tasteless and odorless. You wouldn't have known.
Did you take the pills I gave you?
Had the noises in your head started to go away?
- And the recurring dreams?
- Jesus, what is this?
W-w-why didn't Digicorp check my transmission in Omaha?
There was no transmission in Omaha.
Or in Buffalo. Or anywhere else.
Why do they send me to these conventions?
- The conventions are charades.
- Charades?
You and the other convention guests all work for Digicorp. You're all spies.
You're given phony assignments, phony identities.
You think your pen is a transmitting device, another guest thinks it's his tie clip or her watch.
The whole thing is just a ploy to keep you all distracted, to not realize what's really going on.
What is really going on?
If you want answers, take the shot.
When you're inside the room, act as you always act.
Order the mineral water. Drink it.
Don't make them suspicious.
The shot we gave you should protect you.
It should protect? What'd you mean? What if it doesn't?
Listen to me carefully.
Whatever happens in that room, show no reaction, no emotion, no surprise.
No matter what you see, do not move.
What will I see?
- Who sent you?
- A friend.
I don't have any friends.
- When will I see you again?
- Soon.
I promise.
There are several points of interest here. First of all, the fact, that by an impressive margin, new home purchases took most of the brunt of that decline.
By this I mean that sales of older homes are done on an individual basis where there's considerably more room for negotiation.
Therefore, in those sales we're more likely to find that the official rise in mortgage rates has been offset somewhat by the ...rates of return on high tech investment, which led to a surge in business capital spending and significantly increased the underlying growth rate of productivity.
The capitalization of these higher than expected returns boosted equity prices generally beyond even that expected by the enhanced rise in real incomes.
The elevated level of light vehicle sales, for example, has put more vehicles on the road than the industry could sustain.
And even though demand for the number of high tech products was doubling or tripling annually, in many cases new supply was coming on ever faster.
Overall capacity in high tech manufacturing industries rose nearly 50 percent last year, well in excess of its rapid rate of increase.
Accordingly the slowdown in the economy that began in the middle of last year intensified, perhaps even to the point of growth stalling out around the turn of the year.
As the economy slowed, equity prices fell, especially in the high tech sector, where previous high evaluations were being re-evaluated, resulting in significant losses in some investors.
Clearly some slowing in the pace of spending was necessary, if the economy was to progress along balanced and sustainable growth.
With the process likely to intensify with the rise in the cost of energy
that has strained business and household purchasing power,
purchases of durable goods and investment
in capital equipment declined in the fourth quarter.
Because the slowdown was not anticipated by business,
it induced some backup in inventories, despite more advanced technologies...
Inventory sales ratios rose only moderately, and even after the policy actions taken in January,
the risk continue skewed toward the economies remaining on a path
inconsistent with satisfactory economic performance.
Crucial to the assessment of the outlook and the understanding
of recent policy options,
is the role of the technological change in productivity
in shaping near-term transcyclical forces
as well as long term sustainable growth,
perceptible for sustaining slow advances in quality...
Just a reflex.
...Managers appear to be more generally sanguine about the potential for innovation.
You are not Morgan Sullivan. You are Jack
Thursby. You are not married to Amy Sullivan.
Your wife is Diane Thursby.
Your wife is Diane Thursby.
You live in Redmond, Washington.
Accordingly to foster financial conditions,
the federal reserve has quickened the pace of adjustment for its policy, and in conclusion, a cautious approach is always the best strategy.
Thank you for your attention.
Excuse me, do you have the time?
- The time? Your watch?
- Yeah, it's 3:30.
Already? Gosh, the last speech just flew by.
Yeah.
Did you enjoy it?
Oh, yeah. Very much.
Hello?
It's for you.
Digicorp will approach you at the airport. Tell them you are Jack Thursby.
Tell them you've never heard of Morgan Sullivan.
Make them think you're brainwashed.
If you're exposed, they'll kill you.
What happened back there?
You're feeling the side effects of the neutralizing agent in your system.
Don't worry. You'll be fine.
Mr. Sullivan. There's been a change of plans, Mr. Sullivan.
You need to come to Digicorp's local office right away.
Mr. Sullivan?
Mr. Sullivan?
Are you all right?
I think you're mistaken.
My name isn't Sullivan.
You're not Morgan Sullivan?
- You don't work for Digicorp?
- No. My name is Thursby. Jack Thursby.
I think you're looking for somebody else.
I'm sorry, Mr. Thursby. My mistake.
That's okay.
Hello, sir. How are you?
I just need to see your boarding pass, please. Thank you.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Excuse me.
- No problem.
Your turn. There's not much hot water left. Sorry.
Could you make dinner a half hour earlier tonight?
Sure.
I wrote down a list of errands I need you to do today.
Okay.
Your car keys are in the foyer next to your briefcase, right where you left them.
Planning a trip?
Just some reading to pass the time.
You're expected in reception, Mr. Thursby.
Down the hall and to the left.
- What's your name?
- Jack Thursby.
My name's Frank Callaway. I'm head of security for Sunways Systems.
According to your neuro-graph, you're lying.
You're lying when you say that your name is Jack Thursby.
You're lying when you say that you are not an undercover agent.
You are lying when you say that you do not work for Digicorp.
And I cannot tell you how happy that makes us.
No way. I am not going back to that house.
You are in a unique position here, Morgan.
Digicorp thinks that you're brainwashed as Jack Thursby.
They think that you passed our neuro-graph and they want us to hire you as one of our agents.
I don't care what they want.
Your counter intelligence work for Sunways will be very simple.
Digicorp will never suspect that you're working for us.
So they won't watch you too closely while you're in the house.
All you have to do is to place one bug in each room.
You don't fucking understand. I'm going home. I'm going to my real home.
Your real home is gone, Morgan.
What are you talking about?
Your wife put your house up for sale.
Her lawyer has been trying to contact you for the last few days.
She filed for divorce three days ago.
I'm sorry, Morgan.
- Look, Morgan, I know this is hard.
- I want to see Rita.
- Who?
- Rita Foster.
- She pulled me out of the brainwashing.
- No, Morgan. You cannot see her.
- Why not? She works for you.
- She does not work for us.
But you sent her to find me at the hotels, right?
No.
But you know who she works for?
Who does she work for?
- She works for Sebastian Rooks.
- Who's Sebastian Rooks?
Sebastian Rooks is a freelance operative who we hired to find out how Digicorp was getting their agents past our neuro-graph.
Then we asked him to send us an agent who wasn't brainwashed.
He delivered you.
He's the best in the business, but he's also very dangerous and very ruthless.
I advise you to stay away from him.
Stay away from him and her.
Look, we are offering you a very good deal here.
When your work for us is finished, we'll give you a new identity and a new home, somewhere very far away and safe from Digicorp.
I'm sorry, Mr. Callaway, but you'll have to find someone else for your job.
You won't last long out there.
Anywhere you go outside this complex,
Digicorp will have agents watching you.
If you try to run, if you behave like Morgan
Sullivan instead of Jack Thursby, they will eliminate you.
Quick. Efficient. Ruthless.
You're fortunate, Morgan. If we hadn't interrupted the brainwashing process you'd be like the other convention guests: programmed with a new identity and sent to companies across the globe, disposed of when you're no more useful to Digicorp.
You have a chance to fight back.
So, are you ready to be a spy, Morgan?
I'm gonna get some more broccoli.
Phone lines are tapped.
We've got visual in all the rooms.
There they are in the dining room.
The salt shaker gives a nice angle, doesn't it?
Very well. He believes he's Jack Thursby.
He believes I'm his wife.
He's adjusted to this house.
- Who's she talking to?
- Digicorp agents.
She's giving them a report on you.
He spends much of his time indoors.
Of course he has no friends and he has little contact with the outside world.
We've got the Internet lines tapped too.
Excellent work, Morgan. Excellent.
My God.
My life is the same as it ever was.
That's because Digicorp monitored your old life and then duplicated it.
It helps ease the transition of becoming another person.
That's not who I am anymore.
I
- I smoke cigarettes.
I like to drink scotch.
I play golf.
I'm not supposed to live in the suburbs.
I'm not supposed to be like that.
I'm sorry if you're disappointed, Morgan.
But that is your vision of Jack Thursby.
It's not Digicorp's.
Can you guys clean up the camera reception in that hallway?
Yes, Jamison?
This isn't Jamison. It's
Morgan Sullivan. Bitch.
- What do you want, Mr. Sullivan?
- I need your help.
I want to hire Sebastian Rooks.
- Are you still there?
- Goodbye, Mr. Sullivan.
- I'll pay him for his service.
- He doesn't work for individuals.
Ask him to make an exception.
- I'll do whatever it takes.
- You're on your own, I'm sorry.
No. No!
- Listen, you gotta help me.
- There's nothing I can-
You gotta help me, please.
You said I could trust you. I believed you when you said that.
Meet me at the carwash at Fourth and Jefferson in three hours.
Morgan! We'll be sending you on your first assignment next week.
Our surveillance of your house has already paid off.
We know exactly what sort of data
Digicorp is trying to steal from us.
So tonight you will say that you're going out of town on a business trip.
Now, you know how to tell her that, right?
- Morgan?
- Yes.
You will stick to the script, Morgan.
You won't try anything risky, do you understand me?
Sebastian Rooks has agreed to help you.
- When does he want to meet me?
- Not yet. He's in the car behind us.
- How much money does Rooks want?
- He's not interested in your money.
It's your situation. He thinks he can use it to his advantage.
- How?
- I'll be in touch with you in Wichita.
Wichita?
That's where Sunways will be sending you for your last assignment.
How do you know that?
They haven't even told me.
Rooks knows. He knows everything.
- Can I trust Rooks?
- I can't give you guarantees.
But he has the resources to provide you with a new life, a new identity.
It's your choice, Mr. Sullivan.
What do I have to do?
Sunways will send you on a series of assignments.
You'll receive a courier disk on each trip.
Digicorp agents will be following you wherever you do.
Let them, that's what Sunways wants.
At each destination you'll be met by a Sunways contact.
They'll download data onto your disk.
Digicorp's agents will assume you're receiving valuable information.
As you travel to more cities, collect more data, and complete more assignments, your agent status will rise.
Digicorp will then assume you have become one of
Sunways top company men.
Jack?
Each disk you bring home will seem more important than the last.
As they copy the Sunways files,
Digicorp will think they have won a major victory against their greatest rival.
In reality, Digicorp is the loser.
Sunways is feeding them corrupt data that will sabotage their operations.
But make no mistake, Mr. Sullivan.
Sunways is just as ruthless as Digicorp.
Once this operation is complete, they will eliminate you.
Rooks will protect you.
Please. You can trust me.
We're sending you to Kansas. Wichita.
It's almost over, Morgan.
After this trip to the vault, your work for us will be finished.
- The vault?
- It's our data warehouse.
It's completely isolated from the outside world, but we send in agent couriers if we need to retrieve or add a file.
You will be our next courier.
And Digicorp will they have hit the mother lode.
Shh! We need to keep our voices down. Switch this disk with the one in your briefcase, before you go to the vault. Take off your ring.
- What?
- Your ring.
This is a tracking device. We'll know your precise location at all times.
Does this mean we can see each other again?
I pick you up after you leave the vault, deliver you to Rooks.
- I mean, after that?
- We can never see each other again.
It would compromise your identity.
I'm never getting out of this, am I?
500 Horse Creek Road, please.
I know where to go.
Settle down, Mr. Sullivan. We have a long ride ahead of us.
You don't have to pretend to be Thursby.
I know you're not brainwashed.
I know that Sunways has been using you as a double agent against Digicorp.
Are you going to kill me?
Not if you turn your loyalties to me instead of Sebastian Rooks. Oh, yeah. I know that you work for him.
As a matter of fact, we both do.
I'm Rooks' inside source at Digicorp.
- His what?
- He paid me to hire you so you could be his pawn once you were sent off to Sunways.
You didn't think I hired you because
I was impressed by you, did you?
It's a good plan, really.
Rooks knew that you'd end up here in
Kansas on the way to the Sunways vault.
He knew he could convince you to switch their disk with his.
- That was his scheme from the very start.
- It's not possible.
Rooks' disk contains a search program.
It penetrates the vault's secure network and quietly steal a data file without triggering any alarms.
What data file?
Who knows? But if Rooks has gone through all this trouble to get it, it must be extremely valuable.
The plan was foolproof.
Except for one factor he failed to consider: me.
What do you want?
When you come out of the vault, deliver the disk to me, not Rooks.
I've been loyal to Digicorp all along.
Why should I trust you or Digicorp?
Because we'll let you live and
Rooks won't. It's as simple as that.
No one sees his face and lives to tell about it.
No one sees his face?
He's a deep cover operative.
A Yuri in cyberspace.
He's a phantom. Companies hire him without actually knowing who he is.
If they did, they'd kill him.
The moment you give that disk to
Rooks is the moment he eliminates you.
There's only one person Rooks trusts with his identity:
Rita Foster, his lover.
She's completely loyal to him. No one else.
I'm the only person you can trust now.
I'll be nearby when you come out.
Just in case we get separated.
No charge for the ride.
Good evening, Mr. Thursby.
My name's Virgil Dunn.
Welcome to the vault.
Your first time?
Hope you didn't have a big dinner.
Step ahead, please.
Now that we know you are bug free,
I can call you by your real name, Morgan.
Dunn, Virgil C.
I need your disk now, please.
Good, good.
Digicorp will cream in their pants when they copy the bogus data that I just cooked up for them.
You wouldn't believe the number of times they tried to jack into the systems down here.
- Have they ever succeeded?
- Hell, no.
This place is tighter than a nun's asshole.
Uh, snort while we wait?
Sure.
I distilled it myself down here. One of my little hobbies to pass the time.
- Thanks.
- Here's to the information agent.
I used to be an agent like you once.
I was the best mole spotter in the business.
You put me in a room with a possible double agent, let me ask him a couple of questions, and I could tell you right there whether he was a spy or not.
That was before Sunways sent me down here. That was three years ago.
- What happened?
- Those fucking machines is what happened.
They said the neuro-graphs were
100% accurate, but I wasn't.
That a really good spy, a really good liar, could trick me every time.
It's bullshit, I told them.
But they wouldn't listen.
You see, there are things that only a person can know about another person, Mr. Sullivan, things that a machine could never pick up.
For example, let me ask you a couple of questions.
Excuse me?
What is your favorite drink? Go ahead.
Answer. I just want to prove my point.
What is your favorite drink?
Er, scotch, single malt, on the rocks.
You're telling the truth.
- Are you married?
- Yes, I am.
Truth again. See, you're very
- very easy to read.
Now
- Are you in love with your wife?
- Yes.
- There, you just lied. Am I right?
Yes, I lied.
It's more than just questions, however.
For instance, I'm sensing a kind of tension in you.
It's been evident ever since
I put your disk in my computer.
Now why would that be? We both know the disk is from Sunways.
That's nothing that should make you uneasy.
- One last question, all right?
- Sure.
Are you a double agent?
Where's Mr. Dunn?
He decided to stay in his office.
- Right. You can go ahead, Mr. Sullivan.
- Thank you.
Open the door!
Emergency crews are on their way.
For your safety, please remain inside the elevator.
For your safety, please remain inside the elevator.
Emergency crews are on their way.
For your safety, please remain inside the elevator.
Jump!
Now!
I told you I'd know where you'd be.
- Is this Rooks?
- I can take the disk now.
Jamison, one of our operatives.
Rooks is back at the hotel.
He's looking forward to seeing you.
The car's waiting downstairs.
Call me when you get to the lab.
- This is where Rooks lives?
- For now. He moves around a lot.
- But you know where he is at all times?
- We have a special relationship.
Your assignment is nearly finished, Mr. Sullivan.
I'll be back in a moment.
Finster.
- It's Morgan Sullivan.
- Sullivan! What happened to you?
I'm in the penthouse suite of an old building. I don't know where it is.
We're tracing the call. We'll be there shortly. Where's Rooks?
- I'm just about to meet him.
- Get off the phone before he sees you.
He will kill you, understand? Hold on to the disk. We're on our way.
- Don't come any closer.
- Put the gun down, Mr. Sullivan.
I'll break it. You come any further, I'll break it.
I gave you the Sunways disk. This one is yours. The one Rooks wants.
Stop!
- You really don't want to do that.
- You used me. You and Rooks.
- You used me from the very start.
- Wait, let me explain.
No. Finster already explained everything.
- When did you talk to Finster?
- He's on his way. I just called him.
If Rooks wants this disk before Finster arrives, you better unlock that door and let me go.
Listen to me. Sebastian Rooks is not the person you think he is.
Sebastian Rooks is a ruthless spy
- and so are you.
- No, you're wrong. He's-
I know about you.
I know about the two of you. I know about your special relationship.
Please, just hear me out. I-
I don't want to hear any more lies!
I don't want to hear any more lies!
God! I can't believe I thought you actually cared about me.
- I can't believe I was such a fool.
- I do care about you.
No, no.
Just go see Rooks. It'll be okay.
Hurry. Find him.
I tried stopping you, but you insisted.
You said it was the only way to steal the data from the vault.
Welcome home, Mr. Rooks.
Come on. Finster will be here any minute.
No, no. No more lies. You can't trick me anymore.
Listen to me. You are not Morgan Sullivan.
You created him out of your own imagination.
Your life in the suburbs, your miserable marriage-- Your wife, Amy, was one of your own operatives playing a part you assigned her.
The more you fight the truth, the more it'll hurt.
It's not possible.
You used the same brainwashing technique Digicorp uses.
You were the one who sold them the technology to begin with.
- This makes no sense!
- It makes perfect sense!
By turning yourself into Morgan Sullivan was the only way you could pass
Digicorp's neuro-graph.
It was the only way you could get hired to be their spy and get sent to Sunways.
- Why would anyone do this?
- For this.
- What's on it?
- I was hoping you could tell me.
You don't know?
I've put a lot of faith into this assignment.
Clear! Freeze! Don't move!
Sunways Security! Identify yourself! Digicorp Security!
- You're following me, Callaway?
- I'm here for Rooks, not you.
That's who I am here for.
- You've flown this before?
- No, never.
You know how to fly it. You designed it.
- I don't know what to do.
- Sebastian Rooks knows.
- I can't remember Sebastian Rooks!
- You remembered that you loved me.
Just think.
We're out.
Did you get a look at him?
Did you see Rooks' face?
Just Morgan Sullivan, our pawn.
Jesus! He's Rooks.
Is it what you want?
Yes.
Yes. It's you.
The file in the vault was erased. And this is the only copy.
Now there's no copy at all.
You know how blind I am without them.
Howard, don't cry.
Murder.
- Good luck, John.
- Any contractions?
Only the ones you give me.
- What's coming?
- Red Ball, double homicide.
One male, one female.
Killer's male, white, 40s.
Agatha nailed the time at 8:04 a.m.
The twins are a little fuzzy on that.
Location's still uncertain.
Remote witnesses are plugged in.
This will be case number 1108.
Morning, detectives.
Case number 1108, previsualized by the Pre-Cogs...
...recorded on holosphere by Precrime's Q-stacks.
My fellow witnesses are Dr. Katherine
James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
Good morning.
Will the witness preview and validate
1108 at this time?
Affirmative. I will validate.
Go get them.
- Standby.
- Time of murder: 8:04 a.m.
That is 24 minutes, 13 seconds from now. This is a Red Ball.
You know how blind I am without them.
All right, Howard Marks, where are you?
Howard? Howard, breakfast.
Four score and seven years ago...
- He looked familiar.
- Who?
A man standing in the park across the street.
- Seen him before.
- How can you tell?
You're blind without your glasses.
Where are your glasses?
- In the bedroom.
- You're running out of time.
- You know how blind I am...
I show eight Howard Markses in the
District. Sorting by race and age.
Run their license and registration.
See if I can capture an address here.
I was thinking I'd stay home today.
- What about your meeting?
- I've been working too much.
- Can you grab that?
- It's unclear.
- Six licenses. Where do you want them?
- Over here, please.
You know how blind I am without them.
Got him in the Foxhall.
4421 Gainsborough.
Send DCPD. Set up a perimeter.
Tell them we're en route.
I was thinking maybe I'd play hooky, stay home today.
- "We've come to dedicate a portion..."
- What do you think?
- What about your meeting?
- I'll reschedule.
I've been working too much anyway.
- "But in a larger s..." Good.
- We could have lunch together.
- What do you say?
- "We cannot consecrate...
- I would love to.
- "The brave men, living and dead...
I have an open house at the Ressler place.
- Have consecrated, far above our poor power to add or detract. "
I guess that's why you look so nice.
Chief! We got a problem with our location.
- It's no longer there.
- Shit!
- Time frame?
- Thirteen minutes.
Investigator from the fed's here.
I don't need some twink from the fed poking around.
I wrote it on your calendar.
See if the neighbors knew where they went.
- Check all relations.
- Checking.
Just get him some coffee, tell him how I save your ass every day.
I got coffee, thanks.
Danny Witwer, the twink from the fed.
Oops. Gum?
I'll give you the full tour some other time.
They moved two weeks ago. Nobody knows where. Still searching for family.
Time horizon, 12 minutes.
He's scrubbing the image, looking for...
...clues as to where the murder will happen.
Original running bond brick pattern,
Georgian details. Brick was repointed.
And that this nation, under God, shall not perish from the earth.
Victims are pronounced here, killers here.
Beyond that, all we have to run on are the images that they produce.
- Show a cop on horseback.
- Near the Capitol?
- No Maglev system.
- The Mall?
Georgetown.
The Pre-Cogs can see a murder four days out. Why the late call?
A Red Ball. Crimes of passion have no premeditation, so they show up late.
Most of our scrambles are flash events.
We rarely see premeditation anymore.
People have gotten the message.
I show a match with Dwight Kingsley,
18th-century architect.
- He did two dozen houses in D.C.
- Time horizon, 10 minutes.
Look at this kid.
In this one, he's on the left side of the man.
Yes. So?
This one he's on the right.
Merry-go-round.
It's a park.
There's only 16 of these old merry-go-rounds left in the city.
Two in Georgetown, one in
Barnaby Woods, the others in Woodley.
It's gotta be Barnaby Woods.
Evanna, flight time?
The way I drive?
Three minutes after wheels up.
- Clear.
- Clear.
Time horizon, six minutes.
Let's go to bed.
Let's do it in here.
- But the bed is soft.
- I'm soft.
Shit.
Which one is it?
- Not the bed.
- Come on.
I don't want to be on the bed.
- We're catching up to the future.
- Shut up, Evanna. Jad?
- Jad?
- Go ahead.
- Did he close the front door?
- What?
Did Marks close the front door?
Front door...
I didn't wanna be on the bed.
- Negative. The front door is open.
- Time horizon, 30 seconds.
I forgot my glasses.
Howard.
You know how blind I am without them.
Howard, don't cry.
Marks!
Look at me. Look at me.
Positive for Howard Marks.
By mandate of the District of Columbia
Precrime Division...
...you're under arrest for the future murder of Mrs. Marks and Mr. Dubin...
...that was to take place today at 0800 hours and four minutes.
- I didn't do anything. Sarah?
- Give the man his hat.
Oh, God.
Don't put that halo on me. Sarah!
- Put your hand on your head.
- Help me! I wasn't gonna do anything!
I'm Officer Scott with the
Precrime Trauma Response Unit.
Sit here a minute and listen to me.
Your husband is being arrested by Precrime.
Oh, God, Howard, no.
Howard, don't cry.
Howard, don't cry.
Please, don't cry.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
I thought they stopped the murder.
That's just an echo.
Pre-Cog deja vu, if you will.
The really bad ones the Pre-Cogs see over and over again.
Wally, erase the incoming.
Imagine a world without murder.
- I lost my best friend.
- I lost my aunt.
- I lost my dad.
- I lost my wife.
Just six years ago, the homicide rate had reached epidemic proportions.
It seemed that only a miracle could stop the bloodshed.
But instead of one miracle, we were given three: The Pre-Cognitives.
Within just one month under the Precrime program...
...the murder rate in the District of Columbia was reduced 90%% .
- They were waiting for me.
- He was gonna rape me.
- I was going to be stabbed.
- Right here.
Within a year, Precrime effectively stopped murder in our nation 's capital.
In the six years of our experiment...
...there hasn't been a single murder.
And now Precrime can work for you.
We want to make certain that every American...
...can bank on the infallibility of the system.
And to ensure that what keeps us safe will also keep us free.
- Precrime. It works.
- It works.
- It works.
- It works.
- It works.
- It works.
Precrime. It works.
On Tuesday, April 22, vote "yes" on the National Precrime Initiative.
What's the matter? Can't sleep?
- Just need a little clarity.
- True that.
You want the customary clarity or the new and improved kind of clarity?
Give me the new stuff.
New and improved clarity.
Clarity, clarity. Yes, indeed.
Come on. Come on.
Don't bust my balls. You've only given me four, and some of these are duds.
Sweet dreams, chief.
Don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.
I could use a little juice on my side.
What do you think you know?
It's like my daddy used to say:
"In the land of the blind...
...the one-eyed man is king. "
I'm home.
Overhead.
Wall screen.
- Sean.
- Hi, Daddy.
Can you teach me how to run faster?
Because all the kids in my class run faster than me.
That's good.
Keep your knees up.
Like that. Like that.
High. High. Like that.
- See, you're a natural runner.
- Gotta keep running.
Yeah. Gotta keep running.
Gotta keep running.
- Will I be as fast as you someday?
- Oh, I think you'll beat me someday.
- You're gonna beat everybody.
- I think you'll beat everyone someday.
- I gotta go. Bye.
- No, no, no. Wait, wait.
- You gotta give me a kiss.
- Not on the lips.
Only Mommy kisses me on the lips.
Yeah, all right. All right.
I love you.
- I love you, Sean.
- I love you, Daddy.
Reminds me of Rosarito Beach.
Remember?
We had 20 dollars and...
Waiting in that van so the sun would shine on our vacation.
John. John. John, put the camera down.
Look, I'm all ready for bed.
What is this? No. Put it away.
It's time to put the camera to sleep...
...and time to come and take care of your wife.
Why don 't you put the camera down and come and watch the rain with me?
No? I promise I'll make it a memorable moment.
Put the camera down or you're not getting anything tonight.
A gentleman at Justice wants to take this away from us.
In a week, people will vote on whether or not...
...what we've been doing has been a noble-minded enterprise...
...or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.
John...
...watch this Danny Witwer, the observer from Justice.
- I met him yesterday.
- Let him look around.
Answer his questions, but watch him.
If there's any problem, make sure we know about it.
When the Pre-Cogs declare a killer, their name is embedded in the wood.
Since the shape and grain of each piece is unique, they're impossible to forge.
You understand the legalistic drawback to Precrime methodology.
- Here we go again.
- I'm not with the ACLU on this...
...but we arrest individuals who've broken no law.
- They will.
- The commission is metaphysics.
The Pre-Cogs see the future, and they're never wrong.
But it's not the future if you stop it.
- Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
- Yes.
You're talking about predetermination, which happens all the time.
- Why'd you catch that?
- It was gonna fall.
You're certain?
But it didn't fall. You caught it.
Preventing it doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
You ever get any false positives?
Someone intends to kill, but doesn't.
How do the Pre-Cogs tell the difference?
They don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
Why can't they see rapes, assaults, suicides?
Because of the nature of murder.
Nothing's more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us...
...than the untimely murder of a human.
- That wasn't Walt Whitman.
Iris Hineman. She developed Pre-Cogs, designed the system and the interface.
Speaking of interfacing,
I'd love to say hello.
- To Hineman?
- To them.
- Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
- You've never been inside?
We keep strict separation so that no one can be accused of tampering.
- I'll be the first one to go in then?
- Maybe you didn't hear me.
- If it's a question of authority...
- There is no question.
You don't have any.
I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
- Show it to me.
- Sure.
This investigation of Precrime and its personnel is conducted...
...under the direct supervision and permission from the attorney general.
I'm here as his representative...
...which means you're now operating under my supervision.
Seems you've been left out of the loop.
All right, we're ready. Let's go.
- Hold it right there. Hold on.
- Not cleared for access.
Eye-dent: John Anderton. Approved.
- Wally.
- No, no, no, no.
Danny Witwer from Justice.
We're to give him the run of the farm.
- I can't touch you.
- Don't touch anything.
- You can't be in here.
- Just answer his questions.
- Tell me how...
- They're sleeping.
Sorry. Tell me how all this works.
The photon milk acts as both a nutrient supply and conductor.
It enhances the images they receive.
We call the female Agatha.
The twins are Arthur and Dashiell.
We scan by way of optical tomography.
White-light pinpoints pulse along the length of the headgear...
...and are reread after absorption through their brain tissue.
In other words, we see what they see.
They don't feel pain. We keep their heads stocked with dopamine.
Plus, we maintain careful control over their serotonin levels.
Don't want them to drift off into too deep a sleep.
- They can't be kept too awake either.
- Don't think of them as human.
No. They're much more than that.
Science has stolen most of our miracles.
In a way, they give us hope, hope of the existence of the divine.
It's interesting that some people have begun to deify the Pre-Cogs.
Pre-Cogs are pattern-recognition filters.
That's all.
- Yet you call this room the "temple. "
- A nickname.
The oracle isn't where the power is, anyway.
The power is with the priests, even if they had to invent the oracle.
You guys are nodding like you know what he's talking about.
Well, come on, chief. The way we work, changing destiny and all...
...we're more like clergy than cops.
- Jad.
- Yeah?
Go to work. All of you.
Sorry. Old habit.
I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.
- My father was proud.
- What does he think of your work?
I don't know. He was shot and killed when I was 15 at our church in Dublin.
I know what it's like to lose someone close.
Nothing's like the loss of a child.
I don't have any children, so I can only imagine what that was like.
To lose your son in such a public place like that...
Now we can make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone.
- Tell me what it is you're looking for.
- Flaws.
There hasn't been a murder in six years. This system is...
Perfect. I agree.
If there's a flaw, it's human.
It always is.
John.
Wally.
Can you see?
What happened? Her ACTH levels just shot through the roof!
- What'd you do?
- She grabbed me.
Impossible. They're not aware of us.
In the milk, all they see is the future.
- She looked straight at me.
- It could have been a nightmare.
- She spoke to me.
- To you?
What'd she say?
"Can you see?"
You the sentry?
Yes, sir, I'm Gideon.
You're Chief Anderton.
The music relaxes the prisoners.
I don't ever see you Precops down here.
Am I in trouble?
Not yet.
I'm interested in a murder.
- I got plenty of those. Kill type?
- Drowning.
That narrows it down.
Not too many in here for that.
- Victim's Caucasian, female.
- This about the Justice Department?
I'm supposed to spruce up for a tour they got tomorrow. You like this tie?
Stop.
Roll back.
There.
She's a golden oldie. One of our first.
Probably before your time.
- This is the composite of the three?
- That's right.
Combined data stream based on all three previsions.
- Just show me Agatha's data stream.
- For that...
...we go for a ride.
My God.
I'd forgotten there were so many.
And to think they'd all be out there killing people if it wasn't for you.
Look at them.
Look at how peaceful they seem.
But on the inside: Busy, busy, busy.
Okey-pokey.
Now that is one bad man.
He drowned a woman named
Anne Lively out at Roland Lake.
The killer's a John Doe, never identified.
Why is he still a John Doe?
Why wasn't he ID'd from the eye scan?
Those are not his eyes. He had them swapped out to fool the scanners.
You can get it done on the street for a few thousand bucks these days.
Okay, so you want just the female prevision.
That's right.
We don't seem to have her data.
Try again.
This is odd. See?
We have the two previsions. We got what Art saw. We got what Dash saw.
But Agatha's isn't here.
Probably just a glitch.
Tell me about the intended victim, this Anne Lively.
Looks like she's a neuroin addict, like our John Doe here.
Address history includes the Beaton Clinic.
So she cleaned up.
Where is she now?
I guess glitches come in twos.
You finally crawl your way out of one hole just to fall into another.
No.
Can't let you take that out of here, chief.
- It's against the rules.
- Anything else against the rules?
Careful, chief. You dig up the past, all you get is dirty.
The third prevision was what, kind of fuzzy or something?
No, the third prevision,
Agatha's prevision, wasn't there.
That's not all. There are a dozen more cases with missing previsions.
You'd think we'd have found the cure for the common cold.
- It's stress.
- What's this?
Herbal tea with honey.
I hate herbal tea.
Almost as much as I hate honey.
Just drink it, before I pour it in your lap.
- Can I get you anything, John?
- No, thank you.
Witwer's scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow.
Yeah, give him a tour.
- Lara called me.
- What?
She's worried about you.
Quite frankly, so am I.
I'm fine.
I understand you've been spending a lot of time in the Sprawl.
- I go running down there.
- In the middle of the night.
What if Danny Witwer insisted on a full chem run?
I'm fine.
The minute Precrime goes national, they are going to take it away.
- We won't let them.
- No?
How is an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them?
My father once said to me...
..."You don't choose the things you believe in. They choose you. "
There's a reason you are here.
Had Precrime been in place earlier, your loss would have been prevented.
Remember, the eyes...
The eyes of the nation are on us right now.
I'm not the generation anyone listens to...
...but people trust you when you speak of your belief in Precrime.
They know that it's a belief born of pain, not politics. I understood that.
I may have even encouraged it to help with the cause.
But now, your pain is hurting both of us.
They're not going to take it away from us.
I won't let them.
Bingo.
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, buddy.
- I made up a club.
- Yeah?
- We're called the Crescos.
- The Crescos.
- We made up a soccer team.
- Yeah?
- We practice at school.
- With Connor?
Your daddy's in a lot of trouble,
Sean.
- Wait!
- No!
Jad, how come you're not with
Father Witwer?
We're in motion on something. We got a white, male victim, about 5' 10", 170.
He takes a round in the 10-ring and goes out a window.
- Red Ball?
- Nope. Brown Ball.
It's premeditated.
Amazing. There's someone within
200 miles still dumb enough to do that.
The victim's name is Leo Crow.
This is case number 1109. Time of occurrence: Friday, 1506 hours.
Start search for Leo Crow. Case 1109, previsualized by the Pre-Cogs...
...recorded on holosphere by Precrime's Q-stacks.
My fellow witnesses are Dr. Katherine
James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
Good morning.
Are you ready to preview and validate 1109?
- Ready when you are, John.
- Standing by.
I love this part.
I've got no address. No tax returns for the last five years.
Check NCIC.
Maybe he's got a number.
We'll send a protection team as soon as we lock location.
It looks like federal housing.
Concrete, glass, egg crates.
Ouch. About a thousand of those in the District.
Fractured images coming in.
Numbers nine...
Nine, six.
Female, senior. She's smoking a pipe.
She's laughing.
Okay, now I'm inside a room.
Windowpanes, aluminum extrusion.
Two figures resolving in the room.
- Wait!
- No...
Looks like we got a third party.
Wearing sunglasses, just out the window.
You're not gonna kill me.
Goodbye, Crow.
You're not gonna kill me.
- Goodbye, Crow.
- Wait!
Wait. Wait.
You say something, chief?
No.
I'll get this one.
We got time on this one, Jad.
Mind getting me a piece of cake they're eating?
- I'm starving.
- Sure, chief.
I think I'll get one for myself too.
Take your time.
Chief Anderton, what is this that I'm seeing?
I'm confused about...
- Anderton, wait!
- Goodbye, Crow.
Anderton, wait!
Anderton, wait!
I like you, chief.
You've always been nice to me.
Give you two minutes before I hit the alarm.
Hold that, please.
Thanks.
- You're in a lot of trouble, John.
- You set me up.
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you've been doping on.
Easy.
- Easy.
- Seems I've found a flaw.
What are you gonna do?
Possession will cost you six months and your badge.
I guess we won't be working together after all.
Now put the gun down, John.
I don't hear a Red Ball.
Lamar. Lamar.
- Lamar?
- John, what is happening?
It's Witwer. He set me up!
Stop, just wait.
- Witwer! It's Witwer.
- Who's the victim?
- Somebody.
- Who?
- Somebody... Leo Crow.
- Who is he?
I have no idea!
I've never heard of him.
But I'm supposed to kill him in less than 36 hours.
- How could Witwer have access?
- Can you fake a cerebral output?
- Why would anyone want to?
- Can you?
- I doubt it.
- Would Hineman know?
- Now listen, come in.
- What?
I'll protect you until we get to the bottom of this.
Talk to Wally. See if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.
Ask Jad for any off-hour eye-dents into the analytical room.
Who's Leo Crow?
Security lockdown enabled.
Revised destination: Office.
Lamar, they found me.
Is there any way to override the lockdown?
- No, no, no.
- No?
I'll meet you anywhere you say.
You can come to my house, John.
I can't. They'll get me.
I'm not gonna get haloed.
You can't run.
Everybody runs.
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, hey.
Oh, my gosh, are you okay?
I'll bring him in. Unharmed.
You're not gonna do that.
I'm taking control.
What?
Fletcher is second in command.
It's his show to run. You can observe.
- Do it. Find him.
- Yes, sir.
He came to see you the other day right before he was tagged.
- What did you talk about?
- The Mets.
John doesn't think they have a deep enough pitching roster.
Why are you protecting him? You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing.
- The man lost a child, for chrissake.
- Six years ago.
- What did you talk about?
- None of your business.
It's my business. Investigation of a supervising officer for a capital crime...
...falls under federal jurisdiction so as to rule out any conspiracy.
- He's my suspect.
- He's my subordinate.
Call the attorney general. I'm sure he'd clarify the issue for you.
I don't want John Anderton hurt.
I'm going to enjoy working here.
A road diverges in the desert.
Lexus.
The road you're on, John Anderton, is the one less-traveled.
- Make sure you...
- Diamonds...
Good evening, John Anderton.
John Anderton! You could use a Guinness right about now.
- John Anderton...
- Escape from it all.
Get away, John Anderton.
Forget your troubles.
He's been eye-dented on the Metro.
The train stops at 20th and 33rd.
Send units to each location.
- Better make 20th.
- Have faith.
Fire them up!
- Hey, Fletch.
- Hey, John.
- That was a rough landing.
- Yeah.
- Work on that.
- It's the shit knee of mine.
- Yeah.
- Don't do it.
Hey, don't do this.
John?
Don't run.
You don't have to chase me.
You don't have to run.
Everybody runs, Fletch.
You know we'll catch you.
Everybody runs.
- It doesn't have to be like this, John.
- Everybody runs.
Get your sick-sticks ready.
Everybody runs, Fletch.
Slow down, chief. Just take it easy.
No sudden moves, chief.
John, it's okay.
- Fletch...
- Easy does it, chief.
Got a grip?
- Got a grip?
- Yeah.
Anderton!
Go away! Get out of my kitchen!
Get out of my house!
Get out of my house! Go!
- Get them out of here!
- Anderton, stop!
Pull him off me, Fletcher.
Get him off me.
Get him out of here!
What's the matter with you?!
Get out of my house! Go!
By mandate of the District of Columbia,
I'm placing you under arrest for...
Go to sleep.
You two stay with me!
Dr. Hineman.
You're trespassing.
I don't have visitors.
That would be from the doll's eye, the vine...
...the baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall.
It's not a true doll's eye.
It's a little hybrid I designed.
Once the poison gets into your bloodstream, you'll start to see...
...the most extraordinary display of blue objects.
This just isn't your week, is it?
Chief Anderton.
I'm not a killer.
You better drink this.
Soon you won't be able to swallow, and then you'll be totally buggered.
All of it.
Okay, now take a minute to right yourself.
Just what is it you think
I can do for you?
You could tell me how someone can fake a prevision.
How would I know that?
Because you invented Precrime.
What's so funny?
If the consequences of several genetic mistakes and science gone haywire...
...can be called an invention, then I invented Precrime.
- You don't seem proud.
- I'm not.
I was trying to heal them, not turn them into something else.
- Heal who?
- The innocents we use to stop the guilty.
You're talking about the Pre-Cogs.
You think they came from a test tube?
They are merely the ones who survived.
I was doing genetic research, treating children of drug addicts.
This was 10 years ago, when neuroin first hit the streets.
It was impure, not the engineered cocktail popular among the educated.
All of these kids were born with severe brain damage. Most died before age 12.
Those few who survived, they had a gift.
I call it a gift. For them, it was more like a cosmic joke.
They would wake up in the night, curled in the corner...
...screaming, clawing at the walls.
Because when these children closed their eyes at night...
...they dreamt only of murder over and over, one after the other.
It didn't take for us long to realize that the real nightmare was...
...that these dreams were about to come true, these murders were happening.
You say some of the children died?
So many of them.
Despite what we did for them.
Or maybe because of what we did to them. But it doesn't matter.
It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
I'm not going to commit murder.
I've never met the man
I'm supposed to kill.
And yet a chain of events has started that will lead you to his murder.
- Not if I stay away from him.
- Can you avoid a man you've never met?
- You won't help?
- I can't help you. Nobody can.
The Pre-Cogs are never wrong.
But occasionally...
...they do disagree.
What?
Most of the time, all three Pre-Cogs will see an event in the same way...
...but once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the others.
Jesus Christ.
Why didn't I know about this?
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
Why?
For Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.
Who wants a justice system that instills doubt?
It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.
Are you saying
I've haloed innocent people?
I'm saying that every so often, those accused of a Precrime...
...just might have an alternate future.
Does Burgess know about this, about this Minority Report?
I used to joke with Lamar that we were the parents of Precrime.
Parents often see their children as they want them to be and not as they are.
Answer my question: Does Lamar
Burgess know about the Minority Report?
Yes, of course, he knew.
But at the time, we felt their existence was an insignificant variable.
Insignificant to you, maybe.
But what about those people that
I put away with alternate futures?
- My God, if the country knew...
- The system would collapse.
- I believe in that system.
- Do you really?
You wanna bring it down.
You will bring it down if you manage to kill your victim.
That'll be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime didn't work.
- I'm not gonna kill anybody.
- Hold that thought.
- Why should I trust you?
- You shouldn't trust anyone.
Certainly not the attorney general, who wants it all for himself.
And not the young federal agent, who wants your job.
Not even the old man who just wants to hang on to what he created.
Don't trust anyone.
Just find the Minority Report.
You said the Minority Report is destroyed.
The record is destroyed.
The original report still exists.
I designed it so the report is stored in a safe place, but not declared.
What safe place is that?
The safest place there is.
Where is it?
Inside the Pre-Cog who predicted it.
All you have to do is download it, darling.
That's all, huh?
Just walk into Precrime, get into the temple...
...somehow tap into these Pre-Cogs and download this Minority Report.
- If you have one.
- And then walk out.
Actually, you'll have to run out.
But yes, that's what you have to do.
You're insane.
Or you think I am.
I'll get eye-scanned a dozen times before I get within 10 miles of Precrime.
Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
As a policeman...
Excuse me, as a former policeman...
...I'm sure that you know all sorts of people...
...who can help you out in this regard.
It's funny how all living organisms are alike.
When the chips are down, when the pressure is on...
...every creature on the face of the earth...
...is interested in one thing and one thing only:
Its own survival.
Find the Minority Report.
How do I even know which one has it?
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
Which one is that?
The female.
We've got three men in a room.
The victim is here...
...John is here, and this unidentified male, at the window.
The adjacent building suggests public housing, which means...
- There's thousands like this one.
- They're everywhere.
But he doesn't go there to kill Crow for another 22 hours.
This is Chief Anderton's space.
- He's not here.
- He'll be back.
I doubt that. I'm betting he's somewhere in the Sprawl.
He's smart enough to go where billboards can't ID him.
There's fewer consumers, which means fewer scanners.
- Why won't he just run?
- Because he thinks he's innocent.
We concentrate on the Sprawl.
We do fly-overs in ships, with two spyder teams on the ground.
Thermal scan the entire area. Read anything with eyes and a heartbeat.
Where is she?
Started blowing buttons for no reason whatsoever, and I knew that.
This damn cold.
Don't worry. I could cut open your chest and sew a dead cat in there...
...you wouldn't get an infection. Not with the antibios I'll shoot into you.
That's comforting.
You do understand I can't just give you new irises?
Please, don't touch.
Because the scanners would read the new scar tissue, alarms will go off...
...and large men with guns will appear.
What was that?
What was that?
- It's anesthesia. It's all downhill...
- You always sneak up on your patients?
You wouldn't break the hand of a violinist before the concert.
Please, relax.
All I'm trying to tell you is that I'll have to remove your eyes completely.
I know.
- I have to replace them with new ones.
- I know. But I wanna keep the old ones.
- Why?
- Because my mother gave them to me.
What's it to you?
You can't resell them.
Whatever you say. It's your money.
Let me introduce my gorgeous assistant, Miss Van Eyck.
- This is not a lot of money.
- It's all that I could safely move.
Okay.
- What did you give me?
- Smile medicine.
Tell you what, since we go way back...
...why don't I give you my old pal discount? What do you say?
You don't remember me, do you?
- We know each other?
- Yes, we do.
From where? D.C.?
- Baltimore. The East Side.
- Baltimore? We go way back.
Solomon P. Eddie, M.D.
I was a plastic surgeon.
You remember? Specialized in burn victims, mostly women.
- I put you away.
- Yeah, you did.
You made those tapes.
They were performance pieces.
- You set your patients on fire.
- I put them out.
Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?
The future's so much more interesting than the past, don't you think?
Miss Van Eyck.
I'm afraid she's already smitten.
She only has eyes for you.
I know what you're thinking, John:
How can I do what I do now?
Let's say that I spent an awful lot of time in the prison library.
That was a great way to avoid the more unpleasant aspects of prison life.
Confinement was a real education, a real...
...eye-opener.
For true enlightenment, there's nothing quite like...
...well, let's say, taking a shower while this large fellow...
...with an attitude you can't knock down with a hammer...
...whispers in your ear, "Oh, Nancy. "
That was a lot of fun.
Thank you for putting me there...
...and giving me the opportunity to get to know myself so much better.
And now to return the favor.
- This your work?
- Yes.
I like it.
- How do you take your coffee?
- Cream and sugar.
- I don't have any cream. Sorry.
- Just sugar then.
- You and John ever come here?
- We used to.
He's not here now, is he?
I had to ask.
- I don't have any sugar either.
- Thank you.
- He hasn't tried to contact you?
- No.
Did he ever mention the name
Leo Crow?
No, but I don't talk to John much anymore.
- So you haven't seen his apartment.
- That was our apartment.
Have you been there recently?
It's full of these.
- How long has he been doping?
- Since right after we lost our son.
- You mean after he lost your son.
- It was nobody's fault.
But John was with him at the public pool.
You said in your divorce papers that John tried to kill himself.
- It wasn't a suicide attempt.
- What was it then?
The FBI found something that belonged to my son, a sandal.
John was upset. He...
He took out his gun and watched home movies.
- This is all in your statement.
- He shot a hole in the ceiling. So what?
You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
Lamar thinks you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
I left him because every time
I looked at him, I saw my son.
Every time I got close to him,
I smelled my little boy.
That's why I left him.
And now you can leave.
Don't take the bandages off for 12 hours.
If you take them off before then, you'll go blind. Understand?
In the fridge, there's milk.
Greta made you a sandwich.
Make sure you drink a lot of water.
How do I find the bathroom?
The bathroom?
Now that's your right hand.
The kitchen is your left.
Don't scratch. Never scratch!
Seeing as we're being pals, I'll give you a bonus that may come in handy.
This is a temporary paralytic enzyme.
You're gonna shoot this under your chin.
- What is this?
- It'll turn your pretty face into mush.
People won't even recognize you.
In 30 minutes, it'll tighten up again.
But it'll hurt like you've never felt.
I'm gonna put this in your goody-bag, together with your...
...leftovers.
I'm setting up a timer. When it rings, you can remove the bandages and leave.
- But not before then, or you will...
- Go blind. I know.
Don't scratch.
A little something from a mutual friend of ours.
Don 't take the bandages off for 12 hours.
If you take them off before then, you'll go blind. Understand?
- 25. 16 seconds. That's a new record.
- Is that a world record?
Is it a world record?
It's a personal best.
- Now I wanna time you.
- You gotta be kidding.
There's no way
I can beat 25. 16 seconds.
How long can a whale hold its breath?
For about 20 minutes.
- So we gotta beat the whale.
- Okay.
We gotta beat the whale.
Here you go.
It's gonna be 20 minutes. You sure you don't wanna go for an ice cream?
Because you know
I'm gonna beat that whale.
- Ready?
- Give me the count.
Three, two, one, go!
Sean?
Sean?
Sean.
Have you seen...?
I'm looking for my son. Have you seen a boy in a red bathing suit?
You seen my boy?
He's wearing a red bathing suit.
Jad, we're ready to begin thermal scan on all residences on North Powell.
You must really like me, don't you?
That's why you asked to partner with me on this sortie.
You're swell company.
It's not that you don't trust me to be alone with the chief, is it?
That you think I might, you know, futz with him?
No, I just wanna watch him use your body to sandblast another building.
Evanna, go.
I show 27 warm bodies.
Roger that. Confirmed, 27 warm bodies.
- Four spyders, one per floor?
- Let's do eight. I gotta eat.
Residents of 931 Powell, this is
Officer Fletcher of D.C. Precrime.
Under authority of P.C. section 6409, we are deploying spyders into your complex.
Mom, I'm scared.
Mommy, I'm scared. Mommy.
That's gonna scan you.
Keep your eyes open. Stay still.
- It's okay.
- I don't like it.
Stay still. Stay still.
Come on!
You stepped out on me for the last time.
I told you where I was.
You're a no-good liar.
I know you was with that ho.
You're lucky we...
Leave me alone!
We lost one.
Roger that. Maybe it was a cat jumping through a window.
It's an awful big cat.
Fletcher.
I'll go check it out.
They're crying their eyes out.
You terrified them.
Keep your kids away from me.
The big cat's back. What do you think?
A drunk, maybe can't wake up?
Or a guy who doesn't want to get read.
Folks, be quiet, go back inside.
Be quiet and close the door.
We got an ID. It's not him.
- Standing down.
- Let's eat.
Fletcher, take a look.
There's four people in this room, not three.
Four? There's Anderton, Crow and the man in sunglasses.
The man in the sunglasses is outside the window.
There's also someone here in the mirror.
Definitely female.
The Precrime program began in 2046 with a federal grant.
And now, nine years later,
D.C. is the safest city in America.
Why? Because Precrime works.
Precrime has eliminated the need for conventional detectives.
What happens now is the verification and protection of future victims.
Can we see the Pre-Cogs?
They have such a powerful gift, they're kept in peaceful seclusion...
...so as not to be distracted.
This display should give you some idea of what their daily life is like.
The Pre-Cogs get over
8 million letters every year.
That's more than Santa Claus gets.
Each Pre-Cog has their own bedroom,
TV and weight room.
It's wonderful to be a Pre-Cog.
My mom's new boyfriend came over again last night.
He's just not very intelligent.
My mom wouldn't let me eat upstairs.
I had to listen to him go on and on.
Shit!
Eye-dent: John Anderton.
Approved for entry.
- Which I told her I'd be able to do.
I'm so good at taking care of you.
But she thinks I'll be irresponsible.
It's ridiculous because...
You can't be in here.
What are you doing here?
Easy there, old-timer.
Who cleared you?
- You're not allowed here.
- Listen, Wally.
- Do I know you?
- I like you.
So I don't wanna have to kick you or hit you.
But only if you promise to help me.
Hi, John.
Who does that look like to you?
I don't know.
It's Agatha.
He's coming here to get her.
- Are these all of her previsions?
- I'm rewinding her right now.
Just take me to the Leo Crow murder.
They don't come out in any order.
I'm getting them as she's giving them.
Can you see?
- He's inside.
- He has some kind of mask on.
- He sealed the door.
- Shit!
Nobody fires a weapon inside the temple. Use bindfoam.
- Is there another way out of there?
- All the doors are covered.
John, move away from the tank.
Move away from the tank, John.
What does he want with a Pre-Cog?
So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing.
Well, there's still the other two.
The other two can still function, right?
They're a hive mind. It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
They can't see murders anymore?
Agatha, she's the key.
She's the one they listen to...
...the one with the most talent.
- She takes care of the other two.
- Jesus.
- Please bring her back.
- Every team underground, now!
- It doesn't matter. He wins.
- We'll stop him.
She's with him when he kills Crow.
She's already a part of his future.
Jad, put everything you've got into finding that room, and we stop a murder.
- How much time have we got, Gordon?
- We've got...
...51 minutes, 30 seconds.
You cold? Can you understand me?
Are you cold? The shivers, it's the drugs we gave you.
It should wear off soon.
I'm sorry. I need your help.
You contain information.
I need to know how to get at it.
Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?
- Is it now?
- What?
Is it now?
Yes, this is all happening right now.
I'm taking you some place in public...
...which means you need something else to wear.
I'm tired. I'm tired of the future.
Hello, Mr. Yakamoto, welcome back to the Gap.
How'd those assorted tank tops work out for you?
Mr. Yakamoto?
Miss Belfor, did you come back for another pair of those chammy lace-ups?
- If it's ransom, where's the damn note?
- It has nothing to do with ransom.
It has to do with the information inside of Agatha.
- He's trying to prove his innocence.
- He can't download her without support.
Your average consumer can't buy any of this stuff.
It's been assembled and scrounged from spare parts made to order.
Assuming Anderton ordered this, who put it together?
Who's Rufus T. Riley?
What's your pleasure? We got it all here: Sports fantasies...
..."Look, Ma, I can fly" fantasies...
...which covers everything from bungee jumping to flying over the Grand Canyon.
You can experience sex as a woman.
Women come in to get laid by their favorite soap star.
Or just some good, clean fun.
It's a big rush, but you come out without a heart attack.
I wanna kill my boss.
Okay.
- You got some images I can work with?
- Rufus.
Yeah, being concertmaster for the Philadelphia Symphony...
...is a popular choice.
- I wanna kill my boss.
- You sick bastard.
You make this a terrible world to live in!
Detective, nice of you to come here, seeing how every cop is looking for you.
- I need your help.
- Why'd you come here?
- I make house calls.
- I need your help with her.
Hello, honey pie.
I'm impressed. You're on the lam...
...and you still have the time to slice off a little... jerky for yourself.
- She's a Pre-Cog.
- Oh, yeah, okay.
- That's right.
- She's a Pre-Cog.
You brought a Pre-Cog here.
Jesus Christ.
- Are you reading my mind right now?
- Get up.
I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do.
I swear I didn't do that stuff I did.
She has information inside her.
I need you to get it out.
No way. I wouldn't even know where to begin.
Those thoughts about my cousin were just thoughts.
- You've been busted for felony hacking.
- So?
So I need you to hack into her.
I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
- They don't belong to anybody.
- Take her to RadioShack.
You're gonna help me.
Agatha, I need to see. I need to see what's gonna happen to me.
And then we'll go.
- She works.
- Slow it down.
How do I slow this down?
I should hit her on the head?
- Are you recording this?
- Shit.
Yeah, recording.
I know this already.
Come on. Move on.
Goodbye, Crow.
Goodbye, Crow.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
- What happened?
- I don't...
- Where's the rest of it?
- I guess that's all of it.
Where's my Minority Report?
Do I even have one?
- Do I have one?
- No.
- What?
- No.
What?
Agatha? What? What?
- Can you see?
- See what?
Anne Lively.
You want me to see who killed
Anne Lively. Are you recording this?
Yeah, but it's pouring out of her backwards.
I like my life. Everything's good.
They're inside.
Who?
All your old teammates.
Kenny, left chamber.
Alan, straight across.
Negative!
- Negative!
- Negative!
I don't deserve that.
- You are the man.
- No, you're the man.
Can you see the umbrella?
Take it.
Take it!
A man in a blue suit.
He drops his briefcase.
You see a woman in a brown dress.
She knows your face.
Turn in here.
Let's go.
- Wait.
- No, we can't stop here.
Can you see the balloon man?
Wait.
- Wait.
- What are we waiting for?
Wait. Wait.
Wait.
- Please, Mommy, can I have one?
- All right.
Wait.
Thank you.
- Anybody got an ID? Anybody?
- Negative.
Scott, Ramos, take the east end.
Everyone else, follow me. Let's go.
He knows. Don't go home.
We've got eyes on.
They're working, but they're standing on it.
Please! Please!
Have you got a quarter?
Drop some money.
Can't you put it in my hand?
May the Lord bless you.
May God take care of you.
Damn!
That's the guy.
The man in the window.
- Rooms are 95 a night.
- Mind if I look at the registry?
I mind.
How about now?
Help yourself.
He's here.
Anderton, leave.
You have a choice.
Walk away. Do it now.
I can't. I have to find out what happened in my life.
Please.
Agatha, I'm not gonna kill the man.
I don't even know him.
- What room is Crow in?
Come on.
Come on.
Wrong room.
Leave.
Leave.
Oh, God.
This is Sean.
My son.
Every day for the last six years
I've thought about only two things:
The first is what my son would look like if he were alive today...
...if I would recognize him if I saw him on the street.
And the second is what I would do to the man who took him.
You're right.
I'm not being set up.
You have to take me home.
You said so yourself.
There is no Minority Report.
I don't have an alternate future.
I am going to kill this man.
You still have a choice.
The others never saw their future.
You still have a choice.
- Leo Crow?
- Who the hell are you?
Six years ago, Baltimore...
...you grabbed a kid at Francis public pool on the West End.
Did I? I don't remember anything about that place.
Who am I? Who am I?
Do you know who I am?
- You're somebody's father.
- His name is Sean!
Sean!
I told him I was a policeman and needed his help.
It wasn't so bad. I sang him a song.
I bought him a pretzel.
He was happy. He was happy.
Is he alive?
He's alive. Where have you got him?
Is he all right?
Tell me, you fuck, where is he?!
I put him in a barrel.
I sunk him in the bay.
He floated back up. I took him out.
I was gentle. I was gentle.
I was gentle.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm so very sorry.
How could you do that to my...?
You can choose.
You can choose.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say or do can be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney...
...now and during any further questioning.
If you can't afford an attorney...
...we will appoint one.
Do you understand these rights?
You're not gonna kill me?
- Do you understand these rights?
- You're not gonna kill me?
If you don't go through with this, my family gets nothing.
You're supposed to kill me.
He said you would.
He? Who's he?
I don't know.
He called me in my cell.
He told me I'd be released if I went along, and my family would be cared for.
If you did what?
If you did what?
If I acted like I killed your kid.
Okay?
If you killed my kid?
Look, you don't kill me, my family gets nothing. Okay?
What about the pictures?
They're fake. He gave them to me.
Now, listen to me. You...
You tell me:
Who was it that set this up?
I don't know.
- Come on.
- I'm asking you again:
- Who put you up to this?
- I didn't see his face.
I tell you who, and my family gets nothing.
- Who made you do this?
- Kill me.
- You can do this. Kill me.
- Tell me.
- Kill me.
- Leo, let go of the gun.
Let go of the gun. It's okay.
Let go of the gun. That's it.
Let go of the gun.
You're not gonna kill me.
- Goodbye, Crow.
- Anderton, wait a sec...!
- Did you see it?
- Stay back!
What's happening down there?
Murder!
Murder!
Doesn't make sense.
If you were a child killer, would you leave these photos out?
Anderton might have found them.
- What kind of cop were you before this?
- Treasury agent.
This will be your first murder scene?
I worked homicide before federal.
This is an orgy of evidence.
- Know how many orgies I had as a cop?
- How many?
None.
This was all arranged.
Today we saw the first murder in the six years of the Precrime experiment.
Sadly enough, this failure was human.
The protection team simply didn't get there in time.
But the murder itself happened exactly as the Pre-Cogs predicted it would.
Today's event put a human face on the Precrime system.
Danny Witwer's on the phone.
He says it's important.
Lamar?
- What?
- There's something wrong.
We're chasing the wrong man.
I don 't wanna say over the phone.
Meet me at Anderton 's.
We recovered that from Leo Crow's hotel room.
I remember when I gave this to him, back in Baltimore.
Please, sir.
Tell me what you have.
This is the murder of a woman named Anne Lively.
John told me about this.
You got this from Containment?
Yes. This is from the twins,
Arthur and Dashiell.
Agatha's stream was missing.
This one is from the Cyber Parlor.
Anderton downloaded this directly from Agatha. Rufus Riley recorded it.
- It's the same prevision.
- Not quite.
Look at the surface wind across the water. Watch the ripples.
Moving away from shore.
Now the second image, the one from
Containment that Art and Dash saw.
Watch the water.
The wind's changed.
The ripples are moving the other way.
This murder's taking place at two different times.
Anderton was watching this right before he was tagged.
He told me about the missing data stream.
- He was concerned you might find it.
- He was right. I did.
It was inside of Agatha.
So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
Danny, just tell me what you're thinking.
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
How?
Jad told me that sometimes the Pre-Cogs see the same murder more than once.
- It's called an echo.
- Jad called it Pre-Cog deja vu.
We teach the techs to identify and disregard them.
Yeah, but what if a technician only thought he was looking at an echo?
What if he was looking at a completely different murder altogether?
I don't understand.
All you'd have to do is hire someone to kill Anne Lively...
...like a drifter, a neuroin addict, someone with nothing to lose.
Precrime stops the murder from taking place...
...haloes the killer, takes him away.
But then, right then, someone else...
...having reviewed the prevision and dressed in the same clothes...
...commits the murder in exactly the same way.
Technician takes a look, thinks he's looking at an echo, erases it.
It'd have to be someone with access to the previsions in the first place.
Someone fairly high-up.
Do you know what I hear?
Nothing.
No footsteps up the stairs.
No hovercraft out the window.
No clickety-click of little spyders.
Do you know why?
Because right now, the Pre-Cogs can't see a thing.
Can you see? It's beautiful.
- Where are we going?
- Someplace safe.
- Burgess.
- Lamar, it's Lara.
- Yes, Lara.
- You have to help him.
Is he there?
Is the Pre-Cog with him?
Keep them there. I'm on my way.
Please don't tell Danny Witwer.
I don't trust him.
I won't say a word.
You just don't let John leave, all right?
He's no killer, Lamar.
I know.
It's cold.
Lara, this is Agatha.
You remember when I would read
Tom Sawyer to you and Sean?
He got so scared when Tom and Becky were lost in the cave.
I gotta sit down.
I gotta figure this out.
I gotta figure this out.
They used Sean.
They wanted me to think
Crow killed him.
But he didn't.
He didn't.
Why would they set you up?
Because I found out about her.
About who?
- How could I not have seen this?
- Seen what?
Anne Lively.
Agatha.
Dr. Hineman once said,
"The dead don't die...
...they look on and help. "
Remember that, John.
Agatha.
Sean.
He's on the beach now...
...toe in the water.
He's asking you to come in with him.
He's been racing his mother up and down the sand.
There's so much love in this house.
He's 10 years old.
He's surrounded by animals.
He wants to be a vet.
You keep a rabbit for him, a bird and a fox.
He's in high school.
He likes to run, like his father.
He runs the two-mile and the long relay.
He's 23.
He's at a university.
He makes love to a pretty girl named Claire.
He asks her to be his wife.
He calls here and tells Lara, who cries.
He still runs...
...across the university and in the stadium, where John watches.
Oh, God. He's running so fast, just like his daddy.
He sees his daddy.
He wants to run to him.
But he's only 6 years old, and he can't do it.
And the other man is so fast.
There was so much love in this house.
I want him back so bad.
So did she.
Can't you see?
She just wanted her little girl back.
But it was too late.
Her little girl was already gone.
She's still alive.
She didn't die.
But she's not alive.
Agatha?
Just tell me...
...who killed your mother?
Who killed Anne Lively?
I'm sorry, John, but you're gonna have to run again.
- What?
- Run!
I love you.
- It's okay.
- You'll be fine with them.
- No! No!
- Stay with me. Stay with me.
- John, no.
- Don't talk.
John Anderton.
By mandate of the D.C.
Precrime Division...
...I'm placing you under arrest for the murders of Leo Crow and Danny Witwer.
That's it.
That's my girl.
I was so worried about you.
Did he hurt you?
I missed you so much.
It's okay. Wally's here.
Wally's here.
You're a part of my flock now, John.
Welcome.
It's actually kind of a rush.
They say you have visions...
...that your life flashes before your eyes...
...that all your dreams come true.
This is all my fault.
There was nothing anyone could do.
I thought you might want to have those.
I haven't worn this in years. I wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
You look great.
I knew he was having trouble for some time, yet I did nothing.
- The guy from USA Today is here.
- Tell him not now.
- He just wanted a few minutes before...
- Not now!
- I thought you were retiring.
- Well, I was.
But this incident with John made me realize the fragility of all this.
This is John's legacy as much as it is my own.
Now I have an obligation to protect that.
Lara, I know how difficult this is for you.
But maybe you can find some closure in the fact...
...that John finally found the man who killed your son.
Who's Anne Lively?
- Who?
- Anne Lively.
John was talking about her right before they took him.
I don't know who that is.
John said something about him being set up because he found out about her.
- Well, we know why John was tagged.
- He also said Crow was a fake.
And Witwer? He was killed with
John's gun inside John's apartment.
Do you know the reason why
John came here to work for you?
- Sean.
- Yes.
He came here to work for you because he thought...
...if he could just stop that kind of thing from happening...
- I understand.
- No, I don't think you do.
Sir, they wanna start the press conference in two minutes.
Lara...
...John was the best cop I ever knew...
...and, in some ways, also the best man.
But the scars he carried around...
Well, I know he'd want us to honor the good things we remember about him.
And I also know why he married you:
You're as stubborn as he is.
- Lamar...
- Do you know how to tie one of these?
Could you please give me a hand?
I'm all thumbs, as you see.
Listen, I'll tell you what I'll do.
First thing Monday,
I'll look over the Witwer evidence.
And I'll have Gideon run the Containment files...
...see if anyone drowned a woman by the name of...
What did you say her name was?
Anne Lively.
But I never said she drowned.
- Sir, the press conference is starting.
- I'll be right there.
We'll talk about this later.
Perhaps tomorrow,
I'll come by the cottage.
I'd like a word with my husband.
You're not authorized.
How did you get in here?
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, Lamar Burgess, director of the new National Precrime.
On behalf of your staff, we present you with this.
- Congratulations, sir.
- My God.
How did you get this?
I padded your expense account for six months.
Revolvers like this one were given to generals...
...at the end of the Civil War by their troops.
The cylinders were loaded with five gold-plated bullets...
...to symbolize the end of the destruction and death...
...that had ripped the country apart for five years.
Ladies and gentlemen, with Precrime going national...
...maybe we can all look forward to a time when none of us...
...will have to discharge another firearm ever again.
Now enjoy yourselves.
Enjoy yourselves! That's an order.
Does this mean we can finally use the lake house on weekends?
Hello.
Yes. Right away.
- Excuse me, so sorry.
- Excuse me.
- Sir?
- Yes.
Sir, you have an emergency call on your private line.
Yes, this is Burgess.
Hello, Lamar. I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.
You created a world without murder.
Everyone wants your name on a hat.
Can you sign these?
All you had to do was kill someone to do it.
A-room. Jad.
Jad, it's Lara. John needs a favor.
- What are you talking about?
- Agatha 's mother, Anne Lively.
Just a junkie who had a kid once and had to give her up, but surprise!
She cleaned herself up, and she wanted her daughter back.
She wanted Agatha.
Jad, you getting this? It's from the female only. No time or incident data.
It isn't the future.
It already happened.
And the problem was, without Agatha, there was no Precrime.
She's the strongest of the three.
Without Agatha, you had nothing.
You wouldn't be where you are now, standing there, signing autographs.
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing with that?
- What you up to, big man?
- Think before you send that.
Slow down.
Now you had to get rid of Anne Lively, which presented a problem:
How can you kill her without the Pre-Cogs seeing it?
Simple. Use a system you control against her.
You hired someone to kill her, knowing the Pre-Cogs would see that murder.
You lured Anne Lively out to the lake...
...with the promise of reuniting her with her daughter.
Where's my daughter?
Where?
Run!
Run!
When you were all alone, you killed her yourself...
...in the same way the Pre-Cogs predicted your John Doe would kill her.
You made the real murder look like an echo...
...knowing the tech would do what he was trained to do: Disregard it.
Anne Lively became just another missing person.
So, what are you gonna do, Lamar?
What are you gonna do?
We got a Red Ball!
Think about the lives that little girl has saved.
Think about the lives that little girl has saved.
Think of all the lives she will save.
She could have saved Sean.
Don't you ever say his name!
You used the memory of my dead son to set me up.
You used the memory of my dead son to set me up.
You knew that would drive me to murder.
- What are you gonna do now, Lamar?
- What are you gonna do now, Lamar?
- How are you gonna...?
- Shut me up?
Forgive me, John.
Forgive me, John.
Lamar.
It's over.
The question you have to ask is, what are you gonna do now?
No doubt the Pre-Cogs have already seen this.
No doubt.
You see the dilemma, don't you?
If you don't kill me, Pre-Cogs were wrong and Precrime is over.
If you do kill me, you go away...
...but it proves the system works.
Pre-Cogs were right.
So, what are you gonna do now?
What's it worth?
Just one more murder.
You'll rot in hell with a halo, but people will still believe in Precrime.
All you have to do is kill me, like they said you would.
Except...
...you know your own future...
...which means you can change it if you want to.
You still have a choice, Lamar.
Like I did.
Yes, I have a choice...
...and I made it.
Forgive me, John.
Forgive me.
Forgive me, my boy.
Lamar!
In 2054, the six-year Precrime experiment was abandoned.
All prisoners were unconditionally pardoned and released...
...although police departments kept watch on many of them for years.
Agatha and the twins...
...were transferred to an undisclosed location...
...a place where they could find relief from their gifts...
...a place where they could live out their lives in peace.
Hey, boys-
Sorry.
I came into this world out of luck... and we all know a man needs luck.
Becoming a sheriff was the first good thing to come my way- a pretty laid-back job just outside of Colby University in North Carolina... the university being the primary money tree and academic playground... for the offspring of the rich and powerful.
Nothing that required any real police work.
Mostly frat parties, noise complaints and an occasional DUl.
At least that's the way it was until
I got that call from Dean Comyn.
We've had a little trouble with one of our students here.
Overdose.
- Isn't that a medical problem?
- Her mother feels it's criminal.
I'm sure you can understand our position here.
This thing does have to be investigated.
Sensitively.
- Delicately.
- Right.
Like old Sheriff Perkins would have done.
I'm sure that when the time comes for the town council... to name a permanent replacement...
I'll be able to report what a fine job you have done as acting sheriff... for us.
You goddamned rich girls.
You think you own the world.
'Cause whenever you mess up, your daddy just writes a check.
- We didn't do anything to your daughter.
- It was an accident, Mrs. Campbell.
You think I don't know what happened?
You think I don't know what you did?
All right. That's enough.
This bitch tried to kill my daughter.
She's lying in the hospital.
She can't talk. She can't move.
She can't even open her little eyes.
Alicia's her only child, so-
- But she's acting like it's our fault.
- She was our friend.
You don't know how sorry we are.
Okay, well-
Why don't y'all just tell me... what happened.
We were having a party... and Alicia was drinking.
- She was so loaded.
- She wanted to get high.
Oops.
It's all right.
I ain't going to bust y'all.
I just want to know what went down.
Like I was saying, she wanted to do some coke.
And...
I remember hearing someone downstairs making a lot of noise.
She was jonesing, and she thought there was stuff hidden in the guest room.
She was tearing the room apart.
She couldn't find any, sol left.
What time was this?
A little before 2:00.
Okay. Go on.
The party had broken up, and Hads and I were upstairs cleaning up.
She went to bed, and I went downstairs to get something to eat.
- And I heard this- this crash.
- When?
I don't know. 2:15, maybe.
And I went into the bathroom and I found her, and-
I yelled up to Hadley to call student health.
And I tried to give her mouth-to-mouth and I tried to revive her, but-
I just- I couldn't.
Why didn't you call 911?
- We thought it would be-
- Because student health is... down the street from our house, and they have a doctor on call 24 hours.
So we thought that she would be able to get help faster.
Okay. Well, I guess I just need to take a look at the scene.
Multicolored paper.
I've seen this before.
Y'all didn't touch anything in here, did you?
- Move anything around?
- No.
What's in there?
The library-
Alicia's room.
She kind of moved in on us.
All right.
I guess I'll call y'all... if I need anything else.
All right.
I'm sorry.
We don't allow flowers in ICU.
Lead, follow or get out of the way.
These eight words will be the focus of our last semester together... and how they affect behavior patterns in the modern American society... not only macrocosmically in the so-called real world... but in the microcosm of the classroom and the university.
Field-research projects on the topic... will comprise 80 percent of your grade.
Projects to be presented orally the last week of class.
Orally?
Personally,
I do not like to swallow.
I know. It totally wears the enamel off my teeth.
I learned this new dribbling technique where you let it spill out the sides.
- I'm sorry. Can you please be quiet?
- Excuse me?
- Some of us are trying to learn.
- You will work in pairs.
Pairs?
But Professor, if the topic is... lead, follow or get out of the way, shouldn't we work in teams of three?
I'll pair you up myself, thank you.
I'm on my way out of town.
Why don't we talk about this in class.
Hadley, I really think-
I'll do my half, you do yours, then we'll meet towards the end.
But we have actual places that we need to visit together.
- And if our data doesn't corroborate-
- We'll deal with it.
- Who's that?
- Attention, Kmart shoppers.
That's the chick
Hadley got stuck with.
Cute.
Hadley, please.
We really need to talk about this.
- No, we don't.
- But, I-
- Airport.
- Yes, ma'am.
I'm interested, Hadley.
You think you've earned this job?
- I don't know.
- Well, at least you're honest.
You think I oughta give you this job?
Yeah. You're my father.
What's that supposed to mean?
I'm not running a general store in Kansas here.
This job has nothing to do with getting high and listening to music.
Come on.
Come on, Daddy.
It's time you showed initiative, accomplished something on your own.
Get your grades up.
Then we'll talk about this job.
Want me to get A's, I'll get them.
Want me to kiss your ass, I'll-
I don't have to hire you.
And to be quite honest with you...
I think you'd be better off if I didn't.
But what else would I do?
- Why are you here?
- I wanted to see her.
See her or be seen?
- Alicia's my friend.
- Don't make me laugh.
- I'm the one who called for help.
- You're the one that gave her drugs.
You're crazy.
If I ever see you near her again,
I will kill you. You understand?
Hi, Alicia.
Come on in.
So, you think you have what it takes to be a lawyer?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Well...
I have to admit, your grades are very impressive.
Thank you.
How nice of you to say.
I see you've been in the work-study program since your freshman year.
- Yes, ma'am.
- How you managing?
- I just try and work hard.
- Your parents help you out?
Well, my father's not around, so-
It's been tough for my mom, being a single mother and all.
- Tell me about it.
- You're a single mother?
I'm divorced.
It's tough on the kids.
It's been really difficult for us.
Hey, sweetie.
It's okay.
There's nothing to cry about.
- I'm sorry.
- Well,Alicia...
I don't see a reason this application shouldn't pass with flying colors.
Thank you.
As far as that financial aid goes... money is real tight for us right now.
Tell you what.
I'll look into it.
Let me see if there's anything I can do.
God. I grovelled in front of that lady for something I completely deserve.
- She made me feel like an alien.
- It's okay to bomb a little.
Oh, my God.
There he is.
Hi, Trevor.
- Hi.
- Hi,Trevor.
- Who the hell is that?
- She's nice.
What's up, crazy?
Warren, put the camera down and come here.
Where you going, baby?
Come on.
- Hey, Alicia.
- Hi.
- I know we got off on the wrong foot.
- Amongst other body parts.
But I really need to maintain my average.
And I need to get an A.
Then let's try to forget this extraneous stuff and try to work together.
I don't know if my sociology is going to go with your sociology.
Well,we can try.
Okay, but no holier than thou... no snotty remarks and no whiny “But, Hadley. “
That's enough for today.
Hey.
You're-
You're pretty good.
I have my moments.
You want to talk about Alicia?
Well?
They must not give you a lot to do around here.
I'm trying to figure out how Alicia went from being a total stranger... to being your best friend... to now lying in a hospital bed with tubes running in and out of her.
She fucking OD'd.
Had nothing to do with being my friend.
We got stuck together on this sociology project.
She kept hounding me.
I kept blowing her off, and suddenly she was outside the door at the party.
So I decided to invite her in.
Is this a joke?
We wouldn't have let you up here if this were a joke.
Oh, no. Too “white girl. “
Put it on her.
Very nice.
She cleans up real nice.
Nice job.
Lead, follow or get out of the way.
All right. what about the drugs?
None for me, thanks.
But you go right ahead.
I was talking about Alicia.
Well, in the beginning,
Alicia wasn't even into drugs.
- I'll drive.
- No, let Hadley drive.
Not that any of us were either.
- But, you know.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know.
- He was sick before he got in the car.
- Uh-huh. Get in.
Guys, my stepfather told me... if I get a job, he'll give me
$10,000 to spend however I want.
What's the point of getting a job if he's going to give you the money anyway?
- To learn the value of money.
- Oh, please!
Tell me that you see the irony in this.
You don't have to do anything. just tell me you see it.
- It's not like he's buying me a car.
- You guys are so lucky.
- Why?
- Because you're free.
- Aren't you?
- It takes money to be free.
- Speaking of which-
- Relax. It's here.
- I know I have it.
- Isn't this the turnoff to Max's?
Wait. Max Tamer?
- Private moment.
- It's in my panties.
- Your panties?
- Wait. The drug dealer?
- You saving tips from the titty bar?
- I thought it would be safe.
You know what?
I'd like to get out of the car.
Sid, your panties are hardly the Fort Knox of the undergarment world.
- Oh, and you should talk.
- Do you even wear panties?
Today.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Don't worry.
You're not doing anything illegal.
- I'm not?
- No. You're just the lookout.
Hadley, if I get caught,
I'm gonna get kicked out of school.
I'll lose my scholarship.
No law school-
Relax. This is college.
So if she wasn't into drugs, then how did she OD?
I think maybe she tried to kill herself.
In the microcosm of the classroom and university.
Field-research projects on the topic will comprise 80 percent of your grade.
- Oh, this looks like fun.
- Be nice. They're children.
Lead, follow or get out of the way.
A sociological examination... of poor kids placed in a privileged educational environment.
- What cartoons do you guys watch?
- Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network.
- Really?
- Fox Family.
- Do you guys watch the news?
- No.
- What are we going to do now?
- I Spy.
What do you want to look at?
- This?What?
- No. This.
Hey, how come you're not eating with the other kids?
They're stupid.
Dc-I look like him now?
They think they're so cool
'cause they have those boxes.
I like your lunch box.
Look at that.
I don't know.
I think yours is much cooler.
Let's see.
What do we have in here? Aha.
- Look at that.
- Wow.
Now you can get any kind of lunch box you want.
But it's our secret, okay?
- Have fun picking out your box.
- Okay.
Bye-bye.
- Thank you very much for your time.
- Thank you.
- Thank you for coming.
- We'll see you again.
- Okay.
- Bye. That was really nice of you.
Yeah, I'm really great with drunks and kids.
Instant gratification, you know?
I'll see you tonight.
Have a good day.
- Hey, Artie.
- Hey, Joanie-
Where you been hidin'?
Can you give me some background information... on some of the students that attend Colby?
Didn't anybody ever explain to you the way things work in this town?
Which derives 80% of its jobs and 90% of its revenue from this university.
Where, on occasion, the police are asked to conduct a discreet inquiry... they don't disrupt students' lives, privacy, interrupt their studies... or, as a matter of fact, talk to them at all... except at mutually agreed-upon convenient times... until it can be conclusively proven that a crime has been committed.
Which you haven't, you can't, you won't.
Why do you always have to be the center of attention?
Drunk. Butterfly.
Let's just hang out.
Do butterflies drink?
Let's just bail on Josh's tonight, okay?
How come?
'Cause I don't want to sit around and get wasted and stupid.
Oh, okay, Captain America.
Are your parents coming down for your scrimmage on Saturday?
- 'Course.
- What's their deal anyway?
They come down for everything.
- They do.
- That's what parents do.
Oh, so that's what parents do, huh?
I have to tell you something.
What?
Oh, man, you're gonna be so pissed.
What?
I got accepted into an international law program at the University of Minnesota.
You can't be serious.
Sorry, honey. I can't do it.
Daddy, I've been working hard.
I've been getting my grades up.
My friend Alicia's been helping me out with all the-
I'm really sorry, honey.
I'll make it up to you.
- Daddy, phase.
- We?! talk later. I got to go.
I was just going to drop off my notes.
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.
What's that smell?
- Lunch.
- You're cooking?
Yeah, but don't shatter your image of me too quickly.
I only do it for my father, so he can get that nice... homey feeling before he stands me up.
Let's celebrate.
Oh, yeah, baby.
Yeah. Shake it!
You are such a freak.
What's this?
- It says “Hadley?
- Open it.
Okay.
Watch the drink.
“Round trip to Rangoon. “
- Fucking Sidney.
- What does it mean?
It means we're tripping.
But I just held it for a second.
It absorbs through your skin.
But I just held it for one second.
Do I look funny to you?
Come on. just go with it.
It's okay.
- I can go with it.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
This is never, ever, ever going to be over.
And I have nothing.
It's going to be over.
I promise.
And until it is,
I'll be right here.
Promise me that you're never, ever, ever going to leave me.
I'm right here, okay?
Now I want you to think happy thoughts.
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna die.
You're not gonna die. I'm here with you, and I won't let anything happen.
- You're gonna die too.
- No, I'm not. I'm not gonna die.
No one's going to die.
Hey, Sarah.
How you doin'?
I've been better.
Now, Alicia-
She's your best friend, right?
Was.
We basically started to drift.
Everything was fine until she got the news her financial aid was turned down.
- Hi, Mrs. Campbell.
- Hi, stranger. How you doin'?
- Alicia upstairs?
- Yeah, she's up there.
I went to see her that day, and she totally had a meltdown.
After that day, we barely saw each other.
She was too busy reinventing herself with her new rich friends.
- What do you think it means?
- What did you do to her?
- Alicia!
- Hey!
- So, I guess you forgot about Sunday?
- Sunday-
- The movie?
- Oh, God. I forgot. I'm so sorry.
Do you even want to be friends anymore?
What are you talking about?
We've been friends since kindergarten.
You don't act like it.
We barely see each other.
All you do is hang out with them.
It's just you don't know them, and it's hard.
- You never invite me.
- Because you wouldn't like it.
Oh, right.
I see.
I guess it's because I don't do the right amount of heroin... or sleep with my professors or get enough abortions, right?
Is that what they're saying about us this week?
I can't believe you.
You've totally changed.
No, I haven't changed.
I'm just really happy.
What about me?
- So, are you coming?
- Yeah, I'll be right there.
Listen, don't ruin this for me, okay?
I know what I'm doing.
This is a great opportunity.
Trust me.
That's when she really stopped being my friend.
Right side! Cover it!
Excuse me, Trevor.
I need to ask you a few questions.
You're prelaw, right?
Like Alicia?
Yeah.
I'm just a little curious about y'all's relationship.
We're friends.
She's cool.
Is that how she felt?
Meaning?
Meaning is it possible that she could have thought a little bit more of you?
Just a little bit.
Alicia liked to have a good time.
We liked to hang out.
Nothing wrong with that, is there?
I wasn't trying to ignore you. You've just been so busy playing hostess.
I'm surprised you even noticed.
You and Alicia seem to be getting along very well.
You act like I don't even exist, flirt with every breathing guy.
And I dance with one girl, a friend of yours.
I'm not the bad guy here. Okay?
I'm not the one who's drooling all over Little Miss Muffett.
Well, if that's what it takes to get your attention.
- Don't turn this around on me.
- Turn what around?
You know what?
Do whatever you want.
Go fuck her for all I care.
I tried explaining to her that we were just having a little fun.
I mean, it's nothing to get weird about.
Alicia was new to the gang, and she wanted to fit in.
I helped her whenever I could.
All the best girls in town
Every time I see you you have a little frown
Go Warren, Warren, Warren
Warren, you scorin'
With all the chickies
I see that big thing is a hickey on your neck
When I stare at you you're laughin' at me
You're laughing at me that's okay because I'm free
Some call me the trick-a-dick daddy
What's wrong?
Nothin'.
Warren Z's on, he's on the mike tryin' to ride my bike
- God. MC Hammer!
- MC Hammer, MC Hammer
That's me because I'm so “hammerin”
I'm glad I found you, 'cause...
I'm feeling kind of out of place tonight.
Really?
- Me too.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
You really love Hadley, don't you?
Yeah.
I suddenly feel like
I shouldn't be here anymore.
- Why?
- Oh, come on, Trevor.
I think you fit in just fine.
- Good spit.
- I think you're really great.
- So that's as far as it went?
- That's as far as it ever went.
Well, then why is Alicia lyin' in a hospital bed?
Sometimes bad things happen to good people.
So the bartender says,
“We got a drink named after you. ”
And the grasshopper says,
“What, you got a drink named Steve?“
Oh, God! I'm so sorry.
Can I have what she's having?
- Trevor is so, so smart.
- Yeah, he's perfect.
- Are you okay?
- He thinks I'm a drunk.
He's totally crazy about you.
Yeah, for a person with a severe drinking problem.
You're a smart, beautiful girl who really doesn't believe in herself.
Why should I?
My dad doesn't. Trevor doesn't.
I do.
I know you like him.
Well, everybody likes Trevor.
I know that you think we're all wild and everything and that everything goes.
But we don't fuck each other's boyfriends. Okay?
Look, Hadley.
I've never been in this place before.
Now, all of a sudden, all these guys are dancing with me who a month ago... never knew I existed.
I owe all this to you. I would never do anything to jeopardize our friendship.
Okay?
Come here.
Gimme a hug.
Come on.
Come and dance and have fun.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come and dance.
Sorry it took so long.
- All right. All right.
- Basic party mix.
20% coke; 80% milk, sugar, baking soda, talcum powder... and assorted powdery-white crapola.
- Nothing out of the ordinary?
- Not in the least.
Except... that's not what she took.
When they wheeled her in, she still had some crusted on her nostrils.
They took a swab of that.
Pharmaceutical quality.
100% pure.
All right. Thanks, Dex.
What the fuck is your problem?
You want credit, call a loan officer.
Hold on. Hold on.
Hold, please!
Yeah. Yeah.
We got some Colombian,
Jamaican, Thai... northern lights with a skunk-five hybrid, hash, hash oil.
Think about that for one minute.
Hold, please.
- It's not mine.
- I need to ask you some questions.
- Multicolored paper, Max.
- I like to brighten up people's lives.
Did you brighten up
Alicia Campbell's life?
- I don't know anything about-
- Who gave her pharmaceutical cocaine?
- What are you talking about?
- Come on now, Max.
That shit was 100% pure.
If she didn't get it from a drug dealer, then who the fuck did she get it from?
Ask anybody. I sell a very low-quality product at a very premium price.
All right. Now you get to spend some quality time with some premium people.
Lead, follow or get out of the way.
- I'll be back later.
- Alicia, honey.
Don't you have to study?
What's the point?
Hey, it's Hadley.
Leave me a message, and I'll get back to you. Thanks.
Hey, Chief.
Something I can do for you?
I have to ask you a few questions, but could I use your bathroom first, please?
Sure.
Why don't you use the bathroom at the top of the stairs.
I'll be right down. just give me a minute.
You can't do that.
What are you looking for, anyway?
Alicia overdosed on pharmaceutical cocaine.
I need to know where it came from.
- I think you better go.
- Can I talk to you for a few minutes?
Don't you need to get a warrant or something?
- Yeah. Yeah. All right.
- Where would we even get that shit?
- That's what I'm saying. I don't know.
- And I do?
You think that Alicia's just this innocent little virgin we corrupted.
She's nothing like she seems.
Believe me, that girl was full of surprises.
Is-
Hadley's not here. Okay.
She and] Jules went to get stuff for the party, but you can hang out with me.
Okay.
Come sit.
Oh, my God.
You're watching Fame.
I totally think that all America needs is, like, this giant Fame resurgence-
- How many guys have you slept with?
- What?
How many guys have you slept with?
Well- One.
I mean, sort of.
Well, half of one.
Because when we actually did it... his thing only went in that far.
And afterwards, Sarah said,
“You're a technical virgin. “
Why? How many guys have you slept with?
- Forty-two.
- Are you serious?
Daddy number two crawled in one night when I was ten.
Not the ideal way to lose your virginity, but, hey, shit happens.
- He molested you?
- Yeah, well, poor me.
Guess that's why
I'm so fucked up. Right?
My dad did that to me too.
But I think-
Well, I know that you're a smart and beautiful girl.
See, that wasn't so bad.
Was it?
Take off your pants.
So, then, you two were a thing?
Well, that's what I thought. But little miss pisshead had plans of her own.
Trevor, give me a hand with this, will you?
They're gonna be here soon. Hurry.
I am.
Oh,Jesus Christ!
Oh, heart attack.
We were supposed to work today, remember?
But if now's not a good time, then I can come back later.
No, no, no. Stay.
Hang out for a while.
Okay.
- Alicia looks pretty hot tonight.
- Why don't you go dance with her?
So you can slink over and start dyking it up with her?
I already have.
What?
When?
- Right now.
- You bad girl.
Jesus. What, is everyone a lesbian now?
Oh, back for more.
Can you control your girlfriend?
The party's over here.
This should be good.
- I thought we had a deal, Alicia.
- I was just having fun.
A little too much fun.
We're going back to school tomorrow.
It's not due until May.
We don't have to do it tomorrow.
Besides, I'm gonna be completely hung over.
If I blew something off every time I was hung over, I'd still be in third grade.
Hadley, you just have to, like... just calm down.
I am calm.
It's just-
- What?
- It's not cool, okay?
If you want to stay up all night partying, fine.
But you're getting crazy.
You're not balancing.
Don't touch me.
Sid, hey, don't touch me.
Fuck you.
Listen, I'm not into this thing with us.
Oh, really?
You could've fooled me.
Why don't you go find Trevor?
I'm sure he's missed having to fight you off the last five minutes.
Just leave me alone, okay?
So you were upset.
Why would I be upset?
- I don't know. You tell me.
- Tell you what?
About you and Alicia.
You would never understand.
Why? 'Cause I'm a cop?
Because you're a guy.
This is how you're leaving my students alone?
- By sexually harassing them?
- What?
I know all about your little panty raid at the girls' house.
Goddamn it!
I did not touch those girls.
Possibly I didn't make it clear to you... how things work around here.
You made it clear, but I am investigating a crime.
An accident.
Slipping somebody pharmaceutical cocaine and attempted murder- those are not accidents, sir.
Maybe it's time that
I asked the town council... to start interviewing other candidates for the position of sheriff.
- How you doin', Joanie?
- Hey.
All right.
- I appreciate this.
- Anytime.
You think I'm a freak?
I did that... for five years.
Until all these white bumps... grew all over my face and body.
And when you're ready,
I can help you stop.
No one can help me.
Every time I do it,
I think it's gonna be the last.
It never is.
I'm just a big fat loser.
Fat.
You're beautiful, and you're smart.
And your dad... probably said you were fat... just like mine did.
I'm gonna get straight to the point.
The stuff Alicia was doing you can only get with a prescription.
And my father just happens to be a pharmacist.
Hey, Dad, we're having a coke party tonight... and I really wanna fry one of my friends.
Really, Pop?
You're the best.
You think Alicia's the Virgin Mary.
She's a fuckin' liar.
We were getting tired of keeping track of her.
- You won't believe what just happened.
- Want to celebrate?
- I don't know.
- Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.
- It seems like an awful lot.
- Max's shit... you have to do a whole gram in each nostril to even get a buzz.
We are celebrating here, aren't we?
We most certainly are.
Here she goes.
Hello. Oh, yeah, she's right here. Hold on.
- Alicia, here.
- Hello?
Hi! How are you?
I'm fine. Okay.
No. Oh, my God.
I am so beyond excited.
Yes! Totally excited.
Thank you so much.
All right.
I'll see you later.
Bye.
Hey, what's up, Alicia?
Then she took off again.
So you don't know who it was or what it was about?
Just that it was a guy.
Didn't sound like anyone I knew.
But after she talked to him, she disappeared for a few days.
That last night, she shows up at our party totally wasted.
Hey, you guys.
Look.
What a tart.
I'm going to help Hads.
Hold this.
Oh, shit.
I don't know.
You think we should tell Jules?
Not until we got something to tell.
Let's go.
- She's not worth it.
- How am I gonna have fun with her here?
Hey!
Oh, Mes. guess what we 'just-
She is so unbelievable.
- I knew she-
- Whatever.
Alicia, I'm not really comfortable with this.
Here, let me make it easy on you.
Hadley slept with Warren, you know.
- Really?
- Yeah.
All your bullshit about Alicia and me, and you fucked Warren?
Come on. Let's talk about this alone, okay?
No, not if you were the last person on earth.
Should've told him.
Where's Alicia?
All that time, we thought it was Trevor she was after... but apparently she had her eye on Warren.
And you forgave her for that?
No. As a matter of fact,
I didn't.
Well, you realize that's a motive.
Really?
Then why didn't I try to kill Hadley?
She fucked him too.
I mean, if I went after every girl Warren fucked... you'd have a campus littered with dead bodies.
You usually get a lot of college kids in here?
Are you kidding?
The way these kids drink...
I'm making a fortune just off the fucking tips.
But we ca rd everybody.
They got to have two pieces of I.D.
I don't serve underage in here.
Did you hear what happened to Alicia Campbell?
Yeah. She was in here a couple of nights before it happened.
I threw her out. She and this blond chick were having a pier six brawl.
Blond chick? She's about 5'6“, splint on her arm?
Yeah, that sounds about right.
- Do you know why they were fighting?
- It sounded like a guy.
Take it outside!
Outside!
You don't remember what they were fighting about?
You remember hearing any names?
Warren? Trevor?
No. I told you, just some guy.
All right.
All people are affected by their external circumstances... and one uses the gifts one is given... to bargain and negotiate for a place in society.
Was that okay, Warren?
Was that okay?
Was that okay, Warren?
Was that okay?
To blend in and follow.
Was that okay, Warren?
Was that okay?
- Should I do that again?
- This ain't really your style, is it?
You go to school, and every once in a while... they actually want you to hand something in.
“Lead, Follow, or Get Out of the Way:
A Sociological Examination of Poor Children...
Placed in a Privileged
Educational Environment... and Rich Kids Thrust into the Deprived Students' World. “
After an initial period of rebellion... the poor student discovers his success in the rich kids' environment... comes from his ability to blend in, to follow.
The old man who lived in the old house... he jumped on his house and knocked it down.
But what about the rest of the children, the ones caught in the middle?
Like the middle class they will grow up to be... they simply don't want to get involved.
They don't want to be bothered.
They're simply content to get out of the way.
I said it.
Okay. Okay, I get it.
So Alicia is the poor kid, right... who was allowed to hang out, play with rich kids.
They didn't want her to lead.
She didn't want to follow.
So someone had to get her out of the way.
You need a vacation.
So how'd it feel, Warren, huh?
Fucking Hadley- was it worth all the problems that it caused?
Are you kidding?
It let me fulfill a fantasy.
Hadley got the best boning of her life. Sid got to watch.
- Where does Alicia fit into all this?
- She didn't... other than telling Jules and Trevor about it.
Why did Alicia tell... if Sidney was the one who saw it?
If I gave a shit and was willing to think about it, I'd say it's because...
Alicia had more to gain.
You're really fucking paranoid.
I'm paranoid?
You're a smart and beautiful girl who really doesn't believe in herself
Hi, honey. I'm really sorry about your birthday... but I'm having a meeting in Atlanta tomorrow.
I could come down early and meet you for dinner tonight.
Say, 7:30, the Lawrence ville Inn.
Bye-bye.
Message deleted.
- Hi. Mr. Ashton?
- Yes.
I'm Alicia Campbell, a friend of Hadley's.
I'm so glad you could join us.
Where is Hadley?
She's not coming.
She's finishing up an interview for our soc project, sir.
- But I didn't give her your message.
- Excuse me?
The discipline you've enforced on her is working so well, sir.
And because she's studying and she's working hard and not drinking so much- and I know it's not my place to get involved, but if she saw you now... she would just lose complete focus.
Really.
- Are you sure?
- I am, sir.
Have a seat.
Would you like a cocktail or a glass of wine?
I'll have... a club soda.
Club soda.
I'll have another one.
You know, you really might be a good influence on her.
You really might be a good influence on her.
Multicolored paper.
You really might be a good influence on her.
Pressure!
- It's falling. We're losing her.
- Please get out of here.
Come on, come on.
You have to leave. Let's go.
We got a flat line!
Asystolic!
Code blue!
We were able to stabilize her, and we'll continue to watch her through the night.
There's not much more we can do right now, Mrs. Campbell.
You should go home and get some rest.
I'm sure you can understand our position here.
This thing does have to be investigated.
Sensitively.
Delicately.
You think that Alicia's just this little innocent virgin we corrupted.
She's nothing like she seems.
You think Alicia's the Virgin Mary.
She's a fucking liar.
When they wheeled her in, she still had some crusted on her nostrils.
They took a swab of that.
Pharmaceutical quality.
100% pure.
I'm just trying to figure out how Alicia went from being a total stranger... to being your best friend... to now lying in the hospital with tubes running in and out of her.
Sometimes bad things happen to good people.
Sometimes you gotta do what's right...
'cause you can't not.
It may cost me my job, but there's no way Alicia knew what she was taking.
Come on now, man.
Do the right thing.
All I know is there was some pretty weird shit in the air that night.
Hadley and I weren't getting along, and I was sick of getting wasted.
Nice spit to the beat box.
Nice spit to the beat box.
I'm feeling really out of place here tonight.
I know.
Me too.
I had a lot of fun dancing with you.
- You just gotta be careful.
- What do you mean?
You just have to be careful and watch out.
Stay sweet.
See, Hadley didn't like it if she wasn't the center of attention.
Hey, Hadley.
You're not walking so good.
Hey, Trevor.
- Watch this.
- Where you goin'?
- What are you doing?
- You're a nut.
Miss Hadley.
- Where are you going?
- Hadley!
You've had a very severe concussion.
We'll have to keep you to run some tests.
No, I'm not staying here.
Yes, you are.
If there's anything I can do for you while you're here...
- give a holler.
- Is everything okay?
That's all I know.
All right. Look alive.
I'm gonna need this from you- an inventory from the hospital.
Give me the name of the orderly that was on duty the day Hadley was there.
Petey, I'm gonna need a lab test, search warrant.
Thank you for joining us in this candlelight vigil... in honor of our close friend... and fellow student...
Alicia Campbell.
As you all know,
Alicia had a setback last night... and needs our hopes and prayers.
Please take a moment to ask for her recovery... so she can once again return to us here at Colby.
Hi, Artie.
Good to see you.
Hey, Rhoda... were you on call the night Hadley was admitted?
No, but I was there the next day when Alicia came.
You working on the soc project?
God, when did you get so anal?
When you started slacking off.
I just have a lot on my plate.
Right. Drinking like a fish, doing drugs, going through people's drawers.
Daddy!
I heard you finally found something harder than your head.
- How's my little girl?
- Good.
Really?
- Hi. Nice to see you.
- It's nice to see you again.
There's something
I've been meaning to ask you.
- Let me walk you out.
- Okay.
Bye, Hadley.
Bye, Alicia.
Girls and their dads.
All right.
Thank you, Rhoda.
Sure.
May 26.
Graduation day at Colby University- the awarding of an academic degree.
Today, 345 students will be advancing.
One will not.
While the one left behind lies in a hospital bed alone... her friends and colleagues celebrate with their loved ones.
They came to Colby as young, unformed minds... in search of truth and knowledge.
As they leave, the real world awaits... filled with hopes, dreams... opportunity and me.
Sorry, y'all.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
All right.
There they go right there.
Excuse me, y'all.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me. Watch out, y'all.
Comin' through.
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Hadley Ashton, you're under arrest.
I will not have you harassing my students.
They stopped being your students
12 minutes ago. Please come with me.
You have the right to remain silent.
Excuse me, y'all. Sorry.
- Dad?
- Right behind you.
I kept looking at that splint on your arm.
Trevor told me about your fall.
You were in the hospital, Hadley.
The day nurse remembers Alicia's visit.
- Let me walk you out.
- Okay.
Bye, Hadley.
I've been thinking about what we talked about the other day.
- I'd really like to help you.
- Really?
Yes. How'd you like to come work for me?
Gosh.
Well, what I really want to do is go to law school.
Really?
Where have you applied?
Baxter, Yale, Penn.
Well, I can't help you there, but I am on the board at Stanford.
Really?
Yeah, that's great... but it won't help me with the financial aid.
- Wait a minute.
You can clerk in our legal department during the summers... and in exchange, we'll pay your tuition.
- How's that?
- Oh, my God.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
- Thank you so much.
- It's okay.
It's just my way of saying thank you... for you keeping an eye on my daughter.
And when you graduate... we get first shot at you.
- Thank you.
- Sure.
You're giving her a job?
A total fucking stranger!
You're doing everything for her, but you won't hire me... your own flesh and blood, your own fucking daughter!
- This has nothing to do with you.
- She's a lying fucking...
- manipulating, two-faced bitch!
- Hadley, stop it!
There's a motive, Hadley.
Alicia went after everything you had... everything you valued.
It's about my daughter.
It was your father on the phone with Alicia that day.
You pick up this phone and you tell her it was a mistake.
I'm not gonna give somebody something and then take it away from them.
- I'm not gonna go back on my word.
- No! You tell her!
- Calm down.
- No. It's over.
Tell her.
- Hello?
- Can I speak with Alicia, please?
- Alicia.
- Yeah.
Hello?
Hi. How are you?
Remember what we talked about earlier?
Hadley would like to congratulate you.
Wouldn't you, Hadley?
Hey, Alicia.
Congratulations.
Oh, my God!
I am so beyond excited.
Thank you so much.
What's up, Alicia?
We'll keep you here for a while.
If there's anything I can do for you, just give a holler.
See, Trevor saw the orderly hit on you.
- He was easy, wasn't? he?
- Did you get it?
- I could lose my job for this.
- It'll be worth it.
The night you left the hospital, you called Alicia... and met her at the Cilver Bullet.
The whole bar saw you.
- Everybody heard you.
- Don't walk away from me!
- Nobody uses me to get to my father.
- I'm not!
- You're supposed to be my friend.
- I am your friend.
- No! You no longer exist.
- Hadley! Hadley, don't leave me!
You wanted her out of your life, but you knew she'd show up at the party.
I heard her with her dad, and I saw her with this vial...
- Sidney finally told the truth.
- but I didn't know what it was.
She heard you call your father.
She saw you put the coke in Max's paper.
Daddy, come by for breakfast before you go to the airport.
Call me and let me know.
Bye.
Just you, me and your little strung-out protege.
- Have you seen my lighter?
- No.
Hurry up.
Go get dressed.
Whatever your intent, you put the coke where you knew she'd find it.
April Fools', bitch.
I heard this crash.
- Julianne tried to save her.
- And I found her.
Alicia's OD'd!
Call 911! Hurry!
And I called out to Hadley to call student health... and I tried to give her mouth-to-mouth...
- and I tried to revive her, but-
- Two! Hadley, where are they?
Why didn't you call 911?
We thought that-
Because student health is right down the street... and they have a doctor on call 24 hours.
Why aren't they here yet?
- She'll be fine.
- She won't come to.
Where's the phone?
Oh, shit.
Fuck!
You did it all?
Oh, my God.
You were smart enough to switch the packets...
- It's your basic party mix.
- But you forgot...
- and left the real one in your robe.
- That's not what she took.
- I'm gonna call 91 I.
- No, I already called student health.
If you call 911, it'll get the police involved.
Lawrence ville emergency.
We can't just wait for them.
She could die!
Keep doing the CPR.
91 I recorded your call at 2:23.
The call to student health was six minutes later.
Whether you intended to kill her or not... you created the circumstances that put someone at risk.
Once my father realizes you're not perfect-
What's the matter?
Are you jealous?
You're really fucking paranoid.
I'm paranoid?
That's really funny.
Meaning?
No, you know what?
I really don't wanna hear your twisted little take on my life.
Don't ever condescend to me again.
Student health?
I am not your little windup doll, like Sid or Julianne.
Oh, my God.
We've had a horrible accident.
Why don't you go away?
You want me to leave?
You're nothing but a poor little rich girl... who never got enough love from her father.
Never thinking a significant thought, just pretty enough to get by... by screwing around on her fucking boyfriend.
You know what?
I'll forgive you for that... because I assume that you just don't know any better... because you come from trailer park trash.
Or is it the booze talking?
But you know what I think?
You need to get the fuck out of here.
I'm shaking.
- How's she doing?
- I think she's stopped breathing!
Hadley! Where are they?
Come on. Don't die.
Come on, Alicia.
Don't die!
Five, six.
Sorry.
Thank you.
I understand you have something you want to say to me.
Was that okay, Warren?
Was that okay?
No, man, I'm just saying'-- I'm sayin' if-- if you own the beach property, right...
- Mm-hmm?
- Do you own, like, the sand and the water?
Nobody owns the water.
God owns-- It's God's water.
What if someone walks onto your beach, right?
Let's say if you do own it.
No, man, you don't own the beach.
- What you own is sand on the beach, man.
- Here. Here, man.
What if there's a naked girl on the beach?
That girl's not yours.
You don't own the girl.
What if she breaks her foot on your property?
She could sue me.
Sue me! Sue me!
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
- Holy shit!
Ditch it, man! Ditch it!
- Dude, can you eat it?
- The whole bag?
Fuck it!
Hey, Mike, um, while you're at it...
- Those are 'shrooms, dude!
- Come on, man, just eat it!
Mike, uh..
- I hate to ask, but, uh... for the team?
- I can't eat that!
- No! Throw it out the window!
- Okay! Okay! Okay!
All right, I'm doin' a drop.
- I'm goin' for a drop.
- Just opening the window.
- It's gone. It's gone.
- We're cool. It's cool.
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
We're dead!
All right, all right.
Windows down! Windows down!
Windows down! Put the windows down!
All right, we're cool.
We're cool.
God, did you see that?
It must have been, like, a double homicide or something fuckin' cool.
- We was freakin' out for nothing.
- Man, I almost had a heart attack.
Mike, you didn't eat both those bags, did you?
Come and get it.
You must have eaten, like, a hundred bucks worth of pot...

- Who's the man?
So, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna need
130 buck, you know... whenever you get a chance.

Is that the same car, man?

Yeah, it is.

Canada, huh?
Almost made it.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, sure.
- Yes, sir?
- Yes, sir.
- Now, did you say, "Yes, sir"?
- I think he said, "Yeah, sure."
- What'd you say, man?
- Well, I said, "Yeah, sure"... but what- literally, what
I said was, "Yeah, sure, sir."
- So you are okay then?
- Yes, sir.
- You smell somethin', Rabbit?
- Fear.
Now hand over that registration.
Yes, sir.
My mother's gonna kill me.
Holy shit. This is- This is- This is-
Don't look. Don't look.

Am I fucked up or is this fucked up, man?
This shit is fuckin' crazy.
Shit, man. I was just about to pull out my nine... and put a cap in that pig's ass.
Oh, fuck!
Oh, my God!
Shit!

- Fuckin' pig!
Mother of God.
Whoo!
Radio, we're in high-speed pursuit of a white Miata headin' southbound on Route 294.
Unit 91, come in, 91
Unit 91, come in, 91.
What are you doing out there, 91?
Quit counting your pubes.
We got a hell-raiser in a white Miata.
Ninety-one, are you there?
Ninety-one?
Ninety-one, are you there?
Hey, good-lookin'.
You catch any speeders today?
- Whoo!
- What the fuck!
Let's go, 91.
Rabbit, get that gun out!
Aw, Mac, you fucker!
Greetings.
- You guys are too slow.
- You killed my dummy.
Mac, now I'm gonna pay you. But I shouldn't,
'Cause I knew it was you the whole time.
Thorny, don't lie in front of the rookie.
It sets a bad example.
- Foster, where are your shoes?
- What, are you the shoe police now?
I am, and you owe me
20 laps around the bar. Let's go.
- Your black magic only works on the rookie.
- That's brown magic.
- Pay up.
- When do I get to do that?
You'll get your chance,
Rook. Shots?
- Yeah.
- That's a lot of booze.
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
- I'm impressed.
Jesus!
Sorry, boys, you're on duty.
- On your tab, Officer Womack?
- Rookie, pay the lady.
- Pay her.
- Unit 23. Come in, 23.
Unit 23. Come in, 23.
Do you need me out there?
Do you need my assistance?
- Shut up, Farva.
- I can be there--
Listen, we got the Miata.
We're okay.
What about those expert you picked up?
Do you need my assistance?
The snozberries taste like snozberries.
- Oh, shit!
- He killed the cops!
- Get out of the car, man!
- This is a cop car!
- Hello.
- You boys like Mexico?
Yeeeee-hoooooo!
One, two, three, do it!
Oh, go, girlfriend
I'm your mother.
Come on, Thorny. You're losing to the rookie.
It's embarrassing.
Come on, Rabbit.
You can do it.
Oh, Rabbit, he's killing you.
I got Thorny in front by a lot.
What's the matter, your mama didn't teach you how to chug?
Come on, Thorn
Come on, Thorn.
- Ohh!
- Goddamn it.
I am all that is man.
- Every time.
- Finish it up.
See, there you have it.
You're doing it all wrong.
Open your throat, relax the jaw.
Don't forget to cup the ball
You're never gonna win... with those thin little bird lips you got there.
This guy's got these big old powerful lips.
Am I correct, Thorn?
So much of my authority is derived from the power right here.
Hey, guys.
Wow.
- Uh, do you have any more syrup?
- Sorry, Urs.
Why couldn't they chug ketchup?
It's a good thing you didn't order hash browns.
I mean, if they had been chugging the ketchup.
You get the score of that
Red Sox game last night?
- I turned it off just after--
- Ah, waiter. There you are.
I will have the enchilada platter with two tacos and no guacamole.
- Smy?
- Yeah, Chief, I'll take a chinchilla.
I don't get it. Tacos?
They think I'm Mexican.
You're not Mexican?
Another highway cop?
What, are you guys multiplying?
Yeah, if they can figure which hole to stick it in.
Ah, what the fuck?
- Hey, I saw that!
- Sit down, Rando.
That's it!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
All right, all right!
- Cut it out, you turkeys!
- He fuckin' started it!
I'm sorry, Bruce. These boys get that syrup in them... they get a little antsy in their pantsy.
You just can't keep them under control.
You should keep these dogs on a leash, John.
Let's go.
♪ A-number one top gun cadets ♪
♪ In the name of justice
John Q. Public can trust us ♪
♪ Hail to thee dear old Paroon ♪♪
- Hail to thee!
- Hail to thee!
- Hail to thee!
- Hey, all right!
Hey, what's up, bone diddlies?
Did I miss the song?
Sing it again, rookie bitch.
Farva.
- Forgot the coffee.
- My bad, Cap.
All right, all right.
Let's get started.
I got the latest shit list, gentlemen.
It's down to Flagstone
Deer Lick and us.
And if we keep up these low numbers, you can bet your sweet butts... we're gonna get the big, ugly ax.
- Who'll bust heads on the highway?
- The goddamn local cops!
And you better believe that Grady and his goons... have got a copy of this list, so we need to step it up.
Who wants cream?
Nobody? Okay, no cream.
Foster, how many tickets did you issue last week?
Uh, I don't have my figures here in front of me.
Three.
- I can't make 'em speed.
- Try hidin'.
And grow a goddamn moustache, why don't ya?
I haven't shaved in two weeks.
- I'm growin' mine.
- Oh, you're growin' yours, are ya?
I'll tell you when it's time to grow a moustache.
Coffee's served!
Oh, no! That's Rabbit's.
That's Rabbit's.
- I get it. It's Rabbit's.
- Oh, look, a bar of soap.
Oh, shit!
I got you good, you fucker!
- Awesome prank, Farva.
- Better than the crap you pull, Mac.
- Look, fellas...
- Bite it, Rook. Make him look like a dick.
Every Thursday night I walk into the Lodge to play Hearts... and they always have my
Old-Fashioned just waiting there.
- I like that.
- Bite it. Bite--
Oh, hell!
Give me the goddamn soap!
We got 50 miles of highway.
That stretch of highway is ours.
I'll be damned if I'll let Grady and those buttheads get their hands on it!
Thorny, you're the ranking officer here.
Let's do your jobs and keep this place open, huh? Let's do it. Farva!
Your suspension continues.
Hit the radio.
Oh, yes.
Oh. Oh, local smokeys on our turf.
All right, hit it.
See, that's what O'Hagan was talking about.
Hi. You guys forget what color your car is?
- Bye-bye.
- Later, dude.
All right, how about "Cat Game"?
- Cat Game? What's, uh, what's the record?
- Thorny did six...
- but I think you can do ten.
- Ten?
Starting right meow?
- Uh, sorry about that.
- All right, meow... hand over your license and registration.
- Your registration? Hurry up meow.
- Oh.
Sorry.
There somethin' funny here, boy?
No, no, no.
Well, then, why you laughing,
Mr. Larry Johnson?
- All right meow, where were we?
- Are you saying "meow"?
Am I saying "meow"?
- I-I-I thought--
- Don't think, boy.
Meow, do you know how fast you were going?
Meow, what is so damn funny?
I could have sworn you said "meow."
Do I look like a cat to you, boy?
Am I jumping around all nimbly-bimbly from tree to tree?
- No. No.
- Am I drinkin' milk from a saucer?
- No.
- Do you see me eatin' mice?
Now you stop laughin' right meow.
Yes, sir.
Meow, I'm gonna have to give you a ticket on this one.
- But--
- No "buts" meow. That's the law.
It's not so funny meow, is it?
Meow!
Ooo-wee-ooh!
Thanks for washing my car, Rook.
- You know what this is?
- A chamois cloth?
Ha! Luck guess.
I just lost a buck... to myself.
- Think that's funny, do you?
- Yeah, I do.
Also heard something funny about how you got suspended.
Something about a school bus full of kids?
Oh, you heard that, did ya? Let me tell you another funny story, New Jack.
Back in '74... the great Charlie Rich was named Country Musician of the Year.
Then in '75, he had to hand the award off to the new one.
And you know who that was?
Mr. "Sunshine on My Goddamn Shoulders,"
John Denver.
- Really?
- Yeah. Can you believe it?
- Wow!
- Replaced by John Fuckin' Denver.
- Amazing.
- Yeah.
Well, I'll be damaged if Mr. Rich didn't pull out his cigarette lighter... and light that award on fire in front of everyone.
Do you get it?
So you're saying you'll set my Country Music Award on fire?
I'm saying when my suspension's up, you better watch your ass.
Or you’ll light my ass on fire?
- You wanna go? You wanna take one?
- Make your first move.
Hey! I hate to break up the honk convention, but we got a 10-92.
- You wanna take this one, Rod?
- Hell, yeah!
I bet you do-- Ohh!
Nice wax-job, Rook.
- Thank you, sir.
- You--
What the hell is this?
We got local pigs runnin' around?
How'd the locals beat us here?
We're, like, ten miles out.
- Look at this chump.
- Oh, Mr. Tough Guy here.
Take a walk, bud take a walk.
Holy shit!
It's a cool Winnebago.
My Uncle Denny used to have one just like this.
Rabbit, put your game face on.
You got it, boss.
- Hey, what the fuck?
- Oh-oh!
Oh, yes.
- Oh, man! What happened here?
- Take a walk, sonny.
This investigation is already under control.
Well, now it is.
- Hey!
- Don't touch the crime scene, rodent!
Rabbit. Hey, look at that.
Johnny Chimpo.
- Quit slappin' me.
- Would you stop touching my rookie, Grady?
Hey, I'll touch you.
This is the Spurbury Police.
Put your hands up and come outta there!
Get the fuck out of here!
- Glamor pet. No dice Get your tape.
- Okay. Let's cruise.
- Sounds like y'all have a hog problem.
- Oh, watch it, Mac.
Mac, I'm serious.
Be careful, Mac. He's angry.
- He's angry? Well, hello.
- Hey, mark it off.
- Smy, you mark it off.
- Back it up, Grady. I'm serious.
What's the point? Didn't you guys get shut down already?
Oh, yeah, that's next week.
Your bust. You know there's a dead chick in there?
Move it, Ramashit!
- Take it up with O'Hagan!
- Fight, fight, fight!
- Ow! My arm!
- Mac!
Get off of me!
Get off!
I'll give you the fat guy for Foster and, uh... how about that stupid guy for Rabbit?
Well, you're gonna have to be more specific.
They're both kinda fat and stupid.
Get these damn handcuffs off now, Ramathorn!
- Cut him loose.
- Go ahead, Smy.
You want to tell me what bug crawled up your big ass, Grady?
Yeah, I will tell you.
This is our crime scene.
We are takin' it.
- It's highway. It's our jurisdiction.
- No. No.
This highway is closed.
This is our jurisdiction.
Aw, fuck it.
You deal with the hog.
Hey, Chief.
What in hell's gotten into you guys?
I told you to be good.
I told you this was a bad time.
But you go ahead and get into a battle royale with the locals at a crime scene.
- But they started that fight.
- Of course they started the fight!
Now they've taken a jurisdictional grievance against us.
They want us to blow i
I mean, a murder on the highway... and you give them the investigation.
Christ! We look like a bunch of pussies.
All right, come on out, Rabbit.
I guess I just go take a shower then, huh?
Ow!
Strike three!
You're out of there!
All right, good cut, Ritchie.
Good cut. Come on.
Next batter! Batter up!
Next batter! Let's go.
But, Thorn, if they do shut you down... maybe you could
Stick around here?
I don't know, get a different job?
You can always come work in my shop.
Yeah, retired cop goes to work for his hippie girlfriend... in her head shop.
Too sitcom.
Okay. You better pay attention, Coach. Our son's up.
All right, Arlo.
Watch the ball. Get a hit.
You got it.
- Let's do it.
- All right, Arlo.
Whoa!
- Hey, you gotta keep on your toes.
- Do somethin' about that, ref.
Sorry-ass local cops.
You think you have a nice relationship with someone... based on professional courtesy and mutual boredom.
The next thing you know, they're trying to take you out.
What? What?
I don't wanna get transferred.
Have to go be a rookie again with a bunch of random dudes.
Don't worry about it.
If it happens, we'll, uh, we'll all just stay here, open up a roller disco.
Throw him the heat.
Bring it on.
Uh, anybody want a corn dog?
See if they got any chocolate bananas. Foster?
Ohh!
Hey, Charlie's Angel.
Hey, congratulations. You're the one millionth person to say that to me.
- Oh. What do I win?
- Ooh. Um...
Ahh. There you go.
Hope I don't get brain freeze.
I'm not sure you've got the required equipment.
So, listen, I, um, had a really good time at that Winnebago fight.
Maybe, uh, I don't know, we could do it again sometime.
All right, all right.
Fair is fair.
You can slug me back if you want to.
- Really? Okay.
- Yeah.
Hold my snow cone.
- Okay.
- Heads up!
Hey, what happened over there?
What? Wh- Why?
How about a little pep, hmm?
From those guys over there.
Assholes.
You want to move that, buddy. Now!
So, about my field time.
Yeah, yeah. I've been thinkin' a lot about that.
I think I might be able to talk to Grady for you.
- Pink stick, eat it or lose it.
- Hey, shut your pie hole, buddy.
I mean, because I'm ready to go out on patrol.
I'm goin' nuts being on the radio all the time.
I'd like to get some field work.
Yeah? Why don't you take your radio and go stand in a field.
Move that gigantic cotton candy!
Goddamn it! How's the view from sugar heaven, bitch?
Hi. I'm looking for Chief Grady.
I have some files for him.
Grady's not here.
I'll take the file.
It's kind of important.
How about Officer Rando?
Nope.
What do you need?
I'm the only one here?
There are no male officers around?
Just give me the file.
What's this?
So you originally from Vermont or, uh, or what?
You know, you've got a lot of courage walkin' into the lion's den.
- Oh, I got brass buns.
- Mm. You should join the band.
What are your cells, eight by eight?
Ours are nine by nine.
No big deal.
Listen, you seem like a really nice guy, but I just don't date cops.
I'm not much of a cop, really.
More like a civilian trapped in a cop's body.
Oh. Well, I hear you can get an operation for that.
But then,
I guess you'd miss out... on all those wack things you highway guys do.
Yeah, those stories about us are mostly lies, really.
Except for the one about how we pulled over AC/DC's bus... and then they flew us down to Jamaica to party with them; that one's true.
But, yeah, other than that it's pretty boring out there.
Yeah, well,
I wouldn't know.
All right, it's probably time for you to get out of here.
- I don't want to get fired too.
- Oh, I'm not getting fired.
I'm gettin' shut down.
That's a big difference.
- In our cells, the door is over here.
- Right.
A couple of hyenas.
Well, you know, they are speeding.
- Come in, Radio.
- Don't call me Radio, Unit 91.
Then don't call me Unit 91, Radio.
- Are you done?
- Yeah, okay, Radio.
We got a suspicious vehicle.
White Caprice, Vermont plates.
Tijuana-Gringo-Oner-Fiver-Zero.
- Roger. Checking.
- Thank you, Radio.
Unit 91, that license plate belongs to a local Spurbury police vehicle.
It does? Oh, my God!
- Very funny, 91.
- Thank you, Radio.
Whoa! Looks like that truck's planning on skipping the weigh-in.
Yeah, well, you don't weigh in, you don't wrestle.
Whoa! What's this jack-off doin' trying to pull him over?
There's no fuckin' way that is happenin'.
- What the hell's he doin'?
- I got somethin'.
Yeah. That's right, doofu.
Move it along.
You, uh, wanna do "Repeat"?
Do you wanna do "Repeat"?
No. I've been thinking a lot about what the Captain said.
I'd like to play it straight this time, okay?
Okay.
- For O'Hagan.
- For O'Hagan.
Good morning.
Would you mind stepping down from there with your license and registration?
- Sure. I was just--
- Good morning.
Would you mind stepping down from there with your license and registration?
- Yeah. No problem.
- Excuse me one second. No.
Excuse me one second.
No.
Did, uh, I do something wrong, officers... because I know
I wasn't speeding.
- Why didn't you weigh in?
- Yeah, why didn't you weigh in?
Did I miss that weigh station?
They got me runnin' so many miles...
I Just must have dazed out and well--
I'll pull into the next one and get weighed, okay?
What are you pulling back there?
Well, uh, mostly just soap, I think.
Why don't we take a look?
Listen, Officers, I'm on a really tight schedule. I really need to--
Let's go, Mr. Galikanokus.
Well, you heard him.
Let's go, Mr...
Mr. Galonukum.
Hop on up.
Okay-silly-dilly-dokey-o.
I'm an idiot.
Yeah, that's true.
Sorry about the light there.
I have a flashlight in the cab.
- Hey! Mr. Galikanokus!
- Whoa!
Mr. Galikanokus!
- We should have seen that comin'.
- We should have seen that comin'.
- It is time to stop now, Mac.
- It is... time to stop now, Mac?
And that was the second time I got crapped.
- Awesome.
- Afternoon.
- Hey.
- Hey.
It stinks like sex in here.
What happened?
We got a little distracted by somebody doin' the "Repeater."
- Huh. That'll happen.
- That will happen.
Well, you did it this time.
Fishin' your car out of
Lake Leblanc right now.
Oh, man.
Nah, we just parked it across the street.
All right, listen. Next time this kind of thing happens...
I want you to stop, take a deep breath... and pull your heads out of each other's asses, would ya?
Language.
It's easy for you to say.
He's got a tiny little head.
Yeah. What's this guy movin'?
Soap, I think.
Reefer.
Whoo-hoo!
That's one stinky pyramid.
We should've built a stinky igloo and climb in.
That's a lot of pot.
Thinkin' back to your tour days with the Dead, Rabbit?
- Better lock this shit up, huh, buddy?
- What are you talkin' about?
Enhance.
Enhance. Enhance.
Just print the damn thing!
All right, what do we know about this Galikanokus guy?
It's a fake name, fake license.
- Bunty Soap?
- Fake soap company.
- What, plastic fake? Decorative fake? What?
- No, like they don't exist.
So, we got 150 kilos of marijuana and no arrests. We got nothin'.
I got a theory, Cap.
These, uh, bales of pot, they have that red Johnny Chimpo sticker on them.
And that dead woman in the Winnebago had the same logo tattooed on her back.
See, a lot of drug dealers use stickers to mark their products. Like a brand name.
See! Where'd you learn that,
Cheech? Drug school?
Shut up, Farva.
Did that bag you pulled off those college kids have that sticker?
Um...
I don't believe it did.
- Was there any marijuana on that Winnebago?
- Nope.
A monkey tattoo.
Sounds kinda flimsy.
What's the significance of this John Chimpo fella?
Uh, well, you know those really cheap Japanese Cartoons?
No? This is basically a cheaper Afghani knockoff.
It's this monkey that basically travels around the world... uh, doing nasty things.
His butler tries to keep him in line, but, uh-- No.
It's really funny, Cap.
It's Afghanistanimation.
The monkey has a butler?
Great.
- Is that what they do in Arabia, Thorny?
- How the hell should I know?
All right. Somebody get me a VTR copy of this thing.
I'll talk to Grady, see if he'll let us take a look at the Winnebago.
All right. You ready for the photo shoot?
Okay, fellas, let's take it.
- Pull down your pants.
- Shut up, Farva, you idiot. Come on, do it.
- John. I'm not interrupting, am I?
- Mayor Timber!
- No. Come in, come in.
- Good work, gentlemen, all the way around.
- Could I get in on that?
- Sure. Why not?
- Excuse me. Good work. Good work, Officer.
- Hey.
You're gonna have a hard time shutting us down now, right, Mr. Mayor?
We got a murder one day, a drug bust the next.
I'm thinkin' we need as much police as we can get.
- That'd be a good slogan, wouldn't it?
- Mm-hmm.
Tell that to the budget committee.
I Just got off the phone with Governor Jessman... and she's gonna be swinging through here on her way to Burlington.
Give me a gun, huh, to hold for the pictures.
- Rabbit, run. Gun.
- And, John... as far as this brawling with the local police is concerned--
It won't happen again, Bill.
I'm onto it.
Good.
'Cause when the governor shows up,
I'm gonna throw her a little party.
We're gonna let her know just how this community feels about its law enforcement.
Spread it on!
Come on, Dad!
Faster! Faster!
- So what's the deal with you and Bobbi?
- Come on, Dad!
You guys are goin' out, but you, um, sleep with other people?
Well, I mean, yeah.
Not really. Kind of.
It's sort of a long story, all right?
Well- Hey, Arlo, does Mom ever have any friends over?
- Any older boys?
- Can't we turn the siren on?
In a minute, all right?
Are you listening?
Does she have anyone over that maybe you call uncle?
Like Uncle Fred?
Uncle Fred?
Who's Uncle Fred?
He's this crazy bird on TV.
- He's crazy. He flies around like a pigeon.
- Oh, right.
Uncle Freddy, he's great.
He's a crazy bird.
Okay.
We got one.
You wanna take this one, kid?
- What about you?
- I gotta stay with little "A."
- You're okay, right?
- Sure.
- Go on. Make mama proud.
- All right.
Yeah, Farva, I got a Porsche, brown, Washington plates--
- Eight-Donna-Peanut-Eunuch.
- Roger. Checking.
Kill it.
Can I please see your license and registra--
I'm sorry, Office for the speeding violation.
I am so used to driving on the Autobahn.
Uh-- what?
...Sean Cassidy.
Yummy, yummy.
Nicht?
- Do you know why I pulled you over?
- We were driving way too fast.
- Ja.
- Ja.
Officer, this is a major problem... because I cannot afford another ticket with mein Porsche.
Is there maybe something I can do for you, hmm? Or maybe my wife...
Could do for you to avoid this dilemma?
Is there maybe something you would like me to do to you?
Or maybe something you would like to do to me? Hmm?
Uh, 'cause you were doing 90 in a 65.
Perhaps some spanking or cuffing is in order.
Could you hold on a minute?
Just a minute. I'll be right back.
- Twenty-three, that Porsche is hot.
- Are you sure?
Rabbit?
- Please, Thorn, not now. No.
- He can join too, if you like?
- Get over here.
- Tickle, tickle.
- Ja.
- Hold on a second.Just one second, huh?
- What?
- Farva said that car is stolen.
What? Stolen?
- Shit!
- Is there a problem, officers?
Hold on! Come on, Thorn,
I need this.
Look, kid, any other day, I'd step in here and show you how to swing.
But the car's stolen.
Goddamn it!
You got to get over there and you got to cuff her.
Do it! You're a highway patrolman.
Cut it out! Do it.
Now turn that off and step out of the car, sir.
- This is no problem, hmm?
- Put your hands on the car and spread 'em.
- Ah, now some fun for both of us.
- Get back in the car!
Rabbit, get over there and cuff her.
Up against the car.
Ma'am, I hate to do this to you, but would you--
Would you please put your hands behind your back?
Now things are getting kinky.
Arlo!
- I love your--
- I'm on the radio. Come in, Farva.
Arlo! Rabbit! Let's go!
Climb up on Uncle Rabbit's lap, Arlo, okay?
I don't think that's such a good idea, Thorn.
Uh, right.
Okay, why don't you Just sit in the middle, buddy?
Ursula, what the fuck?
There's no T.P. in the bathroom.
- What about the piece stuck to your shoe?
- What about that piece?
Shit!
You know, you might get ahead around here if you made the extra effort.
- Do you want me to wipe your ass?
- That's not what I--
Well, around my house, my wife knows to refill the T.P.
I'm not your wife, Smy.
No. And if you were,
I'd take you down a peg or two.
Ooh.
Hi, douche bag.
You know, if you were my wife..
I'd massage your feet every night until you fell asleep.
Nice try.
He strangles her and puts her face in pig food?
What an asshole.
Got any I.D. on the corpse?
Yeah. "Jane Doe."
Do you know her?
Oh, we're working on it.
It's called routine police work.
Apparently, she had a cartoon monkey tattooed on her back.
John Chimpo, I'm told.
And those cannabis bags in our truck... those stickers had the same monkey logo.
So we think there might be some kind of connection.
Are you suggesting that a cartoon monkey is bringing drugs into our town?
- Look, I know we don't like each other.
- I like you.
Come on! I'm looking for a little cooperation here.
John Chimpo.
Hanson, could you round up, uh, Johnny Chimpo... and, uh, Jerry Giraffe and Arty the Alligator... and bring them in for a lineup.
- Thanks, sweetie.
- Sounds like they're having fun.
That's what happens when you start hanging out with a state trooper.
We show you the funny.
Well, where were we?
Uh, you were laying your best rap on me and I was resisting.
But you were starting to think about it.
- I told you. I don't touch highway hog.
- Baby, I'm Sizzle Lean.
I scratched your back, Bruce.
I scratched it good and hard.
Now, either you scratch my back or you’re gonna get my size ten boot up your ass!
Desperation is a stink cologne, John.
Let's see. You are an expendable line item on a state spending bill.
You have a station full of crappy cops.
I am about this far away from having a bigger budget.
And now, you come in here talking about... monkey tattoos on some drunk lady's tit like it's a goddamn drug conspiracy.
Keep your bags packed, John.
Let us handle the real police work, huh?
Uh, John, when you do get shut down you come back, talk to me.
I can always use a good meter maid.
Let it roll.
Come and get me, Mac.
- See you later, sucker!
- Ohh! Ohh! Fuck!
Can't catch the Rabbit.
- Damn it!
- Out of the car! Out of the car, scumbag!
Well, hello, Shirley.
Come on, Farva, man. Same team. Same team.
What's Thorny going to say, Rook?
Honestly, Bobbi
I think it's gonna happen.
We don't want to leave
We really like this town.
I'll probably just get sent down to Brattleboro. It's a nice town.
I don't think it's a healthy time for him to move.
He's got a lot of real good friends here.
Who? That creepy kid with the lisp?
Hey. Stop jumping on the bed.
Look, I don't want to go without you.
- Then you should stay here.
- But I can't if they transfer me.
Hey, stop jumping on the bed.
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.
Hey, honey, it's almost
Mitternacht, huh?
Uhh. We really should be getting back to the jail.
You don't want us turning into pumpkins.
Thorn, can't they just stay a little longer?
All right.
Who wants a mustache ride?
- I want one. I want one!
- I do! I do! I do!
Spurbury Police.
Oh, thank the Lord.
Thank the Lord. It's terrible.
Oh, there's a disgusting pervert flashing people.
Ma'am, I need you to calm down.
I can't calm down!
You calm down! Oh, my God!
- Ma'am, tell me your location.
- He's right in front of the building... on 323, uh, Karuna Street.
- That's this address, ma'am.
- Oh, well, then, maybe you can see him.
He's right in front of the building.
Go look. I'll hold.
Whoo-aaah!
Did you see him?
Oh, he's disgusting.
He certainly is, ma'am.
Oh, I think he's going to the window again.
Whoo-ooo-ooo!
Oh, the humanity!
He's so bulgy. He's like a moose.
Oh, no!
I think he's going back again.
Freeze, motherfucker!
Oh, God! Please don't shoot me.
I-I'm naked.
Drop your coat and grab your toes.
What?
I'm gonna show you where the wild goose goes.
Oh, this isn't happening.
I-I-I'm a police officer. Ursula, help!
Baby, I'm gonna butter your bread.
You don't have these at your station?
I don't suppose you got a pair of fresh underwear I could borrow?
I'm not sure you could fit into my panties.
You know, you can't tell anybody about this.
I already told my mom about you.
Ohh! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Shit!
- Baby, you rocked me.
Wow! What is this?
Rabbit, you're off the road! Shut up, Farva!
It's a good move, Cap.
Rabbit, you're on radio.
Farva, you're ridin' with Thorny.
- Wait a minute--
- What do you want me to do about it?
My hands are tied!
It's all over the police band!
Rabbit, you couldn't have picked a worst time!
I got a Q-17 request form today.
We have to inventory our equipment.
Which means our balls are this close to the band saw.
What are you sellin', Mac, hot dogs?
- There's a new billboard.
- Casino le Fantastique?
Let me guess.
You just humped the mayor's wife and burnt down City Hall.
I'll do you one better, Captain.
So I'm walkin' down by the local police station, minding my own business.
But there's something funny in the air.
I feel like I just gotta get into that Winnebago.
So after I jimmy the door, I do a quick recon.
Bullshit.
I can see there's something not right about that bed.
- So I busted it in.
- Bullshit.
And just sittin' there were ten huge duffel bags of these mothers.
Let me get this straight. You went into the impound, scaled the fence... broke into the Winnebago and smashed the bed, all on a hunch?
I'll believe that when me shit turns purple and smells like rainbow sherbet.
What? Do you think
I just grew this weed?
How could you know to look underneath the bed?
It must have been my sixth-- or even my seventh sense.
You know, Rabbit, a good cop doesn't really know why he does anything.
Disregard that, Rabbit.
And you didn't even think to call in your partner?
So these local mothers have got a hundred keys of chiba and don't know it?
Not a clue.
It's totally hidden.
And Grady's walkin' around like he's hot soup.
All right, we got a chance here.
But we got to beat these guys to the punch.
Mac, you and Foster check out the truck stops... and find out what you can about Galikanokus and Bunty Soap.
I'll talk to Grady and play a little hardball.
Thorny, I'm takin' a hard line.
You got to promise me no more bullshit.
Cap, you know I'm cool, but I can take no responsibility for these white devils.
Well, you're gonna have to.
Now, Rodney, we're under a lot of pressure here.
Remember what we talked about.
If anything happens... count to ten, take some deep breaths.
Ten deep breaths.
I got it, Cap.
Foster, you're on duty.
Trust me, skipper, we'll make you proud.
You are awesome.
You are incredible.
You are a fantastic cop.
Keep goin'.
Uh, and then somebody said,
I think it was O'Hagan, said, um...
- "Foster, you deserve a promotion."
- Hmm. I think you get a star.
Mm. Foster? Wait.
I don't know if this is gonna work.
- This steering wheel is jabbing my ass.
- Oh, right.
Ow! Okay.
In New York City, a guy could pay ten bucks to watch two cops have sex in a cage.
Yeah?
Oh.
- Foster?
- Yeah?
In our cruisers, somebody has to let you out of the back seat.
Oh, fuck it!
Do we look like the two dumbest guys in the world to you?
Is that why you choose to treat us with such disrespect?
Look, all I'm sayin', man, is switch partners. It'll be fun.
- I don't think so.
- Come on, mix it up a bit.
Mm, no fuckin' way.
Come on, Mac, you know you’re always sayin' how funny Foster smells.
Oh, look out for Thorny, master of psychology.
Do I really smell?
All right, assholes, quit talkin' about me.
Lock and load, Ramathorn.
Let's kick some tail.
We weren't talkin' about you, you big idiot.
Bullshit.
- Truck stop, huh?
- We gotta do it.
But the captain didn't say anything about going undercover.
Do you think they're gonna tell us anything if they know we're cops?
Get a job, man! Look, you're fuckin' super cop.
You should know this.
- I am super.
- Plus, we can't take our car... until they replace the door you, for no reason whatsoever, ... removed last night.
I told you it was those kids with the wrenches.
Ah, yes, those ballsy little punks who took your car door off... while you were sittin' in the damn thing.
I told you I was in a very deep sleep.
Yeah. You wanna tell that to O'Hagan?
Maybe we can borrow his car today.
Do you even know how to drive this thing?
Shit! This rig sucks!
Aha!
Uh, who knew it was a stick?
How about we, uh, pop a couple of Viagra... and issue tickets with raging, mega-huge boners?
Only you, Farva, can make a dark man blush.
- And, no, we're not doin' it.
- Ah, hell.
Hey, I came up with a great name for our car.
Oh, yeah?
Get this.
You're Arcot Ramathorn-- Ram-- and I'm Rod Farva- Rod; car Ramrod.
Car Ramrod. You get it?
Yeah, I got it.
- Rabbit, I got a Plymouth Voyager...
- Say "Car Ramrod."
- Say "Car Ramrod."
- Vermont plates- Hold on.
Vermont plates- Alpha...
God-Mustard-One-Niner-Decade-China.
Check it.
Roger, 23.
You didn't say it.
I wrote it on the paper.
Oh, I forgot.
Oh, yeah.
Come on, Ramathorn, what game are we playin'?
- What? No games.
- Don't bullshit me.
Let's play one of those games I keep hearin' about. You know, Mac and Foster... did that thing, you know, with the "who can say pussy the most."
You know, actually, Mac bet Foster he couldn't say "meow" ten times.
To the driver.
I realize that doesn't sound funny as I described--
Who can say "meow" the most?
You guys are real crazy.
Hey, look out for these guys!
Hell, I can say "meow."
I can say "moo."
For 20 bucks, I'll call the guy a chicken-fucker.
Easy, Rod. Easy, Rod.
Easy, Rod. Easy, Rod.
License and registration... chicken-fucker! Brawwk!
- Bruce? John O'Hagan.
- John!
I'm glad you called. Listen. I have
Bobby the Baboon in lockup... and he says that for twenty bananas he'll provide evidence...
Johnny Chimpo is the pimp in charge of the Cartoon Network whorehouse.
Look, I'm done dickin' around.
We got new evidence on your murder.
Who? Galikanokus?
You know where he is?
No, we don't know where he is, but--
Then I don't see how you can possibly help us, then.
Okay. This is my last offer.
Either you let us in on this investigation... or I'm gonna embarrass you personally.
Oh, how embarrassed?
Like, naked in a dream embarrassed?
No, no.
Embarrassed like back in '77, when you got caught fuckin' your cousin embarrassed.
She's not my cousin.
Welcome to Dimpus.
Can I take your order?
Give me a, uh, double bacon cheeseburger.
Double bacon cheeseburger.
It's for a cop.
- Roger.
- What the hell's that all about?
He gonna spit in it now?
No, I was just tellin' him that so he makes it good.
Don't spit in that cop's burger.
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Roger. Hold the spit.
Give me a, uh, pie.
Apple.
Do you want me to hold the spit?
Just kidding,
Officer... Farva.
So, do you want to "Dimpisize" your meal for a quarter more?
Want me to "punchisize" your face for free?
Some male figure? I'm his dad.
And stop with the whole transfer thing.
Oh, Christ.
You know what? I gotta go.
Let's talk about this later, okay?
Okay. bye.
Now don't give me any lip.
It’s just a quarter, and look how much more you get.
- I said no!
- It’s just 25 cents.
- Hey, listen, guy. He doesn't want it.
- I can handle this, Ramathorn.
- I don't want it!
- Right. Uh, beverage?
Gimme a, uh, liter of cola.
- A what?
- A liter of cola!
"Leederacola."
Do we make leederacola?
Will you just order a large, Farva?
I don't want a large Farva.
I want a goddamn liter of cola!
- I don't know what that is!
- Liter is French... for "give me some fuckin' cola before I break both fuckin' lips."
All right, all right.
Relax!
- That look like spit to you?
- Yeah.
Ah, fuck it.
Mm. I feel like a real cop again.
Well, I wouldn't get used to it,
'Cause you know it's not gonna last.
- Bullshit. I'm not goin' anywhere.
- All right, buddy.
We're about to get shut down anyway.
Oh, yeah?
That's a lot of"Dimp."
- What do you do if you get transferred?
- I don't know.
Bobbi doesn't want to leave, and...
I don't want to leave her and Arlo, so--
Yeah, I don't know what the hell I'm gonna do.
Who gives a shit? I'm about to win ten million bucks anyway, right?
Are ya? What are you going to do with that ten million bucks?
And you can't say,
"Buy the Cleveland Cavaliers."
- I'd buy a ten-million-dollar car.
- Ah, good investment.
- But I'd pull you over.
- Bullshit. You could never catch me.
Oh, I could never catch you?
If you did, I'd activate my Car's wings, and fly away.
I got a good feelin' about this.
Damn it, you burger punk!
You son of a bitch!
Aah!
Yeah, Burger Boy!
All right, all right, all right.
Cut it out, you guys.
Knock it off.
Clear out of here.
All of you.
I was hittin' his ass so hard with that hose.
I'm sorry about the delousing, Rod.
Standard procedure.
- It's powdered sugar.
- The lice hate the sugar.
- Listen, Rod--
- It's delicious.
Uh, good. Good.
Say, Rod, what are your plans after the shutdown?
We're not gettin' shut down,
Grady. We're drug busters.
Maybe they're drug busters, but you're dispatch.
- Nuh-uh. I'm back on the road, now.
- Until this little incident.
Listen, Rod...
This whole murder thing, we've been tryin' real hard to break it open... but O'Hagan just will not cooperate with the evidence.
Now I've spoken to the governor myself.
She is gonna shut your station down, son.
It's gonna happen.
Now, I'm gonna have a bigger budget then, and I could really use... a good local officer like yourself.
- Could I go now?
- You could have your own car.
Work on exciting cases. Hey, we could even chase drug dealers together.
Now, the thing is, Rod...
I really need to know about your side of the investigation.
O'Hagan's making all kinds of threats, and-
Can we make a deal?
I'm all highway.
Let him loose.
Sorry about that, bro.
Hey, Charlie's Angel.
- What's up?
- Guys.
Hey.
Well, we got about, uh, twenty desk lamps.
- Farva went schizoid.
- That's good.
- How did the undercover thing go?
- Well, not so good.
- Turns out, this guy can't drive a semi.
- Yeah.
You guys watch that Johnny Chimpo thing?
- Funny, but nothin' there.
- Mm. Maybe you missed something.
Mm, trust me, bro.
There's nothing there.
Maybe we should take another look.
That's it, you're off the road. Never again.
Sir, no.
- It was not my fault.
- Neither was the goddamn school bus.
You know, there was a time we'd take a guy like you out back and beat you.
- Now you got your goddamn unions.
- I'm not a pro-union guy.
- And you're banned from Dimpus Burger.
- Damn it!
Get some rubber gloves. From now on you're my cleaning lady.
Beat it!
Well, the butler is basically saying to Johannes Chimpo...
"Don't let the Great Satan tempt you with the Western culture.
You must remain true to the Taliban warlord."
Cool beans.
So, um, Galikanokus is not the butler?
Well, possibly. But this is, uh, quite brilliant, really.
And so, Captain, you think there might be some connection with the smugglers?
Rabbit, get this meatball out of here.
You got it, Captain
Come on, meatball.
We should probably do that.
Back in the cage with your beautiful wife, huh?
What did you find out at the weigh station?
My cruiser weighs 16,000 kg.
I just got off the phone with Tom McCardle from the budget committee.
- This thing with Farva screwed our pooch.
- What?
They can't lump us in with that fuckin' Martian.
- We're all in the same boat.
- But our shenanigans are cheek and fun.
Yeah. His shenanigans are cruel and tragic.
Which makes them not shenanigans at all, really.
Evil shenanigans.
I swear to God I'll pistol-whip the next guy that says, "shenanigans."
Hey, Farva!
What's the name of that restaurant you like with all the goofy shit on the walls...
- and the mozzarella sticks?
- You mean shenanigans?
- No! Oh!
- You're talking about shenanigans, right?
Put those away!
Hey, Rabbit.
Yeah, I know. "You got beautiful, big brown lips."
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Have your fun, boys.
Have your fun.
'Cause I'm gonna start looking for a new job.
Hey! Urs! Ha!
- Hi.
- Hi. Sorry I'm late.
The mayor came down today.
Ah, biker! I'm an idiot.
Boy, you guys just keep shooting yourselves in the foot.
- Heard you got to see Farva naked.
- Yeah, it was hard to miss.
So, Grady thinks he's got you guys by the balls.
Yeah. How do you feel about long-distance relationships?
Think I'm getting sent to Deer Lick.
Well, I've been thinking about this.
I think
I might have an idea.
The governor comes to town on
Saturday for that big thing, right?
She's gonna make a big speech about drugs and law enforcement...
- and all of that because of your bust.
- She's gonna shut us down.
No! Not if you give her more.
Get the reefer out of the Winnebago and give it to her during the party.
Make a big show of it.
With all that media there, she would love us for it.
- No way she'll shut you down.
- That reefer's locked in the Winnebago... which is locked in your impound, which is guarded by assholes.
All right.
Here's what I'll need.
Five ski masks, a case of smoke bombs-- the good ones--
- and banana peels, lots of banana--
- Foster?
- How about if I just help you get in?
- You would do that for me?
Yeah. What the hell.
We'll work together.
Like Cagney and Lacey.
Yeah. Well, Cagney and Lacey were women.
- But--
- I could be Lacey.
Mac-o!
- So that's it, huh?
- C.C.S. Rockman Bulletproofing is the tops!
Same guys who make our flak-jackets.
Now, Rabbit, a good cop does what... before using his equipment in the field?
- Uh, they test it?
- They test it. Exactly.
How are you shootin' today, Thorn?
- Dead on all morning.
- How about that little fella?
Oh, that little guy? I wouldn't worry about that little guy.
Good enough for me.
You're my man, now.
I don't get it. How are we going to get into the local impound?
There are gonna be cops there.
Wa-hoo!
Most of the local cops will probably already be at the banquet.
They'll leave, like, one or two of the dumbest guys at the station.
- How are you feelin' there, Mac?
- Good enough to fuck your mother!
So, what we have to do is distract whoever they leave there.
Hey, Mac! You still have that Halloween costume?
Oh, hell, yeah.
You don't throw out--
Wa-hoo-hoo!
Damn, that's good!
So, if we can get ten minutes, you and I can get into the impound... get the reefer, and get it to the governor before she leaves?
- Nice and easy.
- I like it.
- You're up.
- Me?
- Now, don't get puke on it.
- Does it hurt?
You're gonna feel a little pinch.
Lookin' good, Rabbit!
Now don't move!
- Hang on, buddy.
- Hey, Cap!
- Hey, Captain.
- Bulletproof cup, huh?
I invented this gag, Rabbit.
- Only in my day, the rookie got naked.
- Who, whoa, whoa!
And we also used blanks.
You're a sick motherfucker, Mac.
Thanks, Chief.
All right, Thorny.
Why'd you call me up here?
Good to know you’re still battin' for us with the budget committee Mayor.
Well, I don't want to mince words, John, but it doesn't look too good.
Maybe not to the untrained eye.
But if I was a bettin' man, I'd put money on us changin' the governor's mind tonight.
Well, you might want to strap on your ass-kissing boots and start right now.
- I think she's your only hope.
- Hello.
What is this thing again?
Humane society?
- Uh, it's a drug bust.
- Cocaine?
- Hello.
- Uh, marijuana.
Then why are we here?
Oh, I think we're pretty well covered, Mr. Mayor.
I think she's got a lot of decisions to make.
- I don't envy her.
- Oh, I do.
I'll be luck to have a figure like that when I'm her age.
Yeah. That's a good one.
We're sending someone down, don't worry. Okay.
Thanks You bet.
- No, no, no, no. We'll bring the guns.
- We're on it. We're on it.
We got it. All right, that's like twenty calls.
I'll tell you what. I'll go down there and check it out.
- What about me?
- Burton, somebody's got to stay here.
All right, fuck it.
Shit!
Maybe this is the key.
I mean, no offense, bro, but...
When did you become a cop?
None taken, Ramathorn.
None taken.
- Really. How'd you know the key was there?
- A gentleman never asks.
A lady never tells.
Wonder how Rabbit's doin'?
Oh, yeah!
- Yeah! Yeah!
- What does that look like to you?
Is the bear--
- Is the guy--
- Oh, yeah. Yeah!
Seems more of a game warden thing to me.
- Well, it's illegal, Burton. I know that!
- Whoo! Oh!
Oh, shit. Look who's here.
I thought you said he wasn't gonna make it.
I tried.
- Glad to see you, Rodney.
- Hey, how are you doin', Rowdy?
How you think I'm doin'? Open bar, ain't it?
Mm-hmm.
- Thought you said Bowl-a-rama.
- Yeah, I tried to call you, but, um--
Yeah, right!
- Give me six schlitzes.
- No schlitz.
- Whatever's free.
- Take it easy, Rod.
Open bar, dude!
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!
Hello down there.
Are you okay?
Excuse me.
- Bear- Bear-fucker!
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Do you need assistance?
- Oh! Oh! Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Let's do this.
Hey, hey, whoa! Whoa!
Mayor Timber, yeah. So I just wanted to let you know... that the governor's gonna have to leave early.
For an emergency fund-raiser.
So--
Aw, she's gonna speak in about five minutes.
And then we're gonna have to zip on out of here.
- Well, thanks for the heads-up.
- I'll go check on those guys.
Mac-Attack! Wanna go punch for punch?
Good one!
I did not specify.
Never shit a shitter.
Lady in blue, comin' through.
Ramathorn.
What? I don't know.
Two minutes?
♪ Yeah, yeah ♪
♪ Well, I got a ticket to ride this rocket ♪
♪ whoo, sixteen ounces in my back pocket ♪
♪ Well, come on, baby, won't you take a little taste ♪
♪ 'Cause we're about to get on into outer space ♪
♪ I got a ticket to ride on that rocket ♪
You weren't kiddin'.
That's a lot of hooch!
♪ whoo-hoo
Yeah, hoo-hoo ♪
Holy shit.
What's Grady doin' up there?
...and of course, your own local police chief, Bruce Grady... has made yet another astonishing breakthrough.. in our state's War on Drugs.
That's fine police work.
Thank you very much.
The real credit... goes to my skilled officers, who uncovered the marijuana in that Winnebago.
And, uh, we have identified the dead woman from that Winnebago... as a drug "queenpin" from Louisville, Kentucky- Lucy Garfield.
Or, as we like to call her down at the station,
"The Louisville Smuggler."
There will be no more running of marijuana.. through Spurbury on my watch.
You can count on that.
Farva's number one!
Farva's number one!
Hey! You showed Grady our secret stash?
That was our stash!
- I did not show Grady the stash!
- Those bags of grass...
- represented a-a bond of trust between us.
- Foster--
Foster, I had no idea--
Did you pick me because you could manipulate me?
No! How could you even say that?
- Because you crapped on my heart!
- I what on your heart?
What are you gettin' out of this?
Is Grady puttin' you on the road?
No, a-are you--
You're screwing him too.
- Asshole.
- Aah!
Ursula-
- Oh, Mac.
- What the fuck?
Fuckin' traitor!
Hey, Mac! Did it work?
Did it work?
Was there ever a moment when you suspected her?
- No, why would I?
- Exactly.
Why use your head when you can be getting some cop-on-cop fucky-sucky?
Well, did you tell her anything?
Two cops sleeping together. What the hell do you think they talked about?
I don't know. Doin' it?
Positions and stuff?
Oh, shut up.
You guys don't even know her.
Get it through your head, fish dick. She was in on it.
Fuck you, Mac!
All right, all right. Fighting's not gonna change anything.
Foster, she played you good. It's called the honey pot. You should have known better.
Well, I guess they were gonna shut us down anyway.
But you two are friends, you know?
You shouldn't let this come between you.
Come on now.
Shake hands.
- Sorry.
- You should be.
- Hey!
- Sorry. - Sorry.
- Good, now. Who wants a shot?
- I do.
- I'll have one.
- I said, who wants a shot?
I do!
Do you have any openings in Sherburne, Cap?
- Not for you guys.
- Oh, come on.
- We're like the sons you never had.
- If you were my son, Mac...
I would have smothered you by now.
Smothered me in gravy, you big, dirty man.
- You put in for a transfer yet?
- Ugh!
I applied for a guard job.
At the post office.
- Oh, man.
- You'll finally get to shoot someone.
- To the death of fun.
- Here's to you guys.
What's up, dirty dogs?
Guess that's it for the old locker.
She stinks like ass, but I'll sure miss her.
I guess you can say that about all my girls.
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck to you too.
- What are you?
- I'm a cop. What are you?
- A local cop?
- Grady had an opening. Big deal.
Why are you wearing that uniform in my station?
Look who's talkin', Denim Dan!
You look like the president, chairman and C.E.O. of Levi Strauss.
Where'd you get the Canadian tuxedo?
You ratted us out to Grady.
I'm not even gonna dignify myself with a response to that.
Hey, I got no hard feelings.
Nothin' a few beers can't fix, right?
Hey, how about one on me, Ramrod?
Excuse me.
Uh, excuse me, guys.
Yeah. I'll be right back.
What the fuck?
We should have taken him out the back and shot him.
- Aye, aye, Captain.
- I gotta call Ursula.
Fellas, we got to get him back.
He's gotta pay for this.
Nobody wears that uniform in my station.
- Farva's goin' down!
- Yes! Right!
- Grady's goin' down!
- Yeah!
- All of these fuckers are goin' down!
- Yeah!
What?
Welcome to Dimpus Burger.
May I take your order?
Hello in there.
This is Officer Rod Farva.
- Give me a liter of cola!
- Uh, sorry, Officer Farva, I can't--
You want me to come in there, boy?
I'll come in there!
- Hello?
- Chase him! Chase him!
Let's pull someone over.
Whoo!
License and registration.
When you gotta go, you gotta go.
We are the Spurbury police!
Whoo! Hoo!
Who-ho-ho-ho!
Whoo!
I'm cool. I'm cool.
Grady! Get your ass out here!
- Grady!
- I don't want to sound like a wienie...
- but I think I should call Ursula.
- No way!
- You sound like a fuckin' wienie.
- Gimme the radio.
Grady? Bruce?
Fuck it, all right.
Gimme the goddamn radio.
- He's not home!
- Hey, Chief-o!
This is Officer Rod Farva.
Come in, Ursula.
- What're you doin'?
- Ursula! I love you, Ursula.
- Come in, Ursula!
- Who is this? Hello?
- Oh! Oh!
- Oh, she's there?
Ursula! Oh, I'm sorry.
Sir, this is a police channel.
Please get off of it.
- I'm tryin' to apologize here.
- Sir, this is not a civilian channel.
If you’d like to have a conversation with someone, please go to Channel Five.
All right, Thorny.
Pop it over to Channel Five.
Look what I found!
A two-by-four!
- You go, girl!
- Foster!
- Help me out here, Rabbit.
- Foster, is that you?
- I need someone sober.
- You got it, Cap.
- And, hit!
- My ass in your face, Thorny.
So-So, hey, what's goin' on?
Don't use that boyfriend voice with me.
What are you doing?
Don't use that boyfriend voice with me, Foster!
- Hit!
- Yea!
Now, did you know that Farva was the one who told Grady about our plans?
- Yeah. I know. He's working for us now.
- So, I'm sorry.
- I don't know. Can I come see you?
- I love you.
- Listen, Foster--
- Ursula! I'm naked!
Listen, Foster? You want to get these guys back?
- Yeah!
- I know a way we can get 'em really good.
Yeah, let's get 'em good!
Did you hear that, guys?
Yes, sir.
Okay, I get off work at 10:30.
Meet me at Route 9 and Okeechobee Rod, and don't be late.
- She said, "Okeechobee."
- She's okey-dokey.
She's late.
So, Foster...
- is this your usual meeting spot?
- No.
- Fuckin' shit!
- That was Galikanokus!
Let's get him!
Outta the car!
Goddamn it!
Same shit, different day, huh, Rabbit?
Everybody outta the car!
I said now!
You're all under arrest for stealing a Spurbury police vehicle.
No, Farva, you are under arrest for being a total and complete fuckhead!
Y-You don't want to do this, Rod
We gotta go catch that truck.
Using what?
Super citizen power?
Galikanokus is on that truck!
I'll believe that when me shit turns purple...
- and smells like rainbow sherbet.
- Does it sound like that when I say it?
Farva! You are not stopping me from getting my job back!
Get him, Mac!
- I got a job now.
- You're a local cop.
- You're goddamn right I am!
- You ratted us out!
No, Thorny.
I barely had a job before.
Farva, get the coffee.
Farva, hit the radio.
Farva, clean the cells!
I'm a cop, goddamn it!
I got my own car, now.
I get to bust criminals!
It's what I gotta do!
- You screwed us over.
- No, Thorny.
Okay. Okay, I did!
I did, I did.
- I'm sorry, Rodney.
- Come on, Rod.
- Oh, Thorny!
- No, no, no. Please. Come on.
Listen, listen. This is your big chance.
When we go up there, and we're wrong, no big deal.
But if we’re right, you can be a hero.
Come on. Team Ramrod!
Will you look at that?
- We got 'em, Cap.
- We got 'em, we got 'em!
- Oh.
- Fuckin' Galikanokus!
There's Canadian markings on that plane.
Okay, Foster. You and Rabbit come around in a classic pincer move.
- Mac, I need you to take--
- No, no, no, Thorny. Me and you!
We outflank 'em, and we do, like, a submarine move.
- Team Ramrod?
- Shut up, Farva.
- Farva, you're leaning--
- Wait a minute!
Oh! The locals!
I hate those fuckin' guys!
Goddamn it, you dipshits! If I had my car,
I'd have been in on this bust!
Shh! Rodney! Rodney, get your ass back here!
Here we go again--
What the fuck?
- Oh, did you see that? He kissed that guy!
- Shh!
Holy shit!
God! We should have known.
Sok wait. The local cops are selling
Afghani grass to the Canadians?
Assholes!
- No, Rabbit, it's comin' in from Canada
Canadian grass. Ah!
- Assholes.
- No!
The local mothers are running protection for 'em.
Oh, I guess I'm the asshole.
I'm sorry we didn't wait for you, but--
Listen to me, Foster.
I need to tell you something.
- What, are you guys drunk?
- No!
- Your local buddies are runnin' grass!
- Listen, I know.
I know what they're doing. I've known for awhile.
You know this?
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Are you in on it?
No! They keep me on dispatch. I didn't know what to do when I found out about it.
- I was afraid I'd lose my job.
- Oh.
You should have just told us.
We would have arrested them.
- Yeah, we used to be cops, remember? Shh!
- I remember--
No offense, but the less you guys knew, the less you could screw up.
Oh.
I was trying to stop it without getting brought down.
Th-- That's why I helped you find the reefer, that's why I helped you guys steal the Winnebago... and that's why
I brought you... here tonight.
You didn't do this because you like Foster? Shh!
No, I mean--
I do like Foster, but I--
But you used him.
Yeah, I guess so.
But I really like him now.
Ah!
- This is so good--
- This is kind of awkward.
I hate to break up the "like-fest," but it's prime time for crime-time!
But wait! Hey, hey, hey!
Are you guys kidding? Look at yourselves.
You saw what they did to
Galikanokus's girlfriend.
And you guys are drunk, and unarmed.
Oh, hey, I am sober as a bird.
I am drunk.
- What do you got?
- No guns. They got flares.
And some string.
Oh, Farva, you sad, lonely man.
Ugh.
Oh, wait. He's got your name written on it.
- Oh!
- Ooh.
Chief! Chief Grady! I secured the perimeter, sir.
Farva!
Sorry I missed the call.
Looks like we got 'em. Rock 'n' roll!
What the hell are you doin' here, Farva?
Put that pistol down!
- Qu'est-ce-que c'est ca?
- English!
- Chief!
- Put a bullet in him, Grady.
What the fuck is this?
- Grady?
- Shit, what the fuck is this?
Shoot it!
- That's my car.
- Grady!
- That's my girl!
- Grady!
Smy, Burton, check that out.
- What are ya, drunk?
- Drunk enough to kick your ass.
Let's see what you've got, O'Hagan.

Here we go.
"Dear John..."
"Congratulations are due to you..."
"and your men for your brave, impressive..."
"but most of all unorthodox tactics..."
"in thwarting the drug-smuggling ring..."
"and extreme police corruption."
- Ooh. She loves us.
- All right.
"I cannot stress enough how proud we at the statehouse are of you."
"The great State of Vermont could use more officers like your men."
"As you requested, we have reevaluated the financial situation..."
"regarding your unit."
And we're gonna buy you a tank.
"Due to our tight fiscal situation..."
"we regret to inform you that we are still..."
"going to have to close your station."
"Good luck in Sherburne, John."
"And give your men my best."
"Sincerely..."
Governor Fuckhead.
I did not see that coming.
I told you to bring the handcart.
- Sorry.
- Tilt it.
Oh, goddamn, I remember these things being lighter!
I think I'm gonna drop a nut!
- Shit.
- Hope they like foam.
It's not so bad. Good exercise.
- Cool uniforms.
- Yeah. All the beer you can drink.
I'm into that!
Beer!
- Oh, God.
- You order the keg of St. Anky?
Uh, yeah!
But aren't you guys the Highway Patrol?
Yeah, but our station got shut down, so--
Oh, no shit, man!
Yeah, shit.
This your keg?
Oh, my-my Dad ordered it.
But he's asleep right now.
Keg's here!
Oh, St. Anky!
- Oh, God. No!
- No, no, no!
Hey, man. Hey, bro.
It's cool, man. They got fired!
No shit?
No shit, man!
- All right, all right. Where's the keg go?
- Put it in the rec room, man.
Make room, make room.
What took you guys so long to get here?
What'd you do?
Brew it yourself?
- You're cool, man.
- I am cool.
Check this out. Um, why don't you guys put that, um... over there?
- Move it, move it, move it.
- We want a drink! Come on.
Tap this thing!
Actually, you know what?
I think it's better...
Feng Shui if it’s, uh over there.
Definitely. Definitely better over there.
Oh, wait, wait. Guys Guys.
You know what?
Man, it's probably better for the flow... if you put it back over here.
And don't forget to tap that keg, guys.
Okay, okay. Somebody's gonna need to sign for this... and I need to see some I.D.
Look, you know what?
I don't have any I.D.
But, uh, Abraham Lincoln here, he says that I'm 21 ... and he never told a lie.
Yeah, actually it was George Washington that never told a lie.
You guys drive a hard bargain, but--
Actually, you know what?
Why don't you guys split it?
That was good, man.
- Are you ready for the fun part?
- Oh, yeah.
'Cause here comes the fun part: Spurbury Police!
You're all under arrest!
- Come on back, now.
- Oh, yeah.
All this for a noise complaint?
I love acid--
Cops.
What the crap?
How come nobody called me?
- We're in trouble, aren't we?
- Oh, yeah. You're in big trouble.
And if you really want to choke somebody, you gotta hit the Adam's apple.

Get out of the car.
That's right
I'm talkin' to you.
Aah!
I'm going in, mam.
Mamy.
Suzon! My granddaughter.
Were you sleeping?
-No, just resting.
I'm happy to see you at Christmas.
-So am I.
How are your legs?
-Every day it's different.
Being old is horrible.
The pain is not the worst thing.
It's being dependent on others, being a nuisance.
Don't say that.
You know we love you.
As a family you care for each other.
Dear Suzon!
Chanel!
-You are here.
Fat Chanel!
-As fat as ever.
The weather is awful.
-How nice to see Suzon again!
Isn't she looking nice?
Fit for marriage.
-I think so too.
The sooner the better!
-Your father will be happy to see you.
Does he know already?
-He didn't want anyone to wake him.
What? Daddy is still sleeping?
He has been working in his room all night.
I'm so happy to be home.
This wonderful house.
Your old house!
All that snow makes me think we are in Siberia.
It's terribly annoying.
Luckily we have a telephone and a car.
Meet Louise, our new chambermaid.
Hello, Louise.
-Hello, miss.
Had a nice journey?
-Yes, thank you. Except for that snow.
Shall I wake your husband?
No not for while...
-Can I?
No, better leave him.
He didn't want anyone to wake him.
Will there be anything else?
No, thank you, Louise.
Where is that girl from?
From around here, I believe.
She's great! I'm very lucky to have found her.
And she's willing to stay here for the entire winter.  We were lucky.
Aunt Augustine!
You look tired. How are you?
Same as ever.
This taricardia is killing me.
It's tachycardia, aunt...
-Oh well...
It's freezing with all this snow.
Are you back already?
You were kicked out of school?
No, I've come home for Christmas.
I'm getting good grades.
Yes, your mother showed them.
But grades can be forged.
That wasn't very nice.
Can't I ask my niece if she is trying her best?
Of course you can.
Everything is going fine.
At least someone is happy.
-Are you talking about me?
I'm merely saying my daughter is happy.
-Is that all?
Girls girls, quit it!
Augustine, you are exagerating.
We have nothing to complain.
Gaby has always cared for us.
Not the same as our own home, but it's thanks to her...
No it's not!
It's thanks to your father, Suzon.
He respected your old and, sick grandmother... and a woman of virtue, just like me.
Thanks to Marcel...
-Thanks to both of us, of course.
Don't be so bitter.
You know we love you.
You're not being nice.
Members of a family support each other regardless of all their imperfections.
Coffee's here.
Ah! Warm brioches!
And I always get toast.
Everyone does, juffrouw Augustine.
Those brioches are my welcome present for Suzon.
Take one.
-Thanks. I love them.
I have some chocolate in my room.
Tastes even better together.
We must indulge her.
Augustine is like a child.
Nice of your mother to tolerate her moods.
You call that 'moods'.
I call it rudeness.
But Marcel tolerates her...
Daddy is admirable, and tolerance is a rare virtue.
Very true. And he's always in a good mood.
Even now business is not going so well.
-Oh, really?
You know more about his worries than me.
I stay out of it, and I like to keep it that way.
I have my problems and he has his.
A while ago I asked some advice about selling some of my shares and he said...
You sold your shares?
-No.
He advised me to wait.
Yes, keep them. You never know.
Guess who?
-Catherine!
Little Catherine!
Watch out for my legs.
-Sorry, Mamy.
She's so full of energy.
You rather have her become like aunt Augustine?
You got a present for me?
English chocolates.
-How original.
Don't 16-year-olds love those?
-I'm almost 17.
You'll always be my little sister.
You're looking good.
-So are you.
You seem to have gained some weight.
-Really?
No, or...
Maybe from eating too much muffins...
Where is daddy?
-He's still sleeping.
He's so lazy.
Shall we teach him a lesson?
A little respect please
He's your father.
I do respect him.
In my own way.
And I admire him, even if he is a bit old fashioned.
When I was a little girl you told me
Ill-gotten goods never prosper
In the course of my existence
That didn't always hold true
Daddy, you are so out of date
Daddy, you are so out of date
You said: my child on this earth
You get rewarded for helping someone
But I lend my car to Jean-Pierre
And got it back in small pieces
Daddy, you are so out of date
What you have to do
Is go back to school
And learn all kinds of new things
Invest a little bit
You also told me
Working makes you healthy
I worked around the clock every day
And now I'm so tired
Daddy, you are so out of date
Daddy, you are so out of date
You said: this boy is no good
Watch out or he will hurt you
But I'm in heaven
And fortune smiles upon me
Daddy, you are so out of date
Daddy, you are so out of date
Daddy, you are so out of date
Daddy, you are so out of date.
Are you finished with that racket?
There you are!
-I'm furious with you.
What now, baroness?
-You had your light on all night.
I haven't slept at all.
Been reading those despicable books again no doubt.
-What despicable books?
Aunty thinks they are despicable: detective, spy, adventure novels...
You're too young for those.
-Reading is harmless.
But going to the bathrooms 5 times, wakes us all.
So what? That was me yes.
Where you feeling sick, darling?
I couldn't sleep thanks to little miss perfect.
I wanted something to drink.
I was thirsty. Sorry.
As long as it's water...
He doesn't answer.
You can go in then, Louise.
-Alright, Madam.
How can he sleep with all that noise.
She's so clumsy.
Where has she been trained...
If I wouldn't be tied to this chair...
Madam!
Madam!
-What is wrong?
Monsieur...
But what is it?
-Monsieur... It's terrible.
What's wrong with him?
He's lying dead on his bed... with a knife stuck in his back.
You're mad! What are you saying?
He's dead. Blood everywhere.
It's horrible.
Mama...
Mama. oh baby, sweetheart...
Must be horrible to see for such a confused child. And she's so nervous already!
Watch her for a moment will you.
Watch her.
Mom?
Are you sure?
I have to go.
I have to see for myself.
The door is locked!
Catherine, did you lock it?
I'm giving it to the police.
No one can go in before the police gets here.
The police!
She's right. It's always in the newspaper. Fingerprints!
But my poor Marcel...
-Here. Go ahead.
Do you think you're up to it?
-yes.
We must see.
-Come!
Careful! Maybe the killer is still there.
She's right! Close the door. Quick!
Suzon... Suzon...
-Mama.
Business was going poorly.
He killed himself.
No, the knife was in his back.
I saw it with my own eyes.
Well, in that case...
A dagger with a handle of bone.
Monsieur asked for it last night, to cut some cardboard.
Cardboard? That is weird...
What did he want with cardboard?
We have to call the police.
-Right away?
We have already waited too long.
The line is dead.
Look. The telephone cord has been cut.
But by whom?
By someone!
It's just the wind, and your imagination.
What now? If we can't call the police?
-They will come. I'm going to get them.
You're in no condition to drive.
Louise, my coat.
Madam, the dogs!
-The dogs?
They didn't bark last night.
-And?
Vicious as they are, they would have barked if...
-If what?
If a stranger entered the house?
-Precisely.
But if no came from the outside, then...
Who made the last phone call?
Who made the last phone call?
Me.
-Tell.
I'm telling. This morning around seven thirty,
I called the butcher.
But he couldn't deliver anything because of the snow.
So at seven thirty the killer was still here.
Then he cut the cord.
Tell us about daddy's business.
You know how he was.
A real businessman, always working.
Very intelligent, but not very talkative.
He was always working on several things... but he never told me he was having trouble.
And Mr. Farnoux was a big support.
-Mr. Farnoux?
His new partner at the factory.
-Oh, yes.
Has he been here?
-No. Well yes, once or twice.
We never saw each other.
I mean, very little.
But every time Mr. Farnoux came, the dogs started barking.
They smelled he had a dog himself.
So it's unlikely that...
-Absolutely. Very unlikely.
Mom, who inherits daddy's fortune?
Me.
I mean, we...
In this case the factory get's sold, and the money goes to the wife and children.
His wife gets half and...
Notaries know everything about that.
Catherine, can you get me a handkerchief please.
-Yes, mom.
We must warn daddy's sister.
His sister? Rubbish.
That woman!
Yes, mama. You wrote me she moved to this town.
Do you know why?
Surely to get in touch again with Marcel.
After her decadent life in Paris, she thought she could come back to her rich brother.
Thank god she never set foot in our house.
How awful.
I come home after a year, and daddy is dead.
Killed.
Everything is looking different now.
Incredible how faces can change in a year.
Do I look older then?
No, mama.
You're still as beautiful as ever.
Despite the passing of the years...
Maybe.
But that will probably change soon after this disaster.
My sweet Marcel.
We understood each other.
We had it so good together.
But with separate bedrooms.
Marcel came home late.
He often worked at night.
He asked me to temporarily move.
Anything else?
This is not the time.
-Girls, quiet now.
We must get help.
Gaby, take the car. Hurry!
What if the killer is still here?
-Don't worry.
He probably isn't waiting for us.
He's long gone.
He went out the same way he came in: through the door.
The killer is smarter than we think. And nearer.
Is there a man prowling around?
-A man? Why a man?
What else?
-Well...
A woman!
Shame on yourself! You're accusing us.
If you have a clear conscience...
You have one then?
-More than you.
You think I did it because you hate me?
I don't care about you.
-Can you hear that?
Augustine, darling, calm down.
Of course, take sides with Gaby.
She's rich now.
She can kick us out!
Save your own neck.
Nobody ever contradicts her.
But I have a lot to tell the police.
That's slander, you can't do that!
-Let her talk, darling.
She despises me. She's jealous.
Of course. I'm beautiful and rich.
She's ugly and poor.
Next time it will be right between your eyes.
Such a nice vase, darling!
Do you want something to drink?
-I hate drinks between meals.
Didn't you get up 5 times tonight?
That's something else.
I'm very sick. Heart problems.
Take your pills then.
Fine, I'll take them all, then you'll be rid of me.
Augustine, baby.
-Leave me alone!
Mamy!
Your legs! What happened?
I feel better. It's either the snow or a Christmas miracle.
And we had to buy a wheelchair.
Louise, my coat.
I already asked you 2 times.
Yes, Madam
Did Mamy and Augustine get along with daddy?
I should hope so.
He took good care of them.
They had some fights now and then, but never serious.
Fights? About what?
-Oh small things.
Mamy was hanging on to her shares.
I tried to convince her to give them to Marcel.
Out of gratitude for our hospitality.
Part of Mamy's money belongs to you doesn't it?
Yes, but I gave it to Marcel, when I finally got my hands on it.
Augustine found out and started interfering.
Augustine and Mamy are being torn apart by gratitude and avarice.
What do you want?
They didn't have a rich husband, as you.
That's my fault?
I had to beg Marcel to let them live here.
He couldn't stand them.
Your father always loved youth.
Madam, your coat.
Tell me Louise, when did you started working here.
Why do you ask?
-She's with us since October.
I worked for the wife of a notary before. Do you care to check that?
That's not my job.
Louise, are you sure the dogs were quiet?
Certainly. I couldn't sleep.
I had a bad feeling.
Monsieur wasn't looking all that well when I brought him some herbal tea.
Monsieur asked for herbal tea?
Around midnight.
But he never drinks herbal tea!
He was working...
Maybe his stomach was bothering him.
He called. I brought his tea.
Did you stay long?
I left immediately.
Why didn't I see the serving tray in his room then?
Leave me alone!
Gaby, I need you.
Your sister wants to take all her pills.
She's only pretending! You still believe her?
Can I go now, miss?
No.
Tell me, Louise, when you were making tea, was Chanel still around.
No, she just left.
She sleeps in the hunting lodge in the park.
It gives her a sense of freedom.
We can do what we want after work, can't we?
And playing cards is innocent.
Does Chanel play cards?
-Didn't you know?
Then I said something foolish!
Of course I knew.
And who's she playing with now?
I'm not a snitch.
We won't tell anyone.
Alright then. With miss Pierrette, your father's sister.
Yes.
-And how did you know?
Mamy saw them.
She told me when she was drunk.
She always has a bottle in her room.
So Mamy is drinking again?
What's she like, aunt Pierrette?
An ex stripper, they say.
A talented artist, pure as an angel, says Chanel.
What does it matter.
She does know how to take advantage of her feminine charms.
Can't blame her...
But how does she get to Chanel?
She hitchhikes her way to the freeway
Then she street walks.
She's always been very good at that.
-Where is miss Augustine?
Upstairs.
Bring these to her.
Now, Louise. Hurry!
Yes, miss.
What time did you leave last night?
Around midnight...
Did you go for a walk?
-Are you kidding, in this weather?
Had any visitors?
-Visitors?
I haven't had any visitors in the last 10 years.
-Are you sure?
This is enough!
I've ironed your pants.
You're going to get nicely dressed now.
I'm going already.
But I think you're hiding something.
Your sister doesn't have any manners.
She's not like you.
We are rather different.
And she's still so young.
If only your mother was more strict...
Tell me, Chanel.
Is Louise good at her work?
Let me tell you something, she's a little slut that tries to seduce the man of the house.
About the others...
-Yes?
I'm going back to the kitchen.
I want to tell you a secret.
You're the only one I can trust.
-I'm coming, Mamy.
Your father didn't have any more money.
-That's interesting. Go on.
Out of gratitude for his hospitality...
I wanted to give him the shares your grandfather left me.
He refused them.
He said, "Keep your money,
I'm going bankrupt anyway."
So I kept my shares.
But not for long.
They were stolen 2 days ago.
-Stolen?
They put something in my drink.
A little glass after dinner helps fight the pain.
They've been in my room and I've been robbed.
They knew where I was hiding them.
Under your pillow?
-How do you know?
Mamy, everyone knows.
-Everyone?
What a bunch of crooks!
Stop the thief! Murder!
Stop the thief!
Good heavens! What's the matter?
Why are you shouting like that?
They stole her shares.
-Her shares!
She's lying! She sold them.
And mine too!
I want my share! Now!
I swear they have been stolen!
-But you never leave your room.
That's not true!
I hear her floor creaking every night.
Don't you ever sleep?
-Never.
I listen. All night long.
If the girls weren't here,
I would tell you what I hear.
My poor Augustine...
I know! Gaby, you stole them, to give them to who knows who.
Give them back!
Give them back now!
Madam, don't get carried away like that...
You stay out of this!
You dare to spit at madam?
She deserves it! I spit on her lies!
My poor sister,
I'll get you for this!
Stop it! You act like a bunch of children.
Daddy is dead.
You're right, Suzon.
This is enough. Everyone stays here.
I'm taking the car.
Madam, your bag, your keys...
You should be ashamed of yourself, aunt Augustine.
On the other side of the line
There is your voice
There are words I will never say
Words that hurt if they can't make you laugh
Words we see all to often in movies, songs and books
Words I want to say to you
And words I want to live
Words I cannot say
I want to
But I can't
I'm so alone I'd rather die
And I know where you are
I'm coming, wait for me
We're learning to know each other
Give me some time
I'll give you mine
I want to come to you
But I'm staying
I hate myself
I'm not coming to you
I want to, but I can't
I want to talk to you
I want to be with you
Or try to sleep
I'm afraid you are deaf
I'm afraid you are a coward
Afraid I'm being too pushy
I can't tell you
That I love you: maybe
But if you ever think that you love me
Don't be afraid for your memories
Dare to run until you are out of breath
Then come back to me again
If you ever love me
And have trouble
Finding the right road
Then come back to me again
If you had enough of your life
If every day seem the same
Then think of me
Think of me
But if you:
You think I hate you.
But I love you.
No one understands my love.
They think it's hatred.
Good wine also turns into vinegar sometimes.
-Don't be so mean to your aunt.
She's spoiled by her mother.
Reading all night so I can't catch any sleep.
But I will spare your sister.
-Why?
Because it's none of my business!
I won't tell you that... she was constantly begging Marcel for money.
And that she wasted it on
God knows who!
But it's none of my business.
You won't hear a word out of me.
Bad news, ladies.
The car won't start.
The engine has been tampered with.
And who did that?
-What do you mean?
Madam, I was only asking.
I'll have to tell the police you often go out at night, which everyone knows.
I'll tell the police you often go out at night, which no one knows.
-There are laws against perjury.
And there are inheritance laws!
-Meaning?
You know exactly what it means.
Who has a motive?
-You've lost me.
The heir did it.
That's in all detective novels.
Go study your geography!
Suddenly interested in her studies?
-You want me to slap you too?
That's enough.
We'll have to walk.
I'm going.
-I'm going with you.
This isolation is unbearable.
Look! There is someone in the garden.
The killer is back!
I don't feel so good...
-Shut up.
I'm sorry, ladies.
I would never visit my brother uninvited, especially in this weather, but this morning someone called me.
A bad joke no doubt.
My brother is supposedly murdered.
Then they hung up. I called here but the line was dead.
It's stupid, but I got scared.
The baker dropped me off...
Why are you staring at me like that?
It's a joke, right?
Answer me!
Why is his door locked?
How do you know it's his door?
You've never been here.
Marcel, let me in!
Marcel, it's me, Pierrette!
What's going on?
Don't yell like that.
Marcel is dead.
Dead?
I don't believe it.
Murdered.
A knife in his back.
We must ask you a few questions.
Leave me alone, please.
Who called you?
-I don't know.
A man?
-No, it was a woman.
I don't believe you.
Why would I make this up?
-As an excuse to come here.
Even though you've already been here before.
-Never!
Why didn't the dogs bark then?
-How should I know?
Why is the door locked?
-So no one can touch anything.
I want to see Marcel.
Give me the key.
So you can destroy evidence?
Give me the key or I'll kick down the door!
It's on the piano.
This key doesn't fit.
What?
-See for yourself!
It's another key...
Someone is working against us.
I beg you, stop it.
My nerves are killing me.
We have no other choice.
The key was here.
Anyone of us could have switched it.
Even Pierrette, when she went up the stairs.
I'm a free girl
Who changes day and night
Love is a game
I like to play
But one fine day
I like to be tamed
And stop playing
And share everything
What good does it do to be free
If you have no one to love
I have casual pleasures
And something special now and then
But when push comes to shove
Someone has to pay
And you're even more foolish then me
You teach to wait
And to shiver in prospect
That you'll be mine
What good does it do to be free
If you have no one
Who loves you
Now that your song is over, when did you last see my husband?
You know we weren't the closest of friends.
Don't tell me you never saw him.
I ran in to him a few times, in the city.
He loved me very much.
The fact that you didn't allow me coming here made him suffer.
Well, you're here now.
-Yes.
The telephone call brought us together.
But my brother is dead.
And I've decided to suspect all of you, out of principle.
Where are our manners?
I'm Marcel's mother-in-law.
This is my other daughter,
Augustine.
My son-in-law allowed us to stay here.
Your brother that is.
So you are Augustine?
We are members of the same reading club.
You're with a reading club?
I thought you hated to read?
Did I say something wrong?
Not at all. Not at all!
I might be a member, but I never borrow any books.
Oh, really?
But the loose-tongued secretary told me you borrow 5 love stories a week.
You must be mistaken.
-Maybe.
But last week you were reading
'Gondola of Love'. Weren't you?
'Gondola of Love'?
I didn't think so.
-I read it right after you.
By coincidence.
And I was happily surprised.
Between the pages,
I found someone belonging to you.
Give it back then.
What did you find in that book?
-A letter to my brother, a draft.
To Marcel?
But you saw him every day!
This woman is making things up!
Unfortunately,
I save everything.
An old habit.
"Dear Marcel,
Don't hold anything against me... for shouting at my mother about the shares in your presence.
I had to claim my share, so she wouldn't suspect anything... about my feelings for you.
I'd love for you to have them.
I would do anything to get you out of trouble, but don't mock me again together with Gaby.
I'll put this under your door.
Love, Augustine."
Lies! I despised Marcel.
He was a womaniser.
I mean, he had women everywhere!
He would have given my shares to his mistresses.
She has the same kind of arrogant smile.
I'll get you for this!
Is that a threat?
A motive for murder and a threat is too much for a single person.
I couldn't have killed him,
I was in my room all the time!
You went to the bathroom 5 times, so you had 5 possible occasions.
The bathroom? Which bathroom?
Calm down, Augustine...
Don't touch me!
Bravo, aunt Pierrette, focussing all attention on Augustine.
Well done. But I have to ask you a few questions.
I'm listening.
You said you've never been here?
-yes.
You're lying and I can prove it.
I swear I haven't told them anything,
Pierrette.
What's this?
-Yes, mama.
They know each other and keep in touch regularly.
They both like to play cards.
-Play cards?
What's this about, Chanel?
I might as well tell you.
Sometimes Pierrette comes to my room and stays the night.
My God!
I admit. I came to talk to my brother once.
Couldn't Chanel pass a message?
I bet she came for money.
-I've never asked for money.
He spend it on himself then?
-He knew I was having difficulties.
He helped me a few times.
-I can't believe this!
Mommy, daddy could do as he please.
So what.
I can react can't I.
It was my money!
It belonged to me.
Your greed will kill you sooner or later.
Do hear that?
How dare she...
This woman is terrible.
To be perfectly clear we must know exactly... what everyone has been doing tonight.
Mother, where were you?
-I already told you: in my room.
Did you leave it?
-No. Well yes... once.
To see how Catherine was.
I thought I heard her door.
She was reading.
So I went back to bed.
Catherine, did you get up?
-I went to the bathroom.
That's what mommy heard. I didn't see anything.
-Didn't you hear anything?
I was too absorbed in my book.
I didn't pay any attention.
Aunt asked me if I wanted to turn the lights off.
-You called me all sorts of names.
Stupid kid!
-I'll get you.
Suzon, I forgot something.
I heard a strange sound.
I looked through Augustine's keyhole, and I saw her... standing in front of the mirror holding something shiny.
I didn't think about it at first, but now I'm sure... she was sharpening a knife!
You nutcase!
That was my comb.
I was cleaning it.
-At 3 am.
Combs never sleep!
I can go get it.
No, Augustine. We believe you.
And you went to the bathroom 5 times?
Did you see anyone?
No one.
-You said you heard mother get out of bed.
That's right.
Mamy, seeing as you can walk again:
Did you get up?
-No.
Wait, yes...
Around 1 am,
I went to the living room to get my knitting.
I thought I heard a scream in Marcel's room.
I didn't recognize the voice, but I didn't worry myself.
I thought it was you, Gaby.
You hear someone scream and you automatically think it's me. Thanks.
Louise, do you know anything about this?
No. When I took his tea, he was all alone.
Did you see anyone?
Yes. Miss Augustine.
I thought you said you didn't see anyone?
I forgot. I went to get a drink.
-But you were sneaking around Marcel's room.
What happened?
You could have known if you slept together.
Being judged by my own children!
That's why I never had any.
A man never asked you, say it like it is.
Chanel, when did you leave?
Around midnight.
Before or after the tea?
-Shortly after.
How shortly?
-I don't know.
Five minutes later.
I did some cleaning up.
Louise wanted to bring the tea herself.
Why did you wanted to that yourself?
Monsieur asked me.
That's why.
It's all becoming clear now, young lady.
I'd rather be accused of sin than of murder.
Those two go hand in hand.
But I don't have to tell you that.
What are you insinuating?
And where were you tonight, Pierrette?
I was doing a personal visit that is none of your business... and that has nothing to do with this murder.
Are you sure you didn't see Marcel?
Yes, I'm sure.
So you are the last one that saw my husband alive, Louise.
Is that serious?
I can be accused of murder?
-No doubt!
Than I rather tell.
Sorry, miss Pierrette.
I could have known.
When I brought him his tea, his sister was there.
So, Pierrette. You've been lying.
Why were you with my husband.
I came to talk to my brother.
I was sad.
Why did you talk so loud?
You had a fight?
No. We even laughed.
-And mother thought it was me.
Excellent witness!
So you were following our conversation?
No, I left immediately, and I took the serving tray.
Pierrette, what did you do after that?
We talked some more, then I left.
I can confirm that. I saw her through the kitchen window.
Did she say anything else?
I'll tell you if you'll leave me alone.
She asked me to keep quiet and she gave me 10.000 francs.
Which I regret, little bimbo.
-What?
You sleep with everyone don't you.
-You don't? Even with the same ones.
And why did you give me the money?
I heard her telling Monsieur:
Give me the money or I'll kill you.
No, I said:
I'll kill myself.
No, I'll kill you.
-My poor Louise!
You have nothing to say.
You are merely a maid.
And you do? You are just a hooker.
-But I like it!
Stop it. You look like mad.
I've had enough of this!
I'm going to stop a car.
There is no longer any doubt.
The murderer is one of us.
It's one of the seven of you.
Hey, inspector Suzon, you forgot to question someone.
We?
-Yourself.
Myself?
-Yes.
You now know what we've been doing tonight, but you didn't tell us what you've been doing.
Nonsense.
She arrived this morning.
No she didn't, dear mother.
I saw Suzon here last night.
When?
-Around 4 am.
I opened my door and
I saw you entering our father's bedroom.
I didn't kill my father.
I swear.
Well try to explain anyway!
This is shocking news.
I took the train a day earlier.
Tonight I sneaked into the house.
I went up to daddy.
I had important news I only... wanted him to know.
Without his approval,
I would have never returned.
He was great.
Poor daddy...
He would help me, and told me to go back to the station to arrive according to plan.
I obeyed. That's all.
What was so important?
Tell me, dear!
I'm having a baby.
Madam! Madam!
What now? Weren't you going for help?
The gate is locked. We can't get out. We're stuck here!
I shouldn't have told you were already here.
That's ok. Mom had to know.
So you are having a baby?
-Yes.
What does your fiancée look like?
Does he resemble daddy?
No.
He's tall and blond, and has green eyes.
You are my love, my friend
All I dream about is you
You, my love: You, my friend
I only sing for you
My love, my friend
I can't live without you
My love, my friend
And I don't know why
I've never known any other boys except you
And if I did
I'll forgot about them
Comparing them makes no sense anyway
But my heart believes it
And it carries your name
You are my love, my friend
I only dream about you
You, my love: You, my friend
I only sing for you
My love, my friend
I can't live without you
My love, my friend
And I know very well why
You never know what happens with love
And I always thought
I wouldn't leave you
I left you
Even though I didn't want to
And sometimes I still sing for you
But love fades
You are my love, my friend
I only dream about you
You, my love: You, my love
I only sing for you
My love, my friend
I can't live without you
My love, my friend
And I don't know why?
Is he handsome?
-Yes.
I'm crazy about him.
-Lucky girl. What does he do?
He works in a bank.
His own bank?
-No.
Does he have a car?
-No.
What? Is he broke?
You still thinks money makes people happy?
Does he have a brother?
-No.
Too bad.
You are much too young for a boyfriend.
Too young...
Always the same!
I'm not a baby anymore!
I'm sick of it.
"Don't read. Don't throw stones.
Don't smoke!
Don't, don't, don't!"
And you dare lecture me?
After what happened to you?
I don't want you to make the same mistakes.
I want to protect you.
Me? Don't you worry about me.
Mom?
What is it?
More shocking news?
No, that was all.
A slut!
A slut, that's what you are.
Those things happen.
In your circles yes.
In ours people get married first.
"Circles" no longer exist.
That's progress.
Should I congratulate her then?
-You could be a bit more forgiving.
We can do without your advice.
I just want to help.
If I remember well, your belly was getting bigger too, when you married my brother.
Shut up, you snake!
Thank god Marcel was around.
In detective novels it goes like this:
One of us is lying.
That's the killer.
What helps her is other people lying, but for other reasons.
To find the murderer, we must all tell the truth.
Listen...
I have something to say...
Augustine! It's her heart.
Chanel, boil some water.
Suzon, get her medicine.
Where are they?
-In her night drawer.
She needs an injection!
Louise, get the medicine cabinet.
-Me?
I'm not a nurse.
I'm the maid.
But only you can do it!
Refusal is a crime.
As a maid I only do the housekeeping, laundry and meals.
You can go to jail if you refuse.
Everyone must know his place.
What if judges become doctors, or grocers ministers.
Save us your wisdom.
I order you to inject her.
I have no business dealing with your kind or your grocer...
So madam knows about my kind...?
But because you ask so nicely,
I'll grant madam her wishes.
I can't find anything!
She always moves things around.
I'm coming.
Aunt Augustine is looking so pale.
Isn't she faking?
-She's gaining conscience.
Her medicine are gone.
Someone is trying to kill her.
Baby, how are you feeling?
Terrible. My heart has stopped.
It will start beating again.
-I'm dying.
I need my injection. I'm dying!
-You are not dying.
You faint 2 times a day.
Why is everyone just standing there?
We want to help, but your medicine is missing.
Missing?
-We were afraid to tell you.
I get it! You want me to die.
Like a mutt in the streets.
So I'm not getting an injection.
That's how it is, isn't it?
Fine! I'll die.
I'm going like I came: without any help!
With my sick heart.
All alone.
Poor Marcel, only he was pure...
He's dead because of your corruption.
"Gondola of Love", chapter eight.
Mamy!
I've found the medicine.
-Hurry! Quick!
Careful. Watch it.
Where did you find them, Suzon?
-Under someone's bed.
Which bed?
-Your bed, mommy.
Mine? But that's impossible.
Someone is trying to accuse me.
-No doubt.
Whoever is doing this do us must be our enemy.
There is no other explanation.
-Thinking of me again?
Not in particular.
But you know you are in
Marcel's will.
He told me he left you
2 million.
So, Marcel thought about me?
-Don't act so innocent.
You knew he went to his notary, and when you were sure about your inheritance...
I have a different version to tell.
He wanted to include me in his will, so you interfered for your own benefit.
Repulsing!
-Is there a will or isn't there?
If there is, it's not looking good for me.
But if there isn't, you are in trouble.
I know the answer.
There is none.
I was talking to daddy about it yesterday
He said,
"I'm glad you know.
I'll be seeing my notary tomorrow.
I won't forgot you."
A clever way of saying,
"I'm innocent, daddy was going to put me in his will."
What a despicable insinuation!
You are a monster, Suzon.
I'm not accusing you.
I'm telling you like it is.
You dare to lecture me?
Look at your mother!
And repeat what you just said.
How can you be so bitter when you went through the same thing?
I'll never get over this.
Excellent acting!
-Shut up you!
Why don't you tell us where you where last night.
I'll save that for the police.
Surely with a man?
I'm dying. Hurry up!
You aren't dying, dearest.
Here's your shot.
Wonderful...
I saw something else under your bed.
-What?
Your bags. Packed...
Ready to leave.
Did you have any plans?
None of your business.
Tell me one thing.
Was daddy my real father?
I don't want to talk about that.
I have a right to know.
You were pregnant when you married daddy.
Tell me!
It doesn't matter anymore.
It's all in that past.
Marcel raised you like his own daughter.
Who is my father?
A man I loved.
You have his eyes.
His cheek bones.
His face.
It often touches me when you smile.
I look at you, but I see him.
In you.
Where is he now?
He died before you were born.
In a car accident.
I think about him every day.
Seeing you...
Having him so near me... makes me happy and sad.
Louise not wanting to help!
That isn't normal.
Leave that girl alone.
Why would she kill him?
Because personnel nowadays isn't what it used to be.
By the way, Chanel,
I don't understand something.
You said you left the house around midnight.
But I saw you coat and scarf around 1.30 am, when I went to get my knitting in the living room...
You aren't so quiet usually.
Answer me!
Yes, answer.
I came back after 1 am.
Why didn't you say so?
Because I thought you would find the murderer immediately.
Why did you come back?
I was looking for Pierrette.
And did you find her with daddy around 1 am? -Yes.
Why where you looking for Pierrette at that hour?
I cannot say...
We decided to tell the truth.
I love Pierrette and I wanted to protect her.
She likes the wrong kind.
I can't believe it.
Chanel, you love women?
-Is there a law against it?
Do you have something to complain about?
-But...
You must... You are ill.
Chanel's personal life is none of our business.
Sinners understand each other!
Mamy, stop being so prejudiced!
Where were we?
You wanted to protect Pierrette.
But from what?
I was jealous of her love for Marcel.
It's getting better and better!
Marcel and I were brother and sister, nothing more.
Maybe as kids...
-It depends on the family!
Forgive me, Pierrette.
Chanel, I trusted you completely!
You raised my children!
-I did nothing wrong, madam.
Without me, your daughters would have had nothing.
I won't stand and listen to this.
Especially to someone of your... nature!
If the police arrives,
I won't spare you.
As you wish, madam.
I have nothing more to hide.
Not to be alone
We get a dog
Surround us with roses
Or worship a cross
Not to be alone
We believe in fairy tales
Are fond of memories
A shadow, anything will do
Not to be alone
We long for spring
And when it's over
We long for the next
Not be alone
I love and wait
It makes me believe
That I'm not alone
Not to be alone
Not to be alone
Girls like girls
And boys
Like other boys
Not to be alone
Some children have
Children who are alone
Just like other children
Not to be alone
We build cathedrals
Where all lonely souls
Hold on to a star
Not to be alone
I love and wait
It makes me believe
That I'm not alone:
If you ladies are interested in the whole truth,
I have some more... interesting information to add.
-What is it now?
Marcel and your new maid have known each other for 5 years.
What?
5 Years of hotels and secret weekends.
This winter you were looking for a girl, so Louise had herself hired.
Now that's what I call "taking care of house".
You have enough problems of your own.
Did you already knew Monsieur?
Yes.
So you thought of this plan to come work here?
Yes. We were attracted to each other.
That surprises me.
You are so ordinary.
Maybe it was time for an ordinary woman.
He probably paid you.
Madam is always thinking about money.
But if you rather believe that...
I'm not believing anything, I want to know.
With a little imagination...
I gave Marcel orgasms like he had never experienced before.
In a way you didn't want to find out.
-Keep those obscenities to yourself!
Is it bad to give yourself completely to someone?
That's the most beautiful thing you can do in your life.
You missed your calling, you should have become a non.
I'm talking about love and you laugh.
But madam didn't like it I was so dedicated to my job... and relieved her of all her marital duties.
We shared the same bed.
Stop it. My daughters are here.
Didn't you want to know the truth.
Monsieur's death doesn't change anything.
I'd like to keep working for you.
It keeps getting better.
Nice state of affairs!
Poor Marcel!
I feel sorry for him.
You'd loved to comforted him.
-Is it my turn now?
So you got wind of Louise and
Marcel's affair... and at night you took revenge!
-How dare you? The girls!
The girls? Catherine is mean and lazy, ruined by those books, and Suzon is knocked up.
Yet she's questioning us as if she were Lady Justice herself!
Girls used to have some self-respect!
Now they go out, smoke, wear pants, camp and get pregnant.
How sad!
What do expect with such a mother.
Nice example you are.
Why don't you have any children then?
-Because I'm respected!
Is aunt still a virgin?
-Of course! Who would want her?
Gaby, please! Don't torment your sister any further. She almost died!
Stop protecting her.
And lecturing me.
An alcoholic witch, pretending to be a cripple widow!
You are a liar. And a hypocrite too, consumed by your own greed.
I should have let you suffer.
You ungrateful child!
How dare you?
Your husband is murdered.
Daddy too!
-What do you mean?
You poisoned him.
Literally and figuratively speaking.
My heart!
My heart is going to stop beating...
Now I know for sure.
What?
-Everything.
Or almost...
-Spill it!
One piece of evidence is missing.
Everyone stay here!
I have to go check something outside.
Give me 2 minutes, and I'll explain this murder.
Do you believe her?
-She know's something.
No one was allowed to leave and you let her go.
She'll get away, it's a trick!
-So she did it?
I figured she did.
Now's she's trying to get away.
There she is again!
Let's hide.
Just as I expected...
Where are they?
Why are they gone?
Where are you?
Chanel!
My God.
Is she dead?
-Because she knew...
Now we know for sure.
-What then?
She's not the murderer.
Say something.
You know something. I know you do.
She won't tell us anything.
You scared me.
Is Chanel ok?
-Yes, the bullet didn't hit her.
But she's not saying anything.
The murderer didn't want to kill her.
Or he's half blind.
She's hard to miss.
Maybe he wasn't wearing his glasses.
If you ask me, he wanted to scare her.
In any case, I'm exhausted.
Not surprising considering your "dedication".
-Could be.
Since you spy, did you also hear him moaning with pleasure?
Yes, I mean... I don't know.
But...
Now that we are talking about it,
I would like to...
I would like to ask you something,
Louise.
Yes?
No, never mind.
Go ahead, ask me.
I just wanted to ask how...
How to seduce a man...
You are asking me, the maid, how I seduced Marcel?
Yes, please.
You know, miss...
Femininity, charm... and the art of seducing can't be learned.
You either have it or you don't.
You can try a little.
Hairstyle...
Glasses...
Don't bother
Looking behind
The school board is empty
The chalk has faded
There is no longer a trace
And I live my life, head or tails
Al my feelings, head or tails
For ever and ever, head or tails
It doesn't matter to me
Sometimes I make it
Sometimes I don't
I want to live, head or tails
My love is head or tails
Everything blurred, head or tails
I try everything
Sometimes I get lost
Sometimes I shine
Everyday in front of my mirror
I see dreams appear
And dreams disappear
And time is flying by
But I live my life, head or tails
Al my feeling, head or tails
Every sensation, head or tails
Without hesitation
Sometimes I make it
Sometimes I don't
And I live my life, head or tails
Al my feelings, head or tails
For ever and ever, head or tails
It doesn't matter to me
Sometimes I make it
Sometimes I don't
I can't.
I just can't.
Our dear Augustine!
You always wanted daddy too.
Too bad he went for the maid.
Bitch! Just as mean as your mother.
As long as I'm no longer a virgin at your age.
I've had it.
We must get out of here.
I don't want to be humiliated any longer.
Mommy, can you hear me? Say something!
What did the knife in
Marcel's back look like?
Louise says it was a dagger, but she may be lying.
If you couldn't see the blade, then how could she know?
Stop tormenting yourself.
It's no longer our problem.
Let's go pack.
What if the handle was not made of bone but something else?
It couldn't be a fishing knife...
You are confused by what Gaby said.
What did Gaby say?
-That you killed father.
What's so funny?
It's a despicable lie...
It's not a lie, dear.
It's the truth.
Have you lost your mind?
Why would you have killed father?
There are different kinds of women, Augustine.
And different times, different generations.
Your father...
Your father gave me a good life, without worries.
He gave me everything
I wanted...
He just started his career.
His goal was to make a fortune.
You can't even imagine.
He was brilliant.
He treated me with sensitivity and respect.
A real gentleman.
But I couldn't stand him!
Can you imagine a life with a man you don't love?
And who you have nothing to blame.
Knowing you're stuck with him.
Divorce was out of the question in those days.
So it's true.
I robbed you of a father... and of his money.
That's what made me suffer the most.
That's what made you suffer?
You suffered? You?
How dare you say that, when I never got over my father's death.
Forgive me, dear.
I'll kill you...
-No!
I'll kill you!
-Yes, kill me.
I'll kill you!
-Go ahead!
With my bare hands!
-Do it, quickly!
I'll kill you!
-Hurry up!
Stop it, Augustine!
What are you doing?
She killed daddy.
-I know, but it's too late now.
Kill me please.
-Stop it.
She's mad.
I've been living with a lunatic.
I took care of her, cuddled and kissed her! And she's insane!
Stop it, both of you!
-A lunatic!
Kill me!
-That's enough!
Mamy? Mamy?
Is she dead?
-Only unconscious. Open the closet.
Really?
-She'll calm down in there.
I'm sick of this.
Really sick.
What's the matter? Are you upset?
Why didn't you ever tell me?
I wanted to protect you.
I ruined my life.
I ruined my life.
No, you are exhausted.
Lie down a bit, Titine.
What a day.
In one day
I've grown 10 years older.
So did I.
It feels good.
-Oh really?
Yes, I feel like a woman now... instead of a child that no one takes serious.
Now they listen to me.
They are even afraid of what I have to say.
I'm glad Chanel is unharmed.
Al those awful things we've heard...
Strange that she's not talking though.
Either she can't, or she won't.
She's protecting someone.
I doubt it.
Tell me...
Do you believe Mamy poisoned Papy?
I don't know, I hope not.
They hate each other so much, they lie to hurt each other.
I hope we won't turn out like that.
How does it feel to sleep with a boy?
Don't you know?
-Of course. But how does it feel?
You liked it?
Well... it depends.
Never mind. Tell me about school.
How is your English?
You are afraid to answer.
Stop all those questions.
Looks like an obsession.
Pardon me.
Never suspected you were so... frigid.
'Frigid'? Is that a new word?
It means your heart is made of ice.
Too cold to feel pleasure.
Stop it.
I'm warning you!
You can't beat me anymore.
I've grown to old for that.
Hit me again and I'll tell your boyfriend you are frigid.
So what?
You're not even my real sister.
What?
Mom says dad is not my real father.
That's not true!
Thank god he's not.
How can you say that?
You have to swear you won't tell anyone.
I swear.
The baby I'm having?
It's Marcel's.
Louise? My coat, please.
Just put it there.
No, better put it here.
What are you doing?
Playing lady of the house?
-Yes.
I'm tired of being your maid.
You call this clean? Give me that piece of cloth. I want it shining.
You are mad!
Where do you think you are?
In a badly managed household.
The lady of the house is incompetent and doesn't reflect any authority.
How dare you judge me?
You are my servant.
Me working here, was not for myself, nor for Monsieur... but for you madam.
Unfortunately you disappointed me today because of your weakness and mediocrity.
Who is this woman?
Your former employer?
Yes, madam.
And you respected her?
Yes... I loved her.
Darlings, I don't know where this is going...
Chanel won't speak,
Augustine won't stop crying,
Mamy is making things up and Louise is getting arrogant.
Where is Pierrette?
-I don't know.
Me neither.
I hope she's not gone.
-Gone?
In the dark, with all this snow?
-That woman is dangerous.
She didn't answer a single question honestly.
Coffee, madam?
-Yes please.
Louise!
-Yes, miss?
Did you know Pierrette was gone?
She can't be far.
The gate is locked. I don't see her climbing over the wall.
Are her things still here?
-Her bag is still there.
So who was right?
I didn't suspect either of you.
-How is that possible?
Pierrette and Marcel were having a fight last night.
Then she spent the night with Chanel.
This morning she came back and she killed him.
In stead of going home, like she said, she waited and came back, and used the mysterious phone call as an excuse.
You think so?
-I'm sure of it.
She wanted to get rid of her friend Chanel or intimidate her.
Madam, look!
Augustine, what happened to you?
Nothing. I just wanted to be pretty for a change.
Can't I be?
Of course you can.
Is that one of my old dresses?
-I borrowed it for a moment.
You don't mind, I hope?
-Not at all.
You look beautiful, aunt.
Nice to see you like this.
Incredible...
A total change.
Get used to it.
What was that?
-It came from upstairs.
Pierrette is coming to kill us.
What shall we do?
-Nothing.
We'll hide this gun and find out what she's up to. Come on.
Where were you, Pierrette?
-In the bathroom.
Did Chanel tell you anything?
-No, don't worry.
What were you doing in the bathroom?
-Nothing.
Augustine, you look like one those heroines from your novels.
'The Lady with the Camelias'.
-Don't you like flowers?
Sure I do. Especially camelias.
A flower with no scent.
Why are you staring at me like that?
Well, because of this.
It was in your purse.
-Someone put it there, I swear.
Of course.
Easy to prove. The police won't find my fingerprints, while... you did touch it.
-I didn't think of that.
Now listen.
The killer has made sure that we couldn't call the police.
We must get out of here, it's a matter of life and death.
The gate is closed.
We'll try climbing over it using a ladder.
I'm going with you.
-Let's go.
Mom, keep an eye on Pierrette.
Why are you smiling?
You may thank me for keeping my mouth shut.
About what?
You have a lover.
A lover? Is that your latest discovery?
-No, my first.
I've known for a while...
And that's why I killed my husband?
-I didn't say that.
It's too obvious.
If all unfaithful women did that, there would be no more men.
Or lovers.
They usually are both.
They want to buy me cars
Jewels and fur coats
You never!
They promise me a fortune
And also the moon
You never:
And every time they call
They tell me I'm beautiful
You never:
They prey to me and worship me
Yet I ignore them
You know
Man, you're a man like any man
I know
And because you're my man, I forgive you
You never
They make up stories
And I pretend to believe them
You never
They promise to be faithful forever
You never
And when they tell me they love me
They need too many words
You never
I don't care for their fortune
Let them send that to the moon
Without regret!
Man, you're a man like any man
I know
And because you're my man
I forgive you
You never
I don't understand how a man can love you.
You probably think you're more attractive?
The desire of a man is an incompleteness, which we encourage.
No?
Is that how you caught
Chanel in your web?
And seduced her?
Chanel didn't need me for that.
I'm so disappointed in men, that I often prefer women.
Believe me, love between women is not shocking at all.
It's even so nice you should try it to forget about all the men.
Did men make you suffer so much?
-Yes.
Even Marcel?
-Especially Marcel.
I got even with those other men.
My brother was my only family.
When I came here, he was a coward.
He rejected me and locked me out.
I can't forget that.
So I made sure he... gave me money.
Louise heard it correctly:
"Give me the money or I'll kill you."
If you don't help a sister in need, you have to pay.
Now you are accusing yourself.
No. You don't kill your benefactor.
Neither of us would.
You think I'm innocent?
I'm sure of it.
I want to thank you for your discretion.
Concerning my daughters.
Naturally... amongst women.
I have to tell you something.
I should have been long gone.
I wanted to leave my husband.
My bags were packed.
But he was murdered the night
I wanted to leave.
Horrible.
Poor Marcel.
And what's to become of me?
I could give you the money
Marcel refused to give.
That's not necessary. I lied.
He did give it to me.
Why didn't you say so?
I don't have it anymore.
I gave it away.
To a man I love.
Even I sometimes pay.
He needed the money for a trip to Mexico.
To Mexico?
How much did you give him?
-500.000 francs.
In an envelope?
-Yes, a big blue envelope.
What's the matter?
Don't tell me you...
Who's your lover?
You know. My husband's partner,
Jacques Farnoux.
Jacques is your lover?
That is my envelope...
-You can have it back.
It's empty!
The money is gone.
Someone knew about it.
You took Jacques from me, just like my brother.
With your neat and tidy looks!
I failed as a citizen, but you as a whore. I could strangle you.
That's enough!
Stand up! Or I'll shoot.
-Go on.
Shoot! Have the guts.
Do it, you're experienced.
Mom, what are you doing?
Nothing!
We were just talking.
We can see that.
-It's not what you think.
We don't think. We see.
Any success with the ladder?
The wall is too high and there is too much snow. We would fall on the road.
I could have been killed.
-But that's my coat!
Everyone is stealing from me.
First my sister, now my maid.
It kind of suits me.
-I bet it does. Take it of!
Get Mamy out of the closet.
Mamy is in the closet?
-Yes, she's taking a siesta
Unbelievable!
Mamy, is everything fine?
Answer me!
Where am I? What's happening?
I don't remember anything.
-Some things are better to be forgotten.
I had this strange dream...
Marcel was dead.
Still no police.
Why did you get up, Chanel?
This nonsense has been going on far to long.
I have to tell.
She knows everything.
She's playing a game with us.
The revenge of the servants!
-You are wrong.
It's a sad case of family affairs.
-Well? We are listening.
It's a bizarre story.
Catherine, get over here.
Do you know everything, Chanel?
Yes.
Come one, Catherine. Tell us.
Listen. I'm going to tell you a nice Christmas carol.
There once was a good man with 8 women vexing him.
He fought and fought, but they always won.
Last night, that poor man went to bed more betrayed and broken than ever.
His 8 women continued as usual.
Fortunately his daughter Catherine, who was hiding, heard and saw everything.
10 pm. Act 1.
His mother-in-law refused to give him her shares.
My sweet Marcel,
I know you are bankrupt.
I wanted to give you my shares, but someone stole them.
The old lady could have saved him, but her greed made her lie.
Act 2. 10.30 pm.
Augustine, residential serpent, comes flirting and spouting the latest gossip.
I really love my sister.
She's...
We're simply very different.
Aunt didn't kill dad.
She just made him more sick.
But that's no crime.
Around 11 pm.: next attack.
His wife, my mother, tells him she's going to leave him.
For the man who caused his bankruptcy, his partner, Jacques Farnoux!
At 11.30 pm.,
Louise comes in dressed as a vamp.
She's a vicious maid but also perverted.
Her special talents include the misfortune of the man of the house.
Shortly thereafter, Pierrette comes in, daddy's sister.
She milks her cow:
500.000 francs. Not bad!
Thanks.
In the mean time, Chanel is enchanted by the ex stripper, a pathetic jealous scene.
Now come to the hunting lodge.
And to tip it all of...
Suzon, his daughter, comes straight from London, to tell him she's pregnant.
And then, good night!
Who saw daddy after that?
Are you still listening?
You're all ears now.
Only I remain.
-My little girl.
Poor daddy.
I found him this morning around 6.
He was crying.
A father crying is terrible.
Did you ever see that?
There was a big tear on the tip of his nose.
He said: "You're a sweet daughter.
A bookworm with dirty hands but you're everything I got."
I swore to make him happy, no matter what.
But he kept crying.
He said: "It seems wonderful to be dead."
I felt sorry for him.
Pity.
Then I decided to free him from his misery.
You're not saying you...
-Murdered daddy?
Murdered?
Daddy was never dead!
Daddy was never dead!
He's alive! Behind that door!
I conceived this macabre scheme to test you all.
I phoned Pierrette.
Sabotaged the phone and the car, hid the medicine, stole the gun and mom's money... and hid daddy's key, so he could have some peace and quiet.
It was all part of my plan and you fell for it.
You were afraid.
Only Chanel got suspicious.
You saw daddy at the window?
-Yes.
Sorry about the gunshot, but you couldn't say anything... to discover the truth and expose everyone.
Daddy is alive and well behind this door.
He watched everything.
Daddy, freed from you, awaits his little Catherine to leave here. Far away.
I'm the only one who truly loves him.
Heard enough, daddy?
I'm coming.
No one will hurt you anymore.
I'll protect you.
I'll give you everything.
Daddy?
Daddy!
I was only joking...
Now you've really killed him!
Nothing a man owns, really belongs to him
Nor his power, nor his weakness, nor his heart
And if he opens his arms
His shadow forms a cross
When he has found happiness, he ruins it
His life is a strange and bitter divorce
There's no such thing as happy love
His life is like those soldiers without weapons destined to pursue another goal in life
Why would we get up in the morning when the night finds them unarmed and unsure
Say these word and hold your tears
There's no such thing as happy love
My beautiful love, my dear love, my torn heart
I carry you like a wounded bird
And they, ignorant, watch us pass
And repeat my words that die instantly in your big eyes
There's no such thing as happy love
The moment we learn how to live it's too late
Our hearts cry together in the night
It takes much regret to atone for a sensation
It takes much grief for the most simple songs
Lot's of tears for a melody played on guitar
There's no such thing as happy love
Who'll pinch me to wake me up?
Who will laugh at me when I fall?
Whose breath will I listen for...
...so that I may sleep?
Whose hand will I hold...
...so that I may walk?
We may question ourselves at moments such as these.
Did we make the right decision to settle here?
We are grateful for the time we have been given.
What manner of spectacle has attracted your attention so splendidly?
I ought to carry it in my pocket to help me teach.
Who came upon this?
- Philip, did you move this?
- No, Mr. Walker.
I inspected it carefully. Its head was twisted back and much of its fur removed.
- I see.
- It was murdered.
But who is the culprit?
Who has done this heinous act?
- Those We Don't Speak Of killed it.
- There it is.
Why would such a notion come into your mind?
- They're meat eaters.
- Mmm.
They have large claws.
Children...
...Those We Don't Speak Of have not breached our borders for many years.
We do not go into their woods, they do not come into our valley.
It is a truce.
We do not threaten them.
Why would they do this?
And we ought not to overlook the Flight of the Birds.
We didn't have it last year and I, for one, missed it desperately.
And I know your wife missed the children dressed in feathers and such.
- I am fond of it.
- Mmm.
I do not have a say in this matter.
August Nicholson is chair of today's meeting.
There's a young man who has requested a word with the elders.
Well, do have him come forward.
Alice.
Hello, Lucius.
"My mother is unaware of the reason for my visit today."
"She did not give her consent or consult me in any form."
"The passing of little
Daniel Nicholson from illness, and other events, have weighed on my thoughts."
"I ask permission to cross into the forbidden woods and travel to the nearest town."
"I will gather new medicines, and I will return."
"With regards to
Those We Don't Speak Of,
I am certain they will let me pass."
"Creatures can sense emotion and fear."
"They will see I am pure of intention, and not afraid."
"The end."
What goes on in that head of yours?
Say something, Lucius.
Finton Coin is in the tower, and I've promised to sit with him.
Hmm.
Do you ever think of the towns, Finton?
The towns?
What for?
They're wicked places where wicked people live. That's all.
Thank you, Lucius.
You're a good friend.
I do hope no one saw you.
What we seem to have amongst us is a predator of some type, most likely a coyote or a wolf.
Its manner of... of killing and removing the fur, but leaving the flesh torn, may be a sign that this animal suffers from madness.
And for the next fortnight, we should be vigilant for sightings of this coyote.
Keep careful watch over our little ones as they play on the hills.
As for the other notion...
...we do not believe our boundary has been breached.
Those We Don't Speak Of are much larger creatures than coyotes...
...and we would know if they had been here.
Ahh, it's frightful, this business with the coyote. Is it not, Papa?
- Do not feel worried, Kitty.
- You are not troubled?
I'm certain it will all end soon.
- Can we speak on other matters, then?
- It would be a relief.
I'm in love!
I want your permission to marry, Papa.
There's a proper manner in which things are supposed to happen.
Such as the boy would normally be standing next to you, in a moment such as this...
Where is the boy in all this, Kitty?
I haven't spoken to him as of yet.
The young man is unaware of your intentions?
He has a quiet way. I was going to talk with him, Papa, but not without your blessings.
I won't talk with him without your blessings.
Kitty!
It's Lucius Hunt.
Lucius?
You think badly of him?
- No, no. I have been thinking about him.
- He's not like the other boys, Papa.
He doesn't joke or bounce about.
No, he certainly does not.
Do I have your blessings, then?
Look, do me one favor first.
Do not tell anyone else of your burstings until you have spoken with the young man.
Good afternoon, Lucius.
I wanted to... to... to tell you something.
I love you, Lucius.
I love you... like the day is long.
I love you more than the sun and the moon together.
And if you feel the same way, then we should not hide it any longer.
It's a gift, love is.
We should be thankful.
We should bellow it out with all the breath in our lungs.
Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you!
Shh, shh.
Shh.
# Baby, sleep, gently sleep
# Life is long and love is deep
# Time will be sweet for thee
# All the world to see
# Time to look about and know
# How the shadows come and go
# How the breeze stirs the trees
# How the blossoms grow
I often wondered if you and my son bonded because neither of you is fond of speaking.
You're very kind.
You must pardon my manners.
I haven't slept in many nights.
You are doing capital,
Jamison.
Just a few more moments, huh?
Gather your bravery.
Do not jostle about so. You'll ruin my shirt.
They made a sound when I made a sound, and they mimic before they attack.
Have courage, man.
That's a wives' tale. It isn't true.
Do not falter. Steel yourself!
You know, like a dog can smell you.
- Pardon me, Mr. Nicholson?
- Hmm.
You may run from sorrow, as we have.
Sorrow will find you.
It can smell you.
Hurry.
I didn't know you could run so fast.
We're still for running and staying... Hey!
Noah ought to be punished. He whacked little Joseph with a stick again.
- Ouch!
- No more hitting! Put it down!
Ow, ow, ow!
Why don't they grab it?
Noah Percy!
Stop your fussing right this moment.
You're in trouble, you know.
- No hitting, no hitting.
- I'm to place you in the quiet room.
Um, I'll cry quarts.
- What if we strike a deal?
- Yeah, capital idea.
It would be prudent to keep our deal a secret. Can you do that?
Can I keep a secret?
Like a church mouse.
You needn't go to the quiet room if you a take an oath to never strike any person again.
- No hitting, no hitting.
- No. No hitting.
- No hitting.
- No hitting.
No hitting.
The deal is struck.
We ought not return right away, huh?
What shall we do with our stolen time?
- Hmm.
- Hmm.
- Hmm. Shall we have a foot race?
- Yes.
- Up the hill to the resting rock?
- No cheating.
What a deeply scandalous thing to say.
I insist you take that back.
Is that the school bell?
Ivy, you cheated!
I know! I'm sorry!
Whoo!
My sister cried a lot.
You wonder how I recognized you?
Some people - just a handful, mind you - give off the tiniest color.
It's faint, like a haze.
It's the only thing
I ever see in the darkness.
Papa has it, too.
Do you wonder what your color is?
Well, that I won't tell you.
It's not ladylike to speak of such things.
You shouldn't even have asked.
You run like a boy.
Thank you.
I know why you denied my sister.
When I was younger...
...you used to hold my arm when I walked.
Then suddenly, you stopped.
One day, I even tripped in your presence, and nearly fell.
I was faking, of course, but still, you did not hold me.
Sometimes we don't do things we want to do so that others won't know we want to do them.
What?
What's this? Oh, berries.
What a splendid present.
Be cautious.
You are holding the bad color.
This color attracts Those We Don't
Speak Of. You must bury it.
You ought not to pick that color berry any more.
He picked it from his pocket.
What's wrong?
Your breathing has changed.
I've never set eyes on these before.
You did not pick that now.
Where did you find this?
"Today at Resting Rock,
Noah Percy handed Ivy Walker berries of the bad color."
"When asked where he found these berries, for they were not like others I have seen, he pointed to the drawing upon Resting Rock."
"It is my belief that Noah Percy has entered the woods, and has done so on many occasions."
"It is also my belief that, because of his innocence, those creatures who reside in the woods did not harm him."
"This strengthens my feeling that they will let me pass if they sense I am not a threat."
We shall speak of the town, just this once, and we shall never speak of it again.
Your father left for the market on a Tuesday, at a quarter past nine in the morning.
He was found robbed and naked in the filthy river, two days later.
Why'd you tell me this blackness?
So you will know the nature of what you desire.
I do not desire it.
My intentions are true to my word.
I think of nothing but the people of this village.
Forgive me.
I am but scared for my only son's life.
I am not the one with secrets.
What is your meaning?
There are secrets in every corner of this village.
Do you not feel it? Do you not see it?
That is for my own well-being, so the evil things from my past are kept close and not forgotten.
Forgetting would be to let them be born again in another form.
Then let us open it.
No!
Perhaps we should speak with Edward Walker together.
- He may be able...
- He hides, too.
He hides his feelings for you.
Oh.
Sometimes we don't do things, yet others know we want to do things, so we don't do them.
What nonsense are you saying?
You needn't worry.
Nothing will happen to me.
You remind me of a colt sometimes.
What makes you think he has feelings for me?
He never touches you.
There's no escape!
Oh, hello.
I was just playing a game with Noah.
The rascal must have gone to hide in my house again.
Houses are against the rules!
He knows that.
Are you all right?
We're tending to the children tonight,
Kitty and I. I should be with her. Be well.
I heard my parents speaking of you.
I know of your request to go to the towns.
I think it is noble, but I do not think it is right.
Are you not angry you have no sight?
I see the world, Lucius Hunt.
Just not as you see it.
What of Noah, then?
What if there are medicines for Noah that could help him be still and to learn?
May we stop speaking of this?
It is putting knots in my stomach.
Kitty is to be married.
She's found love, again, with Christop Crane.
You think it an odd choice, right?
You know, he won't sit back in his chair for fear of setting wrinkles on his shirts.
But he does have a gentlemanly way about him...
...and he does care for my sister deeply.
I think Kitty is blessed.
I am blessed as well.
My older sister is now spoken for.
I am now free to receive interest from anyone...
...who might have interest.
I'm going to get you. Oh!
I got you. I got you.
Can you fetch a blanket for me?
Have you seen Noah?
Lucius?
Lucius?
- Hurry, to the cellar!
- Oh, good gracious!
- They're coming. They're coming.
- Close the door.
- Noah, close the door, OK?
- They're coming.
- Close the door.
- Coming!
Here we go.
- Noah, come on inside!
- Come on inside!
Everyone, inside!
Everyone, inside!
- They're coming. Come on in.
- Let's close the door.
- Lucius is outside, walking.
- They're coming.
He's inside safe somewhere!
Please, close the door!
He'll come back to make sure we're safe.
Ivy! Ivy, please.
- Please.
- No.
Don't let them in.
Come on in.
By the markings we find this morning on our homes...
...I feel they were warning us.
They acted as if threatened.
Creatures have never attacked us without reason.
Does anyone here know of a reason...
...why these events may have occurred?
Who has written this note?
"Please read so that all may hear."
"I have brought this burden upon us."
"On the day before last,
I crossed the forbidden line into Covington Woods..."
"... and was witnessed there by Those We Don't Speak Of."
"I am deeply sorry."
"I have shamed myself and my family."
"I pray that my actions will cause no further pains."
"With deepest sorrow, Lucius Hunt."
Is he in trouble?
Do not fret.
You are fearless in a way that I shall never know.
We are grateful...
...for the time we have been given.
Yes. Yes, indeed.
Cheers.
I had an elder sister.
Mrs. Clack, you've been keeping secrets.
Oh, Kitty reminds me of her so.
What manner of person was she?
- Saucy.
- Oh.
And we fought endlessly.
May I ask her name?
Why did she not come to Covington Woods?
My sister did not live past her 23rd birthday.
A group of men took her life in an alley by our home.
Please rise!
Come on.
She's not going to squeeze my shirt like that, is she?
Many blessings on this most joyous of days.
It was a rare and lovely ceremony, was it not?
Glorious.
I saw your hand move to your eyes on more than one occasion.
That must have been dust of some matter.
Mr. Walker!
- Mr. Walker!
- Mr. Walker!
Behind them.
How did she deal with this brightness?
Help us out.
Where are the rest of them?
Speak up.
- They're in the village.
- What?
They left more warnings.
They wish us to leave.
That cannot be.
One saw us.
It ran off into the darkness.
You are certain?
Can you boys stay close to Ivy here?
She'll tell you some funny stories and have you laughing soon.
We will go together.
Livestock has been taken and skinned.
The hides and feathers are missing.
There are marks on the door where it was opened.
The marks are high.
Coyotes cannot reach that height.
The elders are going to have an inquiry tomorrow.
Each member of the village is to be questioned in the meeting hall.
To see how the border was breached?
Yes.
It is cold outside.
You ought to go in.
Why are you on this porch?
It is not safe.
There are other porches.
Do you find me too much of a tomboy?
I do long to do boy things...
...like that game the boys play at the stump.
They put their backs to the woods, and see how long they can wait before getting scared.
That's so exciting.
I understand you hold the record.
It will never be broken, they say.
It's just children's games.
How is it you are brave when all the rest of us shake in our boots?
I do not worry about what will happen, only what needs to be done.
How did you know I was here?
I saw you out the window.
No...
...I won't tell you your color.
Stop asking.
When we are married, will you dance with me?
I find dancing very agreeable.
Why can you not say what is in your head?
Why can you not stop saying what is in yours?
Why must you lead, when I want to lead?
If I want to dance, I will ask you to dance.
If I want to speak,
I will open my mouth and speak.
Everyone is forever plaguing me to speak further.
Why? What good is it to tell you you are in my every thought from the time I wake?
What good can come from my saying
I- I sometimes cannot think clearly, or do my work properly?
What gain can rise from my telling you the only time I feel fear as others do...
...is when I think of you in harm?
That is why I am on this porch, Ivy Walker.
I fear for your safety before all others.
And, yes...
...I will dance with you on our wedding night.
I had been to the storage shed twice to fetch food prior to the wedding ceremony.
And the livestock was untouched at that time?
Yes, Mrs. Hunt.
All was as it should be.
Thank you, Beatrice.
I beg your pardon.
Is it true... about Lucius and Ivy?
There are whispers all over the village.
We were informed early this morning of their intentions.
It is amazing to witness which two people love chooses to unite.
It follows no rules.
Kitty...
I wanted to speak with you first.
I would not want you to feel pain, in any fashion.
You are my cherished one.
If you were to feel badly about Lucius, I would not have it.
One love to sacrifice another love is not right.
There is nothing you could do that would sacrifice my love for you.
You are my cherished one as well.
God bless you and your life together.
What's happened?
Is this about Ivy and myself?
I know you are very fond of her.
And I know she is fond of you.
There are different types of love.
Oh.
Oh, God.
Oh, Ivy...
Noah?
You'll be late for the meeting hall. Would you like your father to walk you there?
Noah?
Oh...
The bad... The bad color.
Oh...
The bad color, the bad color...
Mama!
- I beg your pardon.
- What is it?
There's been an accident.
Noah Percy was found with quarts of blood upon his clothes and hands.
The blood was not his own, and he will not speak as to whose it is.
God in heaven.
Ivy!
Is there anyone injured in here?
Has anyone been hurt in this home?
Is anyone in here?
Is anyone hurt in this house?
Lucius?
Lucius Hunt!
You answer me right this moment!
Is anyone hurt in this house?
They're fine.
Mr. Walker!
Joseph!
Papa... I cannot see his color.
Ivy.
Come away. Come away.
Come away. Here, take her.
Take her.
No!
He has suffered a great deal.
He may pass at any time.
Please give him all your prayers and good thoughts.
He will hear them.
Turn!
I am in love.
I know.
He is in love with me.
I know.
If he dies...
...all that is life to me will die with him.
I ask permission...
...to travel through Covington Woods...
...and go to the towns...
...to retrieve medicines...
...that may save...
...Lucius Hunt.
You are my father.
I will listen to you in all things.
I will trust your decision.
I've done what I can to close the wounds. There's an infection.
What can be done to mend him?
We can only pray.
If there were no limitations, what could be done?
Hmm?
What are you asking me?
Is there anything at all that can be done to mend the boy?
Please, Victor. Would you be so kind as to answer my question?
If the infection is contained, he may still survive.
I must speak up.
You have a restless spirit.
I know the thing that is in your head.
You're thinking of going to the towns.
Tell me I'm wrong.
You have made an oath, Edward, as all have, never to go back.
It is a painful bargain, but no good can come without sacrifice.
These are your words I'm saying.
You cannot break the oath.
- It is sacred.
- It is a crime, what has happened to Lucius.
You have taken the oath.
You and the rest of the elders...
Are you listening to me?
You...
...have taken the oath.
The moment I heard my daughter's vision had finally failed her, and that she would forever be blind,
I was sitting in that very chair.
I was so ashamed.
What do you know about your grandfather?
He was the wealthiest man in the towns?
That he was. He had a gift for that.
If he was given one dollar, in less than a fortnight, he would have turned it into five.
You do not know of money.
It is not part of our life here.
Money can be a wicked thing.
It can turn men's hearts black - good men's hearts.
My father could not see this.
For all his gifts, he was a poor judge of a man's character.
Your grandfather was a good man, Ivy.
He had a laugh that could be heard three houses away.
He used to hold my hand as I hold yours.
He taught me strength and showed me love, and told me to lead when others would only follow.
Your grandfather, James Walker, died in his sleep.
A man put a gun to his head and shot him while he dreamed.
I tell you this so you will understand some of the reasons for my actions, and...
...and the actions of others.
You are a strong one, Ivy.
You lead when others would follow.
You see light when there is only darkness.
I trust you.
I trust you among all others.
Thank you, Father.
Ivy, do you know where you are?
At the old shed that is not to be used.
Yeah.
- Ivy.
- Yes, Father?
Do your very best not to scream.
What?
I am leaving to fetch you medicines.
I had a difficult time getting away.
What is it?
Ivy...
...has asked...
...to go to the towns...
...for medicines.
Christop.
Christop... you needn't be scared.
We have the magic rocks.
They will keep us safe.
Why have we not heard of these rocks before?
Christop, please.
Do not leave us.
There is nothing to fear.
Then why do you wear the cloak of the safe color?
We will light torches.
It will be safe.
It is forbidden.
Christop.
Ivy... there's something in these woods.
It turns my stomach to rot.
You will be safe. They will not harm you, because you cannot see.
They will take pity on you, the way they took pity on Noah when... when he ventured in the woods.
They will kill me, Ivy.
I cannot stay.
You're better in these woods than most boys. Anyone would say so.
It is my burden, Finton.
- You may go.
- Come with me.
Do your very best not to scream.
There's an odd smell.
It is ahead of you.
What is it?
I cannot explain in words.
It is just a few steps.
- Those We Don't Speak Of!
- Do not be frightened.
It is only farce.
Do not be frightened.
There did exist rumors of creatures in these woods.
It is in one of the history books
I used to teach in the towns.
The screams from the woods?
We created those sounds.
The Ceremony of Meat?
We remove it ourselves.
An elder is always assigned.
The drills - they are farce, too?
We did not want anyone to go to the towns, Ivy.
What about the animals - the skinned ones?
- Are the elders responsible for that, too?
- I believe one of the elders is responsible.
It will not happen again.
There is no one in this village who has not lost someone irreplaceable, who has not felt loss so deeply that they questioned the very merit of living at all.
It is a darkness I wished...
...you would never know.
Forgive us our silly lies, Ivy.
They were not meant to harm.
I am... sad for you, Papa.
For all the elders.
On this paper has been written a tool of medicine.
It is common in the towns.
You will go... with two escorts.
Follow the sounds of the stream.
A half day's journey will bring you to a hidden road.
At this hidden road, the two escorts will wait as you continue.
You alone will follow the road...
...and leave Covington Woods.
You are to tell no one in the towns where we are...
...and return with haste.
I cannot come with you.
You gave your heart to this boy.
He is in need.
Are you ready to take this burden, which, by right, is yours and yours alone?
I am making fresh cloths for Lucius.
He needs them.
Alice, I've sent for help.
I've sent Ivy to the towns.
You cannot.
It is all that I can give you.
It is all that I can give you.
I accept.
- What have you done?
- He is the victim of a crime.
We have agreed never to go back. Never.
What was the purpose of our leaving?
Let us not forget it was out of hope of something good and right.
You should not have made decisions without us.
- You have gone too far.
- I'm guilty, Robert!
I made a decision of the heart.
I cannot look into another's eyes and see the same look
I see in August's without justification!
It is too painful. I cannot bear it!
You have jeopardized everything we've made.
Who do you think will continue this place, this life?
Do you plan to live forever?
It is in them that our future lies.
It is in Ivy and Lucius that this... this way of life will continue.
Yes, I have risked! I hope I am always able to risk everything for the just and right cause.
If we did not make this decision, we could never again call ourselves innocent.
And that, in the end, is what we have protected here - innocence!
That, I'm not ready to give up.
Let her go.
If it ends, it ends.
We can move towards hope.
It's what's beautiful about this place.
We must not run from heartache.
You know, my brother was slain in the towns.
The rest of my family died here.
Heartache is a part of life.
We know that now.
Ivy's running toward hope.
Let her run.
If this place is worthy, she'll be successful in her quest.
How could you have sent her?
She's blind.
She's more capable than most in this village...
...and she is led by love.
The world moves for love.
It kneels before it in awe.
# All the world to see
# Time to look about and know
# How the shadows come and go
# How the breeze stirs the trees
# How the blossoms grow
# Sleep, baby, sleep
# Sleep, gently sleep
There did exist rumors of creatures in these woods.
It is in one of the history books
I used to teach in the towns.
It is not real.
It is not real.
Noah?
- Oh, my God. What is this?
- What is this?
Where is he?
He found one of the suits we kept under the floorboards.
Oh, no.
Oh, God.
The animals.
His will to live is very strong.
A half day's journey will bring you to a hidden road.
You alone will follow the road...
...and leave Covington Woods.
You are to tell no one in the towns where we are...
...and return with haste.
My sister did not live past her 23rd birthday.
A group of men raped and killed her.
They stuffed her in a Dumpster... three blocks from our apartment.
My brother worked in an emergency room downtown.
A drug addict came in with a wound to his ribs.
My brother tried to dress the wound.
He pulled a gun from his jacket...
...then he shot my brother through his left eye.
My husband, Michael, left for the supermarket at a quarter past nine in the morning.
He was found with no money and no clothes in the East River, three days later.
My father was shot by a business partner, who then hanged himself in my father's closet.
They had argued over money.
I am a professor.
I teach American History at the University of Pennsylvania.
I have an idea...
...that I would like to talk to you about.
Mile 27- there's a girl.
I'm gonna check it out.
Be careful.
You're not allowed to go in there.
Please return to your vehicle.
What was that noise?
What are you doing out here?
How... how'd you get here?
Are you from the towns?
Uh...
Where are you from?
The woods.
You came from the woods?
In there?
Will you help me?
I need to find a doctor of medicine.
I must find these things.
We must make haste.
Listen, ma'am.
I'm just supposed to...
Is someone hurt?
Please, sir. We must make haste.
- Well, you... you live in there?
- I do, sir.
Breaker.
- What is your name?
- Kevin.
Kevin.
You have kindness in your voice.
I did not expect that.
We have guard shacks every ten miles around the perimeter of the preserve.
We keep medical supplies in there in case of animal bites or related injuries.
You can find the things written on the paper?
Uh...
- You have to wait here.
- Please, sir.
Please... take this as payment.
Wait, y-you're not...
You're not tricking me, are you?
I do not understand.
What's your name?
Ivy.
Ivy Elizabeth Walker.
There's an overturned tractor-trailer causing a one-hour delay at the Lincoln Tunnel.
The body of seven-year-old
Katrina Nelson was found today.
She'd been missing for three days.
Another 14 soldiers died in combat when a bomb exploded in their convoy.
It's 35 degrees outside.
What's with the girl?
I tried calling you back on the walkie.
- You didn't answer.
- Oh, it was just some teenagers.
They were lost.
Can I give you some advice?
Don't get into conversations.
You start talkin', you start gettin' into how some estate is payin' all of us, and no one's allowed to go in there and disturb the animal sanctuary.
People's interest gets piqued.
It's a really easy gig, Kevin.
Maintain and protect the border.
That's it. A few years ago, it got out in the papers that some government guys had been paid off to keep plane routes from flying over this place.
That was a very stressful time for me.
Don't cause me any troubles.
Do not get into conversations.
Hey, Jay, where's the maintenance ladder?
I n-need to fix a sign.
It's in the back.
Ivy has returned with medicines from the towns.
She was attacked by a creature and killed it.
Noah.
Oh, God.
We will find him.
We will give him...
...a proper burial.
We will tell the others...
...he was killed by the creatures.
Your son has made our stories real.
Noah has given us a chance to continue this place...
...if that is something...
...we still wish for.
I'm back, Lucius.
{1835}{1892}That's the guy.
{1894}{1945}Does he get|to screw her first?
{1947}{2047}Sure. She can be coming|and going at the same time.

{10678}{10714}Hydrocortisone injections|all major joints

{10763}{10787}And the history?
{10788}{10833}-Oh, initially, coal tar.|-Right.
{10835}{10862}-Then gold injections.|-Mm-hmm.
{10863}{10890}Butazolodin, lndomethocine.
{10892}{10915}Not successful.
{10916}{10986}The courses Prednisone,|Prednisolone,
{10987}{11044}Iengthening.|PUVA, not successful.
{11046}{11068}Then Methotrexate
{11070}{11106}after positive liver biopsies.
{11108}{11162}Oh, well, then, excuse me.|Much nausea?
{11163}{11219}Do you, uh, vomit, yes, mm?
{11222}{11275}Y-yeah...

{11428}{11451}he's hyper...
{11452}{11493}You're hyperventilating.
{11495}{11551}Um, are you experiencing some|kind of visual dislocations?
{11552}{11612}-Mind tripping?|-I think...
{11614}{11673}Oh, yesterday he said|there was a dog in the bed,
{11675}{11724}uh, chewing his ankles.
{11757}{11797}Okay, things are not good here.
{11799}{11857}Um, how do you feel about
{11859}{11889}Mr...
{11891}{11945}Dark, how would you feel about|one of the new Retinoids?
{11947}{11992}Hmm?
{11994}{12059}It... it-it wasn't my ankles.
{12061}{12117}It was chewing my balls.
{12171}{12201}I see.
{12203}{12247}But what I'm asking you is if|you understand the question...
{12248}{12287}No! I don't!
{12289}{12345}Because I have regressed into
{12347}{12423}the pathetic condition|of total dependency, Doc.
{12425}{12453}In short,|and in the vernacular,
{12455}{12481}I'm a fucking kid again.
{12483}{12513}The last time I had
{12515}{12569}to endure anything|this demeaning
{12571}{12630}was in my baby-buggy.
{12632}{12716}I was drooled over|by slobbering cretins...
{12718}{12753}-Mr. Dark!|-who apparently escaped
{12755}{12791}from the local cuckoo house.
{12793}{12826}They thought they were|doctors and nurses.

{12996}{13046}what exactly did you, uh...
{13048}{13098}what'd you do for a-a living,|Mr., what, I forget his name...
{13099}{13129}Dark?
{13131}{13193}What did I do?
{13195}{13231}I'm an author.
{13235}{13308}Oh... oh.

{13594}{13635}Hey, listen to me.
{13637}{13666}Please, please...

{14524}{14547}My tether.
{14548}{14595}Oh, come on!
{14597}{14623}F...!
{14625}{14683}I'd like...
{14684}{14784}Christ, I'd like|to get out of it, but I can't!
{14786}{14856}Listen! I can't s...|I can't stand it,
{14858}{14935}I really truly can't stand|any... more!
{14939}{14998}I can't get on top of it,|I can't think straight,
{14999}{15043}and I can't tell what is|from what isn't,
{15045}{15113}and if I don't tell someone,
{15115}{15154}if I don't admit it,|I'll never get out of it.
{15263}{15293}Oh, I'm sorry...
{15295}{15354}Oh, the shame.
{15356}{15400}The tears...
{15402}{15515}All this oozing, useless liquid,|it just hurts my... skin.
{15516}{15601}My face, and...
{15603}{15643}and when I laugh,|it hurts my jaw.
{15645}{15668}I'm a prisoner inside my...

{19023}{19083}Good morning.
{19203}{19250}Uh...
{19251}{19282}he's almost over the edge.
{19283}{19351}I think that Gibbon|should see him. Okay?
{19495}{19582}Pretty Nina was full of semen,|comma, and bath water, period.
{19583}{19618}But the pretty head...
{19619}{19658}that knew too much|was now emptied...
{19659}{19750}of its last|sad, little thought, period.
{19751}{19809}A lot of products.
{19839}{19886}Oh, lookee here.
{19887}{19930}Body cream.
{19931}{19978}Jesus.

{20155}{20184}-Shaddup.|-Hey.
{20186}{20227}Shaddup!
{20282}{20327}Ah.
{20434}{20476}Just like a dame.
{20478}{20518}Tough guys don't upchuck.
{20520}{20602}They half know that vomit|is a kind of sacrament.
{20603}{20654}Period.
{20783}{20860}How are we today?
{20862}{20928}Mm, I'm not too happy.
{20930}{21000}I don't... I don't|know about him.
{21002}{21048}What?
{21050}{21090}Or maybe you mean you.
{21091}{21115}What do you mean?
{21117}{21208}Well, how are we today?
{21210}{21260}See, you say, "we."
{21262}{21300}Who's the other guy?
{21302}{21342}It's just|a way of speaking.
{21343}{21380}Yeah, it's a medical way.
{21382}{21473}Assume loss of health|equals loss of brain cells.
{21499}{21545}Do you think you have|a positive attitude?
{21640}{21666}Don't... don't.
{21668}{21702}You're going to crack me up.
{21736}{21831}Well, that depends on whether|we're talking donuts you dunk
{21832}{21910}or black feminist lesbians.
{21911}{21969}I'm in favor of both,|up to a point.
{21971}{22010}You know, your illness,|to a large...
{22011}{22142}Will I be able to move|on my own three feet?
{22144}{22203}Will I hold a pen|or a tit again?
{22204}{22247}Never mind the rhetoric.
{22248}{22330}I can get that from|a doctor, Doctor.
{22331}{22394}I have seen a lot of patients|who are as bad as you are,
{22396}{22487}but not one of them has reacted|with such aggression.
{22490}{22540}What they do, sing madrigals?
{22542}{22576}Well, they don't act
{22578}{22621}Iike they've fallen|into a sewer.
{22623}{22692}Ah, see...
{22694}{22735}I thought you were|pushing tranquilizers.
{22736}{22798}I didn't realize you|had a deodorant in mind.
{22800}{22847}You should take them,|you know, the tranquilizers.
{22848}{22963}No! No, no and no.
{22964}{23030}How long are you going|to see your plight
{23031}{23101}through a blinding hot rage,|Mr. Dark? Hmm?
{23103}{23160}What do you live by?
{23199}{23261}What? Come on.
{23263}{23329}All right,|it's an embarrassing question,
{23331}{23396}but surely|there must be something
{23398}{23477}in a time of crises...
{23479}{23513}What do you believe in?
{23607}{23657}Genocide.
{23659}{23681}What?
{23683}{23713}Genocide.
{23715}{23805}Starting in Los Angeles and|working its way eastward.
{23807}{23857}I believe in so many things.
{23859}{23949}Infanticide, insecticide,
{23951}{24017}cy... anide, suicide,
{24019}{24061}AlDS...
{24063}{24088}Okay.
{24090}{24137}All right. Okay.
{24139}{24241}I put my faith in cholesterol,|caffeine, nicotine, alcohol,
{24243}{24333}President Bush,|carbon monoxide, masturbation,
{24335}{24413}nuclear first-strike,|the Reader's Digest and...
{24415}{24500}not properly labeling poisons.
{24503}{24527}Are you done?
{24529}{24558}But most of all,
{24559}{24643}Doc, most of all, I believe|in the one good thing
{24645}{24719}that comes hurtling|out of people's mouths.
{24721}{24815}Ralph. Vomit. Puke.
{24817}{24887}The Technicolor yawn.
{24889}{24923}Cookie dough!
{24925}{24955}There is a good man here.
{24957}{24999}-Uh-huh.|-He's new.
{25001}{25063}He's very alert|and sympathetic.
{25065}{25087}Dr. Gibbon.
{25089}{25147}Doctor... of what?
{25149}{25244}Skin, joints, zoology?
{25246}{25296}He's a psychotherapist.
{25298}{25370}Go fuck yourself!
{25485}{25571}You will never|get on top of your condition
{25573}{25667}until you deal|with your bitterness.
{25669}{25710}Start over.
{25711}{25777}Reassemble yourself.
{25891}{25956}Reassemble myself?
{26009}{26091}With what?
{26139}{26218}Many a tear has to fall

{26987}{27149}And your future's|looking dim...
{27195}{27254}Sorry, guys, I need five.
{27255}{27318}The words are breaking my heart.
{27319}{27364}See you gators later.
{27366}{27407}In a while, reptile.
{27594}{27642}Dan Dark?
{27774}{27832}Is it you,|the guy I've been waiting for
{27834}{27896}ever since Sax|invented the phone?
{27898}{27965}Come on, are you the big cheese|with the fat contract
{27967}{28016}who just loves|the way I tickle a tune?
{28018}{28060}Sorry, no.
{28062}{28116}Yeah, that's right, trouble.
{28118}{28176}You're in trouble.
{28178}{28228}I'm told you can help me.

{28270}{28340}Oh, I get the cases|the polite guys pass.
{28342}{28396}See, I get the jobs the guys|who don't sing don't get.
{28398}{28444}So, what's the story?
{28446}{28480}Who's the dame?
{28482}{28540}How do you know there's a dame?
{28542}{28612}There's always a dame.
{28614}{28734}Tell me, am I right...|or am I right?

{28862}{28957}There's always a body, too.
{28959}{29013}Talking to yourself again?
{29130}{29177}I had on my best pajamas,
{29179}{29256}the ones with red stripes|and the blue forget-me-nots.
{29258}{29308}And I was powdered|under the armpits
{29310}{29350}and talculmed|between each toe
{29352}{29436}'cause a million bucks|was about to call
{29438}{29489}and I was ready for it.
{29515}{29552}I see.
{29554}{29588}High temperature again.
{29590}{29623}When she moved her lips
{29624}{29713}I felt like a tulip|in dry season
{29715}{29780}when the first raindrop|smacked into it.
{29782}{29853}I decided to open up.
{29903}{29954}Boy, was I green.

{34937}{34974}I'm so sorry.
{34975}{35040}That's the one part of me|that still sort of functions.
{35087}{35149}We don't have to talk about it,|do we?
{35175}{35228}No.
{35230}{35297}They say she was with me that|night, but I swear to God...
{35300}{35354}Swear to something|you believe in, bud.
{35355}{35438}I swear on my mother's grave|Nina left me alive and unharmed.
{35439}{35469}That her name? The whore?
{35471}{35530}Why do you call her that?
{35531}{35602}Dog shit by another name|smells just as foul, pal,
{35603}{35654}and it sticks to the bottom|of your blue suede shoe
{35655}{35706}no matter what|you call it, okay?
{35707}{35746}You've stepped into|something nasty.
{35747}{35782}You want me to clean it up.
{35783}{35826}I want you to find out|what happened to her
{35827}{35879}after she left me...|and to prove nothing bad
{35881}{35910}happened to her|from my hands.
{35911}{35934}But it did.
{35935}{35983}What?
{35984}{36032}Wouldn't that be the way|her mother would see it?
{36034}{36096}Her mother,|for Christ's sakes?
{36098}{36184}You just swore on your mother's|grave, Mr. Binney.
{36186}{36220}I'm not hiring you
{36222}{36286}for a mouthful of cant|and humbug, Mr. Dark.
{36318}{36376}Maybe the cops are fixing|to fry you, Binney.
{36378}{36441}Maybe you're playing|some deeper game.
{36502}{36540}You're not a|nice guy, Dark.
{36542}{36584}Ah, but you'll pay me,|Binney...
{36586}{36664}and you'll pay me double|for the cant and the humbug.
{36666}{36695}Period.
{36697}{36764}Part of the service, period.
{36766}{36832}End paragraph.
{37378}{37404}All right, so, uh,
{37406}{37451}you're gonna wait for|him here, all right?
{37452}{37526}Yeah, all right.
{37528}{37583}Cuckoo man.
{37997}{38023}My book.
{38056}{38138}What's it doing here?
{38139}{38163}What's going on?
{38212}{38279}Your book, Mr. Dark.
{38280}{38311}Happened to pick up|a copy
{38312}{38335}the other day.
{38336}{38374}Oh, yeah? Where?
{38376}{38431}Fertilizer factory?
{38432}{38494}He said out of the side|of his mouth.
{38496}{38543}Gibbon. How are you,|Mr. Dark?
{38545}{38608}Can't... shake.
{38610}{38650}Oh, yes, of course.|I'm sorry.
{38652}{38699}And I wouldn't if I could.
{38700}{38738}I'm here under protest.
{38740}{38807}Well, I see. A kidnap.
{38935}{38969}Little men shouldn't sit
{38971}{39013}where their feet don't touch|the floor.
{39015}{39074}Makes me think|of nursery rhymes.
{39125}{39147}You don't want
{39149}{39173}to see me.
{39175}{39238}What sharpness. What perception.
{39240}{39349}And you don't like it at all|that I've got this.
{39351}{39386}It's full of clues.
{39388}{39445}No, it's full of pages.
{39447}{39490}Oh, but clues are what|you're supposed to find
{39491}{39525}in a detective story.
{39527}{39584}Am I right, or...|am I right?
{39639}{39697}Jesus. You're good.
{39699}{39750}I know clues are|supposed to lead you
{39753}{39792}to the killer, but, uh...
{39794}{39821}what if they reveal
{39823}{39869}the victim a little|more clearly?
{39871}{39917}You think you're being|interesting, don't you?
{39919}{40037}If this was a movie, you'd be|on the cutting room floor.
{40039}{40085}Does your book worry you?
{40087}{40121}I want to go back to my bed.
{40123}{40161}It's vivid and exciting there.
{40163}{40205}Well, you don't|have any visitors.
{40207}{40238}How do you know?
{40239}{40285}Well, does your wife|come and visit you, or...
{40287}{40330}-I'm not married.|-or do you stop her when...?
{40331}{40359}I'm not married.
{40361}{40389}Oh, and period.
{40391}{40452}Oh, oh, yes, I see.
{40565}{40607}Stop it! Stop staring at me!
{40609}{40679}You've never seen|a human pizza before?
{40713}{40792}You... you don't like women,|do you?
{40794}{40935}Which ones? Young ones, old|ones, fat ones, faithful ones?
{40937}{40995}Virgins? Whores?|Try to be specific, Doc.
{40996}{41019}Maybe, maybe you think
{41020}{41051}you like 'em...
{41052}{41174}uh, but, uh, my guess is,|well, you don't like sex.
{41176}{41207}How do you spell that?
{41209}{41255}That's not a word|you see much nowadays.
{41257}{41293}You probably think you do.
{41295}{41340}Sex.
{41342}{41378}Well, we think about it
{41380}{41443}all the time-- I know I do.
{41445}{41511}Oh, if-if-if I say "Fuck you,"
{41513}{41564}does that mean yes?
{41613}{41642}Well, isn't it clear
{41644}{41691}that you regard|sexual intercourse
{41693}{41797}with, uh... distaste|or... perhaps even
{41799}{41834}a little fear?
{41835}{41898}What, am I trapped in here|with a fruitcake?
{41899}{41950}Here, for example,|on page 1 1 6...
{41951}{41995}This is against|the Geneva Convention.
{41996}{42038}Oh, l-I'm just going|to read you a passage
{42039}{42062}out of your own book.
{42063}{42102}-No!|-No?
{42103}{42147}Shove it up your ass!
{42435}{42515}Just walkin' in the rain
{42599}{42646}Getting soakin' wet
{42695}{42737}Oh, no.
{42739}{42777}Torturin' my heart
{42779}{42814}Fucking...
{42815}{42898}By tryin' to forget
{42900}{42959}Dad, what's wrong?
{42960}{42987}Just walkin' in the rain
{43083}{43117}So alone and blue...
{43156}{43251}I don't wish to upset you,|Mr. Dark.
{43252}{43290}I'm just walkin' in the rain,|Doc.
{43291}{43334}I think you know|you need help.
{43335}{43390}Now, you're too aware|of your own condition
{43391}{43430}to deny it.
{43431}{43470}Just collecting raindrops.
{43471}{43526}Most chronic skin patients
{43527}{43598}are on tranquilizers|or antidepressants.
{43599}{43650}See, the skin is|very personal.
{43652}{43690}It's, uh, tempting
{43692}{43747}to believe that the|poisons of the mind
{43748}{43779}have somehow...
{43780}{43874}erupted onto the surface|of the skin.
{43875}{43938}"Unclean, unclean!" you shout,
{43939}{44038}ringing your leper's bell,|warding us all off.
{44067}{44108}That'll destroy you.
{44110}{44162}Yes, I think you know that,
{44165}{44226}or at least|part of you does.
{44227}{44262}You can be helped.
{44263}{44325}Yeah, with a Mickey Finn.
{44327}{44387}Now, why mimic that stuff?
{44389}{44414}What stuff?
{44416}{44453}That out-the-side|-of-your-mouth
{44455}{44481}kind of stuff.
{44483}{44530}That down-these-mean-streets|kind of stuff.
{44531}{44555}I'm sorry.
{44556}{44616}What kind of stuff?
{44666}{44712}You know, my feeling is that,|um...
{44714}{44783}now that... after I've read|some of your prose...
{44784}{44831}Ho, ho, hee, hee.
{44832}{44872}...my feeling is|that, uh, you didn't
{44874}{44945}start out to write in this way.
{45031}{45054}What would you|have preferred
{45055}{45079}to have written?
{45081}{45116}What, if I had the talent,|you mean?
{45118}{45171}No, of course I don't mean that.
{45173}{45200}No, go ahead, be a critic.
{45202}{45256}You got the face for it.
{45306}{45340}If you like, all right.
{45342}{45389}Uh, if you had the talent.
{45415}{45448}If I had the talent,
{45450}{45512}one-liners for Michael Jackson,|two-liners for Helen Keller,
{45514}{45576}if it wouldn't be stretching her|too much.
{45578}{45628}Maybe traffic citations|for Ted Kennedy.
{45630}{45668}Who knows?
{45670}{45710}It's just one word|after another.
{45711}{45760}That's where all the problems|of the world start:
{45762}{45836}the next goddamn word.
{45838}{45871}It's not incriminating.
{45873}{45908}What isn't?
{45910}{46015}Telling me what you|would prefer to write.
{46192}{46259}I would like to have praised|a loving God
{46260}{46307}and all His Loving Creation...
{46308}{46338}Yes.
{46340}{46401}...and to have seen...
{46403}{46466}hosts of translucent angels
{46468}{46535}ascending spinning shafts|of golden light
{46536}{46615}to the deep blue caverns|of heaven.
{46616}{46675}Hell, they'd all have|these massive titties,
{46676}{46716}wouldn't they?
{46718}{46823}Well, here's one part here|that doesn't seem to... fit in
{46826}{46852}with the rest.
{46854}{46877}Here it is.
{46879}{46986}"Mouth sucking,|wet and slack at mouth,
{46988}{47076}"tongue chafing against tongue,
{47078}{47124}"limb thrusting|upon limb...
{47126}{47171}skin rubbing at skin."
{47173}{47342}Hmm... "Faces contort and|stretch into a helpless leer,
{47344}{47466}"organs spurt out smelly stains|and sticky betrayals.
{47468}{47523}"This is the sweaty farce
{47525}{47565}out of which we are|brought into being..."
{47567}{47592}Okay, okay, enough.
{47594}{47626}"We are implicated|without choice
{47627}{47659}"in the slippery catastrophe
{47661}{47732}"of copulations that spatter us|into existence.
{47734}{47757}Okay!
{47759}{47813}"We are spat|out of fevered loins.
{47815}{47849}Okay.
{47852}{47909}"We are the by-blows|of grunts and pantings
{47911}{47943}"in a rumpled and|creaking bed.
{47945}{47978}Shut up, you|sadistic quack!
{48023}{48061}Welcome."
{48063}{48146}Hmm?
{48271}{48344}Yeah, the Milk of Paradise.
{48346}{48399}I can taste it now.
{48555}{48632}How much is that doggie|in the window?
{48663}{48781}The one|with the waggley tail
{48783}{48863}How much is that doggie|in the window?
{48895}{49004}I do hope|that doggie's for sale
{49007}{49115}I must take a trip|to California
{49117}{49195}And leave my poor sweetheart|alone...
{49197}{49243}"The Devil was alive|in his eyes,
{49245}{49289}"hot with hate.
{49291}{49351}"l felt that ice chink|against my spine.
{49353}{49416}Hell, I was staring|straight into..."
{49445}{49506}How much is that doggie...
{49637}{49675}Mark, he's going to see us.
{49677}{49703}No, Mark...
{49705}{49747}Stand out there,|he will see you.
{49749}{49779}Come on.
{49863}{49939}It's okay.
{49941}{49981}Let go, Betty.
{49983}{50036}I'm just scared is all.
{50038}{50083}What can he do?
{50085}{50156}Nothing.
{50159}{50195}We're partners anyway.
{50197}{50242}Says so on the sign.
{50281}{50334}Partners in peanuts.
{50336}{50386}Hmm...
{50387}{50472}Well, I'll take my piece|right now.
{50474}{50519}Don't say it like that.
{50520}{50567}Oh, now, you're just scared,
{50569}{50615}that's all.
{50707}{50750}God, I love your mouth
{50751}{50795}when you don't like|something I say.
{50879}{50939}Ain't nothin' to be scared of.
{51039}{51146}Nobody comes to this old barn|no more...
{51147}{51174}except the rats.
{51175}{51207}And you.
{51239}{51278}Hmm?
{51347}{51406}Sounds like you've|been here before.
{51407}{51463}Me? What for?
{51579}{51611}Who with?
{51643}{51735}You are no good, Mark.
{51814}{51900}What about you...
{51902}{51945}Mrs. Dark?
{52146}{52198}Oh!
{52727}{52773}Oh.
{52775}{52833}Angel.
{53021}{53076}Here.
{53184}{53224}Come on, bitch.
{53313}{53382}Tongue chafing against tongue,
{53383}{53442}Iimb thrusting upon limb,
{53443}{53514}skin rubbing at skin.
{53515}{53622}Faces contort and stretch|into a helpless leer.
{53623}{53748}Organs spurt out smelly stains|and...
{53750}{53797}Sticky betrayals.
{53930}{54068}Just walking in the rain
{54070}{54193}Getting soaking wet
{54195}{54294}Torturing my heart
{54295}{54412}By trying to forget
{54414}{54538}Just walking in the rain
{54539}{54668}So alone and blue
{54670}{54698}All because my heart
{54700}{54737}He's still waving.
{54739}{54796}Dad just kept waving.
{54798}{54841}-Still remembers you...|-What?
{54905}{54954}I said, how far is it?
{54955}{55022}About 200 miles.
{55289}{55358}Will we like it--
{55361}{55384}Los Angeles?
{55419}{55478}Mom?
{55481}{55537}It'll be dark
{55539}{55586}and full of gangsters.
{56148}{56209}I'm afraid|he had to be sedated.
{56211}{56279}He's been asleep|most of the day.
{56317}{56364}The poor man.
{56367}{56415}They're trying him|on a new drug,
{56416}{56478}but you know that, of course.
{56479}{56535}Of course.
{56537}{56628}Mr. Dark?
{56631}{56657}Your wife.
{56659}{56685}You know what, l...
{56687}{56736}Maybe we shouldn't wake him.
{56853}{56903}They wanted to know if you came.
{56905}{56964}The doctors.
{56966}{57016}They'd like to speak with you.
{57018}{57063}Well, yeah, maybe|l-I should speak to somebody.
{57064}{57087}I mean, at least I won't
{57088}{57117}get my head bitten off.
{57119}{57165}Sorry?
{57167}{57232}Oh, uh, if he wakes up|and sees me here,
{57234}{57272}you'll know what I mean.
{57274}{57396}It's... Dan Dark, Darker,|Darkest, kind of his thing.
{57398}{57467}Actually,|I'm-I'm going to go. I...
{57468}{57520}I think|I shouldn't have come.
{57522}{57582}I just...|I shouldn't even try.
{57584}{57635}Wait. Please...
{57637}{57692}Farewell, my lovely.
{57723}{57791}You bitch!
{57815}{57876}Nicola!
{57919}{57994}Come here, you disgusting tramp!
{57995}{58048}You two-bit slag bitch!
{58050}{58081}Nicola!
{58083}{58170}Who are you|spreading your legs for now?
{58202}{58278}Come back here now,|you stupid
{58280}{58307}bitch whore cunt!
{58309}{58361}Mr. Dark, what do you|think you're doing?
{58363}{58415}Where do you|think you are?
{58472}{58499}I'm so sorry.
{58501}{58529}Is there a problem?
{58531}{58577}Yes, there's|a problem.
{58579}{58618}You're the problem.
{58620}{58654}Stop the yelling.
{58655}{58682}It's disgusting.
{58684}{58716}You should be|ashamed of yourself.
{58719}{58740}You stop it at once!
{58743}{58819}I so don't want|to be disruptive.
{58821}{58847}Good.
{58849}{58892}I was just sort of singing.
{58894}{58931}You were what?
{58933}{59051}Many a tear has to fall
{59054}{59174}But it's all in the game.
{59643}{59750}Ah, there are mysteries,|puzzles.
{59752}{59791}There are always things
{59793}{59831}that bewilder us|as children, Mr. Dark.
{59833}{59858}Mmm.
{59860}{59883}Accept it. Yes?
{59884}{59907}Mmm.
{59908}{59955}Accept the sky,|accept the birds.
{59956}{59992}Accept bird shit.
{60027}{60095}Has your wife been|to visit you yet?
{60097}{60158}God, the way you walk|up and down behind me.
{60160}{60218}I mean, are you pretending|to be an oddball,
{60219}{60274}or are you actually nuts?
{60275}{60329}Ah, there you are.
{60368}{60400}You're looking better.
{60402}{60435}Uh-huh. Am l?
{60436}{60475}Yeah. Your posture, too.
{60477}{60503}-Great.|-Less pain?
{60505}{60548}Yeah, maybe.
{60550}{60605}Well, you know, you-you ought|to let those neck muscles
{60607}{60642}...relax a little.
{60643}{60686}Oh, I'm sorry.|Forgive me. I, uh...
{60687}{60710}God.
{60711}{60742}Well, that's why l...
{60743}{60775}Well, look, I just...
{60776}{60817}If you could just|turn your head.
{60819}{60873}Uh, you'd-you'd get|fewer headaches that way.
{60875}{60913}Who says I get headaches?
{60915}{60948}Oh, you do,|don't you?
{60950}{61000}Severe ones, hmm?
{61002}{61040}And no doubt, as a result,
{61042}{61102}your perceptions are probably|somewhat distorted, hmm?
{61104}{61146}Yeah. I can see around corners
{61147}{61198}and right up|your hairy little self.
{61199}{61247}Not to mention that|ugly temper, yeah.
{61249}{61325}Minute by minute,|we make the world, Doc.
{61327}{61362}Our own world.
{61364}{61414}Hmm.
{61416}{61446}Well, what do you think?
{61448}{61539}You think it's time maybe|you went back to work again?
{61541}{61626}Tell me how, Dr. Donothing.
{61628}{61675}Well, I never write|anything down myself.
{61676}{61731}I dictate.|Never tried it.
{61733}{61785}With whom?|Question mark.
{61787}{61833}Well, there are people.
{61835}{61861}Agencies.
{61863}{61895}Has somebody been getting|to you?
{61897}{61926}What do you mean?
{61928}{61986}Has a certain whore
{61987}{62076}of my former acquaintance been|pushing her hard little nose
{62078}{62146}into my affairs?
{62147}{62215}Mr. Dark,
{62216}{62275}do you plan|to get better?
{62277}{62332}Hmm?
{62334}{62430}Chronic illness|is a shelter. Yeah.
{62432}{62479}A cave in the rocks
{62480}{62556}into which a wounded|spirit can safely crawl.
{62558}{62583}Some cave.
{62585}{62607}Oh, no, no, no.
{62609}{62631}Not very comfortable,
{62633}{62655}not at all.
{62657}{62691}No. There are bats in it. Mmm.
{62693}{62739}Squeaking rodents
{62741}{62803}with wings of skin and fur,
{62805}{62839}that hang upside down,
{62840}{62894}crunching beetles|in their teeth.
{62895}{62932}But you know all about that.
{62934}{62959}You know about bats.
{62961}{62986}Shut up, shrimp.
{63018}{63051}You turned, you turned!
{63083}{63115}I did.
{63140}{63174}I did.
{63175}{63223}Not now. No. Go.
{63256}{63282}Who was that?
{63284}{63331}Huh?
{63333}{63376}What's that?|That's progress, Mr. Dark.
{63378}{63406}Progress.
{63407}{63453}Who knows how far it can go.
{63483}{63516}Oh, from the neck down,|you mean.
{63518}{63545}Hmm?
{63547}{63586}If you're thinking|the other way around,
{63588}{63622}if you want to|get inside my head,
{63623}{63672}you better forget it.
{63674}{63734}Hmm. Good.
{64087}{64134}Wait. You...
{64183}{64209}He's asleep.
{64211}{64253}-Who is?|-My boy.
{64255}{64298}You mean you got a kid in here?
{64299}{64326}Jesus.
{64327}{64371}Shh, shh, shh.|Not so loud.
{64373}{64446}Listen, doll, when I fuck,|I like to make a noise, okay?
{64449}{64487}All right, all right.
{64489}{64517}Come on.
{64519}{64560}This way. It's okay.
{64562}{64634}Here we go.
{64791}{64883}What a disgusting disease.
{64885}{64936}Gee, thanks.
{65045}{65089}Dan. I don't...
{65091}{65139}No, no, no. Sit down,|sit down. Why not?
{65141}{65178}Keep the laughs coming.
{65179}{65230}Who's laughing?
{65409}{65458}You are beyond the|shadow of a doubt
{65460}{65509}an exceptionally|beautiful woman.
{65511}{65596}At your peak.
{65599}{65661}That sounds like|a death sentence.
{65663}{65699}It is a death sentence.
{65701}{65727}Dan, listen...
{65729}{65774}Three months I've been|in this fucking bed.
{65775}{65803}You know that?
{65805}{65836}Where you been?
{65839}{65867}Who are you? What are you?
{65869}{65898}I don't know.
{65899}{65949}I hallucinate now and then.
{65951}{65978}Ain't that a laugh?
{65979}{66022}The past, the present--|they're all in that
{66024}{66107}cheap old book of mine,|and I didn't even know it.
{66143}{66171}So are you, honey.
{66173}{66213}-Me?|-Uh-huh.
{66215}{66261}Nicola.
{66311}{66373}Yeah.
{66375}{66446}You are a filthy,
{66448}{66519}predatory, totally wanton bitch|who is always in heat,
{66521}{66572}and I don't want you near me.
{66574}{66612}I don't.
{66614}{66640}I don't. Not now.
{66642}{66693}I don't. Not ever.
{66794}{66843}What if I said|I still loved you?
{66952}{67003}Liar.
{67059}{67139}I have some things|to discuss with you.
{67140}{67236}There's a film company|that wants to buy the rights
{67238}{67302}to that first book.
{67303}{67330}What?
{67331}{67363}The Singing Detective.
{67364}{67414}The one set in the '50s.
{67415}{67463}Is that the book|you've been talking about?
{67488}{67541}They want it|for Roger Rabbit, right?
{67543}{67575}No.
{67576}{67651}They seem, um...
{67653}{67681}keen.
{67684}{67736}Keen?
{67738}{67833}Hey, what's this got to do|with you?
{67835}{67869}You're broke,
{67871}{67934}and you haven't written a word|for over a year.
{67935}{68041}I mean, Danny,|I just want you to be able
{68044}{68076}to support yourself.
{68078}{68124}Oh, God, I see.
{68126}{68209}Baby, Baby-- still thinks|I owe her money.
{68211}{68243}No.
{68245}{68281}You could work|it out at, say,
{68283}{68323}$500 a screw.
{68325}{68384}Isn't that top rate for hookers?
{68430}{68456}Is it?
{68458}{68494}I wouldn't know.
{68535}{68598}Who are you sleeping with|at the moment?
{68695}{68750}Myself, mostly.
{68751}{68785}Mostly?
{68787}{68833}Mostly.
{68836}{68886}Mostly means not always.
{68888}{68956}Right, if you want|to be precise.
{69079}{69142}Dan...
{69144}{69194}you need to function.
{69196}{69244}You just...|you need to get your hand
{69246}{69273}on that old book...
{69275}{69320}What happened to the screenplay?|Where is it?
{69322}{69358}What screenplay?
{69359}{69396}The one in my head.
{69398}{69449}What are you talking about?
{69451}{69477}That is the|worst thing
{69479}{69525}about a detective|story is the plot.
{69527}{69574}It's the best thing, too.
{69576}{69610}I mean, hell,|isn't it really...?
{69611}{69655}It's just... it's|the only thing.
{69656}{69703}You got to work it out|like a rat in a maze.
{69704}{69751}That's what I'm trying to do|right now.
{69752}{69827}Yeah, but with a story|you've already written?
{69829}{69875}Oh, oh, oh, oh...
{69876}{69927}It grows.
{69929}{70045}How... when you already know|what's going to happen?
{70047}{70088}Where is it?!
{70090}{70114}Where is what?
{70115}{70163}The fucking screenplay--|The Singing Detective.
{70164}{70206}I wrote it years ago;|I put in shoe boxes.
{70207}{70228}Shoe boxes?
{70230}{70318}Yes! Fucking shoe boxes!
{70401}{70454}Danny...
{70495}{70560}I know.
{70627}{70677}Boy, do I know.
{70881}{70917}Dan...
{70919}{70979}You need to write|something new.
{70981}{71006}Something real.
{71008}{71036}Like what?
{71038}{71062}Like this, like everything
{71063}{71096}that's happening right now.
{71098}{71133}Not a silly detective story.
{71135}{71160}Something real.
{71162}{71195}Ah, solutions.
{71197}{71222}What?
{71224}{71263}All solutions
{71265}{71318}and no clues, right?
{71320}{71369}'Cause that's|what the dumbheads want.
{71371}{71440}They want the serious novel,|right?
{71442}{71531}Plus descriptions|of the goddamn sky.
{71533}{71574}I want it|the other way around.
{71575}{71612}All clues, no solutions,
{71614}{71717}'cause that's the way...|things are.
{71719}{71775}Now...
{71857}{71922}Why do you know about this?
{71924}{71990}Why do you know?|Tell me.
{71991}{72083}Were you a party to the offer|in the first place?
{72085}{72122}Tell me what's going on.
{72123}{72187}Tell me.
{72189}{72233}Tell me!
{72283}{72341}Paranoia. I don't...
{72386}{72437}Or theft.
{72439}{72498}Danny, stop.
{72500}{72530}Do you want my help or not?
{72531}{72568}Do I want your help?
{72570}{72616}Do I want you to help me?
{72618}{72662}Well, you think on it.
{72663}{72717}Okay. You go fuck yourself.
{72719}{72779}Okay. I love you too, Danny.
{73151}{73197}Hey, Binney.
{73235}{73293}Quote, no luck, period.
{73295}{73325}No good, period.
{73327}{73391}He was getting very suspicious,|exclamation mark.
{73393}{73426}No luck. No good.
{73428}{73494}He's getting very suspicious.
{73496}{73561}But you'll try again, right?
{73563}{73602}I-I don't know.
{73604}{73647}But we could be sued
{73649}{73707}for misrepresentation|if he doesn't sign.
{73709}{73751}I'll deliver.|I said I would.
{73753}{73806}He still looks awful.
{73808}{73849}Don't start feeling|sorry for him.
{73851}{73891}I don't. I hope|it goes right into
{73893}{73934}his fucking bones.
{73982}{74059}You look terrific|when you're mad.
{74061}{74100}Just like a hornet...
{74102}{74159}drowning in the Tabasco.
{74161}{74226}That's something|Dan Dark would say.
{74227}{74267}You sound like Dan.
{74383}{74444}Sorry, Charlie.
{74447}{74536}How much is that doggie|in the window?
{74580}{74673}The one with the waggley tail
{74675}{74735}How much is that doggie|in the window...?
{74910}{74992}She comes on like a rose
{74994}{75074}But everybody knows
{75075}{75146}She'll get you in Dutch
{75147}{75228}You can look,|but you better not touch
{75230}{75280}Poison ivy...
{75282}{75323}There are songs to sing.
{75325}{75373}There are feelings to feel.
{75375}{75412}There are thoughts to think.
{75414}{75460}That makes three things.
{75462}{75519}You can't do three things|at the same time.
{75521}{75567}...creepin' around...
{75569}{75624}The singing is easy--|sugar on the tongue.
{75626}{75666}The thinking|comes with the tune.
{75667}{75709}So, that|leaves only the feelings,
{75711}{75745}and you're not going|to catch me
{75747}{75816}feeling the feeling.|No, sir.
{75818}{75894}...If you let her|get under your skin
{75896}{75979}Poison ivy...
{75981}{76071}Watch the light, dickhead.
{76073}{76128}...Late at night|while you're sleepin'
{76130}{76251}Poison ivy|comes a-creepin' around
{76253}{76329}Measles make you bumpy,|and mumps'll make you lumpy
{76331}{76394}And chicken pox'll|make you jump and twitch...
{76395}{76435}The guy's a sitting duck.
{76437}{76487}But why here?
{76489}{76516}What's the sense?
{76518}{76562}J. Edgar H. prefers a|different kind of tune.
{76563}{76618}What does it matter?
{76619}{76679}Well, I don't like it.
{76681}{76726}Stick to Patti Page, eh?
{76727}{76780}Up there with the lights--|it's the goons.
{76782}{76828}Watch yourself! Watch!
{76830}{76897}...The minute|you start to mess around...
{78184}{78231}How's it going?
{78234}{78279}Halfway there.
{78332}{78398}Halfway to a million bucks.
{78593}{78663}With disdain.
{78667}{78739}Period.
{78741}{78811}I have some nice things,|if that's what you mean.
{78813}{78837}Nice, no.
{78839}{78874}Expensive, I said.
{78876}{78908}Tastes differ.
{78910}{79019}You're more at home in... bars|and sleazy dance halls.
{79021}{79047}Oh, l...
{79049}{79103}do the occasional|Rotary dinner,
{79105}{79155}state prison dance...
{79157}{79202}where I don't leave my hat.
{79249}{79286}What?
{79289}{79352}That's how the cops|got onto you, Binney.
{79354}{79418}You left your fedora on the bar|when you picked up that whore.
{79529}{79563}Money.
{79642}{79704}Money, money, money.
{79706}{79751}What about it?
{79752}{79778}You got a lot.
{79779}{79809}I do all right.
{79811}{79895}What at, I'm wondering.
{79897}{79954}I buy, I sell.
{79955}{80022}Uh-huh. So does|Second Hand Rose.
{80023}{80056}What do you buy?
{80058}{80094}What do you sell?
{80095}{80122}That's my business.
{80123}{80180}Naked flesh?
{80182}{80215}What?
{80217}{80250}Oh, yeah, that's|what you buy,
{80251}{80275}that's what you sell.
{80277}{80320}That's ridiculous.
{80322}{80362}I deal in antiques,|if you must know.
{80363}{80402}The only antiques are some of|the distinguished gentlemen
{80404}{80478}you service with|young girls, Binney.
{80480}{80522}Are you calling me a...?
{80523}{80596}A pimp? Why, yes, you|don't mind, do you?
{80657}{80717}You're a fantasist,|Dark.
{80777}{80816}Get out.
{80818}{80849}Don't let me see you again.
{80851}{80876}What about my fee?
{80878}{80916}Fee? What fee?
{80919}{80979}It took me five days|between my syncopations
{80980}{81047}to figure out that you set up|that poor girl, Nina.
{81049}{81108}Why? I said to myself, "Why?"
{81111}{81162}Just get out.
{81163}{81188}You know what I think?
{81190}{81221}I think she was|killed right here
{81223}{81255}in this museum.
{81257}{81300}You're crazy.
{81303}{81346}But it's not the cops|you're scared of, Binney.
{81347}{81370}They can be bought and sold,|too.
{81371}{81396}Put it back in the drawer,|will you?
{81399}{81478}-What?|-Put it back in the drawer,
{81479}{81530}unless you want a hole|between your eyes
{81531}{81594}that the wind from your ass|can whistle through.
{81595}{81668}You really are crazy.
{81670}{81714}Out of your cheap little mind.
{81715}{81768}Sure. But do it.
{81770}{81836}I've been shot at once tonight,
{81838}{81881}and that's once too often.
{81883}{81949}Okay, okay.
{82101}{82160}This Nina-- she wasn't|one of your commodities.
{82162}{82203}-But her friend was.|-What friend?
{82205}{82266}That girl they scraped up|under the Hollywood sign.
{82268}{82297}The cops say she jumped.
{82299}{82324}But your pals...
{82326}{82350}What pals?
{82351}{82375}Your pals thought
{82376}{82418}she might have passed|something on to Nina,
{82419}{82450}and they were taking no chances.
{82451}{82478}Not with her, not with you.
{82479}{82505}Am I right, or am I right?
{82555}{82581}And now they want me, too,
{82583}{82622}you slimy slug.
{82687}{82754}Go on.
{82807}{82857}Go on.|I enjoy cheap fiction.
{82859}{82891}Me? Nah.
{82893}{82952}I'm no longer in your employ.
{82954}{82982}Fee? What fee?
{82983}{83007}You hired me
{83009}{83032}to find out|what happened to Nina
{83034}{83058}when you already knew.
{83059}{83170}Why? I'll figure it out. And...
{83171}{83240}And?
{83242}{83299}I sing for people|who dance, Binney.
{83301}{83367}Name your tune,|I'll warble it for you,
{83369}{83406}but when you dance...
{83407}{83462}your feet|won't be touching the floor.
{83463}{83512}Oh, you're cheap, Dark.
{83514}{83591}Ten cents a dance.
{85436}{85469}Mr. Dark?
{85548}{85583}That's my handle.
{85584}{85634}I was born at daybreak.
{85636}{85671}Please, I want to talk.
{85673}{85699}You followed me
{85701}{85742}to make sure I wasn't followed,|but I was.
{85744}{85810}Stay back. Keep|out of sight.
{85812}{85871}Meet me at The Laguna|in a half an hour.
{85916}{85951}Little fool.
{86392}{86451}I warned you.
{86453}{86495}I told you, baby.
{86591}{86630}Ah, gee.
{86632}{86716}Silly... poor little thing.
{86718}{86763}Parlow.
{86832}{86858}What?
{86860}{86922}You mean,|the Parlow Atomic Laboratory...
{86924}{86963}here in L.A.?
{86989}{87023}Binney...
{87024}{87057}Mark Binney.
{87104}{87175}He's providing all the girls.
{87176}{87247}Right? Girls like you...
{87248}{87287}Iike Nina.
{87320}{87370}The Reds.
{87372}{87467}They're getting|to the atomic scientists...
{87468}{87494}Yes?
{87496}{87538}At Parlow?
{87540}{87582}Using sex.
{87648}{87695}Sex.
{87915}{87966}Sex.
{88159}{88213}Sex.
{88215}{88293}I'll get ya.
{88295}{88345}Bastards.
{88347}{88445}Whoever you are,|and whatever you are...
{88447}{88510}wherever you are.
{88943}{89013}You're buffeted by this...
{89015}{89069}by that, and it's nothing|to do with you.
{89071}{89137}You know,|someone you love dies or leaves.
{89139}{89188}Then you get ill,|or you get better,
{89190}{89234}and the whole time, everywhere,
{89235}{89307}there's just this canopy|stretching out over you...
{89309}{89356}What canopy?
{89359}{89412}Fate--things as they are.
{89414}{89466}It's irrational,|impersonal.
{89468}{89559}The rain falls,|the sun shines, the wind blows,

{89752}{89778}Call it what you like.
{89779}{89828}There's damn all|you can do about it.
{89941}{90011}Well, physically,|you're on the up.
{90013}{90066}Well...
{90067}{90119}Now we have a firm|grasp of the obvious.
{90121}{90179}Why do you still feel|so disappointed
{90181}{90241}in things as they are?
{90243}{90311}Things as they are...
{90313}{90364}no concern of mine.
{90367}{90434}You object to the use|of the word "things"?
{90435}{90480}Oh, there's a lot of words|I don't like.
{90482}{90526}Such as?
{90527}{90593}Decaffeinated.
{90595}{90641}Hmm.
{90643}{90670}Another?
{90671}{90734}Oh, good, good, good.|Indoor games.
{90735}{90758}Yeah.
{90759}{90798}-Word games?|-Yeah, sure.
{90800}{90824}I throw you a word, you...
{90826}{90854}I come back with|another word.
{90855}{90902}Yeah, that you associate|with the word that l...
{90903}{90982}Okay, wait-wait-wait-wait, yeah,|but we got to... agree...
{90983}{91030}in advance|that it's meaningless.
{91031}{91100}Please, there's no diagnostic|value for any of it.
{91102}{91170}Fine.

{93210}{93260}It's just words, right?
{93262}{93302}That's what we agreed.

{96602}{96649}It's no good here.
{96651}{96716}I didn't think it would|be like this, but...
{96719}{96770}We gotta go back.
{96819}{96858}No.
{96876}{96934}Why not?|Why not?

{97483}{97544}Your what?
{97546}{97569}What?
{97571}{97595}Let me see.
{97646}{97695}How did you do that?
{97727}{97789}You hurt yourself or what?
{97791}{97881}I don't know.
{97937}{97995}I'm so sorry.
{98095}{98149}Okay, it's not very legible,|and it hurts, but...
{98202}{98254}First time I actually|have to think
{98255}{98296}about the value|of every little word,
{98298}{98331}and it's just so...
{98333}{98366}Ah, it's dangerous.
{98368}{98402}There's one.
{98403}{98439}Well, it cuts|most of the jobs
{98440}{98462}a writer would get
{98464}{98502}if you have to think|about the value
{98504}{98534}of the words.
{98536}{98578}Hollywood re-writes...|National Enquirer...
{98580}{98610}Dan Rather's teleprompter.
{98614}{98653}Let's see how you're doing.
{98655}{98690}Can you read it?
{98691}{98718}"Memory...
{98720}{98758}upward strokes|and downward slopes..."
{98760}{98786}Mm-hmm.
{98788}{98829}And what's this?
{98831}{98882}"...Comma curls|making me hold..."
{98883}{98944}Yeah, I can read it.
{98946}{98978}-Oh.|-Making you hold what?
{98980}{99005}My breath.
{99007}{99059}Words make me hold my breath.
{99061}{99110}Do they now?
{99112}{99146}Who knows what|they're going to say?
{99147}{99171}But...
{99172}{99231}Who knows where they've been?
{99259}{99318}We're getting|a little heavy here, aren't we?
{99319}{99403}Well, what made you say that,|Brenda?
{99460}{99491}What do you mean?
{99493}{99519}If we wrote that down.
{99521}{99592}Quote, getting a little|heavy, comma,
{99594}{99627}aren't we, question mark,|unquote.
{99629}{99662}If I did...
{99732}{99786}No, it doesn't matter.
{99851}{99922}Ah, well, um...|keep at it!
{100035}{100149}Quote, ah, well, dash,|keep at it, exclamation mark.
{100151}{100352}She smiled, comma,|turned away, dot-dot... dot.
{100354}{100421}Ooh, going off the page.
{100423}{100484}Stop... finished, period.
{100555}{100577}He's dead,
{100580}{100606}period.
{100607}{100673}Out of it, period.
{100703}{100727}That's it.
{100728}{100773}All done.
{100775}{100805}Great.
{100867}{100934}Mmm...
{100935}{100975}I like that.
{101023}{101102}Now Dan Dark's whole script|is in the machine...
{101103}{101146}Minus his name.
{101147}{101229}...we can run off|as many copies as we need,
{101231}{101342}and they can tinker with it|if they want.
{101379}{101402}So now
{101403}{101429}we deliver.
{101431}{101482}And we could.
{101707}{101760}But you must get Dark
{101762}{101800}to sign the rights|to my company.
{101802}{101856}That's essential.
{101858}{101896}Okay. Move forward a little.
{101898}{101920}That better?
{101922}{101949}Yeah.
{101951}{101973}Oh... that's fine.
{101975}{102021}Okay. One...
{102023}{102096}he signs with me.
{102098}{102124}Two...
{102176}{102223}...I sell it on...
{102224}{102350}I-I mean we sell it on|to Mail Pouch Films,
{102352}{102423}and three...
{102424}{102478}net profit...
{102480}{102506}one million.
{102565}{102598}Plus points.
{102600}{102630}Plus points.
{102632}{102678}But he's gotta sign.
{102784}{102819}Don't worry.
{102821}{102866}I can get him...
{102867}{102926}to do... anything!
{102960}{103011}Oh, yeah.
{103013}{103109}Oh, oh, oh... Good girl... Oh...
{103386}{103409}Hello.
{103527}{103550}Hey.
{103551}{103599}Hey. I was just
{103600}{103636}thinking about you.
{103638}{103660}Really?
{103662}{103684}Mm-hmm.
{103686}{103742}What were you|thinking about me?
{103744}{103775}I was thinking|you look terrific.
{103777}{103799}Hmm.
{103801}{103834}So do you.
{103835}{103891}You look better.
{103911}{103938}Don't, Dan.
{103939}{103963}Don't what?
{103964}{103989}Look at me like that.
{103991}{104014}Like what?
{104015}{104039}Like I'm your enemy.
{104040}{104077}Oh, you are definitely|up to something.
{104079}{104104}You are so definitely involved
{104106}{104129}in some kind|of fucking scam.
{104131}{104154}Good old Danny.
{104155}{104184}And it probably has something
{104186}{104213}to do with money-- my money.
{104215}{104242}You haven't got any money.
{104243}{104330}No. Not in cash, maybe.
{104331}{104405}Not in good, old-fashioned,|foldable, chewable lettuce.
{104407}{104445}No. Nor in coins, come to that.
{104447}{104507}Nothing to go|chink-chink in my pocket,
{104509}{104542}but I have assets.
{104544}{104579}Like what?
{104581}{104637}My four detective stories.
{104639}{104666}Yeah...
{104667}{104717}Three of which|are out of print.
{104719}{104764}And the screenplay.
{104766}{104789}What screenplay?
{104791}{104821}Bingo!
{104823}{104853}Fucking bingo.
{104855}{104917}Danny, please,|you gotta fill me in.
{104919}{104946}What are you talking about?
{104947}{104974}With my own two hands.
{104976}{105034}With these dead,|buckled, chicken feet!
{105036}{105082}I wrote it six,|seven years ago.
{105083}{105115}Danny.
{105117}{105155}What screenplay is this?
{105157}{105190}"What screenplay?"
{105192}{105242}The Singing Detective,|that's what.
{105341}{105363}Danny.
{105365}{105399}I put it...|I put it in the thing.
{105401}{105430}I put it up|in the shoe boxes,
{105431}{105460}and I put it in the closet.
{105509}{105563}Oh, that.
{105565}{105590}"Oh, that."
{105592}{105617}Oh, my God.
{105619}{105643}Yes, that.
{105645}{105670}Well, wait a minute.
{105672}{105719}If it's the pages|I think you mean,
{105720}{105791}you threw them out. Ages ago.
{105792}{105814}-No.|-Yes.
{105816}{105863}No. I threw them out.
{105864}{105898}-I threw them out.|-Dan, yes, you did.
{105900}{105924}You threw them out.
{105927}{105960}You said it was garbage.
{105962}{105989}What are you doing?
{106226}{106272}Oh, well.
{106274}{106308}Easy come. Easy go.
{106311}{106347}Was it the only copy?
{106397}{106428}Of course.
{106643}{106679}Did I squeeze it?|Did that hurt?
{106680}{106706}My heart, you mean?
{106752}{106790}You are improving, though,|you know?
{106792}{106814}You really...
{106816}{106846}Except I'm going crazy.
{106848}{106870}Hey, now.
{106872}{106894}I'm going crazy.
{106896}{106958}I lie here and make|these connections
{106959}{107008}between my cheap|little detective story
{107010}{107078}and my own cheap little...
{107080}{107130}Oh, to hell with it.
{107195}{107226}Sex.
{107227}{107258}Yeah, I know the word.
{107259}{107321}Yeah, but that's what|the whole thing is about.
{107323}{107394}My book. My life.|It's about sex.
{107395}{107426}Sex and lies.
{107507}{107570}Oh... I want to sleep|with you again.
{107571}{107598}Dan.
{107600}{107643}I do. With a big|mirror alongside.
{107645}{107705}Oh, stop.
{107707}{107758}That's so I can look|over at myself
{107760}{107842}while I'm fucking|and just leer.
{107843}{107928}And right as it's coming up|in me, the ol' joy juice,
{107930}{107984}I flip it over to one side
{107986}{108048}and come off your gleaming|loins, honey, and just
{108050}{108108}spit right in my own face.
{108138}{108169}Oh, my God.
{108223}{108261}Well. It's improvement.
{108263}{108304}What is?
{108306}{108357}Spitting at myself.
{108359}{108439}A couple of days ago my idea of|true bliss would have been...
{108471}{108518}...spitting into your face.
{108519}{108546}-Dan.|-Huh?
{108547}{108577}What are you going|to do about this?
{108579}{108601}-What?|-This rage,
{108603}{108637}this thing you have,|this hatred?
{108639}{108674}What are you going|to do about it?
{108676}{108729}Well, I'll probably just|write serious literature.
{108732}{108784}Just piss in the wind|like poets and priests do.
{108786}{108808}Who are they?
{108810}{108842}Who are those two?|Who are you?!
{108843}{108870}Who is who?
{108872}{108937}Go, go, go and look,|go and look.
{108970}{109001}No. I don't see anything.
{109030}{109080}What is the matter?
{109082}{109120}Paranoia.
{109122}{109189}Thank you.
{109191}{109264}Baby, I'm so paranoid.
{109266}{109298}Then you've got|everything going
{109299}{109322}for you, haven't you?
{109323}{109359}Mm-hmm.
{109472}{109553}I'm telling you, people|are beginning to notice us.
{109555}{109603}You see, they're looking at us.
{109605}{109678}Who cares? They're all|sick in here, anyway.
{109680}{109727}Are you sure that's|him, with the...?
{109728}{109759}The nurse said so.
{109797}{109894}Maybe we should've brought|flowers... or grapes.
{109896}{109934}What for?
{109936}{109974}Less conspicuous.
{109976}{110003}Oh, yeah.

{111823}{111846}Where are you?
{111847}{111870}I'm lost.
{111871}{111894}Lost?
{111895}{111925}Sorry. I'm lost.
{111927}{111973}Huh?
{111975}{112034}I have a confession to make.
{112035}{112071}Uh-huh.
{112111}{112144}I know more about|that movie offer
{112146}{112173}than I implied.
{112175}{112227}Oh, shit. Come clean.
{112229}{112299}Okay, l... I went, um...
{112301}{112337}to your apartment,|just to check it out
{112339}{112372}'cause you've been|in here so long.
{112374}{112396}Mm-hmm.
{112398}{112432}Um...
{112434}{112464}First of all, Dan...
{112466}{112496}Mmm? Mmm.
{112498}{112547}...the way that you live|is unbelievable.
{112549}{112582}The plants?|They're all dead.
{112584}{112616}Good. I hope they suffered.
{112618}{112670}There is mold on every|single living thing.
{112672}{112717}Uh-huh. Give me|some yogurt, please.
{112719}{112742}First of all, who goes away
{112744}{112776}and leaves Camembert|on the table?
{112778}{112824}You opened my mail.
{112826}{112858}Yes. I did,|but just the bills...
{112859}{112882}You opened my mail.
{112883}{112933}...and this one letter.
{112935}{112966}Don't worry about the bills.
{112967}{113000}That's where I grow the mold.
{113002}{113024}-Anyway.|-From who?
{113026}{113059}...this production company.
{113061}{113099}It's about Singing Detective.
{113101}{113130}Well, yes, it's from
{113132}{113157}this producer, Finney.
{113159}{113184}Okay.
{113186}{113208}Binney?
{113210}{113243}Finney.
{113245}{113272}-Finney with an "F"?|-Yes.
{113274}{113307}Finney with an "F '," not a "B"?
{113309}{113334}-Right. Finney.|-Finney. Not a "B."
{113336}{113379}-'Cause you know him.|-What are you...? What?
{113381}{113403}You know him.
{113405}{113427}I've never heard of him.
{113429}{113469}In what context have|you never heard of him?
{113471}{113496}-Danny.|-What?
{113498}{113542}-Why are you so...?|-Where's the letter?
{113544}{113578}-Where's the letter?|-I'll get it.
{113580}{113603}Where's the letter?
{113637}{113664}It checks out?
{113666}{113737}Well, for what it's worth.
{113739}{113777}But would I get|some dough up front?
{113779}{113806}So it says.
{113808}{113833}How much?
{113835}{113859}40 grand.
{113862}{113906}Ugh. Shit.
{113907}{113942}-But that's for the rights?|-Right.
{113943}{113977}Well, who's going to do|the screenplay?
{113979}{114010}Maybe I can get a shot at it.
{114011}{114049}Well, the producer,|Finney, apparently.
{114051}{114122}The producer.|Why? Why? All these...
{114123}{114153}guys, they think|they can write,
{114155}{114179}every busy little schmuck
{114181}{114216}who can hold a pen|the right way up.
{114218}{114259}I know, so we just take|the money and run.
{114261}{114314}Oh, l... I...
{114315}{114343}Okay.
{114395}{114426}It's a good story, though.
{114427}{114458}Mm-hmm.
{114459}{114507}If it'd stay on the page.
{114539}{114567}Mm-hmm.
{114611}{114642}It's all connections.
{114678}{114713}Connections.
{114715}{114757}Connections.
{114976}{115001}Oh, God.
{115003}{115078}Oh... oh,|we shouldn't have run.
{115080}{115106}No choice.
{115208}{115255}Where the fuck is this?
{115256}{115294}Why here?
{115296}{115354}What are we doing here?
{115356}{115396}Geez. Look at that sun.
{115435}{115466}That is the sun, right?
{115467}{115526}It's a big fucking moon|if it isn't.
{115527}{115554}What is going on?
{115555}{115580}What's going on?
{115803}{115882}What are we gonna do?
{115883}{115911}Hey.
{115947}{116031}There's a building over|there... way over there.
{116083}{116143}"Chew Mail Pouch Tobacco."
{116144}{116178}Oh, no, I hate that stuff.
{116179}{116218}It gets in my throat and my...
{116219}{116318}Maybe what we're looking|for is in that building.
{116320}{116378}Oh, yeah, yeah.
{116379}{116420}What are we looking for?
{116512}{116538}I don't know.
{116714}{116775}Nor me...
{116777}{116806}Nor me.
{116858}{116968}People see us everywhere
{116970}{117080}They think you really care
{117082}{117168}But myself I can't deceive
{117170}{117301}I know it's|only make believe
{117303}{117421}Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba,|ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bah, oh...
{117423}{117567}My one and only prayer|is that some day you'll care
{117569}{117630}My hopes,|my dreams come true
{117632}{117707}My one and only you
{117709}{117845}No one will ever know|how much I love you so
{117847}{117965}My only prayer will be|someday you'll care for me
{117967}{118209}But it's only make-believe...
{118211}{118251}Hey, son.
{118303}{118363}Tough guys don't cry.
{118508}{118551}I know that, sir.
{118644}{118746}I can't now separate in my mind
{118748}{118806}the bus that took my mom and me|to L.A.
{118808}{118855}from the one|which brought us back.
{118932}{118995}Brought me back.
{119061}{119095}I dream about it.
{119097}{119158}I still dream about it.
{119160}{119194}But I'm getting there.
{119196}{119231}My head's getting there.
{119259}{119302}Well...
{119304}{119339}What happened to your mother?
{119368}{119415}She killed herself.
{119471}{119506}How?
{119543}{119589}In the river.
{119591}{119630}In the river.
{119663}{119729}Uh... is-is that really|what happened?
{119731}{119761}What?
{119763}{119791}Well, now, now, l...
{119793}{119846}"Now, now"? Wait, wait.|No. Excuse me. What?
{119875}{119934}You have a young woman|drowned in a bathtub
{119936}{119989}and thrown in the river|in your story.
{119991}{120041}So, what about it?|So, what about it?
{120043}{120090}Sometimes a cigar|is just a cigar.
{120115}{120142}Uh-huh.
{120143}{120186}Well, I'm a bit surprised|that you would duplicate
{120188}{120237}such a traumatic event|in your own life in the pages...
{120239}{120281}In what? Oh, oh, in a|commercial piece of trash?
{120283}{120309}I didn't say that.
{120311}{120334}No, you didn't say that.
{120335}{120362}Mm-hmm.
{120363}{120394}No, Dan, I read you|part of your book
{120396}{120420}to illustrate a point to you.
{120422}{120461}Book. I'll tell you,|that book... that book...
{120463}{120492}There are things|in that book, Doc,
{120494}{120534}that are reaching out|to grab me by the throat.
{120536}{120594}Why don't you let them?
{120626}{120709}Why? What?
{120711}{120750}Let 'em.
{120815}{120874}Me, I'm in that book,|and I didn't even know it.
{120909}{120945}Yes.
{121087}{121147}I didn't kill my mother.
{121149}{121232}I can't imagine that anyone|would ever suggest that you did.
{121293}{121409}You know, l... when|I was a... a... boy...
{121411}{121460}Long ago and far away.
{121463}{121540}No. Here and now.
{121573}{121604}I saw my mother|with the greaseball
{121606}{121724}who worked with my father...|Iike, a partner...
{121773}{121820}...in this service station|in the desert
{121823}{121863}that was never really viable.
{121865}{121911}Dark and Binney.
{121913}{121987}Shit, they were screwing,|you know?
{121989}{122050}The noises,|him on top of her, I guess.
{122052}{122117}Kiss, bang, bang--|all that stuff.
{122119}{122145}I don't know.
{122147}{122187}Maybe she would have|gotten away with it.
{122189}{122220}Maybe it was just...
{122315}{122397}My dad was a hard|sort of guy to talk to.
{122399}{122442}You know, he was good,
{122445}{122486}you know, but, as a kid,
{122487}{122568}I couldn't seem to get close.
{122570}{122601}He was good with engines,|you know?
{122603}{122662}Anything under the hood,|and he was just...
{122663}{122770}He was so quiet. He was just...|he was just too quiet.
{122771}{122850}And I wanted to get closer,|you know?
{122851}{122958}I mean, maybe I wasn't the kind|of kid he would have wanted,
{122959}{122994}you know?
{123019}{123086}Reading,|and off on my own and...
{123139}{123174}...Iocked in.
{123175}{123316}That pain-in-the-ass kid stuff,|but...
{123435}{123509}I wanted to get closer,|and l... I...
{123511}{123567}So you told him about her.
{123569}{123598}Well, I traded her in.
{123599}{123670}I traded her in|for a pat on the head.
{123671}{123707}No. No.
{123709}{123755}I got beat instead,|and so did she.
{123757}{123832}He just hit her from one side|of the room to the other.
{123834}{123912}And we went...
{123914}{123961}to L.A.
{123963}{123990}You know, but by then
{123992}{124056}I think my pa's rage|had-had-had cooled down.
{124058}{124096}I don't think|he wanted us to go,
{124098}{124133}'cause I remember him waving.
{124202}{124287}I remember him waving to us|as the bus went away.
{124347}{124382}Away.
{124383}{124456}And l...
{124458}{124513}And my mom couldn't get a job.
{124515}{124541}It was just, you know...
{124614}{124669}She started|bringing men home and...
{124706}{124758}Oh, the poor bitch.
{124806}{124840}I remember these cracks.
{124842}{124885}There were these cracks|on the ceiling.
{124938}{124987}I remember these cracks.
{125526}{125566}All right.
{125616}{125650}Stand up.
{125652}{125682}What?
{125684}{125734}You can. You can do it.
{125736}{125782}Oh, you think so?
{125784}{125845}It's now or never.
{125904}{125970}Yes. Yes. Yes.

{131851}{131906}You had it coming, baby.
{131947}{132002}They should have|cut your dick off first.

{132562}{132632}Yeah.|One step ahead all the time.
{132634}{132692}But I didn't think the Feds|would waste one of their own,
{132694}{132728}but there you go.
{132730}{132804}No morality these days, eh?
{132806}{132865}I know, but I wanted|to waste him on my own.
{132918}{132957}Well, why not?
{132959}{133017}I'd like to wash|all the men off my skin.
{133066}{133124}No, we'll give these klutzes|one more chance
{133126}{133188}to eliminate the warbler.
{133190}{133225}He's a sitting duck.
{133266}{133345}I'd like to see the bullet|splatter his larynx.
{133396}{133472}Dan Dark is the real killer.

{135735}{135773}No!
{135776}{135813}No...
{135853}{135906}Are you okay?
{135907}{135934}Yeah.
{135997}{136038}Okay, sure.
{136040}{136080}Why not?
{136082}{136174}Why aren't you in the bed?
{136175}{136243}I'm not in the bed|because l
{136245}{136293}stood up all by myself.
{136294}{136323}Fantastic.
{136325}{136364}Yeah, see what I can do.
{136366}{136422}I'll be walking out of here|next week.
{136424}{136459}Well, don't overdo it.
{136461}{136528}You look...|Are you hot?
{136530}{136555}Mm-mm.
{136557}{136584}Okay, 'cause that's how
{136586}{136625}people get disappointed,|you know?
{136626}{136654}You got to take it easy.
{136656}{136681}No, I'm fine.
{136683}{136704}Day by day, in every way,
{136706}{136732}I'm getting better|and better.
{136734}{136767}All right, well,|I'll let you stand up
{136769}{136791}while I lubricate you.
{136793}{136828}I think I can,|but I just... my knees...
{136830}{136852}No, no.
{136854}{136878}I was just kidding.
{136880}{136917}No, I don't expect you to...
{136919}{136978}I'm just so glad|that you're being...
{136980}{137020}It's a real|improvement.
{137023}{137079}You know, you're one of
{137081}{137128}the nicest people|I've met in a long time.
{137161}{137226}Well, you haven't been anywhere|in a long time.
{137228}{137282}One of the prettiest, too.
{137283}{137327}Oh, your eyes.
{137372}{137406}What about them?
{137408}{137452}Your mouth.
{137455}{137494}The way your head|joins your neck,
{137496}{137526}as though|it's hesitating...
{137528}{137600}No, no, no, it's reluctant to...
{137602}{137673}Boy, when I get out of here|I'm just really going to write.
{137675}{137751}The way it, though...
{137753}{137795}No.
{137797}{137836}Oh, you're the girl|in all the songs.
{137838}{137884}Hey, pull the Caddy around,
{137886}{137910}and let's blow out of here.
{137912}{137964}Stop it, Mr. Dark.
{138005}{138048}Oh... oh, I see.
{138050}{138085}Enough of these intimacies, huh?
{138086}{138131}Hell, we hardly know each other.
{138133}{138167}Christ, the only contact
{138169}{138218}we had so far is|you lift up my penis
{138222}{138254}and just grease around it.
{138255}{138298}Oh, what, what's the matter?
{138339}{138382}Whew. Boy, is it hot in here?
{138383}{138421}Lie down, um...
{138423}{138449}You're burning up.
{138451}{138489}Sweet, sweet, sweetness,|I want to see Nicola...
{138491}{138521}-No, no. No, Mr. Dark.|-I want to see...
{138522}{138565}No, no, no, no, no, no.|You got to lay down.
{138566}{138589}I'll find her.
{138590}{138620}She's probably|straight out in the hall.
{138622}{138668}No, no, no, no.|Come on, Mr. Dark, just stay.
{138670}{138719}Come on, come on.
{138721}{138776}Nicola?!
{138778}{138848}Come on, let's just|go back into the bed.
{138850}{138888}Nicola!
{139006}{139038}I told you, come on.
{139039}{139081}Can I get some help here?!
{139083}{139110}I told you.
{139112}{139166}It's okay, nurse.|It's okay.
{139167}{139202}Gentle.
{139204}{139265}Yeah, too heavy for you, angel.
{139266}{139319}Come on, back in the bed.
{139321}{139376}I'm sorry. I am.|I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
{139378}{139423}Slide your feet, gumshoe.
{139425}{139466}Beddy bye-byes.
{139470}{139528}One small step|for man,
{139530}{139601}one giant leap...|for a cripple!
{139650}{139714}Who are you,|and what are you doing here?
{139715}{139749}Hey, that's|a good question.
{139750}{139808}Right on the nose,|as I think they say nowadays.
{139810}{139838}Yeah, whenever that is.
{139839}{139865}Am I hot?
{139866}{139892}Is this because I'm hot?
{139894}{139917}I don't know you.
{139919}{139982}I don't know who you are,|or what you want.
{139983}{140014}Disowning us, are you?
{140015}{140034}Nurse?
{140035}{140065}Nurse... where'd she go?
{140067}{140108}She was just here a second ago.
{140110}{140136}-Where are you going?|-Where you going?
{140138}{140178}Home.
{140180}{140219}That's off|the fucking page, creepo.
{140221}{140245}You are going nowhere.
{140247}{140276}What...
{140278}{140322}We get all the shit
{140323}{140353}and no explanations.
{140355}{140401}Just one fuck-up|after another.
{140403}{140460}And you're the scumbag|that wrote it!
{140462}{140482}Wait, wait, wait, no, no!
{140484}{140513}Many a tear has to fall
{140514}{140542}Where-where are we going?
{140544}{140592}Shaddup!
{140594}{140631}But it's all...
{140633}{140656}Where is everybody?
{140658}{140704}Help!
{140830}{140920}-All in the wonderful game|-Where are we going?!
{140922}{141011}That we know as love...
{141194}{141225}Well, you can rock it,|you can roll it
{141227}{141252}Do the stop|and even stroll it
{141254}{141322}-At the hop|-Hop, hop, hop, hop
{141324}{141350}When the record starts...
{141352}{141379}Rewrite!
{141638}{141686}Ooh, long way down, fella.
{141687}{141740}Right, it's a good last page,
{141742}{141764}bucklehand.
{141766}{141791}Splash!
{141793}{141828}Yeah, it's pooper scooper time|now.
{141830}{141863}Yeah, so spill.
{141866}{141889}Who are we?
{141891}{141905}What are we?
{141907}{141966}When, when you smile
{141967}{142003}When you smile at me
{142036}{142084}Well, well, I know
{142086}{142147}Our love will always be...
{142149}{142212}When, when you kiss
{142214}{142263}When you kiss me right
{142265}{142322}I, I don't want
{142324}{142391}To ever say good night
{142394}{142468}When will you be mine?
{142470}{142553}Oh, baby, I need you
{142554}{142629}I want you near me
{142632}{142670}I love you
{142672}{142768}Yes, I do,|and I hope you hear me!
{142895}{142972}You know, personally,
{142974}{143046}I don't want to walk down|no mean corridors.
{143048}{143075}No, sir.
{143077}{143144}But there's just no pay-off|in picking bluebells.
{143146}{143194}Am I right, or am I right?
{143284}{143333}God, listen to that, would you?
{143335}{143369}Can you hear the guy?
{143370}{143468}Anybody'd think his arm|was being twisted.
{143470}{143570}Hell, we've all been in pain,|one time or another.
{143572}{143675}What I say is, when you're|dealing with the devil,
{143677}{143740}praise the Lord...
{143742}{143806}and pass the ammunition.
{143808}{143902}I am not wrong.
{143903}{143934}Neither am I wrong.
{143978}{144021}Oh, geez, the warbler!
{144247}{144279}No fair.
{144281}{144308}Shoot this prick,
{144310}{144334}will you?!
{144420}{144459}Shut up!
{145085}{145147}Don't, please.
{145149}{145171}Please, don't.
{145173}{145218}Shut your pie hole.
{145243}{145301}No, wait. That's murder.
{145356}{145397}You get a load of that?
{145398}{145438}Murder, he says.
{145440}{145472}I call it...
{145474}{145500}pruning.
{145502}{145578}Only one of us is going|to walk out of here.
{145580}{145624}Sweeter than the roses.
{145698}{145734}What, are you kidding me|with this?
{145833}{145871}Ah, shucks.
{145873}{145950}You could say we'd been|partners, him and me.
{145952}{146052}Like Laurel and Hardy|or Donald and lvana.
{146054}{146214}But, heck, this was|one sick pup, from way back.
{146216}{146306}And I reckon I'm man enough|to tie my own shoelaces now.
{146856}{146889}Hey.
{146891}{146984}You got my hat?
{146986}{147022}Have I got your hat?
{147206}{147260}I think I've cracked this case.
{147299}{147334}Yeah, I think you have, but...
{147335}{147372}No buts.
{147374}{147410}Watch my lips.
{147412}{147437}What?
{147491}{147578}In my dreams you told me
{147580}{147649}You really, really care
{147650}{147727}In my dreams you told me
{147729}{147798}It's a love|you want to share
{147799}{147878}So hold me, hold me, hold me
{147879}{148002}And never, ever let me go
{148006}{148074}Wah-wah-wah-wah
{148076}{148178}In my dreams you told me
{148179}{148249}Our love was here to stay
{148250}{148325}In my dreams you told me
{148327}{148398}Forever and a day
{148400}{148477}That you'll love me,|love me, love me
{148478}{148588}And never, ever let me go
{148590}{148691}Wah-wah-wah-wah
{148693}{148834}It seems that dreams|are sometimes make believe
{148836}{148979}But now I know|that they are true
{148981}{149131}For in my dreams|you said you loved me
{149133}{149276}And in reality,|you love me, love me, too
{149278}{149355}Well, my dreams|have come true
{149357}{149431}I'm as happy as can be
{149433}{149505}For I know in my heart
{149507}{149577}You won't|take this love from me...
{149781}{149865}In my dreams you told me
{149866}{149943}That you really, really cared
{149946}{150033}In my dreams you told me
{150034}{150109}It's a love that can't compare
{150110}{150193}So hold me, hold me, hold me
{150195}{150335}And never, ever let me go
{150448}{150530}In my dreams you told me
{150532}{150610}It's a love that can't compare

Turn around.
Turn around.
Turn the car around and get the hell out of here.
Right now.
Don't go back.
Do not go back there.
Hey! Hey!
What the hell's going on here?
You stole my story.
Well?
I'm sorry. Do l...?
- I don't know you.
- I know that.
That doesn't matter. I know you,
Mr. Rainey, that's what matters.
You stole my story.
You're mistaken.
I don't read manuscripts.
You read this one already.
You stole it.
I can assure you that l...
I know you can. I know that.
I don't want to be assured.
If you want to talk to someone about some grievance you feel you have...
...call my literary agent in New York.
- This is between you and me.
We don't need outsiders, Mr. Rainey.
It is strictly between you and me.
All right, look, mister, whoever you are...
...I don't like being accused of plagiarism...
...if that's what you're accusing me of.
Chico, inside.
I don't blame you for not liking it, but you did it.
You stole my story.
- Leave. I have nothing more to say.
- Yeah, I'll go.
We'll talk more later.
I'm not taking that.
Won't do you any good to play games with me, Mr. Rainey.
This has got to be settled.
So far as I'm concerned, it is.
"Sowing Season.
John Shooter."
Never heard of you, pal.
Never heard of your story.
Now...
...where was I?
I'm open to suggestions.
If you don't go and bite her,
I'll kill her.
"Four days after George had confirmed to his satisfaction...
...that his wife was cheating on him, he confront..."
This is just bad writing.
Just bad writing.
So you know what to do.
Just do it.
No bad writing.
I think that solves it.
Oh, I found one of your stories in the trash, Mr. Rainey.
I thought you might want it, so I put it on the table.
Yeah, I see that, Mrs. Garvey.
"Todd Downey thought that a woman who would steal your love...
...when your love was really all you had, was not much of a woman.
He, therefore, decided to kill her.
He would bury her in the deep corner formed...
...where the house and the barn came together at an extreme angle.
He would bury her where his wife kept her garden.
The garden she loved more than she loved him."
Oh, shit. Oh, sh...
Thank God. From the sound of you,
I didn't know what to think.
Let me get this. That's my job.
I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. Garvey.
I really am.
I'll take care of this.
Go on back to work.
- I didn't write this.
- Oh, I thought you did.
No, it's not mine. Look, it says John
Shooter right there. It's not me.
Oh, I thought it was one of those...
...whatchamacallums, pseudo-names or "-nyms."
No. No, I never used one.
I've never used one.
Oh, I can't imagine why you would.
I mean, hide behind a made-up name.
No. Mrs. Garvey, what I'm trying to tell you is that someone else wrote this.
Oh. Okey dokey, then.
"A woman who'd steal your love when your love was all you had...
...wasn't much of a woman.
That, at least, was Tommy Haverlock's opinion.
He decided to kill her.
He even knew the place he would bury her. The exact place.
The little patch of garden she kept in the extreme angle...
...formed where the old and new parts of the house came together.
He'd bury her in the garden she loved more than she loved him."
Come to the flea market with me.
It'll be fun.
We've got to get rid of some of this stuff. Look at this, it's awful.
No wonder they left it.
Oh, my God, look, there's a window.
It's a secret window.
Oh, this is perfect.
I'm gonna put my garden right there.
It's a secret window, and it'll look down on a secret garden.
Shit.
I didn't steal it.
What?
Mr. Rainey?
I'm all done.
Really? So soon? Well...
...I'll see you next time.
- Mr. Rainey...
...there's something I want to say.
Some women don't know a good thing when they got it.
They don't know they got the whole world right in front of their nose.
There. That's it.
Not another word from me.
Mr. Rainey?
Can I make you something to eat?
No. I ate. Well, earlier.
I'm going to eat later.
And I'll make it myself.
You're a good man, Mr. Rainey.
You too, Mrs. Garvey.
It's my personal business,
Mrs. Garvey. Thank you very much.
My pillows now.
Her sticky, weird fingers on my privacy.
I didn't steal that story.
I don't think.
- Hello?
- Hello, Mort.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm all right.
- Why wouldn't I be all right?
- I don't know.
You're up there alone. Anything could happen and nobody would know.
- I'd know.
- Right.
How's my little baby puppy? Did
Chico get those cataracts removed?
Why did you call, Amy?
What do you want?
I had one of those feelings I get.
I know you think they're stupid and you don't believe them...
...but I believe them.
I was making a sandwich and I had a sensation that you might not be okay.
I held off as long as possible.
But then I couldn't anymore, so here I am.
Well, I don't know what to tell you except I'm fine.
Nothing weird happened or anything?
Do you remember "Secret Window"?
What?
My story. You know, the one where the woman has the garden...
...and then the guy has the shovel.
- Not one of my favorites.
- That's good to know.
Well, it was kind of hostile, don't you think?
Gee, I miss your constructive criticism.
I really do.
What about the story, Mort?
I was just wondering, do you think it's possible...
...that I might have been influenced by anybody or anything at that time?
Other than Jack Daniel's?
I know that part, Amy, hence the question.
I don't know.
You got weird on that one.
You'd write it mostly at night, I think.
- What do you mean, "influenced"?
- I don't know.
Like, by another story?
Look, forget it.
Mort, you swore the one time was the only time.
Forget it, please.
Please, just forget it. Come on.
How's Ted?
He's fine.
I was thinking that he and I should get together sometime, have a drink...
...because we've been to a lot of the same places.
- You know what? I gotta go.
- So do I.
Okay.
- Is he there?
- No.
We're not together.
Wow, well...
...I'd be lying if I said I wasn't on the verge of doing Snoopy dances.
No, Mort.
What I meant was we're not together at the moment.
He's coming over later. He hardly ever comes here. I usually go to his house.
There's a useful detail.
Thanks for that.
Don't ask, then.
It was working just fine that way.
I think you should have him over to the house more.
Such a nice house. I like it.
I mean, I love it. That's why I bought it.
Goodbye, Mort.
Goodbye, Amy.
Shit. Shit. Shit.
Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.
- You read it?
- I did.
I imagine it rang a bell, didn't it?
Oh, it certainly did.
When did you write it?
I thought you'd ask that.
That's the whole point.
Two writers have the same story, it's all about who wrote the words first.
- Wouldn't you say that's true?
- I suppose so.
I suppose that's why I came all the way up here from Mississippi.
I wrote it seven years ago, 1997.
How'd you get it?
That's what I really want to know.
How in the hell did a big money-scribbling asshole like you...
...get down to a little shitsplat town in Mississippi...
...and steal my goddamn story?
- Drop it.
- Drop it?
Drop it. What in the hell do you mean, drop it?
You said you wrote your story in 1997.
I wrote mine in late '94.
It was published for the first time in June 1995 in a magazine.
Nice try, Mr. Shooter, but I beat you by two years.
If anybody's got a bitch about plagiarism, it's me.
You lie!
- No, I don't!
- Prove it!
I don't have to prove a thing to you.
Go look for yourself. Ellery Queen's
Mystery Magazine, June 1995.
- And how am I supposed to find that?
- That's not my problem.
Am I supposed to drive down to your house in Riverdale, New York...
...and ask your wife, Amy, for it?
I read it on your book jacket.
That's not my house. That's hers.
What the hell does that mean?
What do you think, you ignorant hick?
I'm in the middle of a divorce.
D-l-V-O-R-C-E. Divorce.
You strike me as the kind of guy...
...who's on the lookout for a head he can knock off with a shovel.
But what you don't understand is, if we do start to fight...
...it's not going to end...
...until one or the other of us is dead.
Hold your water,
I'm just getting my smokes.
I don't smoke.
I'll give you three days.
Call your ex and get her to send you the magazine with your story in it...
...if there is such a magazine...
...and I'll be back.
If I show you, will you go back where you came from and leave me alone?
Three days.
Always a pleasure to meet a reader.
I don't want to call her.
I want to go to sleep.
I want to take a nap.
Okay. No nap.
I give her a call about the magazine...
...I go write some crap for a couple of hours...
...and then I get to take a nap. Right?
Chico?
Chico
Don't be discouraged
All right, go ahead and be discouraged, you blind bastard.
See if I care.
And returned to the couch...
...in shame...
...degradation...
...and sloth.
Sloth.
Shooter!
I'll get you for this!
You hear me?
I'll get you for this!
Chico? He killed Chico?
Yeah. Last night around 9.
I was asleep.
Look, he left this.
"You have three days.
I'm not joking. No police."
Anytime somebody sits down and writes "No police"...
...that's exactly the time that a fella should get himself over to the police.
Yeah, well, that's what I figured.
So, what I've got is a detailed description of him and his car.
Type a little harder.
You have to get through the carbon.
I didn't get the license plate number...
...but I'm sure it had Mississippi tags, and I think that it started with an A.
That's what I see in my mind.
Needlepoint. Can you believe it?
Doc says it's good for the arthritis.
Anyway, anything you can find out about this guy, I'd appreciate it.
I must cut quite an intimidating law-enforcement figure, huh?
I'd like to know what I'm dealing with.
Maybe he has a violent history.
Maybe you can find him, talk to him.
I think that would be better.
So you got yourself a member of the crazy folks tribe?
Yeah. I mean, they pop up every once in a while.
I suppose it's just the price of selling a few books.
Sorry.
Here's the... Here's that description.
Of course, killing an animal isn't like killing a man.
I'm not even sure it's a crime, come to think.
Come on, it's gotta be.
What about animal cruelty?
What about destruction of private property? What about...?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe.
Okay.
First thing I'm going to need is a description.
Tell me the truth. Did you steal it?
What? No!
Kind of an amazing coincidence, don't you think?
The stories being so much alike?
Obviously he copied me. Would you like to choose a side before we go on?
I'm on your side.
But I still need to know the truth.
Which kind of situation is this?
Is he a regular wacko like you've had before, in which case I can help...
...or something you should talk to your lawyer about?
No, this guy is just simply out of his mind. That's all it is.
Fine. Okay.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to help me in the same way that...
In the same way that you did before.
He wasn't this crazy.
That guy was just an obsessed reader...
...who couldn't tell real life from the crap you make up for a living.
No offense.
Now, this Shooter guy, he threaten your life?
- He put a screwdriver through my dog.
- Well, he did break a law...
...but it doesn't seem to be a very important law in Tashmore Lake.
The sheriff must be a cat person.
Yeah, well, I don't exactly feel safe...
...with a 70-year-old arthritic sheriff watching my back.
Are you gonna help me or not?
Let's see...
...I got a corporate loyalty thing
I got to be back for on Friday...
...but I can give you a couple of days.
Okay.
My story came out a couple years...
...before he says he wrote his.
I've got a copy of the original at Amy's house.
I was just gonna stop by on my way upstate and pick it up.
- Amy's house?
- Yeah.
- Amy and I split up six months ago.
- I'm sorry.
Yeah, me too.
- Amicable?
- Not remotely.
What happened? You finally nail one of your groupies at a book signing?
The Omaha Barnes and Noble?
That was a dick thing to say, you know? Rotten profession.
I apologize.
- You were saying?
- I was saying...
...that if it's just proof that this guy wants, fine. I show him the magazine.
But I think maybe you should be with me when I do.
No shit,
I'm gonna be with you.
- You remember my rate?
- Yeah. An obscene fortune, right?
You'll see a black Cadillac in the driveway tonight when you get home.
Don't freak out, it's me keeping an eye on things.
Okay.
Get a good night's sleep.
You don't look too hot.
This is not my beautiful house.
This is not my beautiful wife.
Anymore.
- You scared the shit out of me.
- Hey, I'm sorry about that.
This last week must have finally caught up with me.
- That's very reassuring. Thanks.
- Hey, relax, Hemingway.
I was only out 10 minutes, swear to God.
Already checked the place.
Everything is fine.
Just waiting for you to get back to let you know.
You think you'll be sticking around tonight, or...?
No. Not unless you want me to.
No. No.
No, I'm sure it's fine in there.
Nope.
No monsters up here.
Did you check under my bed?
Even in your toy chest.
I'll be back in the morning.
Start asking around town.
What the hell you gonna do with that, sailor?
Find out who else saw your nut-job.
Tom Greenleaf.
Tom Greenleaf passed by when I was talking to Shooter.
He waved at us, so he must have gotten a good look at him.
Tom Greenleaf.
How do I get ahold of him?
Bowie's store, breakfast every morning, 9 a.m.
Okay, I got it. Don't worry.
Once I find out where this Shooter's staying...
...I'll stop in for a little freak-me-out chat. Use the word "we" a lot.
"We know what you're doing. We want it to stop. We're watching you."
Trust me, he'll hit the road so hard, it'll hit back.
Hey. You know what?
Are you staying in town tonight?
Yeah, some motel out by Route 9.
Irv's Lakesider, I think it's called.
You know the place?
- Yeah, I know the place.
- Okay.
Good night.
Hello?
Shit.
I know you're in there, shithead!
If you don't come out by the time I count to five...
...I'm gonna come in swinging.
One.
Two!
I killed a mirror.
And my shower door.
I don't care. I'm just gonna smoke.
I'm just gonna totally smoke.
I'll finish these, go to the store...
I'll finish these, go to the store...
...get a brand-new pack, smoke the shit out of that one.
Thought you didn't smoke.
I took it up recently for my health.
How are you, Mr. Rainey?
Oh, I'm just peachy, Mr. Shooter.
How are you?
Well, it sounded like you pitched a fit or something in there.
I don't think you're really all that well.
Stealing from another man, that don't seem to have ever bothered you none.
Being caught up on, though.
Or maybe it's just that successful writers like you...
...throw tantrums when things don't go the way they expect.
Why didn't you get that magazine?
You were down there at her house today, weren't you?
If I get this story and I show it to you...
...will you then kindly disappear?
There isn't any magazine with that story in it, Mr. Rainey.
You and me, we know that.
Okay, then.
What can we do to make you feel better?
I want you to fix it.
What would you like me to fix?
My ending.
The one you wrecked.
I can't decide what's worse...
...stealing my story or ruining the ending.
Mine was perfect.
- I don't think I read your whole story.
- Oh, I bet you did.
"'I know I can do it,'
Todd Downey said...
...helping himself to another ear of corn from the steaming bowl.
'I'm sure that in time...
...her death will be a mystery even to me."'
That's how the story ends, pilgrim.
It's the only ending.
You're going to write it for me and get it published.
And it's gonna have my name on it.
I'd be more than happy to write your ending, Mr. Shooter.
Saw that wife of yours coming out of the house.
- She's purty.
- My wife?
Why don't we just leave her out of this.
Would if I could...
...but I'm starting to think you ain't gonna leave me that option.
You want to wake up from one of your stupid naps...
...and find Amy nailed to your garbage bin?
Or turn on the radio some morning and hear she came off second-best...
...in a match with the chain saw you keep out in the shed?
Do you?
You can't get away with it.
I know what you did...
...and I ain't quitting until right gets put right.
- Is that you, John Wayne?
- Mort?
Are you there? Mort?
Yes, Amy, I'm here.
Just lower your voice a little.
- What is it?
- Where have you been?
I've been trying to get ahold of you all night and this morning.
I was asleep.
Oh, great, so you unplugged the phone?
How may I assist you, Amy?
Oh, God, Mort.
What happened? What?
Someone burned down our house.
That's what happened, okay?
- What?
- Someone burned down our house!
Bye, babe.
Pardon me, miss.
- You left $ 100 on the dresser.
- Shut up!
Surely the escort service told you I was three.
Please.
Some guys are less, some guys are 100 if you like that kind of thing.
Some guys are less than that, but I'm three. I happen to be three.
There's something on your mouth there.
Bye.
Mort!
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I'm really sorry about all this, Amy.
- So am I.
Me too.
Thank you, Ted.
- Mr. And Mrs. Rainey?
- Yes.
- You the owners?
- Yes, we are. We were the owners.
Were the owners?
What do you mean?
You don't own it anymore?
Were Mr. And Mrs. Rainey.
Are the owners.
- I'm Steven Bradley, Riverdale P.D.
- How do you do? Ted Milner.
- This is Fire Chief Wickersham.
- Chief.
We won't keep you long. The insurance investigator needs to see you at 3.
You're victims of arson. The fire was started by an incendiary device...
...made with a champagne bottle and a couple of quarts of gasoline.
Oh, that really works, then, eh?
So first question:
Enemies. You got any?
- No. No one.
- No, no. Not a soul.
Bother you if I answer one or two of these, Ted?
It's okay. It's cool.
Yeah.
I have an enemy.
Sorry I wasn't there to meet you this morning.
I spent last night poking around the site with a flashlight and a Polaroid.
Oops. Broke one of my own rules.
I don't like to call it "the site."
It wasn't a site, it was a house.
Your house, and I'm sorry for your loss.
Thank you very much, Mrs. Evans.
It still says "Mrs."? Fran is fine.
These meetings are hard.
People in your situation are already upset...
...and quite often they see an investigator...
...as an accusation that they've torched their own property.
And in this case, you've given us a plausible suspect...
...who we'll investigate aggressively along with the police.
But in the meantime, that's a list of your claimed insurable property.
Read it and sign an affidavit swearing that the items still belong to you...
...and that they were inside when the fire occurred.
I'm told there was a separation of residence recently...
...so that last bit will be important.
We're going through a divorce.
It's not final yet.
Well, the settlement agreement's all done.
Everything's been negotiated...
...we're just waiting for it to be signed by both parties.
I moved out about six months ago...
...and just hadn't gotten around to hauling all the stuff out yet, so...
Been down that road. Sucks.
These things just have to follow their natural course.
Things will wrap up when everybody's ready for that to happen.
That's been my feeling.
In the meantime, do the best you can with the list.
Thanks.
Do you actually intend to rubberneck?
I hardly think my concern could be construed as rubbernecking.
Amy, he's rubbernecking.
I'm not gonna freak out about this, but, I mean, this is our stuff.
No. All right. He's right.
- This is our stuff.
- He's right. He's right, Ted.
He is right. The law says you have no right to see the listed items at all.
We wink at things like this if nobody minds, but it seems Mr. Rainey does.
Yes. Mr. Rainey minds a lot.
Would it help matters if I took a walk around the block?
- Yes, thanks.
- Sure.
Oh, heck, Ted, live a little.
Make it two.
Rubbernecker.
Mort.
- Wait. I need to ask you something.
- What?
This guy, Shooter. His story. I mean, is this situation like the other time?
I'm sorry. I wouldn't bring it up, but it did happen once before.
Look, that is the only time I've ever done anything remotely like that.
I paid the guy everything he wanted.
Never happened before or since.
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.
- Amy.
- What?
Only you, me and the lawyers know about that, right?
Right.
Because you haven't said anything to Ted. Surely not.
No.
- Have you said something to Ted?
- Come on!
Well, do I have timing or what?
Yes, you do.
Sorry you had to miss that.
I know how much you like my things.
- Oh, Jesus.
- You and me are gonna have a talk.
Be back in 10 minutes.
I'm in trouble.
- I've had enough of your bullshit.
- You're a dick.
Do you feel better?
Yes, I do.
Yeah, look, marriages end.
I'm sorry, but I didn't end yours.
It was done by the time I got there.
Really? You must've thought her wedding ring was a little strange.
Oh, man. Listen, I apologized to you months ago.
I know you don't want me in your life.
I don't want you in mine either.
But until this little divorce thing's done, not much we can do about it.
But I will not let you upset Amy any more than you already have.
So why don't we just wrap this thing up and get out of each other's lives...?
Are we getting the message
I'm sending?
Where are we from, Teddy?
Tennessee...
...Morty.
I was gonna say Mississippi.
No. Long way from there.
Little place called Shooter's Bay.
Come on, Karsch.
Five hundred dollars a day.
Where are you when I need you?
What...?
What fresh hell...?
- Yeah?
- Where you been all day?
I might ask you the same question.
Relax, you're fine.
I checked the cabin an hour ago.
Well, he showed up an hour after you left last night.
Oh, really?
Then he had a busy night.
My office called me about your Riverdale house. I'm sorry.
The worst part is, I hadn't had a chance to get the magazine out.
The one with the story he says I stole.
That's gone up in smoke now.
Do you still want to go through with it?
Meeting? Showing him the magazine?
Hell, yes, man.
I've had a shitty year.
I want it settled now. Everything.
Good. I called your agent when I heard about the house.
I figured he'd have a copy of the magazine.
He sent the original by UPS overnight today.
You can pick it up tomorrow after 3.
I knew there was a reason I hired you.
There's something else.
I caught up with your
Tom Greenleaf today.
The guy who drove past you and Shooter on the lake road.
Well, he's a weird one.
First he says he did go down to the Lake Drive on Tuesday...
...and he saw you like you said.
But then he gets nervous and says:
"No, come to think of it, I didn't.
Didn't see anybody.
Wasn't even on Lake Drive on Tuesday."
Yeah, well, Tom's old.
Maybe just slipped his mind.
Don't be naive.
He was scared shitless.
Somebody got to him.
Come on, wait.
Why would Shooter care if
Tom Greenleaf knows he's here?
- Well, it depends.
- On what?
On what he plans to do to you.
I'm revising my opinion, Mort.
I don't think Shooter's just some nut.
We need to consider the possibility that he was hired to do this.
Somebody with a grudge against you hires a tough guy to rattle you...
...scare you to death.
But he hires the wrong guy.
Things get out of control.
They go further than they're supposed to.
Dead dogs...
...burnt-down houses.
Now he can't call him off.
- Ted.
- Who?
Ted. Amy's Ted.
The Ted that Amy left me for.
That's why he calls himself Shooter.
Ted wants me to know it's him.
He's trying to intimidate me, trying to send me a message.
- Why? What does he want?
- I don't know.
Did you piss him off?
- I might have.
- Okay, here's what we do.
What proof do you have that Shooter was there?
Other than the manuscript.
Physical evidence, I'm talking about.
Bruises. I got bruises on my arms from where he grabbed me.
All right.
You and me are going to go see Greenleaf together.
All right.
Bring the manuscript.
Bring your bruises.
I'm gonna push the guy hard, make it impossible for him to lie.
If he'll tell the police he was threatened too, we've got something.
Bowie's store, breakfast?
9 a.m. Sharp.
I'll see you there.
And bring your six-gun, pilgrim.
It is a good ending.
Oh, shit.
Shit.
Pall Mall.
Cracker bastard.
Sorry.
Ken?
Tom?
Would you like a pack?
I don't smoke.
Did a guy come in here looking for me around 9:00?
- No.
- Big guy, kind of a New York-cop type.
No. No, that doesn't ring a bell.
I overslept.
Well, maybe he did too, because he wasn't here.
Yeah.
What are you doing here?
Matter of fact, I was just on my way over to your place.
Where's your buddy?
- Came alone.
- Sure you did.
I know what you're up to.
Look, Mort...
A lot of what's going on right now is my fault.
Most of it, in fact.
What do you want?
I want you out of our life.
Gotta sign your papers, Mort.
My divorce papers?
Tell her to send them to my lawyer.
She did. He said that you won't return his calls for weeks.
- This is about the settlement?
- Just calm down.
- Money?
- It's not about money.
This is about getting this thing done.
Because I'm afraid if we don't, who knows where it might go.
I think you know what I mean.
Well, Teddy, I think I do, but here's the problem:
I don't respond well to intimidation.
Makes me feel icky. You know?
You know, I'm attempting to have a normal conversation here.
I buried my dog, mister.
This whole thing is out of your control now. You know it, I know it.
You started this shit,
I'm gonna finish it.
Now, do me a favor, go back and tell that to your filthy little friend.
God!
Bummer, Ted.
- Yeah?
- Go to where we met the other day.
Walk down the path a little way.
- Why?
- I'll catch up with you this afternoon.
Anybody you call between now and then is your responsibility.
Tom?
Greenleaf?
Quarter past 2.
You been out about three hours.
Your leg's sleeping.
You laid on the damn thing.
Now, I would have moved you, but I didn't want to wake you.
Got tired of waiting.
Almost pinned a note on you.
Decided not to.
You scare too easy.
I wouldn't go too far if I were you.
I hooked you to those two men in more ways than you know.
You're insane.
I'm going to the police.
Whose screwdriver you think is in that fella's head?
If you leave them here and I disappear...
...you'll find yourself standing with your head in the noose...
...and your feet in Crisco.
What do you want from me?
Why, I told you that already,
Mr. Rainey.
I want you to fix my story.
The one you stole.
Or ain't you ready to admit it yet?
I did not steal your story.
I expect you'll let yourself go to Greenhaven for murder...
...before you'll admit it.
I have the magazine, you lunatic!
I have the magazine!
I have the goddamn magazine!
You have this so-called magazine right now?
On me, no.
I was gonna go pick it up at 3:00.
There can't be any magazine.
Not with that story in it.
That story is mine.
What do you want? To kill me?
Why don't you just do it? Just kill me.
No, sir.
These others here were gonna get in the way of our business.
I couldn't have that.
You bring me that story...
...if it exists.
Your house in two hours.
You got some heavy lifting here first.
I'd get to it if I were you.
By the way...
...if you talk to that sheriff of yours again...
...or if you don't show up at 4:00...
...I will burn your life and every person in it...
...like a cane field in a high wind.
When I show you the magazine that has my name on the contents page...
...with my story inside...
...then what?
- Then I turn myself in.
But I'd take care of myself before a trial, Mr. Rainey.
Because if things turn out that way...
...then I suppose I am crazy.
And that kind of crazy man...
...has no reason or excuse to live.
Listen, you got my hat.
I want it, one way or the other.
- Hello?
- Mort?
Yeah, hi.
I've been so worried about you.
Are you okay?
- I'm okay. I'm okay, Amy.
- Are you sure?
When I saw you yesterday, you seemed so strained. I mean...
- What?
- Do you...?
Do you think things would've been different if we hadn't lost the baby?
Jesus Christ, I don't...
Amy, I don't know.
Let me call you later. I gotta go.
I gotta be somewhere.
What? What is it, Amy?
Breathe. Breathe.
Take a breath.
Where are you? You at Ted's?
Yeah.
How we feeling about old Ted these days?
I don't know.
I love him, I guess.
- That's good.
- I didn't go with other men, you know.
I always wanted to tell you that I didn't go with other men.
Only Ted, and only the last few months after you and me were already over.
If we were over while we were still together, you might've mentioned it...
...because it was news to me.
That's because you weren't there anymore.
You were gone all the time.
I worked at home, Amy!
That's not what I mean.
Even when you were with me, you were gone, up in your head.
I don't think that I looked in your eyes and saw you looking back at me...
...I mean, really with me, for the last two years.
You know what, you're right.
You're absolutely right. It's all my fault.
No. I was a chickenshit.
Ted wanted us to tell you together.
He kept asking, I kept putting it off.
I'll never forget that look on your face.
Get out! Get out!
- I gotta go.
- Mort, wait. Can't we just...?
No! I've gotta go.
- Will you call me if you need me?
- I doubt it.
- Can I come up there?
- Why on earth would you do that?
You still haven't signed the papers yet, Mort.
I know you don't want to deal with it.
Me neither.
But everything's been negotiated.
We don't disagree on a thing.
I don't understand why you won't sign.
Don't you want to get it over with?
Unbelievable.
You were worried about me, and I believed you.
- What an idiot.
- I am worried.
You sound like you did six months ago, and I think it's my fault.
It's my fault, and I wish
I could take it back, but I can't.
I guess you shouldn't have fucked him, then!
You're not going up there?
I am not going to dance around this anymore.
Once he signs, it'll be over. We won't have these horrible conversations.
All right, well, I'm going with you.
I just... I really think
I should go alone, Ted.
Well, that makes no sense.
Just the sight of you is gonna send him.
I was married to the guy for 10 years,
I know how to talk to him.
All I want is for this to be over.
Excuse me.
I'll be back around 7.
Hey, Mr. Rainey!
- I'd like to...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey. Mr. Rainey.
Mr. Rainey, are you all right?
I'm sorry, my throat just double-clutched on me for a second.
- You're very pale.
- Yeah, thank you.
Did the UPS guy drop anything off for me?
- Just the one thing.
- Pardon me?
Just the one thing, I said.
- Oh. Yeah. Thank you.
- Welcome.
Post office would have a cow if they knew we handled the UPS guy's stuff.
I know that, and I certainly appreciate it.
You won't tell them, will you?
- No way.
- Good.
Because I saw what you did.
- I'm sorry?
- I said, they'd shoot me if you did.
You ought to go home and lie down,
Mr. Rainey.
You don't look well at all.
Yeah, that's... That's a good idea.
Cute.
- Got a minute?
- Well, no. I really don't right now.
But I'll give you a call later.
Okay. Sure.
I'm gonna call you on the phone, okay?
Okay.
Nineteen ninety-five.
Contents.
Eighty-three. Eighty-three.
Eighty-one.
Eighty-two.
Ninety-nine.
Ninety-nine.
You cut it out.
You son of a bitch.
You cut it...
...out of the magazine.
Wait a minute.
How would he do that?
I don't know...
...but he did it.
Think about it.
How?
I don't know.
Why'd you put it on?
I don't know.
Maybe he wanted you to.
Why would he want me to put his hat on?
Maybe he wants you to...
Maybe he wants me to what?
To get confused.
Oh, I'm already confused, pilgrim.
Plenty confused.
So don't talk to me about confusion.
Wait a minute. Back up just a sec.
What about that?
What about what?
Well, "pilgrim." "Shooter's Bay."
And the half a dozen other details you've chosen to ignore.
You know what? You're nuts. I don't need to listen to this shit from you.
Are all these things coincidences?
I'm wearing his bruises, aren't I?
- Aren't I?
- Are you?
Well...
This doesn't make any sense.
Would you like to hear something that does make sense? Call the police.
Call Dave Newsome, tell him to come here this second and lock you up...
...before you can do any more damage.
I'm gonna get a knife and cut you out of me.
Before you kill anyone else.
I didn't kill anybody.
- You had a gun.
- Wasn't loaded.
- Really?
- No.
You almost killed them.
You wanted to.
The gun was not loaded!
- You still want to.
- Shut up!
Listen to me.
Because this is how it happens.
- This is how it happens to people.
- Shut up!
There is no John Shooter.
There never has been.
You invented him.
Listen to me, not to him, before it's too late.
Leave me alone!
You are alone.
You're not handling this.
What you're doing is wrong.
You have no idea what you're doing.
You've been eating potato chips this way for 30 years. For 30 years.
Sister found out about the broken window.
The school had to be withdrawn from the competition.
Sister found out about the broken windows.
Then she got up from the table.
We didn't talk for the rest of the night.
Todd Downey thought a woman who'd steal your love...
- What does Todd have to do with it?
- Everything.
I'm starting to believe
Todd was right.
Everything that you're doing is wrong.
What is happening to me?
Oh, I think you know.
I think you have a real good idea.
You don't exist.
Me? I exist, Mr. Rainey.
I exist because you made me.
- Check it out.
- You thought me up.
I'm a dairy farmer from Mississippi.
Gave me my name.
Told me everything you wanted me to do.
I did them things so you wouldn't have to.
Right up there, Tom.
We were standing right there.
Yeah, I know, Mort. I saw you.
I didn't want to say it in front of him, but you were alone.
I know, Tom. Look, just pull over for a second. I want to show you something.
Didn't have the stomach to do it yourself, but you knew I did.
Are we done yet?
We got things all cleaned up around here?
What's the real reason I come for?
- Fix the story.
- That's right.
Fix the ending.
Got to fix the ending.
And how exactly do you suppose we ought to do that?
Mort?
Mort?
Are you there?
I saw your car outside.
Hello?
Mort?
Chico?
That explains a lot.
What the hell?
Hi.
Jesus, Mort.
Where'd you get that old thing?
The attic?
It's mine.
Wasn't ever anybody else's.
Mort, what's wrong?
You got you a wrong number, missus.
Ain't no Mort here.
Mort's dead.
He did a lot of squirming around...
...but in the end he couldn't lie to himself anymore, let alone to me.
Now, I never put a hand on him, missus. I swear.
He took the coward's way out.
- Why are you talking this way?
- That's just the way I talk.
You're scaring me.
It don't matter.
You won't be scared long.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Help!
I'm about done fussing with you.
I am so sorry, missus...
...but right is right and fair is fair...
...and something has got to be done.
By the way, I want you to know that none of this was my idea.
It was Mr. Rainey all along.
You are Mort Rainey.
I got a place for you.
You are Mort Rainey.
I got it all picked out.
You are Mort Rainey.
Mort...
Amy?
- Amy?
- Ted.
- Amy?
- Ted! No!
No!
"'I know I can do it,'
Todd Downey said...
...helping himself to another ear of corn from the steaming bowl.
'I'm sure that in time...
...her death will be a mystery...
...even to me."'
Hi.
Hi.
I'm kind of late.
Hi.
Hi.
- Braces.
- Yeah.
Getting a few things straightened out.
I was kind of wondering if sometime you might possibly be interested in...
I don't need a bag.
Mr. Rainey?
Your front door's open.
I'm coming in.
Mr. Rainey?
- Mort Rainey?
- Oh, hi, Dave.
I didn't hear you.
Come on up.
Glad you're here.
I could use the break.
Working lunch. I'm on a roll.
Yeah.
Both you and I know what you did.
Maybe we don't have enough to put you away now, but eventually...
...we'll find those bodies.
We'll tie you to them...
...and you're going away.
In the meantime, I'd appreciate it if you didn't come into town anymore.
Makes people uncomfortable.
You can do your shopping in New London.
Did you hear what I said?
Sure. No problem.
You know...
...the only thing that matters is the ending.
It's the most important part of the story, the ending.
And this one...
...is very good.
This one's perfect.
"'I know I can do it, '
Todd Downey said...
...helping himself to another ear of corn from the steaming bowl.
'I'm sure that in time...
...every bit of her will be gone.
And her death will be a mystery...
...even to me. "'
One thing's for sure; it's getting weirder out there every day.
No need to run anymore, emma.
You're among friends.
I have been mandated to create the genetic security agency to protect the world from this rapacious menace.
A teenage girl falls six stories, then walks away unscathed.
Help me.
We can't let someone with her ability to manipulate the feelings of others become the tool of our worst nightmare.
She's headed for the skycourse.
This is not good.
No, it's not, is it?
Brennan.
Stop.
Let them go.
This isn't over yet.
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to cause all this trouble.
And now you understand the danger we're all in.
Attempting to escape is a waste of time.
You're still an hour off your game, mr mulwray.
Now, you keep playing hard to get and you're in for the world's worst nightmare.
Don't be so sure about that.
Any nightmare you can dish out will be like a sweet dream to me.
That's enough, mr thorne.
I'd prefer him in one piece.
You want strange?
I'll give you strange.
We get a call on the hotline about a guy who controls electricity.
She's talking about brennan.
Next thing you know, a guy fitting that description runs rampant downtown.
Silent record.
This is becoming tiresome, emma.
Why did we have to rescue you again?
I've apologized a dozen times, adam.
What do i have to say to convince you i'm sorry?
I'm sure that you're sincere in your regrets.
But your actions continue to put us in jeopardy.
I'm just confused and afraid.
We're all afraid.
But you don't have to walk around constantly assaulted by other people's feelings and terrors.
You're right.
Maybe it's time that you looked at your world from a different perspective.
And you take what you see as a problem and you make it a solution.
That's what saved my life.
You know, it's not like we were thrilled to be so different, you know?
But with a little work, being a new mutant can be fabulous.
Or you can end up like thorne.
Well, i'll take fabulous anytime.
Breedlove's death has set events in motion that are going to change our lives forever.
This is only the beginning.
What about brennan?
We'll do whatever we can to get him out.
Assuming he still wants to get out.
You let ms delauro get away.
Yes.
That's primarily due to mr mulwray's interference.
However, now we can use mulwray to entrap her.
You always find the positive in a negative, mr thorne.
It's your responsibility to make something of mr mulwray.
But rather than expending all our resources in searching for all these lost souls, let's find one to bring the others to us.
So, what's this all about?
With everything that's been hitting the fan lately, we wanted you all to be able to get out at a moment's notice.
You know, i'm still not sure why adam thinks it's necessary to set up a second safe house.
Yeah, the one behind my book store's fine.
Absolutely.
But it never hurts to be too careful.
We've been waiting to meet you for a long time, mr mulwray.
Oh, yeah, is that right?
You and ms delauro are high on my... shopping list of anomalies.
Well, you know, it feels so good to be so wanted.
Mr eckhart does not have time for sarcasm.
This is going to hurt.
Now, we've just implanted you with a device called a sub-dermal governor.
Something my people created especially for people like you.
It connects us directly with your dna.
So that whenever you use your abilities without our approval, the pain is debilitating.
Bring it on.
Well, alright then mr mulwray.
Let's see what you're made of.
Release him.
Well, give us your best shot.
Weli... i gather we all have a better idea of just what you can take.
Don't you think?
This is your chance to redeem a misspent life.
An opportunity to protect the world from genetic terrorism as an operative of the genetic security agency.
Mr thorne will give you the details.
You know, i think the two of us should just try to get along.
If you believe that, you're crazier than he is.
See, there's a second feature which mr eckhart neglected to mention.
I have the ability to turn it both on... and off.
I can give you a little jolt from time to time to keep you in line.
You coming?
What do i know about being a hero?
I sell misses and petites, for heaven's sakes.
And i gather you were unusually good at it, because of your gifts.
I'll admit it, i did manipulate customers occasionally.
Often.
Alright, every chance i got but it didn't always work.
When did you first realize that you had these gifts?
When i was a kid.
Maybe five.
I was at this rock festival with my parents.
I got separated from them.
Totally lost in the crowd.
They were both on the flaky side.
When i realized they were gone, i closed my eyes and it was like i saw my parents in a dream.
So what you're saying is you found them?
Yeah, but they figured they'd found me.
They ran off when i was ten and left me in a foster home.
By that time, i didn't care if they found me or not.
Hmm.
Mr eckhart, this is the man you requested for your interview.
My name is mason eckhart.
Ah, you've heard of me.
I gather you're a telepath.
Please, mr bishop, we have no secrets here.
Answer the question.
I'm an esper.
Fine.
Now, tell me what you see when you read my mind.
Unless you'd like me to have mr thorne convince you.
Now that you know that everything you've heard about me is true, i want you to help me bring the rest of your friends to justice.
I don't think adam likes me.
It's not in adam's nature to dislike anyone.
He's a remarkable man.
Saved me from a lot of the same demons that have a hold on you.
Trust me, when i first got here, i was just as confused as you are.
Maybe even more so.
All i wanted to do was live my life.
Then all of a sudden these guys come after you for no good reason.
Well, other than the fact that i can work people over emotionally with my mind.
Well, yes, there is that one thing.
We've all had our gifts since birth.
And just like we learned to walk and talk, we've had to develop skills with our new mutant abilities too.
Okay.
Adam asked me to teach you some focussing techniques.
Help you channel your abilities.
Adam asked you to do that?
He's got a lot of faith in you.
It's up to you to justify that faith.
I just want you to follow my lead.
And don't worry if you can't get it right away.
It's progress we're after.
Not perfection.
Gosh, you're such a hotshot telepath, you should have saw that coming.
That is the end of the pain portion of our program, assuming you do what you're told.
Get the hell out of the chair.
We searched your store and we found a hide out behind a secret panel.
So now all we'd like you to do is invite all your freaky friends to a little get-together.
There's another safe house.
Can't move against eckhart until we're ready.
But from what i've seen of emma, we're almost there.
And i understand your frustration, but taking action prematurely could get us all killed.
Thanks, adam.
For what?
For listening to me when i said i thought emma deserved a second chance.
If i didn't believe in second chances, you wouldn't be here.
Start scan.
Was i really that difficult?
Well, when i found you you were holed in some fleabag hotel.
Hadn't eaten in five days.
I was convinced i was some kind of freak, with what was happening with my body and my mind.
End scan.
Well, i'd say you pulled yourself together pretty well, everything considered.
Well, i owe it all to you.
The good and the bad.
You don't need to go there with me, adam.
So, how am i doing?
Visual diagnostic.
Perfect.
These id's are ironclad with an electronic paper trail that's foolproof.
There you go, allison.
Thank you.
Where's ruby?
Get everyone out of here.
They're everywhere.
Round them up.
Let's go.
Yes, mr thorne.
Alright, mulwray, your powers are back on.
Let's see what you got.
Or do you require a little jolt for motivation?
Nice work, mulwray.
Hey, it was an accident.
He went ghost on me, what am i supposed to do?
He has a perfectly clear shot at me, and he hesitates just long enough for me to phase out, shoots through me and hits two gs agents.
Could have been an accident.
No way.
No, emma's is right.
He threw me a look.
He knew exactly what he was doing.
Good.
Then eckhart hasn't been able to suborn brennan yet.
He made it possible for me to get out of there.
But they got everybody else.
Oh, except for ruby.
He wasn't there.
Has he checked in?
No, i haven't been able to find him yet.
Well, we have failed the people we pledged to protect.
Well, i say let's get in there and get them the hell out.
Fine, get in where?
We don't know where eckhart's holding them.
Let me find them.
I can do it.
I have the power.
Are you willing to work with me to get your gifts under control?
I am.
Then it's time to take your first step into a whole new life.
Nicely done, mr thorne.
I understand there were problems.
Mr mulwray took aim at one of adam's men, the man went intangible, mr mulwray shot through him, which in turn allowed the man to escape.
Bring me the delauro girl.
And no excuses.
Engage thermal cloak.
Analysis of your dna suggests that you've got an enormous reservoir of untapped power.
And a sensitivity that will allow you to tele-empathically contact allison, vince and the others.
But... you have to focus.
You can do it, emma.
Just like i taught you.
Oh, god.
What?
I can see them.
I see allison.
And vince.
Good.
Where are they?
I don't know.
Welcome, all of you.
The children of genomex have been away too long.
My name is mason eckhart.
It's time we all got to know each other better.
I can't do it, adam.
I'm sorry.
Emma, you're new at this.
It's okay.
When you were five, you found your parents, right?
Yeah, but i knew my parents.
And you know brennan.
You can do it.
One more time.
For him.
Focus.
Brennan.
I see him.
I know where he is.
Satellite has a place between the two safe houses.
She's looking for her freaky little friends.
So how does it feel to betray your own kind, huh?
Freaks like us.
Well, i think you should speak for yourself because i'm no freak.
See, i just got a talent and i'm using it the best way i know how.
Yeah, like you have a choice.
Yeah.
Because you see, i volunteered.
You must be real proud.
Well.
Hi.
Lovely to finally meet you face to face, ms de lauro you're eckhart?
Mr eckhart.
You'll learn soon enough how to best deal with authority.
You'll be given an opportunity to put your abilities to use rescuing others like yourself.
You call dragging us here rescue?
I call it protective custody.
Who it's intended to protect is open to interpretation.
As for you, mr mulwray, i have to say i'm terribly disappointed by mr thorne's report on your behaviour.
I've been hearing that since the third grade.
It's really too bad.
You could have been of enormous service to the cause.
Instead, you'll be put into stasis for future examination.
The alarm reboots in five minutes, so whenever you're ready.
Have to find where they're holding emma and the others.
I have to get into that control room.
Hold on, adam.
This is woman's work.
Excuse me, could you tell me where you've got the new mutants locked up?
I would've gotten him i don't doubt it.
Everything seems to check out, okay with you?
Yeah.
Adam has disengaged all of your sub-dermal governors.
So it's time for you guys to hit the road.
Here's your new id's.
Took you long enough to track me here.
You know, you could have let me in on the gag.
Well, i had to figure the walls have ears.
Thanks for the heads up at the safe house.
What are you talking about?
Just lucky i missed.
Shalimar?
Guess again, adam.
Never did know when to stop, did you?
You know, we're both guilty of relentless tenacity, mason.
It's something we've always had in common.
True.
But while you chase your horrific dreams of rescuing these laboratory mistakes, my passion is in the service of humanity.
A grim and limited vision of humanity defined by your narrow mind and your pathetic perspective.
I suspect that you've done that before.
Hey.
Got some unfinished business to attend to.
You and your freaks are threats to everything i hold dear.
These so-called freaks are the product of genomex's recklessness.
What, am i supposed to be wracked by guilt?
No, i'd never expect guilt from you, mason.
It's too much to ask of a sociopath.
No, that's what i've always admired about you, adam.
Your utterly perverse sense of reality.
Thorne.
If i'd known it was this easy to get you here, i'd have invited you sooner.
I'll be back.
Well, that's wonderful.
Then you can visit that cage of freaks i've got upstairs.
Thanks to mutant x, they should all be one their way out by now.
I've disengaged all your governors, and our little talk has gone on just long enough for the virus that i uploaded into your database to do its work.
I expect better than a cheap bluff from you, adam.
Well, i guess it is true.
What's that?
The bigger they are, the faster they run.
That's because he knows i can light him up like a christmas tree.
What do you say we join the others and get out of here?
Nice place.
Huh?
This must be real fun to clean.
Get the feeling he's always like this, huh?
Always.
Welcome.
Emma, when i started this journey, i always knew i needed someone like you.
Someone with the gift of inner vision, and the strength of character to bear the weight of so powerful a gift.
Now, in time, you'll come to see yourself as i see you.
But for now, you'll just have to take my word for it; you're an answered prayer.
And brennan, i never wanted to work with someone like you.
Someone that would squander his incredible gift on petty crime.
An outlaw's live-for-the-moment mentality.
Until i realised that i have chosen the path of the outlaw for myself.
And who better than a fellow outlaw to help show me the way?
You've both seen what we're up against, and that the odds are against us.
But emma, i'm hoping that this is a chance for you to fulfil the potential that you know is inside you and you've never been able to quite reach.
And brennan, for you it's an opportunity to put the past behind you and to join with us all in helping create a new future.
Thank you.
What, no hug?
All right, i'm in.
But as long as there's no hazing or weird secret handshakes.
No hazing.
No handshakes.
But you will be expected to do some basic housekeeping.
Yes, the ring is your key to your own personal dna strand.
Yours and yours alone.
Welcome to mutant x.
God help anyone who tries to stand in our way.
<alarm sounds>
You've reached The Auk.
We're currently only accepting reservations for large parties.
Please leave a message at the sound of the tone,
and someone will get back to you.
WOMAN: I know you're there, David, pick up.
Well, then you have to call me.
There are some things that we have to talk about.
I mean you know that, and I get the impression that you're avoiding me.
Well, anyway, call me.
We have to deal with this.
Bye.
I love you, too, Claire.
Judas Priest.
The pressure. (SIGHS)
Anyway, I did manage to clear the obstruction out of your outlet pipe.
We got a confit de canard in the oven here, Phonce.
The duck?
Oh, lovely.
You know, since I ate that here
I'd given thought to raising ducks.
I swear, Dave, that is the best duck that I've ever eaten in my entire life.
Mmm! Oh, my God!
With grub like that on the menu, they should be beating the doors down.
Mmm.
1961, Dave?
Well, now, a little grand for lunch, don't you think?
What the hell.
So, any progress on the...
RS...
G?
RSV, Dave.
Yeah. I am very close.
Very close now.
I probably never should have mentioned to you in the first place.
I mean, it's strictly on a need to know basis, you know what I mean?
What you don't know won't hurt you kind of thing, the RSV.
I wouldn't breathe a word, you know, Phonce.
On my honor.
Dave, if anybody ever comes down to the restaurant and they're asking unusual questions, right, no matter how insignificant that might seem to you, you call me up, all right?
Absolutely.
Strange radio traffic on the scanner last night, Dave.
Scanner?
Phonce.
What scanner?
Phonce, can you slow up a bit?
We're being watched, Dave.
Hold on.
See.
Hunters?
No, heard no shots.
I see no shell casings.
Maybe it's the boys from Pushthrough, you know, casing my place.
No. If they were gonna knock you over I would have heard.
I suppose we should be
- concerned.
- Concerned?
Concerned?
I knew it.
It's the Winnebagos.
They're after the RSV.
Help me with this one, Phonce.
Well, obviously you're involved now.
I am?
Look.
Come to dinner tonight.
I'll explain everything.
All right, tonight.
Yeah. I'll go tell Deb you're coming.
Seven o'clock?
Seven is good.
Oh, and the sister-in-law is in town.
She's a bookish creature.
Dave, good to have you aboard.
Here, you know, for dinner.
Oh, I should open this up, right?
Let him breathe.
Good idea.
It's quite messy out there.
Yeah. Yeah.
Here you go.
(FOOTSTEPS
DESCENDING A STAIRCASE)
So, you are the famous Dave.
You ever tasted wine like that, Deb?
It is lovely, Dave.
Phonce is becoming a regular connoisseur.
DEB: Mmm-hmm.
It's just wine, they're all the same.
Oh, my, from the girl from Gull Tickle.
She been off to Montreal, and she knows all about wine now, doesn't she?
It is just wine after all, but do you like it?
Deep, penetrating bouquet.
Ripe pinot fruit.
Balanced with some real terroir.
Earthiness, tar, bacon fat.
It's evocative. Recalling hardwood forests, losing one's cherry at a price...
- DEB: Alice.
- PHONCE: Don't bite her, Dave boy.
She's saucy by nature.
Seriously, Dave, it's beautiful.
I think it's just about the most beautiful thing I ever tasted.
So, you are a student of...
I've applied to an architecture school.
Waiting to hear.
Oh.
So...
Now.
To the business at hand and to other matters arising.
Sorry?
We're gonna talk about the RSV.
Of course.
Dave.
I would like to show you my shed.
Sure.
No, no. We're going to take the tunnel.
A tunnel?
This is something, Phonce.
Yeah, the Americans built it during the war.
It was convenience originally but now with the woods crawling with Winnebagos it is an absolute necessity.
No, I meant...
I meant the lights.
Tsvetkov Illumination System.
Yury Tsvetkov, Dave, a partner of mine.
A Bulgarian guy, he defected at Gander in '89.
He boarded with us briefly.
Well, I always reckoned he headed out for California.
How do they work?
It's a mystery to me.
I'll tell you, Dave.
They actually break the energy equation.
That's right.
You can light the biggest kind of a room with a double A battery.
Yeah. Dave.
The strange thing is you can't read under it.
The words just float right off the page.
Okay, come on.
Oh, Dave.
- Before we get down to business...
- (OPENING BOTTLE)
...I'd like to ask your opinion on something.
You've been around, eh?
What do you mean?
I mean you're a man of the world.
Spent some time in the big city.
You hung around with the bohemian crowd.
I suppose.
I don't mean to imply anything.
Not about to suggest you had any intimate knowledge...
What's the question, Phonce?
Because... (GRUNTS)
I came across this.
I salvaged it,
I guess you could say.
It's an operation being undertaken at sea.
There are at least 20 more like this one.
Yes?
And I was wondering...
...is this cocaine,
Dave, or heroin?
Not that I am a drug addict or even planning on becoming one.
But... this must be worth a few dollars, eh?
Christ in heaven.
Then who's been watching you is the police.
No, no.
I recovered this over two years ago.
Jesus.
That must be...
Twenty-six pounds.
What do you want me to do?
Well, you tell me what it is, how much it's worth and where we can unload it.
I mean, have you ever tried cocaine?
No, no, no, no, never.
Once or twice.
Somebody I knew had some.
So?
For Christ's sake, Phonce, I am no expert.
You can throw it in the bay.
People kill for this stuff.
Well, so, you don't think it's really cocaine?
I don't know.
I thought you horked it up your nose.
It's cocaine.
And you do put it up your nose.
So, is it any good?
Oh! Oh.
Wow.
It's good.
It's good.
May I?
Oh, fill your boots.
What I still don't understand, Phonce, is what is an RSV and why would these Winnebago people be interested in this giant sack?
They're unrelated.
They're totally unrelated, Dave.
Dave, Dave.
This is my Recreational
Submarine Vehicle.
Or RSV, for short.
Winnebago.
The recreational vehicle giant.
I think they mean to steal my plans.
DAVE: But, Phonce, do you think there's a market for Recreational
Submarine Vehicles?
Rose crested grebe, my friend.
Rose crested grebe.
- So?
- Nature, old man.
People are going mental onto nature.
I mean, get geezers hiding in blinds all day to get a snap of some bird that they're not even gonna eat.
The RSV, once we get a few windows in, so people can see all the little fishies.
Looks a little cramped.
It's a prototype.
It's a two-man.
If you're interested in joining me on the sea trials?
Oh, I would.
In a heartbeat.
But I doubt I'll be around.
Why?
I am going to sell The Auk.
It's not working out.
People aren't coming.
I am going bust.
If there was anything I could do, you know, any choice I had, Phonce,
- anything at all...
- Dave.
Though I got to say you're one of the best cooks that I've ever come across in my life.
I feel I must observe that there have been some serious shortcomings in the marketing department over at The Auk.
Maybe it is a little too far off the beaten track.
Nonsense.
It's the marketing.
And isolation's got nothing to do with it.
I mean, that should be part of the appeal.
Dave, look, look. People will fly here from halfway across the world to gawk at a whale or to take a picture of a gannet.
Dave.
Dave. Dave, I got an idea.
Go on, go on.
Go ahead, boy.
Dave.
It's so clear.
Now you promise me you'll give this a second chance.
Sure.
All right. Just do this one thing for me, all right?
Now, I mean, even if you got to sell The Auk you'll be in a much better negotiating position to be pitching a goin' concern, right?
Christ, Dave, they'll fleece you for an empty restaurant, right?
All right, now listen to me.
I got a little plan.
MAN 1 OVER RADIO: All right, we're in position.
MAN 2:  Copy that.
To rose crested grebe.
To the call of The Auk.
MAN: Dave.
Dave, old man.
Dave!
Remember?
Our little plan.
Hey, boys, look, it's Dave! Where'd you get the cool car, Dave?
Hey, Dave!
Dave.
Mmm?
I couldn't help noticing, last night at dinner you were somehow...
How can I say it?
Affected.
Yeah.
Affected by...
By Alice.
Alice? In what way?
These women from out there, from Gull Tickle, can have a powerful effect on a man.
I am married, Phonce.
I am.
Was.
I am.
Dave, I think I found what we're looking for.
Campbell's Dodger Bird.
Yes.
And it's from Vanuatu.
What would a bird from the
South Pacific be doing here?
I suppose blown off course during its annual migration from the steamy land of the coconuts.
But that's not the point, Dave.
If you read on, you'll notice that it is extremely rare.
If it's too wacky, no one will take it seriously.
Yeah. Perhaps you're right, Dave.
But still I feel that the bird must have a certain measure of sex appeal.
Marketing, Dave, marketing.
You poor old auk.
Another candidate then, Phonce?
No, Dave, this is the bird.
"Tasker's Sulphureous Duck.
"Aythya flagitius.
"Range: The Carolina's to the coastal waters of Newfoundland.
"Distinct from the common Sulphureous
"by its unusual yellow markings and white cheek spots."
"Now extremely rare."
"Last spotted by Dr. Hans Speidal near Fox Bite, Newfoundland"
"in March 1985."
It's spot on, Dave.
It's spot on. Look, look.
Look, it's a diver.
It's a salt water diving duck.
You just report having seen it on the bay by the restaurant, and we are in business.
Yes. But I...
You just watch, Dave.
They'll be tramping all over the place.
You'll be maggedy with bird watchers.
Look, one fellow will say,
"Did you see that?"
And another fellow'll say, "Yeah,
I think I seen something."
Mass hysteria, Dave.
Psychology of the mob.
All right, my son.
Oh, no.
Phonce. Phonce.
Dave.
There's a phone booth down by the baseball diamond.
Now, nobody will see you there.
And it's nice and quiet.
Why can't we make the phone call from here?
Because we got to cover our backs.
They probably got some sort of a call-tracing mechanism down to the CBC.
Just in case some lunatic calls in.
Says he's planning on skull fucking the premier.
Come on, Dave, we're running behind.
Phonce, I have to use the washroom.
That's just nerves,
Dave, come on.
Oh, no, I think I have to.
No, there's no time!
All right, well, here's the description of the bird.
Anatomical features and behavior.
What's it called again?
Perfect, Dave, perfect.
Now, remember, for this to work you want them to identify the bird.
Your ignorance is our trump card.
This is not gonna work.
It'll work like a charm.
Now go on. Come on.
The show's about to start.
(OVER RADIO)  Hello, everyone!
Buster Bradlen here with Avian Week.
Our guest expert today is Dr. Jack Tomlinson.
Well, Dr. Tomlinson, that cold snap must've given our feathered friends a start.
Most regular visitors are prepared for this kind of thing, and it was short-lived. There was probably some kill off.
Nature can be cruel, eh?
Well, I wouldn't characterize...
Our number,
Out-of-town callers dial 1800-767-bird.
And our first caller of today is from Cappahayden.
Go ahead, you're on the air.
MAN:  Dr. Jack?
Yeah?
I was in the woods the other day, right, and I saw this woodpecker
and I figured it was an hairy, but he had a yellow head...
A yellow cap.
Yeah.
Well, there are some rare aberrant, immature, hairy woodpeckers with the cap.
That would be exciting.
Are you sure it wasn't three-toed?
I couldn't get close enough to tell.
I took a shot at him, that I did.
But I missed.
Well, this might be a good time to bring something up,
the matter of people shooting at birds so as to get a closer look.
No. No.
And you know, while we're on
woodpeckers,
Dr. Tomlinson,
I have often wondered what species was Woody?
Line 4, go ahead.
You're on the air.
Line 4, you're on the air.
Well, seems we lost that one.
Oh, no. No, I'm here.
I am here on line 4.
All right, go ahead. You're with
Buster Bradlen and Dr. Jack Tomlinson.
I've seen a...
I've seen a strange bird.
A duck, I think.
Yeah, yeah. Go ahead.
Could you offer us a little more than that?
Uh...
Well, it's a duck, I think, as I said.
Very colorful markings.
Yellow markings.
I see. And where did you see this bird?
And a white tuft.
Yes. And where did you see it?
Oh! On Push Cove right by Pushthrough.
Oh, saltwater. Hmm.
That's different.
Isn't that where that restaurant used to be?
Yeah. I think the restaurant is still there.
Did you see just the one?
Yes.
And did it dive for extended periods or come up near shore?
Dive, I didn't see it dive.
(STUTTERING) It was getting dark, it was very far away.
Well, it doesn't sound like anything I know.
Thank you, caller.
All right, line 2...
Oh!
Shit.
I was wondering if a rose crested grebe has been seen since the storm?
- (BANGING ON CAR)
-  That's a...
Hey, why don't you get your head out of your ass?
You almost ran me over, shithead.
GIRL 2: Yeah, freak.
- Huh!
- Get out of here!
GIRL 1: You have to learn to drive!
- Oh, my God.
- GIRL 2: Idiot!
They saw me for sure.
Oh, my God.
MALE CALLER:
I saw that too, yeah.
She's like no duck
I've ever seen.
Go down below the water and come back 40 or 50 feet away.
Yes.
They come up on the beach, too.
Never seen the like.
It was...
It was walking around all confident, but in a wobbly sort of way.
My God!
We have two listeners describing what can only be
Tasker's Sulphureous Duck.
Phonce! Phonce!
This changes the picture completely.
It was thought extinct until there was a sighting in Fairview...
Extinct? Thought extinct?
...by the noted ornithologist,
Dr. Hans Speidal.
Phonce! Are you home?
Phonce!
Dave!
Got to hide the car.
I've got to hide it, if those girls talk, Jesus, and they will, too.
Dave, calm down, man!
I crashed into the telephone booth, the whole thing obliterated.
- Calm down!
- Those girls, they were watching me.
- Calm down.
- Panicked, I guess.
Dave, it was perfect!
In the end, you come across as a proper simpleton!
Why is that good?
Well, they would never suspect a scheme from such an asshole.
Now, you say that some girls saw you knock over a phone booth.
They'll call the police, they'll call the phone company.
Were they young girls?
Yeah, yeah.
They'll never say anything.
And everyone would automatically assume that they had something to do with it, and you would just deny it.
I mean, what would you be doing up to the baseball diamond?
Calling the radio show!
(CHUCKLES) Dave...
Columbo lives in Los Angeles, which is on television.
Were you always gonna call?
Always have a plan B, Dave.
Always have a contingency.
Phonce, I'm going to shit something awful!
Go on.
Go to the house, boy.
Yeah.
Hey, Dave!
Dave.
There's two kinds of people in the world!
Those whose assholes seize up during a crisis and those who shit themselves.
Winston Churchill during the Blitz for instance.
His sphincter locked with bulldog determination.
They say he never shit during the entire Battle of Britain.
Are you looking for Phonce? He's usually up and gone by now.
No, Phonce, no.
I'm just back seeing, you know?
Uh, the other night,
I thought I...
I thought I left my...
Watch, so...
Dave.
Yeah.
Could... Can I get in the bathroom now?
Oh! Yeah, of course.
- See you later.
- Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.
Can I help you?
I come about the bird.
A bird, madam?
Oh, you've not heard then?
It was on the radio.
There's been quite a remarkable sighting down off the rocks.
No, well, I've...
I've heard of no bird.
But, uh...
I caution you about the rocks.
It's all so exciting.
The birding community is going to be very keen.
If it's fine with you,
I've parked in your lot.
The lot is for customers.
I had no idea you were still open.
Well, perhaps lunch then?
If you have a table.
I'm sure I could squeeze you in.
At 1:00?
Yeah.
Good luck in your quest.
I'm sorry,
I've nothing for lunch.
Supper...
Tomorrow is fine.
Yeah.
Yes, it's filling up fast.
All right.
All right, good.
All right, see you tomorrow.
You need provisions, don't you?
You should have got 'em right after the phone call!
I guess.
Right.
Give us a list.
- Right-o.
- Phonce.
Phonce.
Jesus Murphy.
Hey!
I wasn't sure about the haddock.
So I got this great-looking salmon.
Good, good.
How did this happen?
It's a crazy thing, a bird, evidently, some rare specimen sighted in the area.
What kind of bird?
Uh...
Rare, Tasker's?
What...
I could hardly say it.
Sulphureous Duck.
Shit!
WOMAN: Yoo-hoo!
They started arriving.
Dave, Dave.
You're covered in fish slime.
You stay and prep and I'll take care of the front of house.
Just temporarily.
Sure.
How do I look?
It's just about the best thing I ever saw, but...
Good.
- Hello.
- WOMAN: Hello.
- Salmon...
- Uh-huh.
...has asked for a French wine.
Oh!
The guy there.
Oh-ho.
I have half bottles of the '88.
Does he want an appetizer?
The, um...
The little, um...
Toast with the goat cheese and tomatoes.
Coulis of sun dried tomatoes.
I'm gonna have to pay you to come back tomorrow.
We'll work something out.
I did well on tips.
Shit, I'm tired.
I'll come back tomorrow.
But you run supplies.
Yeah, I'll do that,
I'll take care of it.
And you need one other waitress.
Probably two.
Yes, of course, absolutely.
I got to go to bed, Dave.
Where's your wife?
Phonce said you were married.
She's in Washington DC.
She lives there now.
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
Give us a cork here, Dave.
Move my head.
- Ooh!
- Tough guy!
Bette, don't keep
Mr. Purcell waiting.
(SOFTLY) Retarded.
Retarded, retarded, retarded.
Of course, the poor creature hasn't had a day of work since you laid her off.
She's invaluable.
Isn't that right?
Queer things happening up your way, Mr. Purcell.
- What do you mean?
- Oh.
People, snooping around in the night...
With equipment.
Those bird watchers.
Bird watchers.
I don't know now if that's the kind of thing we want going on around here, bird watching.
What kind of birds are they watching, I wonder?
And why?
Oh, I know now they haven't got a lot of time to be wasting.
And they've probably got the biggest kind of government jobs, too.
- Thanks.
- Phonce says Murphy, he's in with them.
Yeah. And what happened to his
Romanian friend, Tsvetkov?
- Bulgarian!
- (DOOR CLOSING)
Oh, I don't mind foreigners personally.
I don't mind them at all.
But that crowd up to the university...
I'm ready.
Mr. Purcell,
WOMAN: Madame, it was a lovely meal.
Thank you.
What's the word?
Happy customers?
Positively giddy, Dave.
Though no sighting of the rare bird.
Amazing bit of luck for me, eh?
Quite.
Two lobsters, risotto fungi, lamb rosette.
I think we're good for wine.
Yeah, you're probably right. I don't know what I was thinking, eh.
You got company.
What?
Phonce is out there.
Yes, yes, a perfectly preserved fossil.
Jesus big jaw bone, it's a raptor of some sort.
Jeez, can cut a man in half with one bite.
How are we enjoying our dinner?
Oh, simply delightful.
Good, I see you've met
Mr. Alphonse Murphy.
Yes, he's just been telling us the most extraordinary tale.
Perhaps, Mr. Murphy, we should speak in the kitchen?
Oh.
Of course, Mr. Purcell, of course.
Good.
Enjoy.
Thank you.
- Excuse us.
- Thank you.
Dinosaur bones, Phonce?
Yeah.
It's a new project.
Very busy now, Phonce, what's up?
What can I do?
I was just wondering if you had an opportunity to...
Get a price on the cocaine.
I'm really sorry, Phonce, but
I've been swamped, you know?
Not to worry.
Not to worry.
Just curious. There's no pressure, Dave, no pressure.
And you want to proceed very carefully.
Yeah.
It's a delicate matter.
(BREATHING HEAVILY) Yeah.
If you need the money, because I could...
No, no, no.
If you need that money,
I could...
Dave, it's fine.
I owe it to you.
Dave.
You do not owe it to me,
I mean, what are friends for?
I mean,
I expect no less from you.
So, I'm searching.
I'll say it for you,
I'll tell him.
- Talk to you later.
- Have a good night.
- All right, Dave.
- Say hi to Deb.
- I will, yeah.
- Yeah.
The Auk.
WOMAN:  Moira tells me business is booming.
Claire!
Something about a bird.
Well, thank you, darling,
I'm fine, too.
So, it's a wonderful opportunity then?
In what way?
Well, we've talked about it already, for selling.
Yeah, we have.
I don't want to get into it right now, but I thought you could move on.
No, this is hardly the subject we should talk about over the telephone.
Well, I don't know.
With my schedule right now...
I'll be back very soon, David.
That sounds like a good Idea.
You know where you can find me.
Let's be civil, David.
I'm being civil.
I meant it.
No, you were being sarcastic.
I mean, it's not like you come to Washington to see me.
I'll try.
As soon as I find someone to run the restaurant, I'll be on a plane.
That would be great!
I got to go.
Okay.
Goodbye, David.
(WHISPERING) Dave.
Yeah.
- Table six.
- Mmm-hmm.
- Porcini.
- Yeah.
Asking a lot of questions.
What kind of questions?
How long we've been open?
We always this busy?
Do you have a proper wine cellar?
Oh, yeah?
They didn't order any wine.
Can you show me?
DAVE: Mmm.
Stop. Stop.
Move in to the side.
Yeah, over there.
MAN: One, two, three.
Heave!
What's up?
Body in the water.
Up, she comes.
One of those bird watchers, apparently.
Imagine, died looking for a duck.
You takes your chances, gallivanting around on these rocks.
I dare say her head was not clear since it was bouncing off on the cliff face on the way down.
Sure, yeah.
Coming through.
A woman, she drowned, Phonce.
A birdwatcher, she drowned.
She was looking for the duck and she...
She fell off a cliff.
Hmm, sorry to hear that.
Sorry? Fucking sorry? How about guilty, we killed that woman?
We're responsible for that woman's death.
We are not!
She died pursuing a lie that we fabricated.
We are morally, if not criminally responsible, we're going to jail!
Probably to hell.
Pull yourself together, boy.
Everybody takes their chances, Dave.
It was undoubtedly the woman's time.
I mean, if she hadn't fallen off the cliff, she would have been struck by lightning or choked on a bone.
Perhaps in your restaurant, and that would be a pickle, wouldn't it?
Oh, Phonce, I'm worried.
We've got to put a stop to this.
Dave, this is just between us.
And we can trust one another.
I'm with you all the way on this, Dave.
And you can count on me.
And I'd like to think that I can count on you.
Of course.
Good, 'cause we got sea trials tonight.
What?
Full moon, 0300 hours.
What are you gonna do with that?
We're taking her down to the water.
You're cracked!
How much does this thing weigh?
1,200 pounds.
It's ultra-light.
Now, we're gonna wheel her down the hill.
And that's where you come in, right, you're the brake man.
That thing isn't going anywhere.
Besides, I'm not sure I want to be party to you drowning yourself.
Dave, I have made the appropriate calculations.
Now, I'm not asking very much.
You've always been a very good neighbor and I need your assistance on this one night.
After this, you can forget you ever knew me.
But, Dave, you are the only person that I can trust at this time.
So, uh...
Is there any movement on the cocaine?
I, um...
You know, I might have a lead.
- A lead?
- Yeah.
Good. Good.
All right, I'll help you.
Good.
A drink then!
Kind of like a christening.
Here, help yourself, Dave.
- There.
- Thank you.
I got a little present for you, Dave.
I was gonna give it to you later.
But...
Where there are risks, eh?
It's elemental.
Something to remember a great friendship by.
Beautiful, Phonce.
It's no simple duck, Dave.
That's Tasker's Sulphureous.
The rarest of birds.
I, uh, haven't finished painting it yet.
- Moves pretty well.
- Yeah.
You mind the brake now, we don't want it getting away from us on the incline.
Phonce!
Alphonse.
Going really quick now.
Phonce!
- Yes, what?
- Phonce!
Phonce!
I can't hold on.
- (CLANGING)
- Phonce!
Phonce!
Come on, Dave.
I'm trying!
PHONCE: Jesus, in the dirt!
Phonce!
Dave!
Phonce!
Phonce!
Phonce!
Phonce!
- (CLANGS)
- (GROANS)
Dave! Dave!
Dave, here!
I was shouting for you to stay ashore.
Thought you were drowning.
Very fucking dangerous, Dave.
We're drifting.
Stand back.
All right.
It's a tight squeeze.
Help.
PHONCE: Jesus, Dave.
It's a little bit stuffy in here, don't you think, Phonce?
That's 'cause there's no oxygen, Dave.
Oh, is that all?
It's a good sign, proves she's tight.
Now, just fire up the engines here.
God damn, Tsvetkov lamps!
Is that fuel low?
Right.
These pumps kick in now, Dave old man, you'll have oxygen aplenty.
Run silent.
Run deep.
Are we underwater now, Phonce?
You're smart, Dave.
Dive.
Dive!
Dive!
Phonce, excuse me, but how do you know where we're going?
Could be a simple matter of checking the sonar here.
Goddamn Tsvetkov lamps!
Is that 13 fathoms, is that 13?
No, no!
It's 18 fathoms.
18 fathoms.
Or is that 11?
Oh!
Thirty fathoms.
Judas priest, that is deep.
What is that, Phonce?
Thirty fathoms.
Must be the upper range of the hull's pressure tolerance.
All right.
Phonce, I'm having an anxiety attack.
Not uncommon, Dave.
Prospective submariners usually goes through an incredible battery of psychological tests.
And the last thing you want is somebody cracking up in the submarine.
Guess, well, I'm saying I'm...
...cracking up.
Oh, no. I mean a full-fledged nut-out, you know, like...
Like, screaming and yelling,
"Get me out, get me out."
Okay, Dave.
Just one last thing.
Up periscope.
Okay, Dave, now.
Things should start to get interesting.
Oh, Jesus, Murphy it's so beautiful.
Wait! Shit!
What? What?
There's three guys on the community wharf.
They were at the restaurant last night.
You know who they are, don't ya?
Goddamn Winnebagos.
Here, let me see that.
Here, let me see.
Oh, yeah.
That man is obviously with the
Winnebago corporation.
Industry is the new frontier of espionage.
All right.
Just gotta open her up here, Dave.
And get us home.
Mmm-hmm.
Hey!
What's up?
Phonce is having lunch.
That's a look, Dave.
And your wife called.
She was kinda curt with me.
I think she suspects we're having an affair.
If only.
If only...
She wasn't so suspicious, you know.
HOST:  Today's special guest is noted ornithologist Dr. Hans Spiedal.
It's the bird man.
DAVE: What?
The bird man is on the radio.
...doctor, the local birding community
certainly has gotten itself into a flap
over the sighting of this
Tasker's Sulphureous.
Hey!
You know, as well as many other visitors like yourself from abroad,
given your particular part in the story, you must be very excited.
No.
A Tasker's Sulphureous has been known to rangers...
That's Spiedal, Hans Spiedal. First guy to spot the duck in the '80s.
...particular about the sighting.
The terrain, specifically the shoreline in Push Cove,
is all together too abrupt, it's too brutal.
Frankly, I'm amazed that humans choose to settle in that godforsaken place.
I'm afraid someone has made a mistake.
Oh!
Well, then.
Well, that's terrible, terrible to have you travel all this way
on a fool's errand, all the way from Germany.
What are we talking airfares here, Doctor?
I'm sure,
I don't know, but, uh...
What does he know?
Everything, Phonce.
He's the most respected ornithologist in the whole world almost.
Besides... he's right.
(WHISPERING) There is no duck.
Remember?
Well, still only his opinion.
It's a shame I didn't put the place on the market when we were doing such good business.
Dave, you're throwing in the towel again.
It's not over yet.
Plan B.
Time for plan B.
I thought we already employed plan B, Phonce?
Dave, there's no problem.
We go to plan C.
Always have a plan C, Dave.
Run silent, run deep.
Duck's back.
Dougie, did you ever hear of the Loch Ness monster?
No.
The duck is like the Loch Ness monster.
Dismissed out of hand by serious-minded people.
Championed forever, by a loyal crowd of quacks.
No, boy, here's picture in the paper.
I'm surprised Buddy got such a good picture.
He must have the finest kind of gear.
They'll just keep studying the photo until they see something wrong.
They'll blow it up sections, until they see a flaw.
Who? Who's gonna blow up the photo?
The international bird police?
Inter-bird?
Everybody wants that bird to be out there, except you, Dave.
I want it to be there.
Of course, I do, it's just the real thing.
But, that is not possible, now, is it, Dave?
The bird is extinct.
Do me a favor and don't do it again.
Not to worry.
I lost a decoy during my last pass of the day.
Come here.
Alice.
I'm ready.
I'll be right there, Bette.
There's something...
...about...
I got a call this morning.
A call?
An interview, in
Montreal, for school.
And, you know, I gotta go.
Yes. Yes, of course, you do.
Alice, I...
Yes, certainly, like to reschedule, I'm sorry.
PHONCE: Lights out over at my place too.
There's no reason for trouble with the power lines.
I called light and power, they're flummoxed.
I'm gonna go and check the perimeter.
Have any dinner plans?
Why, no.
Eight?
Bon.
I'll make something special.
Too romantic?
Positively.
Iranian caviar, Dave.
You don't like caviar?
It's perfect.
You even have the mother of pearl spoons.
You're trying to get everything perfect, aren't you Dave?
Hmm.
I hope I don't get wound up on the vodka.
Probably good though, get a little loose.
Oh, laugh, will you?
I can't believe it,
I'm a nervous wreck.
Are you not nervous?
No, Alice, I'm a bag of nerves.
Dave, will we ever make it to dessert?
Who cares?
Shit, this is wrong.
No, it's not.
No, not us doing this.
I should have jumped your bones ages ago.
Shit, see, um...
When your wife called...
She's coming here.
As soon as possible, maybe even tomorrow.
It's supposed to be a surprise.
And it puts you in a difficult position.
It does.
But, Alice, my thought is that...
I should make matters worse.
I should work toward an emotional catastrophe.
I'm ready for it.
(WHISPERING) Shit.
- Oh, they'll go away.
- Yeah.
He's not going anywhere.
MAN: Hello!
His car has been stolen.
You're kidding me.
MAN: You don't expect that kind of thing around here.
Can I use your phone?
I gotta call my wife.
It's on the bar.
Taking it very well.
Ah, there it hardly seems to matter.
I have seen the duck, you see.
The duck?
Where?
Just off the beach.
If it hadn't gotten dark, I think, I would have got a snap.
It is so peaceful out there.
This phone isn't working.
(WHISPERING) Alice.
MAN: Hello?
Hello?
There is no duck.
I'm not terribly surprised, Dave.
But there is regrettably a decoy.
Just watch this guy for 15 minutes, please?
I'm gonna take care of this right now.
(WHISPERING) Fuck the damn duck.
Fucking, I'm gonna blow their brains.
What the fuck are you doing here, Jack?
You have a gun?
Please.
Please, please, please.
Please!
Winnebago?
No.
Is it harrier?
Is it harrier orange?
I don't know the response.
You move.
Move over here.
Be still.
Be still, right there.
Come on, run in the night.
Rise up the hill!
Up the hill!
Go on, you, go on!
Go on!
Standing around in...
Have a heart attack! Who do you think you are anyway?
Phonce!
Come on.
Come here.
Oh, excellent, Dave!
A hostage.
I found him, in the bushes behind The Auk.
He had a gun.
Let's just call the cops.
There's no phone, I'll keep him.
Go on, get here!
Go on, get here!
Sit down!
You surprise me, Dave.
I didn't think you had it in you.
Well, you know...
Winnebago?
No, he doesn't know what that means.
How many of you are there?
Sixteen.
What?
You mean to tell me laddie-o,
(SHOUTING) that there are 15 more of you fuckers out there?
Phonce!
Now...
Who are you with, son?
I'm with the R.C.B.
Mounties.
What in the Christ do they want?
The RSV.
It makes perfect sense.
You after the RSV, huh?
Please! Please!
They want the lights, okay?
All I know is the lights.
Don't shoot me.
DAVE: No one is going to shoot you.
I was never really considering shooting the fellow.
But as you can see, he's a lot more cooperative when he imagines it's in the cards.
I want no part terrorizing in this guy.
I've got no stomach for that.
Perhaps I should remind you, that you were the one who took the hostage.
Can't you just give him the lights?
They are nof mine to give, are they?
It will be like a surrender, Dave.
This is no time for heroics!
It is now, Dave.
It's as good a time as any.
Why not?
Just once.
Come on, Dave.
Okay, look, you're gonna have to stall, all right?
- (GASPING)
- (SHOUTING)
Oh!
Well, the first thought would be to fire the occasional round into the bushes, right?
Send a few over their heads, keep them pinned down.
No, I didn't think so.
Well, I guess, you'll have to talk to 'em then.
What you gonna do?
Always have a plan B, Phonce.
Dave, old man, that surely is the truth.
I'm really sorry about this.
Fuck you.
MAN OVER P.A.:
Mr. Purcell, Mr. Murphy!
We know you're in there.
Now we're gonna settle with you, arsehole!
You're holding one of my men against his will.
You're not gonna settle anything with anybody,
I'm about to shoot you in a moment.
Mr. Purcell.
I know you're a reasonable man.
That's not true.
Get him out of here.
Constable, hold back!
I guess you guys don't have a lot of opportunities like this one.
Speak to him, speak to him.
Right there.
Uh, David.
Claire?
David?
(SHOUTING) Claire?
Just do what he says and no one will get hurt.
She's right.
We know about the cocaine.
We know about the bird.
We'll forget that, just give us the Tsvetkov lights.
That seems reasonable, don't you think?
I'm coming down,
I wanna speak to you.
Stop right there.
Stay right there.
I'm coming out.
No.
We hope to keep you out of it Mr. Purcell.
We don't blame you for any of it.
Any of what?
Stealing the design for the lights.
Phonce didn't steal anything, he was partners with
Tsvetkov, Tsvetkov took off.
Just give me the lights.
What's so important about the lights?
I don't know.
They didn't tell me.
They...
HOSTAGE:
The other guy is gone.
The other one took off.
Fuck, sorry!
MAN: All right, go, go!
Get in there! Get in there.
Somebody untie that guy.
Where is your friend?
Where are the lights?
David, I want a divorce.
Sure.
MAN:
What the fuck was that?
MAN: Go, go, go, go, go!
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo!
Fuck me!
Whoo!
Plan B, Dave.
Anything yet?
They won't find lights here.
So, Alice is off.
I'm just going up now.
Oh, yeah.
Say goodbye?
I'll see you soon.
I'll be up.
Find someone to mind the restaurant, I'll be on a plane.
Finish the cod with truffle oil.
Just need someone to help trim the...
...lamb.
It's not that complicated.
Just need someone to help run the restaurant.
I'll be...
I'll be on a plane.
I'm ready,
Mr. Purcell.
MAN:  Say it when you're ready.

Excuse me, honey.
- Cologne?
- I better get going.
...61 degrees downtown.
In Harrisburg, the governor has given...
Remember we have the
Finches tonight.
- You sleep okay?
- Yeah, fine.
Why are we having the Finches?
We haven't seen them in ages, and I think we should make an effort with Eva.
- Is there an occasion or...
- No, no occasion.
He used to be your good friend. You know?
Yeah. Are you gonna speak to Jill today?
No, I spoke with her yesterday.
Why? You worried about her?
Should I be?
Well, why don't you give her a call?
I think I'll give her a call this afternoon.
Well, that's a good idea.
She likes her job?
Yes, she seems to.
She wouldn't tell me if she didn't.
No, but that's only because you've made your opinion on the matter so clear.
Bye.
Okay, you hound.
Hey. Come on.
Come on, hey.
Come on. Attaboy, attaboy, come on.
No, not... Hey, that's cruel.
Well, he's gotta learn how to swim.
It's how I taught the children.
You did not. Anyway,
I taught them to swim.
See you later.
Wayne, please don't be any later than 6:00, okay?
- Yes, please.
Not active. Press the services button now.
Shut up.
...dashing optimism that profits
will soon show signs of rebounding.
Dow Jones Industrials were down by a third of a percent,
a half percent decline for the S&P 500.
Near 2.5 percent lower for the NASDAQ.
Graciela, that's beautiful.
Thank you.
Hi. Wayne's late.
Can you believe it?
- Hi.
- What's he doing?
- He's working.
- Why the hell is he doing that?
What else is new?
Tom, can you make us drinks?
Yes, and I want that good Scotch.
I'd like to speak with Wayne
Hayes. This is his wife.
One moment, please.
I'm afraid he's not at his desk.
Well, is he gone for the day?
I'm afraid I don't know,
Mrs. Hayes.
I'd like to speak with
Alex Rice, please.
One moment, please.
He's gone for the day.
Would you like his voice mail?
No, no message, thank you.
Please leave a message.
Well, I hope you're on your way.
- As usual, you've spoiled us.
- Yes, Eileen.
Everything was absolutely delicious.
It was nothing.
I didn't do anything.
If this isn't doing anything, well...
You should be so lucky, Tom.
Well, I'm so sorry
Wayne couldn't be here.
That's all right.
He never liked us.
What is your emergency?
Yes, hello?
I need to report a missing person.
- Hello?
- This is Detective Seymour.
There was no sign of break in.
Doors were locked, alarm was set.
Can you think of a reason why he'd be parked there?
No.
Did he know anyone in the neighborhood?
No, not that I'm aware of.
Was he under any particular kind of stress?
No, I don't think so.
What's your husband's height?
- He's 6'.
- Weight?
About 175, 180 pounds.
- Eyes?
- Blue.
Blond hair.
Mom?
Hi.
How's the baby?
He's still such a bad sleeper.
I wonder how he's gonna get on in the world.
He'll be a grown man living with his mother.
Your next one will be better.
I think you get one of each.
No, we're not gonna have a next one.
He's in our bed every night.
Oh, I'd love to see them.
Do you think they could come out?
Yeah.
We'll see.
So tell me more about what the police said.
Well, it was questions mostly.
They wanted to know if anything had been bothering him recently.
Apparently, people wander off all the time.
They said that?
They said they were going to check the river.
No, that's not Dad.
No.
Wayne!
Wayne!
- Yeah?
- Hi, Wayne.
- Hi.
- I don't know if you remember me.
Arnold? Arnold Mack from Hadley.
That was a long time ago.
Yeah, it sure was. I'm supposed to show this to you.
What the hell are you doing?
If you make a noise I'll shoot.
Give me the keys.
Your hands.
Behind your back!
Legs out. Let's have your shoes.
Now, tell your wife you're all right.
Am I?
Yes.
This is Wayne.
Eileen, I'm fine.
Jill!
The possibility that they're watching the house, we have to take seriously.
We'll set up surveillance and stay with you until the situation is resolved.
They've instructed you to confirm receipt of the keys in a personal ad.
It's a common mode of communication.
We'd obviously like to get them on the phone.
So we'll monitor all calls in the event that we're successful in doing that.
I understand that our presence here is an imposition on you.
But I need to ask all of you to try to be as open with us as you can be.
So if Mr. Hayes mentioned anything, something on his mind, something bothering him, any information that you can give us, the better off we are.
I want to assure you that our first priority is Mr. Hayes' safety.
In a situation like this, lack of control can be the hardest part.
We're here to get you back some of that control.
Hello.
Where have you been?
- Talking to Lane.
- How is she?
We spent most of the time discussing the color of what's in Oscar's diapers.
I hope the FBI found it interesting.
How's Mom?
She's okay.
I think she thought he left her.
- She tell you that?
- No.
Of course not.
He would never do that.
Why not?
Because he'd be lost without her.
He might think about it, but he'd never do it.
Most kidnappings in this country are small in scale.
Usually over disagreements about drugs.
They usually work themselves out.
Someone pays the bill and on they go.
A high-profile case is a different matter...
We're free.
We'll be on our way in five minutes. Everything's fine.
Put those on, please.
Sit down.
All the way.
Put your butt down.
Straighten your legs.
Hold it a minute. Hold it.
Your hands'll be better in front.
Do you mind?
Do you mind if I take off my coat first?
A little hot in the trunk.
Okay.
Okay. Hands in front.
All right. Let's get going.
Oh.
No, please, please, sit down.
Thanks.
Pepsi for breakfast?
One of those bad habits.
Everything will be paid for by the bureau.
I don't know if that was explained.
No, that's all right.
You have a wonderful place here.
Yes, we built it about five, no, six years ago.
I hope we're not getting in your way too much.
- No. I think we'll be all right.
- Good.
Well, enjoy your breakfast.
Thank you.
It's good once you're in.
It's cold.
Keeps you young.
You know, I can't remember the last time we swam together.
Yeah, it's been a while.
When you were little we had a hard time getting you out.
Cigarette?
I quit.
But under the circumstances...
The shoes all right?
I mean, they fit okay?
Yeah, they're... They're fine.
No, no. Those things are killers.
I've been telling my wife that for years, but...
Are we gonna have a conversation now?
Is that it?
Okay. I don't need to talk.
What made you think I smoked?
Look, Arnold, how much are we talking about here?
I could call my lawyer.
Whatever it is.
This has nothing to do with me.
I'm just doing my part.
- What... What is your part?
- I'm doing it. This is my part.
Did you take the pictures?
No. I'm not a photographer.
We should really get going.
We've got a long way to go.
- You mind telling me where that is?
- I'm sorry, I can't.
Were there disagreements you can remember?
With former employees?
Any unpleasant departures, grudges?
Someone who may feel they were owed something? Anything like that?
No, not that I know of.
I hear there was anger over your husband's use of foreign automobiles?
No, there was just a few letters.
That was all.
About a year after he sold primary control in the car-rental business, he resigned and formed a new company, right?
- Right.
- A consulting firm?
- Yes.
- But it wasn't successful.
No.
So he's been advisory director at
Lennox-Stuart for the two years
- since closing the consulting firm?
- That's right.
Do you know a Ms. Louise Miller, formerly in the employment of your husband at Lennox-Stuart?
Yes, my husband had an affair with her.
And she left your husband's employment in June of 2001?
I told him to let her go.
Ah.
And as far as you know, that was the end of the relationship?
Yes, as far as I know.
Your husband's phone records indicate they were in regular contact beyond that date.
Is that all?
Sure. That's it for now. Thank you.
My children don't know about this.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell them.
I understand.
Ham or tuna?
Ham.
We'll split it.
Thank you.
You know, Arnold, I think you may have the wrong man.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
You want my neighbor,
Mr. Shipley. He's loaded.
You think I made a mistake?
Happens all the time.
Perfectly intelligent people, pick up a wrong bag at the airport...
I know all about you.
"The man Hertz and
Avis are afraid of."
Oh.
- I see...
- You grew up in Altoona.
You married your high school sweetheart.
You won a scholarship to Penn State.
You had a good job, but you quit to start a car-rental business.
Didn't make sense at the time, but you made it work.
In those days the greatest challenge was keeping your marriage together.
- They wrote that. I didn't.
- You like to watch the Pirates.
You have a house on a lake in the woods.
A boat in which you like to float on summer afternoons to clear your mind.
And two children, a son and daughter, all grown up now.
That about sums it up.
So when did you lose your job?
I guess it's obvious, huh?
Eight years ago, November.
And what did you do?
I was a manager of sorts.
And you thought if you were hardworking and loyal you'd be safe, right?
I worked there 17 years.
Out of their hands, they said.
- Well, it probably was.
- That's what they said.
Changing economy.
Gotta keep things profitable.
- I've heard it all.
- Nothing personal.
- Yeah, right.
- It's a terrible thing.
A lot of good people lost their jobs.
I'd say 30 percent of our work force at one point was from Hadley.
You could have come work for us.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't condescend me, Wayne.
I know how the world works.
That's why I'm out here with you.
So, what does your wife think about this plan?
- My wife?
- Yeah. Those are her cigarettes.
You can keep things from your wife.
- I don't know.
- What?
You've never deceived your wife?
Well, there are levels of deception,
Arnold. I mean, this is a whopper.
Oh.
Well, how about you?
- Me?
- You know everything about me.
Tell me about yourself.
All right. Um...
I have a wife and two daughters.
One of my daughters supposedly lives with us. She's got some boyfriend.
I think he's a mute. Can't tell you the last time I saw her.
My wife is trying to kill herself with cigarettes.
We live with her father.
He sleeps in the den.
He has his own TV, but he's hard of hearing, and he doesn't like to wear his hearing aids at night so he lies in bed and plays it so loud, we can hear it in our room.
Sometimes he leaves it on all night.
But what can I say? It's his house.
I don't say anything much at all, Wayne.
It's a household of...
...disappointed people.
But...
We have our health, and we have each other, so...
Ah.
Everybody suffers, isn't that right?
Yeah, everybody suffers.
Did you always have that moustache?
So long as I could grow one.
This is Wayne.
Eileen, I'm fine.
Our profilers believe the letters are probably being written by one person.
Male, some college education, white, over 30.
But we do believe we're dealing with a group.
To keep a hostage for a prolonged period requires multiple participants.
Why haven't they asked for anything?
They're showing you who's in control.
I'd like to suggest a different approach.
They haven't acknowledged our request to communicate by phone, so we should place a personal ad confirming you received the recording, but we also claim you got a ransom demand.
You're willing to pay. You just want to pay the right people.
If they think you'll give their money to someone else, they usually call within 24 hours.
Okay, so we're agreed.
We do what Fuller says.
Well, I'm not gonna make this decision alone.
You're not alone, sweetheart.
Where are you going?
I'm going to get something for Oscar.
You're going shopping?
It's his first birthday.
It's important we celebrate it.
Are you coming?
Happy birthday dear Oscar
Happy birthday to you
- Is he asleep?
- Finally.
He woke up the minute
I put him down.
Wayne will be sorry to have missed it.
Yeah, he loves birthdays.
You know, Lane, for my first birthday after Wayne and I were married, he wanted to surprise me, so we drove to a hotel in the mountains.
We could not afford it, but he insisted, as usual.
Anyway, when we got there, they'd never heard of us.
I don't know, he messed up the reservations or something.
Anyway, he was devastated, so he pleaded and then he tried to sound important.
- But they took no pity on us.
- Poor Dad.
We finished up at an all-night diner, because there were no hotel rooms.
But he made them put candles on everything we ate.
In the rice pudding, in the hamburgers...
And they all sang "Happy
Birthday." it was great.
I remember once he convinced me it was a special birthday treat to go to work with him and help clean cars.
I fell for that too.
You loved it. Both of you.
He really made you feel like you were the center of the world.
I hope Oscar gets to feel that.
He will.
Hold it.
This is where we meet the others?
- No.
- What then?
Just a break.
You can sit over there.
May I see the pictures of my wife?
What for?
May I see them?
She'd hate the idea of being watched.
She's self-conscious. Even with me.
She's beautiful.
You know what I think?
What?
I don't think there's anybody watching my wife.
And do you know what that means?
No.
It means I'm gonna have to give you the slip.
You wouldn't want to do that.
You'd get me into a world of trouble.
- I'd be sorry about that.
- Anyway, your wife'll pay and then you can go home.
If she wants you back.
Have you done anything terrible?
I've never pointed a gun at anyone.
Does your wife know about the company you keep?
That woman?
I told you I know all about you.
I followed you there once.
I sat outside.
- You followed me?
- They asked me to.
I'd say that's a whopper, Wayne.
Isn't that a whopper?
- We should get going.
- This is a beautiful spot, Arnold.
You picked a great day for it.
I didn't pick it. Let's go, Wayne.
I love my wife, Arnold.
We have two beautiful kids.
And I'm just getting to know them.
For most of their lives
I've been working.
I missed a lot.
I'm not suggesting you didn't love them.
Come on. Let's go.
No.
- Come on.
- No, this'll do just fine.
- Tell me where we're going.
- Let's go.
Look at yourself.
You've lost your job, you put people in trunks...
- Get up.
- What if everybody did that?
You goddamn lunatic.
How many times have you fired that gun, Arnold?
There's a hunting cabin near the top.
I'm gonna drop you off, then I go. That's it.
There's some guys waiting for you.
I work for them. They're okay.
I wish I'd paid better attention, you know,
but I was mowing the lawn.
All I remember is, he wasn't a gardener.
He was white, middle-aged, I guess.
He was wearing a suit, I think.
And he was standing at the side of the car, talking to Mr. Hayes.
A driver from one of the local bus routes remembers a man of similar description.
We've come up with a composite sketch based on those descriptions. Here you go.
Does that resemble anyone you might know?
Yeah, it resembles a million people I might know.
What about the personal ad?
There's still no response.
As they have so far refused to make phone contact,
I'd like to demand an assurance of Mr. Hayes' safety.
I think this organization would expect such a demand.
Wait a minute. Mr. Fuller, at your suggestion we threatened to give their money to someone else.
Since then, they haven't contacted us.
They've made no demand.
We're further from resolving this than we were to begin with.
What difference does it make who was on the bus?
I think you don't have the faintest fucking idea who those people are!
So, what would you consider an assurance?
A phone conversation.
If they won't confirm your husband's safety, we should consider the negotiation over.
Come here.
Mrs. Hayes, if they can make you desperate, they know you'll give them anything they want.
I want to apologize for my son.
Well, that's not necessary.
- Please, sit down.
- You know, it's strange.
You've never met my husband, but you know all about him.
Yeah, I'm used to it.
You'd like him.
He inspires confidence.
It's his great talent.
A man like that needs to be appreciated.
It gets worse as they get older.
They feel themselves being forgotten.
You don't have to explain anything...
I'm trying to explain my husband, Mr. Fuller.
Did you tell my son about that woman?
I asked him to look over some phone records.
- I don't know...
- You said you wouldn't.
- I said that I understood.
- What if I looked into your marriage?
It wouldn't look very good at the moment.
What are you doing?
I was thinking about Dad.
I'm afraid I'm never gonna see him again.
What would you say to him if you could?
That I love him.
You know, when I told him that I was pregnant with you that's the only time
I've ever seen him cry.
He knows you love him.
These guys waiting for us, have I done something to them?
No.
And you. You seem to know a lot about me.
Have I done something to you?
No, you haven't done anything to me.
You're good with names.
You're famous for it, you know?
I read somebody can meet you once and you see them again 10 years later, and you greet them as if you saw them every day of your life.
That way you manage to make each and every person feel important.
Fortune magazine.
To be honest, I'm not surprised you don't remember me.
Give me a minute.
I started at Hadley a few months before you left.
One day we crossed paths in the hallway.
The man I was with pointed you out and said, "That's the guy to watch."
We met in the cafeteria a few days later.
I introduced myself.
We talked for a while, actually.
I wanted to see what the hotshot was like.
That was a stressful period in my life.
- Can't blame me for not remembering.
- You were very gracious, don't worry.
You bought me a cup of coffee, and we talked.
I think actually we saw eye to eye on quite a few things.
I think you might have enjoyed talking to someone of like mind for once.
And you kept up with me?
In the papers?
Like the man said, I watched you.
Like the man said.
And that's it?
That's why it's me?
- Let's go, Wayne.
- I worked hard my whole life.
Everything I've got, I've earned.
Nobody handed it to me.
I don't deserve this.
What...
You all right?
I think that was my wife.
I have something for that.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you.
So, what's the plan when you're done here?
I'm going away.
- Someplace hot?
- That's right.
I'm taking my wife away from here.
Get back to the way you were.
That's right.
I see.
- So she'll go with you?
- Of course she will.
And give up everything for you?
Leave her father behind, and the kids?
They'll be all right.
She'll miss them.
You can't go back, Arnold.
My wife doesn't look at me the way she did 30 years ago.
Nothing you can do about that.
Is there...
...any news about Wayne?
No.
You know, the FBI came to, um...
To speak to me.
- How can anyone be so cruel?
- When did you see him last?
It was a while ago.
I didn't... I didn't know he'd started seeing you again.
I'm sorry.
I mean, what was it like when he was here?
I want to know.
Did he bring you things?
Were you in bed?
Sometimes he'd bring me things.
What things?
He brought me that book.
He hates New York.
Um... I've never been.
You know, when I left the company, he helped me with this place.
And then he just started coming around now and then, you know, to see how I was.
We were here for each other.
I think I'd prefer if you'd been fucking in hotels.
You know, Eileen...
I don't know what I would have done without him.
He's a great man.
I went to see her.
I know.
You know, I never talked to him about it. I never asked him why.
I just told him to get rid of her, and we got on with our life.
I didn't want to know.
I love him, and she admires him.
They may allow your husband to watch the news.
Hey!
What are you doing?
I'm tired, Arnold.
There's a stream up ahead.
You can soak your feet in the water. It'll feel good.
How long you been married?
24 years.
She stood by you.
Yes.
You're a lucky man.
Would you do something for me?
Would you mail a letter for me?
To my wife?
You could mail it when you go home.
I might not get along too well with the guys at the cabin and I'd like to tell her something.
You can do that for me.
Shit. Would you...
Please, could you cut me free?
You can read what I write.
I won't say anything about you or where we are.
Be careful where you mail it, so they can't trace the postmark.
After we were married and she was pregnant with Tim, she sometimes had this feeling when I'd walk out of a room, like maybe I wasn't coming back.
I traveled a lot with the businesses then and I think she got over it.
I don't think she suffered much.
When I asked her to marry me,
I wasn't completely sure.
I had my doubts.
But I...
I couldn't imagine my life without her.
And that's never changed.
I think that's the same as being sure.
You think?
I don't know.
I think it is.
We can go now.
We have a demand.
Do you recognize these?
The demand comes to approximately $10 million.
They've requested that you,
Eileen, deliver the ransom.
It's 9.5 in diamonds,
2 karat, round D flawless.
The most common stones on the market, easy to move.
And half a million in non-sequential 100-dollar bills.
Why do they want my mother to go?
We can't send an agent in her place.
They know what she looks like.
They've requested that we put the ransom in Wayne's sports bag.
The lining's too thin for us to put in a tracking device of any range.
I advise you not to pay the ransom without confirmation that your husband's all right.
Eileen, they've given us three days to get the stones together.
Tell them you need more time.
Tell them you need proof that your husband is alive.
Do you know how you do something completely beyond the realm of your normal behavior?
How?
You imagine it. Every piece of it.
Until it feels real.
Like something you do all the time.
I wasn't nervous this morning.
It was like driving to work.
The sky, the weather,
I knew what it was gonna be, even before I opened my eyes.
They offered me money.
Real money.
And all I have to do is bring you to them.
Tell me, Wayne, if you were in my shoes, wouldn't you do it?
No, I wouldn't.
Do you know what it's like to see your wife go to work every day instead of float in her pool?
- No, I don't.
- Well, it stinks.
It stinks seeing your life fall apart.
Everything you planned for, everything you counted on.
To see it happen and not be able to do anything, as if you'd become invisible.
You don't know what I'm talking about, do you?
Do you?
My mother was sick when I was growing up.
My father worked in a mill just like everybody else.
He should have done something else with his life but he accepted his place in the world.
People would try to get him to settle their arguments, whatever the argument.
He was above it.
- He knew everything.
- It's a nice story...
Hey, goddamn it, listen to me!
I listened to you.
And when he got sick, they'd come around the house, stand by the bed and try to brighten his mood.
And after he died, they raised a glass to him, came by the house to see if they could help.
And even though he was dead, felt like he hung around.
Now, all of a sudden, he really was dead.
He might not have lived for anybody except my sick mother and me.
Just the two of us.
But we missed him.
Really missed him.
I don't know that
I've even got that.
So all you have to do is just take me to them.
You think they'll let me go, once they know I've seen your face?
What about you?
Think they're gonna let you go?
It'll be all right, Wayne.
No, it won't.
No, it won't.
You don't understand, Wayne.
I understand.
Look at you. You don't even have any shoes on.
I understand there's plenty of people like you.
You think this is for your wife?
You think if you steal my money, go to some beach someplace, your life won't be such a waste?
This is for you, Arnold.
This is what you amount to.
Because the truth is, you can't make it yourself.
And my family is gonna suffer because of you?
You're a piece of shit.
You're a miserable piece of shit.
- You have no right to speak to me...
- Shut up.
Just take me to whoever it is you work for.
I'm done with you.
"This is your final chance.
Thursday, 1:00 p.m.
"The exact location will appear in a personal ad on the day of the drop.
"Do not involve the FBI."
What is it?
It's blood.
Let's get this to the lab for analysis.
Can you grab some evidence bags?
According to the lab report,
Wayne's white blood cells have begun to expand to an unsafe size.
What does that mean?
It's not a conclusive indication that Wayne is alive.
Does that mean he's dead?
Wait.
I can't let you go, Wayne.
Mrs. Hayes. Phone call for you.
Hello?
Hello? Mrs. Hayes here.
What are you doing?
- What do you mean?
- You were told no FBI.
No. No, I told them to stay away.
You think I'm an idiot?
No. Why?
They're all over the hotel.
No, but... No, I told them to stay away.
There's a subway station across the street. Exit through the side.
I'll call you on a pay phone.
She just hung up.
Hold on.
She's on the move.
I don't see her.
Yes?
She made phone contact.
Did the FBI ask you to carry anything?
- My phone.
- Get rid of it.
She dumped the phone, west entrance of the station.
Yes.
Stop here, please.
- There's a deer-crossing sign.
- Sign?
- Do you see it?
- Yes.
Now, there's a viaduct up ahead.
Stop the car between the lights.
You drop the bag here.
Turn off the engine.
Turn on the interior lights.
I wanna hear his voice.
Do you hear me?
Eileen.
Wayne?
Eileen.
Tell them you need proof he's alive.
- Eileen. Eileen.
- They're showing you who's in control.
I wanna hear his voice.
Do you hear me?
Eileen.
This is Wayne. Eileen, I'm fine.
Wayne?
Hello?
Wayne?
Wayne?
No!
Wait!
No!
Fuller.
Same series number?
Same place?
...like blueberries, coffee, and look at this,
even red wine! Look at that.
Arnold?
Yes?
Don't forget the trash.
Have you ever spilt chlorine bleach on your colored clothes?
Yeah, this is Larry
Schmidt over at Foodland.
I think I got another one of those hundred-dollar bills.
Right.
Charlie, baker, one, one, four, zero, one, two, one, seven, Charlie.
Here we go. That'll do you.
$83.13 is your change.
Okay.
Thank you for shopping at Foodland.
Thank you.
It's Fuller.
Did you want us to catch you, Arnold?
You passed several consecutive 100-dollar bills, in a two-week period at a store that sees maybe a handful in a month.
I don't think you're stupid, Arnold.
My wife won't understand.
She's not so unhappy.
Why did you wait all day?
I imagined it that way.
In the dark.
Arnold?
You know...
There is no cabin.
Arnold?
I said...
There is no cabin.
Arnold.
I couldn't have done it in the light.
- How did you pass the time?
- We talked.
- About what?
- About our families, our wives.
Regular stuff.
And then as soon as it was dark...
"I feel about you now the
Way I did when Jill was born.
"If you love me,
I have everything I need."
Do you love me?
Yes.
Then I have everything I need.

That's Nykwana Wombosi speaking in Paris the day before yesterday.
He was an irritation before he took power, a probIem...
...when he was in power, and he's been a disaster for us in exile.
He's writing a book about the Agency's history in Africa.
He's going to name names.
It's basically a shakedown.
He's demanding the Agency's help.
He wants us to put him back in power in six months, or eIse.
This interview, and I'II make the tape avaiIabIe to whoever wants it...
...he goes on to cIaim that he's just survived an assassination attempt.
He says it's us. He says he's got proof.

...in this accusation.
I've already assured him there's nobody that reckless on my senior staff.
ABBOTT: I was recaIIing a conversation we had some time ago.
Talking about Treadstone.
I seem to remember Wombosi's name might have come up.
I'm not sure what we're taIking about.
Someone tried to take him out.
Tried and faiIed.

How did you get my.... My God!
I'II do this! You stay there. Stay there!
[Car tires screech, pedestrians scream]
-Where are your shoes? Get your shoes.
-Sure. Yeah, sure.
He went out the window.
Why wouId someone do that?
BOURNE: We can't stay here. It's not safe.
I can get us out of here, but we got to go.
We got to go right now.
[BreathIessIy] Okay, Iook, you can wait.
You can wait for the cops. It's okay.
You just wait for them to get here.
But I can't. I got to go.
Marie?
BOURNE: Marie?
[Marie groans]
BOURNE: Quiet. Be quiet.
[Marie vomits]
Don't Iook.

OPERATIVE: Code in.
NICKY: AIpha 37509.
[Phone rings]
ZORN: Yeah.
Hang on.
Bourne went to Paris, to the apartment.
CONKLIN: We got him? TeII me.
NICKY: He killed our man.
CONKLIN: What? In the apartment?
NICKY: Yeah.
CONKLIN: Well, you got to clean that up.
NICKY: No, I can't cIean it up.
NICKY: There's a body in the street.
CONKLIN: So?
There's poIice. This is Paris.
CONKLIN: Put up the scanners.
Get as much radio information as you can.
Okay, you stay here.
I'm gonna go find a pIace for this money.
I'II be back in 10 minutes.
[Train announcements in French]
BOURNE: Hey, I toId you to stay in the car.
Jesus Christ. I toId you to stay in the car.
I needed a drink.
I didn't think you wouId come back.
Look, you got to go to the cops.
Right now.
You got to go before this gets any worse.
MARIE: By myseIf?
BOURNE: It's gonna be okay.
You're gonna take my passport, okay?
You show this to them.
You have that picture, you have the $20,000.
You teII them everything that happened.
They'II beIieve you.
They have to believe you.
Marie, you can't just sit here.
It's not safe here.
MARIE: Safe?
This is from inside the embassy.
-Who can do this? This is from yesterday.
-I don't know.
MARIE: How can they know we're together?
BOURNE: I'm trying to do the right thing.
BOURNE: That's aII.
MARIE: Right?
How'II you make this right by sending me there aIone?
You think I want you to go to the cops?
That's good?
-You want to go, fine.
-If you go, I run!
-You teII them what happened!
-I don't know what happened!
I don't know who this guy was or about that picture!
I don't know who I am!
Look, I'm....
You think I'm trying to burn you.
I'm trying to do the right thing.
Nobody does the right thing.
Look, I can't run with you. I can't.
We run, I got to Iive Iike this. I got to....
I don't even know who I'm hiding from.
These peopIe know who I am.
Yeah, I got to stay here.
I got to figure this out.
So figure it out.
You take care of this car?
What do you mean?
The tires feIt a IittIe spIashy on the way over here.
MARIE: It puIIs a IittIe to the right.
POLICE
[DiaIogue over poIice radio]

Last chance, Marie.
[Rock music pIays on radio]
[Tires screech]
[PoIice car sirens bIare]
[Fast-paced instrumentaI music]
BOURNE: So....
MARIE: What?
BOURNE: We got a bump coming up.
[Fast-paced music continues]
Turn your head away. Turn your head away.
[Cars honk repeatedIy]
We can never come back to this car.
You understand?
Okay, we're gonna cIean it out, and I'II wipe it down, and we waIk away.
-That's it.
-Okay.
Okay. And I'II find a pIace for us to rest.
And I got to think.
Do you have a hat or a scarf or something?
-For my hair?
-Yeah. Just untiI we can change it.
Yeah. Sure. Okay.
Okay.
HOFFENMEIN MORGUE - PARIS, FRANCE
[ChiIdren giggIe]
[Speaking in French]
It's not him.
This man was not shot.
[Phone rings]
CONKLIN: What do you have?
NICKY: Wombosi went to the morgue.
He saw the body. He didn't buy it.
Where is he now?
NICKY: I told you, I'm not staffed for this.
CONKLIN: Where is he? Right now!
Where's Wombosi?
NICKY: They were leaving the morgue.
They just Ieft.
ZORN: Sir, what do you want to do?
[Beeping]
I need to get the bottIe.
BOURNE: Hey.
You aIready cIeaned the room?
I wiped the whoIe pIace down for fingerprints.
Can I waIk around or is it gonna Ieave any footprints?
You can waIk around. It's no probIem.
But we'll just keep track of everything we touch.
I think it's best if we Ieave a room, that we don't Ieave a traiI.
Why? Where are we going?
BOURNE: I need to go to the hoteI where John MichaeI Kane stayed.
The HoteI Regina.
If I was him, then they're gonna have some records.
We need that hotel bill.
MARIE: Okay.
It gets sIightIy compIicated, though.
Because you're dead.
BOURNE: Right.
BODYGUARD: PIease.
WOMBOSI: They want war, we'II make war.
If they want to kiII me, they better kiII me the first time.
They better kiII me dead.
They better kiII me when I'm in my sIeep.
BODYGUARD: Listen to me.
We need these peopIe.
It's hard enough getting peopIe that we know to heIp us.
BODYGUARD: We must be carefuI.
We?
No, you.
You need to bring me back that bastard kid's head...
...put it in front of this house, and show them the war we're fighting.
But that is preciseIy--
BODYGUARD: Nykwana!
[Screaming]
BOURNE: We'II give the watch a reference check before we go.
MARIE: Okay.
What's the pay phone number?
MARIE: 616-2468.
Exits?
There's three.
Service at the back, side goes to the street past the shops...
...front is the best.
If I think I'm being foIIowed, I waIk out with the bag over my right shouIder.
And if there's no taxi?
I keep on waIking, don't Iook back untiI you make contact.
MARIE: What?
We need this, right?
Okay.
[Rhythmic instrumentaI music]
BOURNE: [Voice-over] I need distances.
You walk in, you pick a spot.
Some midpoint in the lobby.
Count your steps to that spot, and then remember that number.
Because after I call you,
I can get you moving.
You understand?
I also need a head count.
How many people from when you walk in until you get to the desk.
How many hotel employees are there?
And obviously security.
And it might not be that easy to see who they are.
So I'll call you, you give me the layout, and we'll take it from there.
[In French]
OPERATOR: Regina.
Yes, the house phone in the Iobby.
[Phone rings]
[Knocking on phone booth]
BOURNE: What happened?
MARIE: I--
BOURNE: Did something go wrong?
MARIE: I've got the records.
He, this guy at the front desk was smiIing at me.
So I thought, you know, aII this troubIe, maybe it's easier to just ask for them.
BOURNE: You have the biII?
MARIE: He made me a photocopy.
You just asked for it?
I said I was Mr. Kane's personaI assistant.
BOURNE: Okay. That's good thinking.
ZORN: Sir, can I--
ABBOTT: No.
ABBOTT: Wombosi was assassinated in his house in the middIe of Paris.
Yeah, we just heard.
It's him. It's Bourne. We're almost positive.
He had an assignment. He faiIed.
He obviousIy feIt compeIIed to finish the task.
ABBOTT: Jesus.
CONKLIN: We think he'II come back in now.
I mean, it's routine.
It's like behavioral software.
He's foIIowing a protocoI.
Now that he's compIeted the mission, we think he'II come back in.
They always do.
When?
ABBOTT: How Iong tiII he checks in?
ZORN: 24 hours.
ABBOTT: 24?
Yeah, it's usuaIIy something Iike that.
ABBOTT: Then what?
I toId you we'd cIean this up.
It wiII be cIean.
BOURNE: I understand you're a dive shop, but where are you Iocated?
BOURNE: MarseiIIes?
[DiaIogue over poIice radio]
[French diaIogue over radio]
BOURNE: What specificaIIy does your company suppIy?
DIVE SHOP EMPLOYEE: I am sorry.
What is your name, monsieur?
COP: [In French]
You've been here for three hours and you stiII can't find a print?
[Knocking]
CONKLIN: What?
ZORN: Paris poIice found the vehicIe.
[Beeping]
RAWLINS: You've reached Simon Rawlins at Alliance Security, Maritime Division.
Paris office hours are from 8.:00 a.m. to 5.:00 p.m.
BOURNE: I got a Iead in Paris.
The rest were MarseiIIes, and two out in Southampton.
-Paris? It's what?
-AIIiance Security. Simon RawIins.
I got a machine.
[SuspensefuI instrumentaI music]
[Phones ringing in background]
SECRETARY: Mr. Kane?
Mr. Kane!
SECRETARY: How are you?
BOURNE: I'm good. How are you?
Mr. Kane. Come right in.
PIease have a seat.
Thank you.
RAWLINS:
So, this is the PaImer Johnson tri-deck.
I'm assuming you're stiII in the market.
It's stiII the same vesseI?
Yes.
[Parisian music, indistinct chatter]
So I'm Kane.
MARIE: They--
BOURNE: I had a meeting as Kane.
-They said--
-No. I'm definiteIy Kane.
I just had a meeting as Kane and he knew me as Kane.
So I'm definiteIy Bourne.
I'm aIso just definiteIy Kane.
It's all just boats.
I got blueprints and cameras and security systems.
I just found John MichaeI Kane's body.
In a morgue here in Paris.
But if you are John MichaeI Kane, whose body do they have?
ATTENDANT: What was the name again?
BOURNE: Kane.
Kane.
BOURNE: John MichaeI Kane.
John MichaeI Kane.
[Woman sings over radio]
Kane. It's number 1 21 .
I want to see the body.
Our boss couId come back.
We are not supposed to do that.
Come on.
Is this it? I mean, where is he?
ATTENDANT: I don't know.
[In French]
What's going on?
This guy has come to see the American.
But the body has disappeared.
They came yesterday evening...his brother.
He's not in the register.
Who are you? What's going on?
-Where's the body that goes in here?
-I said someone came Iast night.
I know. Where'd they take the body?
Look, this is not a carnivaI, okay?
People call, they make an appointment, follow the rules.
Everyone signs in and out.
This is a serious pIace. Serious work.
-It's not just to come in whenever you Iike!
-You're right. We didn't sign in.
BOSS: Get the heII out of here.
BOURNE: Fine. I'm just gonna go sign in.
BOSS: Okay, go.
BOURNE: Is this it?
BOSS: You can't take the book.
BOURNE: This is it?
It's okay. There's a penciI in here.
That's fine.
Honey, why don't you go wait outside?
Here it is.
BOSS: We can't have--
BOURNE: Okay.
MARIE: Jason, what just happened in there?
What are you Iooking for?
BOURNE: Nykwana Wombosi.
Wombosi went to the morgue to visit Kane.
See?
MARIE: So?
BOURNE: He's in the AIIiance brochure.
BOURNE: Same guy.
This guy knows.
[PoIice siren bIares]
[Indistinct chatter]
My French sucks. I can't....
It says something about a boat or....
I don't understand. What does it say?
You read it. TeII me. What?
It says that 3 weeks before he was kiIIed,
Mr. Wombosi toId poIice...
...that a man came onto his yacht, five miIes off the coast of MarseiIIes...
...and tried to kiII him.
It says that he chased the man off the boat and shot him twice in the back.
It says I'm an assassin.
[Soft instrumentaI music]
[Siren sounds]
[In French]
Stop the car.
But no...you said Rue de I... we're aImost there.
Just right here, this is good.
I said stop.
MARIE: What's going on?
WeII...what's going on?
MARIE: What the heII are you doing?
BOURNE: Go. Go.
MARIE: What are--
You gave me too much.
BOURNE: We're bIown. Come on.
MARIE: BIown? What is ''bIown''?
Monsieur...your change, your change.
Sir, pIease...You can't stay here...
You have to Ieave.
BOURNE: Keep waIking.
What do you think they're doing there?
They're on to the hoteI.
-No. You don't know that.
-Trust me. Just keep waIking.
[Sirens bIare]
[Indistinct chatter]
Are you crazy? What are you doing now?
MARIE: Jason!
BOURNE: This is bIown.
BOURNE: Marie?
MARIE: Get away.
BOURNE: Stop right there.
MARIE: Get away from me.
What are you gonna do? KiII me?
BOURNE: Marie.
MARIE: Is that next?
Listen, stay caIm. Stay caIm.
Whatever we do, we have to do it together.
-We have to be--
-We?
The onIy thing we had in common was that neither of us knew who you were.
MARIE: We've passed that now.
BOURNE: Listen!
The poIice'II find us. The peopIe who took the picture in the embassy...
...who kiIIed Wombosi, they're gonna come here and kiII us.
The peopIe who you work for.
I wiII take you wherever you need to go.
I'II take you there. I'II Ieave you there.
You can do what you want.
You never have to see me again.
BOURNE: But not here.
If we stay here, we die.
Boy, great poIice work! ReaIIy briIIiant!
Why don't they just hang out a banner that says, ''Don't come back!''
Jesus Christ!
What is the French word for ''stakeout''?
CONKLIN: Okay, this was 16 minutes ago.
This is our starting point.
CONKLIN: Can't fIy, trains are risky. Nicky?
NICKY: Here.
I need to know everything
Paris's finest is doing on this.
NICKY: I'm on it.
ABBOTT: [Voice-over]
You said 24 hours, and he's not back.
CONKLIN: [Voice-over]
No. But we got a good idea where he is.
ABBOTT: You've got a black ops agent who's off the reservation.
He trashed an American consulate.
He's on the run in Europe.
You don't know why. I got to stand before an oversight committee.
What wiII I say about Treadstone?
You're worried about a budget meeting?
We don't take care of this, we don't make it to the men's room.
Now, is that cIear enough for you?
We will burn for this.
We wiII both of us burn.
CONKLIN: AII right, I want two teams.
DaryI, Ray, stay on the grids.
Brian, Harris, Steve...
...I want to work on this girl.
CONKLIN: And this residency pattern?
COMM TECH 1 : We started it.
Get it out.
[Phone rings]
COMM TECH 1 : We cross-referenced numbers from her relatives.
When we found convergence, we took the numbers...
...back-checked them, ran a search merge with other data we had, which wasn't much.
Pins. These pins.
These are aII the pIaces we think she's Iived in the Iast six years.
CONKLIN: One, two, three, four, five.
That's our pool.
MARIE: No answer.
How many times you Iet it ring?
-Look, if you don't want to go, I'II hitch.
-I said I'd take you.
CONKLIN: Those are the targets.
Beg, borrow, hack, tap, bypass!
I don't care what you do!
I want to know everything you can teII me about what's going on at those Iocations.
[Fast-paced instrumentaI music]
BOURNE: How do you know he stiII owns this?
MARIE: Eamon aIways had money.
He wouId never seII this.
[Loud crash]
Marie?
MARIE: What?
We got to go.
What?
We got to go.
[Curses in German]
I thought it wouId....
[Car brakes squeak]
MARIE: Shit, that's Eamon. I'II taIk to him.
BOURNE: We're Ieaving.
Eamon. Surprise.
It's me, Marie. Wow, God...
...there's a reaIIy good reason for this.
EAMON: There bIoody weII better be.
CLAUDIA: Daddy!
EAMON: Hang on. Hang on.
I had no idea you wouId be here.
WeII, why wouId I be here?
It's onIy my bIoody house, right?
MARIE: Yeah.
Did she get you into this?
It was just gonna be for a day.
Daddy, AIain has to go pee!
AII right, aII right, come on. Here.
Get out of the car.
Okay, in you go.
EAMON: Come on, AIain.
MARIE: I'm sorry. I....
I thought it wouId be okay.
But I guess I was wrong.
-Let's find Mommy.
-Mommy?
Mommy is away for two days, thank God.
BOURNE:
You've got yourseIf aII tied up here.
BOURNE: Okay.
What's he do for a Iiving?
He used to be in shipping.
Is he good for you?
Are you happy?
You know me. I try too hard.
[Christmas music pIays on radio]
Here you go.
Sleep well.
Good night.
BOURNE: I'II sIeep on the fIoor.
CONKLIN: This was when?
RESEARCH TECH 2: 1 1 :45 a.m.
Which is definiteIy within the driving range of Paris.
RESEARCH TECH 1 :
The caII came from a rest stop.
CONKLIN: Yeah. What's this yeIIow pin?
She spent two months there in 1997.
CIosest town is Riom.
We took her famiIy's phone records and coIIated the internationaI caIIs.
They were in Paris at 2.:00 a.m.
They can't fly. The train's too dangerous.
He knows better than to go anywhere we might track him.
So this is our best guess.
[SuspensefuI instrumentaI music]
-What are you doing?
-The kids. I was worried. I couIdn't sIeep.
MARIE: You'II wake them up. We got to go.
BOURNE:
I don't want to know who I am anymore.
I don't care. I don't want to know.
MARIE: Come on. We'II taIk about--
BOURNE: I want to forget everything.
It's okay.
BOURNE: I don't care who I am or what I did.
It's okay.
BOURNE: We have this money.
We can hide.
Can we do that?
Is there any chance you can do that?
MARIE: I don't know.
MARIE: Come on.
[Birds chirping]
CLAUDIA: Here, boy! Here, boy!
'Morning.
EAMON: Christ. You were up earIy.
BIess you for making coffee.
One night. You weren't kidding.
For a change.
He's not there either.
EAMON: And you Iooked by the car?
CLAUDIA: He's not anywhere.
AII right, Iet me get dressed.
BOURNE: Who?
EAMON: BIoody dog's gone missing.
Does that happen a Iot?
What? That mutt?
Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.
It's aIways something, right?
Get in the basement.
What?
-Get everyone in the basement.
-What are you taIking about?
You're in danger. Your famiIy's in danger.
I don't have time to expIain.
EAMON: Wait a minute. What--
MARIE: Eamon.
You shouId go.
EAMON: What have you done?
BOURNE: It's not her. It's me.
You need to get out of sight and in the basement as quick as you can.
CLAUDIA: Daddy.
I'm sorry.
Let's go.
[SuspensefuI music escaIates]
MARIE: The phone is dead.
BOURNE: Yeah.
Jason, who's out there? Who is it?
[Cursing in German]
MARIE: What are you doing?
Oh, no.
We shouId never have come here.
I.... These chiIdren....
That's not gonna happen.
[Intense rhythmic music]
[Rapid gunfire]
[Gunfire]
[Birds scatter and chirp]
[Gunfire]
BOURNE: Where is it? Where's the weapon?
Who eIse is out here?
Who eIse? How many you got with you?
BOURNE: I'm not gonna ask you again.
I work aIone. Like you.
We aIways work aIone.
BOURNE: What do you mean?
PROFESSOR: Who are you? Rome?
Paris?
Treadstone, both of us.
BOURNE: Treadstone?
PROFESSOR: Which one?
Paris. I Iive in Paris.
PROFESSOR: You get the headaches?
Yeah.
I get such bad headaches.
You know at night when you're driving a car?
Maybe it's the headlights.
What is Treadstone?
Treadstone said piIIs.
They said go to Paris.
Is Treadstone in Paris?
Look at this.
Look at what they make you give.
EAMON: AII right, aII right.
AII right, CIaudia, get in the front and put your beIt on.
EAMON:
AII right, we're gonna put you in the back.
All right, get in the front, Claudia.
EAMON: I'm not waiting, Marie.
-One minute, Eamon.
-I'm not waiting!
MARIE: PIease!
Take it.
BOURNE: I took out $30,000.
The rest is yours.
MARIE: That's it?
BOURNE: That's aII I got.
No, that's not what I meant.
This is not gonna stop, Marie.
You got to get out now. Away from me.
BOURNE: You got to get out.
You got to start running.
You get Iow, you stay Iow.
No more friends. Nothing famiIiar.
There's enough in there for you to make a Iife. Any Iife.
EAMON: I'm out of here, Marie!
BOURNE: Hey!
Get in the car. You got to go.
What are you gonna do?
I'II end it.
Go ahead.
BOURNE: PIease.
[DiaIing and beeping]
Code in, pIease.
ZORN: Code in.
Code in.
BOURNE: Who is this?
Who the heII are you?
The man you sent is dead.
So whoever this is, you better start talking.
CONKLIN: Hello, Jason.
So, what are we into now?
It onIy goes two ways. Either you come in and Iet us make this right...
...or we'II keep going untiI we're satisfied.
You mean untiI you kiII me.
I can't fix this if I don't know what the probIem is.
Tell me what we're into, and I'll do the best I can.
Why don't you taIk to Marie, Jason?
CONKLIN: Let's ask Marie what she wants.
BOURNE: I don't think she gives a shit.
She's dead.
I'm sorry to hear that.
How did that happen?
BOURNE: She was slowing me down.
CONKLIN: AII we've been doing right from--
BOURNE: Enough.
Enough.
5:30 p.m. Paris.
Today. Pont Neuf.
Come aIone, you waIk to the middIe of that bridge.
You take off your jacket. Face east.
BOURNE: I'll redial this number.
CONKLIN: Wait!
[Tense instrumentaI music]
[Phone rings]
First fIight out. TeII Nicky I'II caII from the car. TeII her to find Picot. Go.
ABBOTT: So....
What are we gonna do?
I toId you I'd cIean this up.
That's what I'm doing.
Can you reaIIy bring him in?
I think we're past that, don't you?
Do you have a better idea?
You've given me nothing but a traiI of coIIateraI damage...
...from Zurich to Paris.
I couIdn't do much worse.
Why don't you go upstairs and book a conference room?
Maybe you can taIk him to death.

BOURNE: So try this: I'm gone.
Fuck.
[SuspensefuI rhythmic music]
CONKLIN: Get Nicky on the phone.
[Phone rings]
NICKY: Yeah?
CONKLIN: How long to wipe down the room and move it?
NICKY: Get rid of everything?
CONKLIN: Yeah.
NICKY: Two to three hours.
CONKLIN: All right, get started.
Listen, no breaks.
Two men outside, one in the lobby.
And keep your eyes open.
COP 1 : Keep the truck?
CONKLIN: Keep the truck.
I'm gonna cIose this unit down.
We'II move the gear in the truck.
NICKY:
They were covering Spain, MaIta, Morocco.
Yes, aII IocaI poIice radio traffic.
No, for northern Europe we need an authorized directive. Yeah.
Okay, they're on it. We'II have a sateIIite downIoad in 30 minutes.

[Car aIarm sounds]
[Speaking in French]
CONKLIN: Where's your fieId box?
-Where's your fieId box?
-It's right there.
NICKY: The whoIe system's gone haywire.
That's this window right here.
Dining room window?
I don't get it.
Dead. The phones are dead.
It's Bourne, isn't it?
Just quiet.
You move, you die.
CONKLIN: Bourne.
Gun down.
In there.
Okay, so what do you want--
BOURNE: Treadstone.
You better take a Iook around.
There's not much Ieft.
-Are you Treadstone?
-Am I Treadstone? Me?
What the heII are you taIking about?
He's lost it.
You better start fiIIing in the bIanks here!
'Cause I thought we were on the same side.
Whose side is that?
You don't know what you're doing, do you?
You don't have a goddamn cIue!
Who am I?
You're U.S. government property!
You're a maIfunctioning $30 miIIion weapon!
You're a totaI goddamn catastrophe!
And, by God, if it kiIIs me, you'II teII me how this happened.
-Why are you trying to kiII me?
-What happened in MarseiIIes?
You sent me to kiII Wombosi.
KiII Wombosi?
Yeah, we can do that any time we want.
I can send Nicky to do that, for Christ's sake.
Mr. Wombosi was supposed to be dead three weeks ago.
He was supposed to have died in a way that the onIy possibIe expIanation was...
...that he'd been murdered by a member of his own entourage.
I don't send you to kiII.
I send you to be invisibIe.
I send you because you don't exist.
I want to know what happened in Marseilles.
I don't remember what happened in MarseiIIes.
BuIIshit! This is unacceptabIe, soIdier.
You hear me? You faiIed!
-UnacceptabIe?
-You faiIed!
-You faiIed and you're gonna teII me why!
-I can't teII you! I don't remember!
You brought Kane to Iife.
You put together a meeting with Wombosi.
You found the security company.
You broke into the office!
For Christ's sake, you picked the yacht as the goddamn strike point!
CONKLIN: [Voice-over] You picked the boat.
You picked the day. You tracked the crew.
The food, the fuel!
You told us where. You told us when.
You hid out on that boat five days.
You were in, Jason. You were in!
It was over!
[Faint echoes of chiIdren's Iaughter]
[Eerie instrumentaI music]
[Gunfire]
[Thunder and Iightning]
CONKLIN: No, you do remember.
Don't you?
I don't want to do this anymore.
I don't think that's a decision you can make.
Jason Bourne is dead. Do you hear me?
BOURNE: He drowned two weeks ago.
You're gonna go teII them Bourne is dead.
Understand?
CONKLIN: Where are you gonna go?
I swear, if I even feeI somebody behind me, there is no measure to how fast...
...and how hard I will bring this fight to your doorstep.
I'm on my own side now.
[Grunting]
[Gun sheIIs faII to fIoor]
[Dramatic instrumentaI music]
It's done.
Shut it down.
[Soft instrumentaI music]
ABBOTT: The Treadstone project has already been terminated.
It was designed primarily as a sort of advanced game program.
We'd hoped it might build into a good training platform.
But quite honestly, for a strictly theoretical exercise...
...the cost-benefit ratio was just too high.
It's all but decommissioned at this point.
MARSHALL: AII right, what's next?
ABBOTT: Okay, this is...
...Blackbriar.
Blackbriar is a joint DOD communications program...
...that we really feel has good traction to it.
It's got legs. It'll run and run.
It combines elements of proactive and reactive fields of security....
BOURNE: This your store?
MARIE: Yeah.
It's nice. It's a IittIe hard to find, but....
Think I couId rent a scooter?
You have ID?
Not reaIIy.

{2756}{2843}This time the damage|was considerable.
{2844}{2903}This time the damage...
{2904}{2987}was estimated|at $1 .8 billion.
{2988}{3024}This time--
{3049}{3097}This time the damage--
{3172}{3239}This time the damage is est--"
{3362}{3401}Jesus.
{3492}{3533}Chantal?
{5256}{5303}Shouldn't you get that?
{5714}{5765}- Hello?|- Henry?
{5767}{5851}Victor Benezet here.|How areyou?
{5853}{5908}As well as can be expected|under the circumstances.
{5909}{5944}That's good.
{5946}{6041}I'm sorry to call you like this,|but I need you to come in.
{6043}{6124}- There's a charityball tonight.|- It'sjust a few questions.
{6126}{6192}I understand why|you were distressed yesterday...
{6194}{6252}but we do need|to make a proper report.
{6254}{6300}I'm giving the toast tonight.
{6302}{6346}And I'm looking forward|to it, old boy.
{6348}{6406}Can't we do this tomorrow, Victor?|It's a fund-raiser.
{6408}{6490}This'll only take ten minutes.|Seeyou at the station, then.
{8761}{8824}- Arias.|- Yes?
{10146}{10198}Hey, how you doing?
{10857}{10916}Tell me your speech|won't be insufferably long.
{10917}{10992}They won't serve dinner|until you're finished.
{10994}{11091}If you're hungry, write a check,|because I can crawl all night.
{11093}{11163}Don't bait Henry.|He's nervous.
{11164}{11232}Henry loves being the center|ofattention, don'tyou?
{11233}{11281}- Excuse us, will you?|- Yes, go ahead.
{12756}{12815}I have a position|for a good handyman...
{12817}{12898}in case you ever tire|of these long policeman's hours.
{12929}{12984}Nothing works around here.
{13027}{13112}I do appreciate your coming in|on such short notice, Henry.
{13130}{13173}You look marvelous.
{13175}{13226}Just grand.
{13249}{13327}- You get younger every day.|- Thank you, Victor.
{13367}{13432}You met Detective Owens|yesterday at the house.
{13433}{13496}Happy San Sebastian toyou.
{13498}{13556}Same toyou, Mr. Hearst.
{13589}{13632}I'll burn us some coffee.
{13672}{13729}Nonfat milk if you have it.
{13810}{13889}I don't think he heard me, actually.|He reminds me a lot ofyou.
{13891}{13946}Only listens when it suits him.
{13964}{14019}That's unfair, Henry.
{14020}{14076}Not only am I a good listener...
{14077}{14121}but I keep it all in here.
{14123}{14180}Anyway, we should have this|cleared up in no time.
{14181}{14248}Perhaps under the circumstances,|I should be calling you "Captain."
{14250}{14321}Oh, no.|No need for that formality.
{14323}{14374}I do apologize about the timing.
{14376}{14449}I knowyou're due|across the street.
{14451}{14533}Wejust need to clarify some|ofthe details from your report.
{14535}{14624}Your superintendent is one|ofthe charity's biggest supporters.
{14626}{14656}I know, I know.
{14658}{14736}So ifyou'll help us put an end|to some ofthese nagging questions--
{14738}{14789}why, we'll haveyou|on yourway.
{14791}{14839}I would've thoughtyou'd be|at the party already.
{14840}{14913}You do know how to have fun,|don'tyou, Victor?
{14915}{14975}Tuxedo's all ready to go.
{14976}{15069}I must say, Henry,|you seem in high spirits...
{15071}{15132}what with all this|on your doorstep.
{15134}{15197}How should I behave?
{15574}{15613}How's Chantal?
{15615}{15660}Waiting.
{15661}{15722}A noble quality|in that young woman.
{15748}{15822}Something mine didn't seem|to want to do.
{15824}{15921}I was sad to hear that. We always|thought you made a charming couple.
{15923}{15971}Charming, perhaps...
{15972}{16026}but dull, apparently.
{16073}{16121}You see the children much?
{16164}{16217}Both of my daughters|are living with their mother...
{16219}{16260}back in New York City.
{16262}{16328}Must be hard|during the holidays and all.
{16416}{16464}We should get on with it.
{16859}{16916}- No milk?|- I'm sorry.
{16932}{16980}No, thanks.
{16981}{17018}You're into charity.
{17020}{17091}Why don't you fund-raise us|up a cappuccino machine...
{17093}{17181}so all the lowlifes that come through|here can enjoy a solid cup of coffee?
{17183}{17251}I was just going to ask|Mr. Hearst about the dog.
{17252}{17329}Oh, yeah. Right.|The "mystery dog."
{17331}{17412}Actually, I like "ghost dog."|That's got a nice ring to it.
{17414}{17457}Can we start again?
{17459}{17507}I come in here|like you ask...
{17508}{17591}and Mr. Congeniality here is|taking a hostile manner with me.
{17692}{17745}It's this case, Henry.
{17747}{17795}It has everyone on edge.
{17831}{17870}But it'sjust--
{17872}{17940}This business is strange...
{17942}{18006}going by what's in the record.
{18008}{18066}But let's see.
{18068}{18133}Here.January 6.
{18135}{18188}Yesterday afternoon.
{18190}{18244}You sayyou were...
{18245}{18290}outjogging with a dog.
{18292}{18356}Yes. Man's best friend.
{18358}{18414}Belonging to a neighbor ofyours...
{18416}{18470}named Ricardi.
{18472}{18495}You ever own one?
{18497}{18574}When I was a boy,|my family had Great Danes.
{18576}{18637}But you don't own one now?
{18639}{18696}Chantal prefers cats.
{18698}{18798}- So, do you have a cat?|- Too unsanitary.
{18800}{18868}Chantal would want a cat,|but only if it could be sanitized.
{18869}{18955}What do you mean?|Cats are always licking themselves.
{18957}{19016}I dumped a girlfriend once|because ofher damn cat.
{19017}{19071}Thing had me up all night|slurping away.
{19072}{19130}A dog is a lot more unsanitary...
{19132}{19203}but at least when|they're sleeping, they sleep.
{19263}{19304}Thank you for that.
{19306}{19381}Anyway, the messiest is a canary.
{19383}{19430}She refused that too.
{19432}{19498}But for once I stuck to my guns.
{19529}{19584}I can be quite fi rm|ifI need to be.
{19586}{19629}What was his name again?
{19631}{19680}Tango.
{19704}{19785}Do you write that|just like "tango"?
{19787}{19877}How else would you write it,|like "waltz" or "fox-trot"?
{19879}{19938}When you were questioned...
{19940}{20004}you said...
{20006}{20062}"I discovered the girl."
{20098}{20168}What we're not clear about here|is what the dog was doing.
{20201}{20236}So?
{20237}{20325}Logically, you would expect that|the dog would have found the girl.
{20327}{20363}Well, I suppose it did.
{20365}{20457}Butyou say you found her.
{20459}{20534}Well, me, the dog--|We were together.
{20536}{20578}We found the body.
{20580}{20658}What difference does it make?|I called the police.
{20660}{20740}Unless, perhaps, you think the dog|called and disguised his voice.
{20904}{20936}Mr. Hearst...
{20979}{21027}twoyoung girls|have been found strangled...
{21028}{21084}within the past 1 6 days.
{21120}{21195}It is myjob|to fi nd the murderer.
{21218}{21277}You're a principal witness|to the crime scene.
{21279}{21355}Now, I have to make sure|that the facts ofyour statements...
{21356}{21437}agree with the other facts|ofthe case.
{21439}{21493}Mr. Hearst doesn't appear|to be as distressed today.
{21495}{21596}I'm a guest here. I'll be|treated with respect, Sergeant Opie.
{21598}{21631}Owens.
{21632}{21706}- That's Detective Owens.|- Please.
{21708}{21762}- O-W--|- Please!
{21811}{21872}Let's all--|Let's all relax.
{21898}{21960}Everyone has somewhere else|they'd like to be.
{21987}{22058}Now, Henry, if you don't mind...
{22060}{22090}please...
{22120}{22214}tell us one more time|howyou came upon the girl.
{22276}{22344}ljoggedup to Ricardi's|like lalways do.
{22346}{22384}I grabbed the dog.
{22446}{22504}Better run him|a little faster, Henry.
{22505}{22580}He's getting a belly|as round as yours!
{22582}{22624}Fuckin' old geezer.
{22626}{22670}Come on, boy.|Let's go. Let's go!
{22714}{22744}This dog--
{22764}{22812}He was defi nitelywith you?
{22836}{22884}What dialect doyou need this in?
{22886}{22944}Yes, the dog was with me.
{22946}{23041}The dog was with me.|Got it?
{23043}{23092}You're saying Tango--|He was there.
{23094}{23142}Good. You're catching on.
{23363}{23411}Tango's all right.
{23431}{23490}Keeps me company|on my runs.
{23591}{23658}We took the path|by my house like always.
{23752}{23822}- Suddenly Tango wasn't there.|- Tango, come on, boy!
{23824}{23926}I called to him,|but he wouldn't come.
{23928}{23995}I could hear him.|He was growling, barking...
{23996}{24035}actingpeculiar.
{24070}{24126}That's when I turned back.|I kept calling.
{24128}{24187}Tango, come on, boy.
{24213}{24263}The dog wouldn't come.
{24264}{24312}You couldn't see the girl|at this point?
{24314}{24387}Obviously not from the path.
{24389}{24456}But I could see Tango|in there moving around.
{24458}{24524}Soyou ventured off|into the grove.
{24633}{24671}That's when I saw her.
{24722}{24778}At fi rst I thought|she was asleep.
{24810}{24900}She was almost--|I want to say--
{24938}{24966}angelic.
{24996}{25040}The way shejust lay there.
{25060}{25143}Her eyes--|Theywere dark brown.
{25184}{25228}Theywere still open.
{25253}{25305}Sue Ellen Huddy.
{25307}{25366}She was three days shy|ofher 1 3th birthday.
{25406}{25500}- How did you discern she was dead?|- I touched her.
{25501}{25584}I mean, I put my head|on her chest.
{25795}{25858}There was no heartbeat.
{26086}{26116}That was that.
{26152}{26229}- The dog found the body.|- That's correct.
{26231}{26327}Mr. Ricardi states fi rmly that|you did not run the dog yesterday.
{26352}{26457}He admits that on most days you do,|but notyesterday.
{26478}{26524}Well, hejust|doesn't remember right.
{26526}{26608}Well, that may be, but in that case,|your neighbor...
{26609}{26700}Miss Lazzo,|doesn't remember either.
{26701}{26781}And another neighbor, Mr. Irwin,|also suffers memory loss.
{26783}{26845}In the whole area, you're the only one|who remembers correctly.
{26847}{26916}- Who am I to believe?|- Them, naturally.
{26918}{27041}Come on. You're taking this personally.|I'm just trying to fi nd the truth.
{27043}{27082}You know, you enjoy hounding me.
{27103}{27180}- How is that, Henry?|- You forget I know all your tricks.
{27181}{27255}A murder by some thug or nutcase--|That's average.
{27257}{27317}But when it's a pillar|ofthe legal community...
{27319}{27366}that's more than|just a witness--
{27368}{27440}Then it's banner headlines,|television.
{27442}{27526}It'd help in your push to become|our next police superintendent, right?
{27528}{27581}Come on, Victor.
{27583}{27625}Confess.
{27667}{27736}See? I gotyou.
{27820}{27879}Let's sayyou're right.
{27881}{27923}Everything you say.
{27924}{27980}I bag a prominent attorney...
{27981}{28079}hang his pelt on the trophywall|ofmy new luxurious offices.
{28106}{28179}What about your neighbors, then?
{28180}{28232}Are you saying that|they're all out to getyou too?
{28234}{28293}- How would I know?|- Whywould they be?
{28331}{28396}Maybe because I'm very rich?
{28398}{28446}Because I have a big house...
{28448}{28506}and a glamorous wife.
{28508}{28595}I have these things,|and it happens I don't deserve them.
{28612}{28690}My looks are entirely ordinary,|and I'm no genius.
{28724}{28795}Mediocre people|tolerate success...
{28796}{28889}when it comes to someone exceptional|like a movie star or an athlete...
{28891}{28965}but when it comes|to one oftheir own...
{28967}{29034}then it strikes them|as being an injustice.
{29068}{29097}You agree?
{29169}{29250}I thinkwe're getting|a little far afield.
{29279}{29369}Interesting thing is, there were no|dog prints found at the murder scene...
{29371}{29446}and we know that|without the dog...
{29448}{29492}you neverwould've seen the body.
{29494}{29569}In otherwords,|your ghost dog story reeks.
{29571}{29615}There were|dead leaves everywhere.
{29616}{29724}How doyou make dog prints|in dead leaves, Detective Opie?
{29726}{29775}I don't know.|Tell me.
{29776}{29856}You're a tax attorney.|Good at making up fantasies.
{29858}{29916}That's what|they payyou for, right?
{29941}{30051}The dog was there.Jesus.
{30154}{30220}Hold it, now.|Hold it. Hold on.
{30247}{30292}Yesterday. Damn.
{30369}{30449}They're all correct about Tango.
{30451}{30506}I didn't pick him up at Ricardi's.
{30508}{30555}I met him out on the path.
{30572}{30613}Geez.
{30615}{30687}Really had me going|there for a sec.
{30689}{30726}Good.
{30816}{30903}He gets out sometimes,|and he runs around the gardens.
{30932}{30976}Halfthe time...
{30977}{31056}Ricardi doesn'tevenknow|he's missing until lbring him back.
{31057}{31104}I remember now...
{31130}{31176}that I called him.
{31178}{31236}Tango, come here, boy.|Come on.
{31356}{31432}- Youjust went offwith him.|- Yeah, Tango's my buddy. Aren'tyou?
{31484}{31528}Go on. Go on. Run.
{31530}{31610}Perhapsyou'll understand|howour earsprick up...
{31612}{31662}every timeyourstory changes.
{31664}{31727}Yes, andlcertainlyhope|this one works...
{31728}{31810}because I'm banking on this lame|dog story to get me off the hook.
{31812}{31876}Crap. How much longer|do I gotta put up with this--
{31878}{31951}Owens!|You're out ofline.
{32041}{32087}Good boy.
{32088}{32173}Speaking ofdogs, you keepyours|on a leash. You don't need a lawsuit.
{32175}{32223}Now, you listen to me, Victor.
{32224}{32275}This is getting ridiculous.
{32276}{32352}When you called me, you told me it was|gonna be ten minutes. Now look at this.
{32354}{32397}I'm afraid it's gonna|take a little longer.
{32399}{32475}I can see the notion ofcivic duty|and being a good citizen isjust a myth.
{32476}{32540}- I don't rememberwho said it--|- You don't seem to remembervery much.
{32542}{32645}I don't rememberwho said the police|will ensure public safety everywhere...
{32647}{32689}except inside a police station.
{32691}{32773}You called before anyone|knew Sue Ellen was missing.
{32775}{32837}Well, does that|make me the murderer?
{32839}{32924}It says right here,|"I ran home and called the police."
{32926}{32999}My God, there must have been|several places closer.
{33001}{33048}I wasn't thinking.|I just ran home.
{33049}{33092}Or maybeyou thought,|"I'd betterwash up fi rst."
{33094}{33134}I don't like your tone.
{33136}{33220}And frankly, I'm beginning to fi nd|yours more and more interesting.
{33248}{33294}What areyou recording?
{33296}{33348}Do you have any idea|whyyou're still here?
{33392}{33436}Maybeyou should call|a lawyer down here.
{33438}{33480}I am a fucking lawyer!
{33531}{33600}This isJanuary 7, 8:06 P.M.
{33601}{33666}SanJuan Police Headquarters.|I'm Captain Benezet.
{33668}{33712}With me is Detective Owens.
{33713}{33760}We're talking|to Mr. Henry Hearst.
{33762}{33821}Do you haveyour permission|to tape this interview, Henry?
{33823}{33900}Why not?|I have nothing to hide.
{33901}{33942}Thank you.
{33944}{34033}Now, then--your name, age,|profession and marital status.
{34035}{34065}Come on.
{34067}{34168}Name, age, profession|and marital status, please.
{34170}{34252}Youjust said my name.|Fine. Whatever.
{34253}{34342}Hearst. Henry Buchanan Hearst.|I'm 57.
{34344}{34407}Your house is called "The Ilado"|up on Old SanJuan Hill...
{34409}{34435}and you're an attorney?
{34437}{34540}Yes. Senior partnerwith Hearst,|Dean and Dumet right here in town.
{34541}{34610}You must have a lot offancy computers|up there in that office.
{34612}{34692}You ever surfthe Net? Check out|the chat rooms and the websites?
{34693}{34740}I don't know about chat rooms,|but sure.
{34741}{34797}What does this have|to do with anything?
{34799}{34833}Any other hobbies?
{34866}{34928}Computers are not my hobby.|Photography is.
{34930}{34965}I have my own darkroom.
{34967}{35036}I enjoy chronicling|the island's history.
{35037}{35109}- And you're married.|- Yes.
{35135}{35204}- Ten years now.|- And no children.
{35206}{35274}Yes. And no children.
{35276}{35311}Why not?
{35313}{35388}Chantal won't--|Chantal can't have children.
{35390}{35442}She can't, or she won't?
{35444}{35495}She has a fertility problem.|What difference does it make?
{35518}{35620}You ever hear of adopting?|You walk somebody else's dog.
{35640}{35706}That's true tact.|That's very elegant.
{35761}{35808}Do you think that's elegant?
{35908}{35972}This is what I think.
{35974}{36080}I remember that|you couldn't afford law school.
{36081}{36184}I rememberyou waiting on tables.|We'd swagger in, drunk...
{36185}{36288}trotting along hot-looking dolls,|spending moneyyou know we didn't earn.
{36354}{36441}I think the matter at hand is payback.|That's what I think.
{36964}{37068}When Detective Owens arrived|at your house at 6:54 P.M. yesterday...
{37070}{37154}he noted that you were not|wearing jogging clothes.
{37180}{37241}- I showered.|- Before you called?
{37243}{37272}Of course not.
{37328}{37376}I called as soon as I came home.
{37416}{37465}911. What is your emergency?
{37467}{37549}I want to report a dead body.
{37676}{37774}Officers also noted that your wife|had not yet been told about the girl.
{37776}{37827}She was in the bedroom.
{37914}{37960}It says here you called|from the bedroom.
{37961}{38018}You had to lie down.|You were distraught.
{38050}{38130}- We'd had an argument.|- When you got home?
{38172}{38233}No, earlier. Please don't|go into this now, Victor.
{38235}{38292}- It's none of your business!|- Damn it, Henry!
{38294}{38377}Chantal was in the bedroom. She was not.|The dog was with you. The dog was not.
{38379}{38423}Tell me one thing that adds up...
{38424}{38476}so we can go across the street|and have a good time.
{38640}{38729}It's a pity that you've never been|to our home. Then you'd understand.
{38731}{38757}But I was.
{38788}{38875}I was there.|Downstairs there's that--
{38877}{38962}- Upstairs it gets instructive.|- There's nothing real special about it.
{38964}{39008}Mr. Hearst didn't say "special."
{39043}{39083}He said "instructive."
{39085}{39114}Thank you.
{39160}{39213}Well, let's see.|Upstairs.
{39215}{39307}There's a hallway, right?|There's along hallway.
{39308}{39368}-Sixty feet.|- Possibly.
{39370}{39436}- Defi nitely.|- I count five rooms up here.
{39438}{39536}The extra bedrooms were|for the children, which were never used.
{39554}{39653}The guest bedroom was|redecorated for mywife.
{39655}{39721}Our old room is now mine.
{39791}{39854}In between...
{39914}{39950}the hallway.
{39976}{40036}Sixty feet long.
{40038}{40096}You have separate bedrooms.
{40205}{40289}My lovely Chantal's affl iction|is the green-eyed monster.
{40307}{40387}They say that jealousy is all the fun|you think somebody else is having.
{40416}{40514}Chantal can be unbearable,|I promise you.
{40516}{40566}She have reason to be?
{40684}{40771}Regardless ofwhatyou think of me,|I do love my wife.
{40773}{40818}I've always loved her.
{40872}{40937}The only thing I ever wanted|was to be happy with Chantal...
{40939}{40999}and have children.
{41048}{41098}But the pitter-patter|of little feet...
{41124}{41163}was not to be.
{41424}{41518}- Check those out.|- I certainly would like to.
{41520}{41576}It certainly pays to advertise.
{41577}{41685}Ben, Thomas, I caught you in the act.|Married men should be more subtle.
{41732}{41807}- Where's Henry?|- He'll be right along.
{41809}{41866}Had a business matter to tidy up.
{41868}{41918}I thought I saw him|walking into the police station...
{41920}{41975}as we drove up to the valet.
{42011}{42077}He'll be right along.
{42197}{42245}Well, what do we discuss now?
{42247}{42324}We've pretty much|exhausted canaries and dogs.
{42326}{42461}Let's talk about the fi rst murder,|if you don't mind, down in La Perla.
{42729}{42800}Happened not too long ago,|justovertwo weeks.
{42834}{42901}Little girl's body was found.|Paulina Valera.
{42932}{42976}Twelveyears old.
{42977}{43033}Poorislandgirl.
{43035}{43116}Mother was a streethooker|living in a motel not too far away.
{43303}{43355}We think it started|somewhere in the streets.
{43356}{43428}Paulina was luredorsheran.
{43429}{43509}Either way, thekiller|leftherbodyin the dump.
{43628}{43663}Yeah?
{43726}{43772}Tell him I'll be right out.
{43851}{43896}When I get back, Henry...
{43897}{43953}I wantyou to tell me what|you were doing in La Perla...
{43955}{44012}the night|Paulina Valera was killed.
{44153}{44186}Superintendent.
{44188}{44272}I'm waiting to introduce|good citizen Henry Hearst...
{44336}{44409}in, let's see, 29 minutes.
{44411}{44517}- And I'm told he's still in there.|- That's right.
{44519}{44602}Victor, doyou realize how important|this fund-raising event is?
{44604}{44675}Yes, we have two dead girls.
{44676}{44732}But we also|have countless children...
{44734}{44813}whose homes were|blown away in the hurricane.
{44815}{44867}We have open sewers.
{44869}{44934}- We have a cholera epidemic.|- Sir, I realize--
{44936}{45004}You obviously do not.
{45064}{45160}How will the sponsors react|if Henry's accused?
{45162}{45274}I imagine extremely grateful|that their children are safe.
{45276}{45339}Just have him across the street...
{45340}{45381}by 9:00, okay?
{45955}{46010}- What timeyou got?|- Time to go.
{46012}{46059}- Your pulse is racing.|- I'm due to give my speech!
{46061}{46122}Speech? Yes, I know.|I've been told.
{46124}{46188}Two patrol officers wrote down|the license plate number...
{46190}{46267}ofyour Range Rover, which was parked|in the vicinity ofthe crime scene.
{46311}{46371}Your expensive vehicle|attracted attention.
{46400}{46492}Officers thought it might be stolen,|called it in.
{46518}{46564}That puts you in the area, Henry.
{46769}{46816}Anytimeyou're ready.
{46818}{46879}Me, I'm just hoping this is|as good as ghost dog.
{46881}{46940}You know where you were|three weeks ago, Sergeant Opie?
{46942}{47027}I was right here serving coffee|to stand-up citizens like yourself.
{47245}{47378}I was at my sister-in-law's.|I had knocked back a few at the club...
{47380}{47464}and I had this inspiration to drop off|some Christmas gifts for the kids.
{47466}{47515}Name and address, Henry.
{47516}{47584}I don't know the exact address,|but I know where it is.
{47585}{47636}It's Maria and Paco Rodriguez.
{47638}{47674}Should be in the book.
{47963}{47999}Chantal's older sister.
{48208}{48266}Great kids.
{48268}{48317}- How are you?|- Fine.
{48416}{48488}Maria's done|a fabulous job with them.
{48530}{48590}Merry Christmas.
{48733}{48789}Why didn't Chantal go with you?|It's her sister.
{48824}{48859}It's complicated.
{48934}{49002}Paco. Merry Christmas.
{49037}{49112}I need to know more about this.
{49114}{49159}No, you don't.
{49788}{49828}l talkedtoher.
{49830}{49878}She gave up a little bit ofdirt.
{49880}{49924}She says that|it's the fi rst time...
{49926}{49984}that either Henry or Chantal...
{49986}{50030}had stopped by in a long time.
{50032}{50082}She didn't sound too friendly.
{50084}{50136}Whyyou pick that night|to thaw the ice?
{50138}{50218}- It has nothing to do with anything.|- Where'd you go next?
{50220}{50257}I went home.
{50280}{50349}Police reported|your car at 2:18 A.M.
{50351}{50410}You see, this is what we here|at the police--
{50412}{50494}We call it a window|of opportunity.
{50664}{50756}I was driving drunk.|I wasjust driving terribly.
{50988}{51066}I most definitely needed|to walk off the liquor.
{51535}{51607}La Perla's not a good idea|for a man wearing Armani.
{51742}{51776}It was abeautiful night.
{51843}{51928}- This place doesn't scare me.|- Well, it should.
{51952}{52016}So? Where did you go?
{52067}{52104}I found a bench.
{52172}{52212}I sat down.
{52244}{52324}I found abench.|I sat down. I fell asleep.
{52497}{52553}Found a bench.|Woke up I don't know when.
{52584}{52655}Felt better. I went home.
{52715}{52772}What's gonna stop me from|shoving my fist down his throat?
{52774}{52831}The police would rather|that I drove home drunk?
{52832}{52872}All right, Henry.
{52907}{52955}Let's revisit this...
{52978}{53014}bench later.
{53043}{53096}First I want an answer|to my question...
{53098}{53171}as to why Chantal didn't|accompanyyou that night.
{53173}{53206}It's between the sisters.
{53208}{53288}lmetPaco Rodriguez.|He's ahotlocalartist.
{53290}{53341}Busted him once smoking grass.
{53343}{53408}- Who doesn't on this island?|- You smoke a little grass, Henry?
{53410}{53511}Do you? God knows it would help|with your sunny disposition.
{53513}{53591}I'm thinking you don't|fancy Chantal hanging out...
{53592}{53715}with a handsome,|successful younger man.
{53717}{53754}- Do you?|- Is this necessary?
{53756}{53793}How old was Chantal|when you married her?
{53795}{53869}- Twenty. Right, Henry?|- You're, what, 67, right?
{53871}{53951}I'm 57!|Goddamn it, 57!
{53982}{54055}This is a fucking outrage.|You know that?
{54056}{54125}You've no right to pry|into my private affairs...
{54127}{54182}with these|soap opera insinuations.
{54198}{54287}Look atyou, Victor.|Doing a bang-upjob policing the island.
{54289}{54371}Drugs everywhere.|Just-- Crime is rampant.
{54372}{54451}Superintendent, my butt. You'll|be lucky ifyou still have ajob.
{55134}{55171}I'm sorry.
{55220}{55276}I'm really sorry.
{55278}{55371}This is really rather|unbearable for me.
{55487}{55535}I don't suppose that...
{55537}{55604}Detective Owens could|get me a cold drink.
{55772}{55816}If you would, Detective.
{55845}{55883}My pleasure.
{56234}{56283}All right, Henry.
{56284}{56332}What's going on here?
{56334}{56389}Do you have anything...
{56391}{56469}a little stronger|stashed away around here?
{56791}{56869}Okay, Victor. What's itgonna|take togetme outofhere?
{56871}{56945}We both know that I could|march in an army ofattorneys.
{56947}{57015}I'm intrigued they're|not here already, Henry.
{57071}{57180}You're hiding something, something you|don't want to get outside this room.
{57269}{57318}Now it'sjustyou and me.
{57367}{57419}Tell me about Chantal.
{57482}{57569}You tell me|about Kate and Consuelo.
{57571}{57647}If having a difficult marriage|makes me a murderer...
{57648}{57697}you'd be Son ofSam.
{57747}{57786}Touche.
{57874}{57914}Kate and I...
{57940}{57973}married tooyoung.
{58001}{58049}She grew to want somebody better.
{58051}{58134}A man with a real job...
{58173}{58222}money to buy things|she came to know...
{58224}{58276}that other men were only|too happy to buy for her.
{58326}{58378}And Consuelo--
{58380}{58433}Consuelo just hates|me being a cop.
{58435}{58472}You stuck with your guns.
{58474}{58539}You can't tell me|being a cop isn't exciting.
{58540}{58603}And you obviously enjoy|harassing people.
{58704}{58770}You don't see folks running|up to me at cocktail soirees saying...
{58772}{58876}"Gee whiz, a tax attorney. Wow.|What a cool job. Wish I could do that."
{58878}{58939}Wouldn't mind|whatyou got, Henry.
{58979}{59027}Used to be enough.
{59114}{59166}Chantal's green monster...
{59168}{59221}extends to her sister's marriage.
{59223}{59323}You see, Maria married for other|more tried and true reasons...
{59325}{59393}despite her mother's objections.
{59395}{59471}Married a man|closer to her own age.
{59472}{59519}A man ofmodest means.
{59544}{59588}Dashing young artist.
{59590}{59640}Beautiful women.
{59642}{59719}They are a breed unto themselves.|Wouldn'tyou agree?
{59721}{59807}A beautiful woman|moves through life unchallenged...
{59838}{59889}men giving them|everything that theywant.
{59891}{59987}First their daddies,|then their boyfriends and husbands.
{59988}{60089}- I'll drink to that.|- For some, beauty is their only talent.
{60134}{60185}There's always|somebody more beautiful.
{60187}{60248}Somebodyyounger.
{60268}{60328}Chantal's mother taught her that.
{60408}{60460}Why areyou doing this|to me, Victor?
{60462}{60547}I certainly hope you've gotten your|petty thrill pulling back the curtain.
{60549}{60602}But there's nothing more to see.
{60652}{60707}I'll tell you what I see, Henry.
{60735}{60828}I see the bodies|oftwoyoung girls, murdered.
{60830}{60894}The man who did that's|going to answer to me.
{60896}{60941}You make me sick.
{60943}{60991}Why doyou keep saying|"The man who did it...
{60992}{61034}the one responsible, the killer"?
{61036}{61086}Why don'tyou put a name|to this phantom--
{61088}{61147}Henry Hearst, attorney-at-law--
{61148}{61212}if you're so convinced|that I'm guilty?
{61244}{61316}Construing my marriage|to be dysfunctional...
{61318}{61376}just makes it easier for you|to sell me down the river.
{61378}{61439}I'm being convinced,|but not all the way.
{61476}{61572}- That's whyyou're still here.|- I'm still here because I choose to be.
{61574}{61641}Because you asked me|ifI would "drop by."
{61643}{61712}Because you fed me|this line ofcrap...
{61713}{61757}about a couple ofquestions.
{61759}{61816}But now--|Now I'm leaving.
{61842}{61887}I've told my story to exhaustion.
{61888}{61958}I've got a ballroom full ofpeople|waiting for me over there...
{61960}{62030}to give my toast|in exactly 1 2 minutes.
{62032}{62116}And I've suffered enough insults|and accusations for any friend to bear.
{62116}{62128}And I've suffered enough insults|and accusations for any friend to bear.
{62130}{62178}You're not going anywhere, Henry.
{62207}{62258}What, areyou gonna sick|this knuckle-dragger on me?
{62260}{62299}In that case, be careful.
{62301}{62392}Be very careful, because|you only have so many possibilities.
{62394}{62452}You remember:|I know something about the law.
{62454}{62536}I'm gonna walk right out that door|unless you book me here and now.
{62538}{62597}How about I detain you|on suspicion?
{62599}{62633}Are you serious?
{62693}{62744}Read him his rights.
{62782}{62861}Step inside.|You have the right to remain silent.
{62863}{62940}- Anything you say can and will be--|- On what charge?
{62942}{63022}Taking a nap on a bench?|Walking a dog without permission?
{63024}{63102}Two counts, fi rst-degree murder.|Special circumstances.
{63104}{63155}Two counts, rape...
{63157}{63216}upon the persons ofSue Ellen Huddy|and Paulina Valera.
{63277}{63324}I raped them as well, huh?
{63325}{63402}Ifyou cannot afford an attorney,|the court will appoint one for you.
{63404}{63478}Now, doyou understand these rights|that have been explained toyou?
{63632}{63686}Seeyou outside a minute, please.
{63839}{63885}He's one hundred|fucking percent guilty.
{63887}{63935}He knows exactly where|we're taking him.
{63936}{64018}Yeah, you made sure ofthat.|Thank you. Now, what ifhe lawyers up?
{64020}{64101}He opens his wallet and trots in|some hardball mouthpiece--
{64103}{64172}- That's it. We lose him.|- We already had him.
{64174}{64265}"I was sleeping on a park bench."|I mean, my ass!
{64267}{64337}You're playing it soft.|Why areyou butterballing him?
{64339}{64420}Why don'tyou let me go in there|and let me drop the hammer on that guy?
{64421}{64466}I'm gonna walk across the street.
{64468}{64529}You go back in there,|and you sit with him.
{64531}{64600}And you keepyour mouth shut.|Okay?
{64601}{64636}Shut!
{65535}{65590}I saw Victor's eyes.
{65645}{65767}And your nostrils seem|to have a new flare to them.
{65769}{65847}As in, your butt got chewed|for blowing the pooch.
{65941}{66019}Our notorious captain would love|to have ambushed me with that tidbit...
{66020}{66097}and owned the most|devastating moment.
{66178}{66221}Yeah.
{66305}{66360}- You okaywith that?|- What?
{66361}{66432}I didn't know-- diet or regular.
{66608}{66654}Bet they're fast, huh?
{66656}{66695}Excuse me?
{66697}{66742}Little girls.
{66744}{66800}I bet they run really fast...
{66802}{66853}when you're chasing 'em.
{66880}{66955}You'll be running quick, too,|when I fi le my lawsuit.
{66999}{67040}You're telling me toletaman--
{67042}{67109}whom I think|in all probability...
{67111}{67182}killed twoyoung girls--|walk out ofthe station?
{67184}{67252}For ten minutes, Victor.
{67292}{67360}- Has he confessed?|- Of course not.
{67361}{67416}You have proof enough|to arrest him?
{67418}{67470}I've caught him|in a number oflies.
{67472}{67532}You need more than a few lies.
{67534}{67592}And until you have them...
{67594}{67680}I don't want him|retained officially.
{67748}{67807}Don't tell meyou already--
{67809}{67865}Five minutes ago.|I thought he might take off.
{67867}{67931}He has to make his toast!
{67989}{68036}Bring him here.
{68037}{68092}No uniformed officer.
{68113}{68155}No restraint ofany kind.
{68157}{68196}See to it...
{68214}{68246}Captain.
{68327}{68366}Well, this is nice.
{68392}{68442}A little alone time.
{68604}{68652}You know, I like you, Henry.
{68678}{68728}Can you believe it?
{68730}{68800}A couple ofgirls strangled, raped.
{68802}{68851}And yetyou maintain|a sense ofhumor about it.
{68853}{68891}Raped and strangled.
{68947}{68977}What?
{69012}{69056}You said "strangled and raped."
{69058}{69104}I wouldn't know, especially...
{69106}{69169}but these things should|be put in their proper order.
{69171}{69217}Don'tyou agree, Detective?
{69219}{69268}Do you call to them?
{69382}{69437}What do I know?
{69439}{69504}Could be the poor kids,|they lured you...
{69506}{69574}off into the woods|and seduced you.
{69597}{69640}It happens.
{69642}{69695}You sound obsessed.
{69696}{69742}You like this sort ofthing.
{69788}{69839}I'm just curious.
{69840}{69907}I'm curious howyou operate.
{69908}{69951}Now...
{69952}{70048}these little girls-- I bet they run|like rabbits, don't they?
{70093}{70184}Come on.|Tell me about it.
{70185}{70232}What doyou do?
{70279}{70327}Touch 'em?|You touch 'em like that?
{70359}{70401}What, did that hurt?
{70479}{70544}You hurt 'em, don'tyou?|The little girls.
{70570}{70618}- Do you kiss them?|- Cut it out!
{70665}{70725}"What's your name, sweetheart?
{70727}{70761}Paulina?
{70763}{70857}That's a pretty name.|It's sexy, yeah.
{70897}{70930}Are you here all byyourself?
{70979}{71024}I am too.
{71078}{71148}Cute top. It's a tight little blouse|you got on there.
{71150}{71205}God, you're a hot little cutie.
{71207}{71248}I just wanna put my--"
{71285}{71339}Where areyou going, little girl?
{71588}{71620}Back.
{71654}{71701}- Getyour hands off me.|- Get back in the office.
{72159}{72185}You--
{72263}{72318}You son of a bitch.
{72320}{72383}It's the captain.|Line three.
{72542}{72577}He what?
{72607}{72670}Never mind, Owens.|Never mind!
{72672}{72741}Just bring him here.|Bring him here now!
{72743}{72796}He has aspeech tomake.
{72932}{73013}When you've fixed your rug,|I gotta run you over.
{73015}{73074}Haven't you done that already?
{73245}{73317}Would you please getyour hands|off me? Please!
{73319}{73395}My God, Henry! What happened?
{73397}{73444}Have you met my new tailor|and hairstylist...
{73445}{73510}the " Marquis de fucking Sade"?
{73512}{73598}Look! This is nothing less than assault|and battery, and I have witnesses!
{73600}{73664}- Witnesses to what?|- You knocked me down the stairs!
{73666}{73732}- You attempted to escape!|- That's bullshit!
{73756}{73793}Come on!
{73795}{73846}- Let's go have a serious discu--|-Just cut the crap.
{73848}{73931}- What?|- Henry, people are depending on you.
{73933}{74009}- Shut up.Just shut up.|- Shut up,Julio.
{74126}{74172}Do you mind?
{74204}{74252}Ruthanne,|you're looking lovely, as usual.
{74254}{74355}- Henry, is everything okay?|- Yes, fi ne.
{74433}{74482}Thank you very much.
{74522}{74581}It's all right.
{74583}{74621}Isabella, hola.
{74709}{74752}Wait.
{74754}{74821}Just pray that I'm guilty|ofkilling those girls...
{74823}{74904}because ifI am,|then your boys worked over a monster.
{74906}{75023}It'll be brushed under the carpet. But|ifI'm not, the monster changes sides.
{75024}{75103}Henry,|just give us that money smile.
{75260}{75302}Shit.
{75360}{75410}Good evening,|ladies and gentlemen.
{75424}{75467}Happy San Sebastian.
{75469}{75531}I'm proud to introduce a man...
{75533}{75626}who along with his lovelywife|Chantal Hearst...
{75683}{75796}has championed many charity causes|in Puerto Rico.
{75798}{75911}And in the wake of Hurricane Lucy,|we need him more than ever.
{75912}{75989}So, Henry, get over here|and empty these people's pockets.
{76157}{76208}Where's his fucking hair?
{76301}{76359}Had the damn thing upside down.
{76404}{76474}Thank you very much|for coming tonight.
{76476}{76552}Where you been?|Got a lot ofcatchin' up to do.
{76554}{76608}I'm right behind you.
{76680}{76812}When nature sends its worst, it's|as ifone ofGod's checks has bounced.
{76814}{76870}Let's prayyour checks don't.
{76896}{77013}Because that's whywe're here.|Hurricane Lucy ripped across--
{77015}{77084}They say no amount of learning|can cure stupidity.
{77085}{77151}-You're certainly a candidate for--|-Ifhe'd cracked, you'd have come back--
{77152}{77268}Well, he didn't crack,|and you're off this investigation.
{77270}{77328}- What?|- Don't, Detective.
{77330}{77422}Learn the grammar ofsilence|whileyou still hold that rank.
{77424}{77479}Now, you go back to the station.
{77480}{77554}Go home.|Put on a silly hat.
{77556}{77602}Do whatever morons do.
{77704}{77815}The island is a family,|one that has been torn apart.
{77817}{77928}We need to be there for each other,|especially for our children.
{77991}{78054}For there's no greater gift|than a child's smile.
{78106}{78208}I want him back. Now. Tonight.|Not tomorrow.
{78243}{78322}Victor, don't underestimate...
{78324}{78420}the resolve of Henry Hearst|and his law fi rm...
{78422}{78497}to raise your severed head|on a pole...
{78499}{78567}and wave it|for the whole damn island to see.
{78586}{78650}We'll see whose head|gets waved on that pole.
{78748}{78847}Well, that's your decision,|then...
{78849}{78894}isn't it?
{78896}{79003}In closing, I'd like to askyou|to look intoyour hearts...
{79005}{79060}realize what truly matters|in life...
{79062}{79167}and fi nd the love|to help our family.
{79341}{79403}Perhaps catastrophe...
{79405}{79486}is the natural human environment.
{79488}{79579}We fi nd ourselves attacked|by unforeseen forces come to harm us...
{79580}{79657}even though we are innocent|ofanywrongdoing.
{79712}{79840}But it is human nature to overcome,|ifwe work together.
{79841}{79915}So, please,|help me help the children.
{79916}{79955}Thank you.
{80803}{80854}You know,|as ifI wasn't embarrassed enough...
{80856}{80948}you jerked me out ofthere without|being able to chat or have dinner.
{80950}{81023}- I'm hungry, damn it!|- You like chocolate?
{81024}{81075}There's a whole machine full ofit|in the hallway...
{81077}{81124}and I knowyou've got money.
{81150}{81215}- You can't treat me like this.|- Of course I can!
{81248}{81331}You'll eat, Henry.|Food is the least ofyour problems.
{81356}{81419}I'm going to do the best I can|to seeyou get three squares a day.
{81591}{81639}Come with me.
{81641}{81756}Will you hold my husband all night?|How long could that be?
{81979}{82041}Would you like to have a private chat|with yourwife?
{82148}{82201}This is Detective Castillo.
{82203}{82335}He's going to set up a video camera|in here while I chat with Chantal.
{82336}{82391}Why mustyou question her?
{82480}{82556}Detective Castillo|will getyou some food.
{82920}{82993}- I should tell you the--|- Do it outside.
{83048}{83101}Victor,|I need to know what's happening.
{83103}{83172}Just give me a moment|while I close the door.
{83173}{83238}She came in-- She was-- to me--
{83265}{83339}Is Henry here? Can I see him?
{83376}{83460}- I need to see him.|- Doesn't want to talk toyou.
{83527}{83614}Ifhe's innocent,|why is this taking so long?
{83634}{83674}I never said he was innocent.
{83880}{83941}Tell me about your lives together|as a couple.
{84026}{84083}You could start|with the separate bedrooms.
{84140}{84184}He talked about that?
{84228}{84286}- And what else?|- Your sister.
{84461}{84529}Don'tyou offer|to light a lady's cigarette?
{85031}{85114}Tell me about the night he...
{85116}{85179}visited your sister's home.
{85205}{85261}What night would that be?
{85263}{85390}December 1 9, Sunday night,|about 9:00 in the evening.
{85392}{85462}I find it curious that you chose|not to accompany him.
{85489}{85579}I wasn't aware|Henry had visited my sister.
{85619}{85662}Why wouldn't he tell you?
{85710}{85767}Obviously Henry has talked to us|about your marriage...
{85768}{85910}howyou wish you had married someone|closer toyour age, like Paco.
{85912}{86000}You're saying Henry'sjealous|ofmy sister's husband?
{86002}{86049}Are you having an affair|with Paco?
{86051}{86101}Am I on trial now?
{86244}{86300}Can you tell me|what time he got home that night?
{86400}{86506}There was a night|that could be it.
{86508}{86563}I remember the frontdoor.
{86590}{86636}It's old, veryheavy.
{86676}{86722}It tends to slam.
{86744}{86795}Did you look at the clock?
{86908}{87014}- You must've been worried.|- This wasn't the fi rst time.
{87232}{87262}Hello?
{87524}{87587}Take me into that room.
{88086}{88137}Why don'tyou answer me?
{88499}{88610}Andyoudidn'tpursueit?Or didn't|youcare toask where he was?
{88651}{88721}We don't ask those sort|ofquestions anymore.
{88748}{88793}But I'm sure|you're going to tell me.
{88795}{88871}We have reason to believe|he was in La Perla...
{88873}{88947}where a young girl named Paulina Valera|was raped and murdered...
{88948}{88995}and left on a garbage dump.
{89080}{89145}I need to know whose name|the house is in.
{89181}{89237}The house was a gift.
{89239}{89311}Then may I haveyour permission|to search the house?
{89364}{89398}You may not.
{89790}{89865}- You said you were hungry.|- What'd she say?
{89904}{89955}- You all set, Castillo?|- Yes, sir.
{89957}{90004}Start recording.
{90032}{90082}I was talking toyou.
{90108}{90170}That's right. Victor only listens|when it suits Victor.
{90172}{90219}I listen, Henry.
{90220}{90273}I was listening when you told me|you left your sister-in-law's...
{90275}{90389}and drove to La Perla, that you went|for a walk and fell asleep on a bench.
{90391}{90463}Now I'd like to hear something|that vaguely resembles the truth.
{90465}{90555}- That is the truth.|- Chantal says you got home at 3:30 A.M.
{90556}{90625}I told you I went for a walk.|I was drunk. I--
{90663}{90781}- I may have had another drink.|- You happen onto Via Del Mar Boulevard?
{91268}{91363}Do you want toparty with me?|Whatdoyou want?
{91459}{91530}- Did you see any hookers?|- No.
{91532}{91597}- You didn't talk to any hookers?|- No.
{91599}{91668}- Spend time with one, perhaps?|- Absolutely not.
{91670}{91723}You're lying, Henry.
{91724}{91791}Your carotid artery|is pumping like crazy.
{91792}{91870}And your eyes-- They turn down|and to the left.
{91872}{91926}That's what liars do.|It's a fact.
{91928}{91979}Our bodies give us away.
{92072}{92116}Do you know what these do?
{92192}{92248}They keep me awake.
{92290}{92337}I haven't been sleeping much.
{92363}{92477}Sinceyou found Sue Ellen Huddy's body,|I've been working straight through.
{92532}{92588}And I've got so much|to share with you.
{92615}{92679}For instance, I accompanied|those two officers...
{92681}{92756}who phoned in the license number|from your Range Rover.
{92758}{92800}We went back to La Perla.
{92802}{92860}They showed me|exactly where you parked.
{92862}{92919}We conducted some interviews.
{92920}{93011}Imagine my surprise when several|prostitutes recognized your photo...
{93012}{93060}said you'd been coming around|for months.
{93062}{93117}Jesus Christ, Victor,|she's in the next room.
{93119}{93218}I'm talking about street hookers,|needle users, crackheads...
{93220}{93279}not high-class call girls.
{93280}{93329}Curb crawlers, for God's sake.
{93360}{93466}My God. That old carotid artery|is pumping like gangbusters.
{93468}{93513}God damn you.
{93584}{93655}Chantal can't hearyou,|not with the door closed.
{93694}{93758}- Unless I turn the speaker on.|- Please.
{94088}{94177}She was blond.
{94179}{94244}Obviously peroxide,|being Hispanic.
{94300}{94396}She would truly have been beautiful|without all that makeup.
{94460}{94546}- I never knew her name.|- Do you miss me, huh?
{94562}{94619}Yes, you do.
{94640}{94715}I left my sister-in-law's house...
{94716}{94786}to have sex in an alley|with a prostitute.
{94866}{94948}I be a good little girl|for you. Little girl.
{94984}{95028}I fi nished myselfoff...
{95030}{95140}drinking any goddamn thing|I wanted at the Sunshine Cafe.
{95175}{95230}A whiskey.
{95534}{95632}What doyou think? That I'd|spend my life banging on mywife's--
{95697}{95736}mywife's door?
{95792}{95846}I'd fi nd a substitute...
{95908}{95981}someonejust the opposite|from Chantal.
{96007}{96091}A prostitute is a woman|who will giveyou a great deal...
{96093}{96148}for relatively little money.
{96364}{96497}Well, as an alibi,|I don't know, Henry.
{96499}{96558}A lot ofwomen in Puerto Rico|die their hair blond...
{96577}{96710}especially in that profession,|but I'll tell you what I do know.
{96712}{96799}One ofthem admittedshe'dbeen withyou|last week. Hername was Reina.
{96818}{96905}- Do you know this man?|- No.
{96980}{97009}Yes.
{97011}{97107}She was young,|much younger than the others.
{97148}{97232}And she says|that's whyyou like her.
{97268}{97334}But this must be an old picture.
{97336}{97421}- Why?|- The guy's bald now.
{97423}{97487}- Bald?|- Mm-hmm.
{97524}{97614}You removeyour hairpiece down there|as well, don'tyou, Henry?
{97616}{97676}It seems nobody remembers you|with the rug.
{97678}{97730}Trying not to be recognized.|That's smart.
{97747}{97812}Pick 'em up inyour car,|somebodymightcatch alicenseplate.
{97920}{97982}- "This one likes it quick"--|- From behind.
{98008}{98062}He pumps me hard.
{98064}{98118}At least he comes fast.
{98120}{98228}Then goes like he doesn't|want to be here.
{98230}{98298}But I like it fast.|Gets me back--
{98300}{98361}"...into my corner."
{98363}{98441}But a week ago is no alibi,|is it, Henry?
{98600}{98649}Why, Henry?
{98703}{98781}Why here like this...
{98811}{98854}in the dirt?
{98952}{99021}Think of the high-class escorts|you can buy.
{99023}{99120}Suites at the Ritz.|Dom Perignon. And you choose this.
{99122}{99217}Don't tell her, will you,|Victor? Please.
{99219}{99306}I imagine Chantal will be thrilled|to learn you were with a prostitute...
{99336}{99385}instead of what|you were really doing.
{99744}{99804}Rapists leave bodily fluids--
{99840}{99874}semen...
{99913}{99948}DNA.
{99979}{100067}Your test'll prove|that it wasn't me.
{100100}{100201}- You use condoms with your prostitutes?|- Of course.
{100203}{100267}- What kind?|- I don't know.
{100354}{100409}Trojans. Whatever they have.
{100411}{100461}The killer used condoms.
{100490}{100592}Chemical lubricants were found|in the victims. He's smart, like you.
{100616}{100672}Knows all about our lab tests.
{100697}{100776}Both victims were raped from behind.|Both victims were strangledfrom behind.
{100832}{100907}Thumb and fingerprints|on the victims'necks confirmedthis.
{100934}{100987}Are you here all byyourself?
{100988}{101061}Then you put the clothes|back on.
{101063}{101139}Dirt and leaves inside the garments|confirmedthis, as well.
{101176}{101228}- Pretty blouse you have on there.|- Then you pose them.
{101254}{101299}Each on the side...
{101300}{101389}little heads|resting on cupped hands.
{101417}{101474}And you combed their hair.
{101476}{101519}The lack of debris suggests this.
{101547}{101605}And we have reason|to believeyou took their photograph.
{101607}{101662}Stop it!
{101664}{101743}Photography is your hobby,|isn't it? Isn't it?
{101744}{101775}Stop it!
{102232}{102276}- What's wrong? You all right?|- I'm fine.
{102276}{102343}- What's wrong? You all right?|- I'm fine.
{102344}{102412}You want some water?
{102414}{102479}No. I'm perfectly fine.|I've never been better.
{102504}{102559}I'm just tired.
{102560}{102651}You don't look exactly|fresh as a daisy yourself.
{103222}{103267}You surf, Henry?
{103289}{103405}The Internet? This is a statement|from yourweb-browser provider.
{103453}{103525}Your E-mail address|is hhearst@elpuerto.com.
{103548}{103611}You sometimes|use an on-line alias.
{103631}{103683}" Hard Body Hank"?
{103712}{103815}- Very catchy.|- God, does this ever end?
{103816}{103863}A simpleyes or no, Henry.
{103936}{104002}- Yes.|- Yes.
{104016}{104103}It seems that Hard Body Hank|has visited several pornography sites...
{104122}{104204}one ofwhich|is called Barely Legal.
{104206}{104280}It features young ladies|posed as schoolgirls.
{104300}{104360}That website features women,|not children.
{104433}{104465}Christ.
{104491}{104581}Every time I check E-mail, there's a new|message from some electronic bimbo...
{104583}{104624}luring me to her site.
{104626}{104690}So I checked it out a few times.|What's the big deal?
{104723}{104816}And the prostitutes--|What does that prove? That I'm lonely?
{104841}{104955}That I don't get it at home? That|mywife makes me sleep down the hall?
{105017}{105137}And all this makes me a pedophile,|a rapist, a killer ofchildren?
{105242}{105331}- Whywould I do such a thing?|- I don't know, Henry.
{105382}{105420}Notyet.
{105467}{105592}Let's talk about this glamorous wife who|keeps poor Henry shivering in the hall.
{105637}{105702}- You know what Chantal says?|- She's lying!
{105704}{105763}Whatever she said.|I never touched Camille.
{105925}{105972}Who's Camille?
{106176}{106259}All right, Mrs. Hearst.|Let's talk about your separate bedrooms.
{106284}{106374}Henry says it was his choice;|he moved out.
{106376}{106430}- He's wrong.|- He's wrong or he's lying?
{106432}{106491}Let's not quibble overwords.
{106493}{106551}But words can be very amusing.
{106552}{106603}Words like "conjugal duty,"|for instance...
{106604}{106729}which Henry claims you have not been|performing with willing good spirits.
{106731}{106800}To be honest,|he says you're not performing at all.
{106801}{106879}He has been revealing things,|hasn't he?
{106880}{106959}I'd like to hearyour side.
{106961}{107074}The most interesting things--|Those I'm sure he kept to himself.
{107076}{107120}Not Camille, I'm afraid.
{107162}{107253}That is the reason you sent him down the|hall with his toothbrush and washcloth?
{107423}{107471}He's out there...
{107505}{107614}afraid, hoping for a miracle...
{107616}{107709}that one day|things will turn out all right...
{107711}{107781}as long as nobody|speaks ofthem.
{107876}{107936}He's right to.
{107938}{107982}To what? Hope?
{108122}{108154}To be afraid.
{108250}{108344}Christmas Day, twoyears ago.
{108372}{108481}We always used to spend Christmas|with Maria and Paco.
{108527}{108573}Of course this was before.
{108644}{108693}Yeah.|That's what I understand.
{108695}{108765}I couldn't wait to see my niece.
{108820}{108843}Camille.
{108891}{108971}Their children were special...
{108995}{109088}with an extra share ofmagic...
{109090}{109155}andgraceandpurity.
{109188}{109234}Camille was one ofthem.
{109328}{109384}Henryandl|were extremely fondofher.
{109412}{109453}How areyou?
{109455}{109528}- They seem very close.|- Don't they?
{109567}{109633}- You look great!|- You too.
{109635}{109774}We were allhaving agoodtime,|the way families should beat Christmas.
{109776}{109832}- But then Henrygotdrunk.|- Red, anybody?
{109834}{109918}- No, thanks.|- You've already poured it out.
{109943}{109978}- I have.|- He startedmaking remarks...
{109980}{110060}- Please excuse my husband.|- about me and Paco.
{110107}{110201}Excuse the husband, yeah.|Something Paco seems very adept at.
{110203}{110250}- It was embarrassing.|- Henry.
{110252}{110290}I was angry.
{110311}{110385}- This the first time?|- No.
{110387}{110501}Is it some kind of secret|that Paco finds my Chantal enchanting?
{110503}{110579}- Henry, don't.|- So what did you do?
{110580}{110663}- Don't what?|- I told him to shut up.
{110664}{110695}Just don't.
{111009}{111050}Afterdinner...
{111052}{111121}Maria and I opened our presents.
{111147}{111210}- Books forme...|- Thanks.
{111212}{111257}she wanted to read...
{111259}{111339}and jewelry forher|thatl wanted to wear.
{111542}{111625}Why I got up when I did,|I don't know.
{111674}{111747}Unless|you call intuition are a son.
{111832}{111877}But he wasn't there.
{112031}{112099}Something led me|toward the bedrooms.
{112156}{112218}- I don't get it.|- Come here.
{112348}{112412}- They were there...|- Let me see.
{112414}{112448}in herroom.
{112450}{112517}- Yes.|- Thank you.
{112519}{112595}He was talking,|andshe was listening.
{112596}{112677}lcouldn't tellyou|whathe was saying...
{112679}{112729}but the wayhe talkedtoher...
{112754}{112830}was the way|you talk toa woman.
{112832}{112956}lrememberhowshesmiled,|thelookin hereyes.
{113096}{113177}He had no right|to make her smile that way.
{113348}{113399}And you continued|to stay together...
{113425}{113501}each atyour own|separate ends ofthe hall.
{113536}{113577}And you never had sex since?
{113579}{113694}You're putting on quite a show|for Henry, aren'tyou?
{113696}{113754}Right now,|he can't hearyou.
{113816}{113919}Once a woman decides|that's it's not important--
{113920}{114017}Even when l would try|toget things back tonormal...
{114019}{114066}that image was always with me.
{114068}{114124}And sinceyou can't|have children--
{114166}{114222}Of course I can.
{114449}{114546}Would you mind telling me|how old you were when you and Henry met?
{114587}{114704}I think I was about 11|when we came over from Europe.
{114706}{114790}Henry became|my father's attorney here.
{114792}{114929}They sailed together.|He was always around.
{114931}{115031}In our families, you could always|find some friend ofyour father's...
{115032}{115142}with a boat in St. Thomas|or a penthouse in Manhattan.
{115144}{115196}And that man was Henry.
{115238}{115282}Now, your father--
{115330}{115387}He died when you were what?
{115427}{115461}Fourteen.
{115508}{115575}And Henry|becameyour surrogate father?
{115577}{115632}He paid for my college.
{115634}{115703}And that's|when you became lovers?
{115704}{115777}I wasn't interested|in boys my age.
{115803}{115886}Spring break. I couldn't wait.
{115950}{116065}We did it on Henry's yacht,|then in hotels...
{116067}{116170}in cars, on beaches, everywhere.
{116227}{116322}He was different with me.|He was tender.
{116407}{116474}We had a time, Henry and I.
{116526}{116571}I can imagine.
{116614}{116731}So can you imagine his anger...
{116765}{116817}at not being able|to make love toyou now?
{116819}{116917}- I've seen it.|- You've seen it?
{116960}{117019}As in, he raped you?
{117261}{117320}Rape is an act ofanger.
{117321}{117397}It's about control,|not about sex.
{117399}{117473}Henrywas a very angry man.
{117518}{117584}Do you think he's guilty?
{117586}{117627}Do you?
{117821}{117892}That night,|he visited your sister's home.
{117893}{117974}Did you notice any scratches on him,|signs ofstruggle?
{118025}{118084}I can't remember.
{118086}{118170}I need to get my hands on the clothes|he was wearing that night.
{118204}{118236}Please.
{118238}{118294}Give me permission|to search your house.
{118370}{118441}Becauseyou sawyour husband talking|toyour niece on Christmas Eve...
{118443}{118516}you've thrown him out ofyour bedroom|and haven't slept with him in twoyears.
{118518}{118598}Now, don'tyou think|that's a little bit harsh?
{118600}{118658}Stop trying to bait me.
{118660}{118741}What doyou call a beautiful young woman|who'sjealous ofher 13-year-old niece?
{118799}{118834}Honest.
{118836}{118961}" Honest." I don't know|who's more fucked up, you or him.
{119160}{119198}I'm sorry.
{119317}{119388}But don'tyou want to know|you've been right about him?
{119424}{119464}Don'tyou?
{119658}{119700}Don't make a mess.
{119753}{119850}Castillo? Take a squad ofmen.|Escort Mrs. Hearst back to her house.
{119868}{119912}Yes, sir.
{119914}{120018}- Castillo, search the house.|- Yes, sir.
{120092}{120154}Say it. Go on. Say it.
{120156}{120234}She tells you about Camille,|everything falls into place.
{120248}{120311}There's no need|to even ask my side of the story.
{120313}{120420}I'mJack the Ripper,|Jekyll and Hyde, big, bad wolf.
{120421}{120469}I'll remind you, Henry.
{120471}{120594}I've heard your story all night,|and you've been lying.
{120722}{120835}- Detective.|- You got a problem? Huh?
{120837}{120915}- All right.|- Let's go.
{121008}{121028}Sitdown, Henry.
{121028}{121050}Sitdown, Henry.
{121160}{121219}Going man to man now,|are we?
{121220}{121275}Shall I roll up my sleeves?
{121276}{121348}Christmas. Twoyears ago.|You and Camille.
{121378}{121472}- Letmesee.|- ldon'tgetit.
{121519}{121560}lt was nothing,|absolutelynothing.
{121577}{121653}Camille dragged me into her room to show|off a Christmas gift from her mother.
{121680}{121753}- Even a knucklehead should be able to--|- She was high on a sugarrush...
{121755}{121794}from pumpkin pie.
{121813}{121870}This would look good on you.
{121872}{121926}Couldn'tkeep still.
{122154}{122200}Smile.
{122506}{122576}So Chantal overreacted?
{122651}{122710}Chantal never letyou|touch her after that?
{122755}{122878}You know, there are many things|that separate couples:
{122960}{123003}infidelity...
{123019}{123102}money, long illness.
{123163}{123274}I'm separated from mywife|by a hallway, a 60-foot hallway.
{123311}{123375}ln fact, it's a desert,|thathallway.
{123376}{123454}Andat the very end,|there's a door.
{123508}{123594}And when it's locked,|you can knock all you want...
{123610}{123656}but that door won'topen.
{123658}{123738}Why do you hold on?|Why not just get a divorce?
{123808}{123897}Just trade one nightmare|for another. Let's add it up:
{123899}{123968}half my money, the house.
{123970}{124070}I'd end up living|over somebody's reconverted garage.
{124096}{124178}Oh, yeah, and then there's half|my share ofthe law firm.
{124202}{124291}That's bullshit, Henry.|It's vanity, pure and simple.
{124292}{124364}Being with her|puts you on everybody's A-list.
{124366}{124410}You're Puerto Rico's glamour couple.
{124412}{124540}"Ah! Henry and Chantal Hearst!|They're so in love!"
{124542}{124648}-Just full ofcompliments, aren't we?|- That's whyyou stay married.
{124649}{124737}At our age, fi nding anotherwoman|like that's not so easy.
{124739}{124789}Not so easy|ifyou're taking them back...
{124791}{124903}to your third-floorwalk-up piece|ofshit $500-a-month studio apartment.
{124904}{125016}- Is that what you mean, Victor?|- Well, we can't all afford...
{125018}{125137}to wine and dine classy, sophisticated|ladies we meet in La Perla, can we?
{125139}{125243}Just who'd yourwife find you with|before she relocated in such a hurry?
{125344}{125399}Fuck you, Henry.
{125430}{125474}Whoops.
{125832}{125868}Tell me.
{125870}{125914}Sue Ellen Huddy.
{125940}{126013}Did you know her well|or just in passing?
{126031}{126088}Not well. Not at all.
{126090}{126209}It's impossible for a man my age|to know a 12-year-old really well.
{126211}{126288}To know a 12-year-old really well.
{126560}{126630}Bags. Throw me the bags.|Thanks.
{127425}{127483}The dark room.
{127528}{127622}There was no dog in there.|There was only you.
{127724}{127782}We don'thave any evidence|ofastruggle...
{127784}{127842}so it had to be somebody|very good with children...
{127858}{127902}or someone she knew.
{127972}{128024}Did you kick the ball around|with her, Henry?
{128108}{128154}Did you laugh and play|with her fi rst?
{128215}{128254}Or did you just take her?
{128789}{128853}Was it as exciting|as Paulina Valera?
{128884}{128955}- Tell me, Henry!|- Go to hell.
{129039}{129090}You dressed her again.
{129172}{129230}You posed her.
{129439}{129529}We'll find the brush, Henry.|We'll fi nd the brush you used.
{129558}{129636}We'll find the brush you used|to get her hair just right.
{129820}{129873}And then whatyou came for:
{129927}{129973}your trophy.
{130705}{130771}Youmet Chantal whenshe was 1 1.
{130773}{130840}Youmoldedapleasure model.
{130842}{130943}ls that whatyou think|childrenare for? Topleasureyou?
{131253}{131324}You peel my onion|down to the nub.
{131411}{131485}Are you trying to tell me|that you don't like them young?
{131577}{131694}You're twice divorced,|single with a vengeance.
{131696}{131778}Who do you talk to|in a martini bar?
{131780}{131867}The best-looking girl|you can get awaywith, that's who.
{131869}{131966}And she's not 50.|Probably mid-30s.
{131968}{132027}Of course, in their 20s-- Hey.
{132050}{132144}Now we're talking.|And how about teenage girls?
{132146}{132261}We loved them then.|Why should anything change now?
{132366}{132473}What does he possibly see|in a girl that young?
{132527}{132595}What in the world|do they talk about?
{132639}{132753}IfI want to discuss the S&P 500,|I'll call my broker.
{132838}{132947}Young girls don't talk.|They laugh.
{132949}{133015}They live.|They're in the moment.
{133040}{133104}And every night is the night.
{133106}{133228}And their bodies|are hard and tight...
{133230}{133272}and smooth...
{133302}{133360}the way skin is supposed to be.
{133468}{133514}And saying so...
{133560}{133613}doesn't make me a pervert.
{133843}{133895}Men can't say shit anymore.
{133920}{134045}We're all browbeaten by youth-obsessed|old bitches fresh from chemical peels.
{134047}{134104}Still want us to open their doors,|pay theirway.
{134179}{134264}Yes, Victor,|I loveyoung women.
{134315}{134386}At least I'm honest enough|to say so.
{134480}{134536}One-hundred|fucking percent guilty.
{134538}{134593}Owens. We found them, sir.
{134712}{134755}- She come backwith you?|- Yeah.
{134757}{134800}Put her in there.
{134802}{134843}All right.
{134927}{135018}All right, but only if you promise|to keep your mouth shut until I'm ready.
{135020}{135066}You're welcome.
{135247}{135293}You can sit right here.
{135390}{135444}Check the recorder.|There should be enough tape...
{135446}{135502}though I don't think|we'll need much more.
{135504}{135550}Have a seat, Henry.
{135788}{135827}She's in there watching?
{135932}{135980}What's he saying?
{136083}{136151}You're good|at hiding behind things.
{136206}{136260}Sitdown, Henry...
{136262}{136349}and tell us one more time about your|relationship with the second victim...
{136364}{136409}Sue Ellen Huddy.
{136573}{136639}Your relationship with|the murder victim, Sue Ellen Huddy--
{136640}{136727}the little girl you claim|you found by the jogging path.
{136847}{136897}She thinks that I did this.
{136920}{136970}I'll ask the question one more time.
{137038}{137168}What was your relationship|to the murdered girl, Sue Ellen Huddy?
{137365}{137412}There was none.
{137481}{137518}None?
{137553}{137600}No. None.
{137688}{137788}I saw her by the house|on occasion.
{137820}{137876}Shelivedin theneighborhood.
{137904}{137995}I might have spoke to her|once or twice...
{138056}{138100}ifever.
{138167}{138226}A greeting, per--
{138266}{138314}perhaps.
{138432}{138487}Here's what I believe,|Henry.
{138555}{138601}You're bored.
{138652}{138700}You're unhappy.
{138702}{138758}You have a history|with veryyoung girls.
{138788}{138856}You've been placed at the scene|ofthe fi rst murder.
{138873}{138973}Your attempt at an alibi|was to kill a second young girl.
{139090}{139148}You're in love with someone|who doesn't loveyou...
{139174}{139219}just whoyou were.
{139246}{139331}You're very, very lonely.
{139420}{139467}I'll tell you what I believe...
{139468}{139523}what I know...
{139548}{139614}what I have proof of.
{139730}{139788}Can you tell me who that is?
{140277}{140320}Sue Ellen.
{140450}{140498}A portrait like that|takes time, Henry.
{140768}{140837}And this little girl?
{140908}{140988}Chantal was nice enough|to bring these out ofyour darkroom.
{141288}{141344}You make lovely photographs,|Henry.
{141392}{141503}I can't believe that|she would go these lengths...
{141590}{141649}to make this kind of point.
{141755}{141831}It's almost farcical.
{141965}{142009}You killed Sue Ellen Huddy.
{142436}{142464}Yes.
{142826}{142872}And Paulina Valera?
{142971}{142993}Yes.
{143039}{143085}Both ofthem?
{143256}{143319}Yes, both ofthem.
{143364}{143411}Raped and murdered them.
{143450}{143503}I'm the one.
{143504}{143556}Are you prepared|to make a statement?
{143613}{143668}What else am I doing?
{143696}{143755}Well, let's--
{143756}{143875}Let's begin with the first victim,|little Paulina.
{144231}{144274}Takeyour time.
{144338}{144372}I...
{144492}{144562}saw her on the doorstep.
{144975}{145023}Go on, Henry.|I'll be right back.
{145274}{145332}You saw her on the doorstep.
{145414}{145478}I saw her|on the doorstep, and...
{145492}{145535}she was allalone.
{145537}{145594}- And she went off with you?|- All right. What is it?
{145630}{145716}- These were in his car.|- Youhadsex with her?
{145742}{145828}Yes. I raped her.
{145849}{145914}- And then?|- And then strangled her.
{145942}{145985}There in the dump?
{146044}{146109}- No. No, in the--|- Who is this?
{146111}{146158}- In an alley.|- We were too late.
{146196}{146257}- Which alley, exactly?|- But we got him, sir.
{146299}{146368}Park Central stakeout|caught him in the act.
{146370}{146451}- I don't know.|- He's downstairs.
{146452}{146518}They are processing him now.
{146520}{146589}So, afterwards...
{146591}{146649}you carried the body|to the dump?
{146651}{146726}Sir, it's over.
{146728}{146763}Yeah, I dragged it.
{146832}{146934}Her clothes.|You'd already put them back on?
{146958}{146998}I redressed her.
{147064}{147138}And you posed her?
{147210}{147266}Yes, I po--
{147317}{147424}Yes, I brushed her hair.
{147488}{147525}I took her--
{147568}{147637}I took her hands|and cupped them...
{147653}{147699}under her cheek.
{147744}{147797}I opened her eyes and--
{147856}{147894}and then...
{147920}{147968}I took her picture.
{148220}{148269}What are you doing?
{148312}{148357}You can go home, Henry.
{148391}{148429}What?
{148431}{148473}It's over.
{148547}{148600}They caught the killer.
{148920}{148967}What are you saying?
{148998}{149066}He's downstairs.
{149068}{149102}What?
All right, everybody! Who likes money?
I do, honey.
Good, then I need you to go down to the VFW and collect this much.
Those vets are three months behind on their propane bill.
[groaning]
The VFW? Those guys are war heroes.
Sending a Joe Jack to hit them up for money is, well, kind of an insult.
At least send an Enrique or a Roger Sack.
Hank, I am tired of talking about this.
You get me that money yourself!
The mother of my bastard is all over me for more child support.
Well, I understand.
I have a boy of my own.
(Cotton) A-N-Z-l-O.
-Anzio!
-You can't use that. I challenge.
What? Challenge? The Battle of Anzio.
Thirtieth day of January, 1944.
We caught the Krauts with their pants down... and their schnitzel exposed.
We'd taken the beach by noon, the town by nightfall.
I can still taste the Chianti out of that sigiora 's navel.
All right, it's a proper noun, but, damn it, I'll allow it!
God, she was a piece.
Triple word score. Forty-two points.
[clearing throat]
Hey, Dad?
To quote Mr. Strickland...
I don't mean to be a propane in the butt...
[tittering] but... you owe $416.29... on your propane bill.
I think I can get the $5 late fee waived.
I'm sorry, I must have dropped that money somewhere in the Philippines... fighting for your freedom, you damn draft-dodger!
You mean to tell me... that this bloodsucking ganef never served his country?
Four-F.
Got out on account of his narrow urethra!
[sighs]
The only uniform he ever wore was the Boy Scouts.
I made it to Eagle Scout.
And, Dad, you know the war was over.
Besides, I tried to enlist... but the Army felt I wouldn't be able to relieve myself efficiently under duress... especially in front of others.
[all guffawing]
-Look, I didn't come here to fight.
-Of course you didn't, you coward.
We ain't got your money.
Take a look around.
You see Fat Brooklyn, Cookie, or Tommy-Gun Scanlan?
-No.
-Dead!
All dead. And dead men don't pay no dues.
Now, get out of my sight!
Come back tomorrow.
We's having a fundraiser.
Let's do our shopping before the Salvation Army invades.
[giggling]
I should get a medal for wit.
And you know what I would call that medal?
I would call it the....
[chuckling]
I don't know.
Hey, there's my dad.
Get your war-hero memorabilia here!
All items must go!
Amuse your friends and thrill the ladies... with an authentic Nazi skull.
Priced to move.
Dad, are you selling your medals?
Yes, I am, you four-eyed Four-F-er.
I should charge you $1.25 just for looking at them.
But when I was kid, you wouldn't even let me polish them.
Well, it's sell the medals or lose the VFW.
We can't pay the rent no more.
Now, if you'll excuse me, there's a twig boy eyeing Hitler's canoe.
I'm prepared to offer $100 American for the canoe... and don't try to haggle with me.
I'm an attorney.
Boy, this ain't any canoe.
This is Hitler's canoe.
-Look.
I'm just buying it for a camping trip.
It's gonna cost me $40 just to paint over the swastika on the other side.
What? Paint over the swastika?
It's a war trophy.
You're painting over my victory.
The deal is off!
Well, too bad.
[exclaiming]
Fine! Sold!
Hank, do something useful for once in your life... and help me carry Hitler's canoe out to this patriot's car.
Boy, this fits my hand like a comfortable shoe.
Careful. That's an antique falconer's glove.
Belonged to Hermann Goering.
For you, $80.
Do you accept prepaid phone cards?
Aunt Peggy, I don't think this is right.
He's a very old man.
Luanne, this is for charity.
Oh, yeah.
-Yeah, it's the maroon Mitsubishi.
-Mitsubishi?
They made the planes that bombed Pearl Harbor!
-I ain't selling Hitler's canoe to no traitor.
-We had a verbal agreement.
You're a witness.
You don't deserve no Hitler's canoe.
Dad, calm down.
(Cotton) Don't tell me to calm down,
Boy Scout! I'm a war hero!
I killed 50 men!
Now, hop in your sushi boat and git!
Whoa, whoa!
All right! All right!
Listen up. If you're driving a Nazi car or an ltalian scooter... get your Axis-loving ass out of here!
[quavering]
-Let's go.
-But I paid for another throw.
[grunting]
-Where'd you get that bird?
-lnternet.
What's the hood for?
I think you take it off when you want him to do a trick.
-Make him do a trick.
-Okay.
-Falcon, do a loop-the-loop.
-Yeah!
-A barrel roll! Scratch that.
-Yeah.
A reverse barrel roll... then back to the glove.
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
[exclaims]
[falcon screeching]
[screaming]
Ta-da!
(Cotton) Seized by the sheriff.
We've been captured on our own soil.
Incoming.
I've got two platoons of propane right here... and reinforcements are on the way.
Hank, go away.
It's all over.
No, no.
I worked out an easy payment plan.
I've got pre-stamped envelopes.
You don't have to sell any more of your stuff.
We ain't selling it. It's being repoed.
Oh, Dad, I'm sorry.
Here's everything we got from the rummage sale.
Now, git. It's 4:00, time for Judge Judy,
(Hank) Shouldn't that TV be plugged in?
Dad, you guys deserve better than this.
You're damn straight, we do!
Bring us a heat lamp.
And some sandwiches.
I'm so goddang hungry.
[music playiig oi radio]
[singing]
[humming]
Hey, Peggy, guess what?
Welcome to the new VFW Headquarters,
Hank's wife.
[gasps]
Sorry, we broke your crapper.
[yawning] It is 2:00 a.m.
Now, I am as patriotic as the next person.
But if I am not at the top of my teaching game... it is the children who suffer.
They promised they'd go home as soon as the movie was over.
I can't go in there and just turn off the Duke.
[guifire oi TV]
[men snoring]
They looked like little angels sleeping there.
The smell was unimaginable.
Well, I'll shuttle them home in the morning.
I bet I could do it in four trips.
What they need is some new blood to join their organization.
Maybe they could merge with the Kiwanis.
Now, wait a minute. What about Vietnam?
Those guys always have some kind of float in the parade... and I heard the landlord is having a heck of a time... renting out the VFW building.
Maybe if the old vets could get the Vietnam guys to join up... they could get their post back.
Well, I know a Vietnam vet.
Dr. Sarti, my gynecologist.
They needed those guys over there?
Hank, I keep in touch with some of the guys from my unit... but none of us really have time to sit around rehashing war stories.
I've got a family and a very successful practice.
-I understand.
-I treat a lot of prominent women.
-Okay, then--
-Deputy Mayors and such.
Yeah. Thank you very much for your time.
Hey, you know, a patient of mine,
Karen Schwinn... chronic yeast infection.
Her husband runs a support group for vets.
He used to like to talk about the Nam.
I'll call you with his number.
-Thank you, Dr. Sarti.
-Wish I could be of more help.
[sighs]
Goodbye, Doctor. Sir.
Well, I've been doing a little research and I found out you need to train falcons.
Oh, that's probably why it attacked me.
He has completed my training course, as have I his.
Turns out falcons are hunting birds.
They catch mice, rats, moles, voles... and chipmunks.
What's a vole?
Don't know. Let's find out.
Falcon, bring us back a vole.
No.
[screaming]
[falcon screeching]
So, Bill's a vole.
I ran into a guy from my unit,
Skullcrusher.
He manages a shoe store.
[sighing]
-How come I can't get it together?
-It's not a race, man.
But as long as you keep taking your meds, you are moving forward.
[electronic beeping]
It's cool, it's cool. We're just out of time.
See you next week.
[men chattering]
Hi, I'm Hank Hill.
I talked to you on the phone.
Right. Dr. Sarti's friend.
What's on your mind?
Well, I wanted to talk to y'all about joining the VFW.
[men exclaiming]
We tried that already.
When me and TJ got home from the war, we went over to the Arlen VFW.
This short guy head-butted TJ right in the nads.
Yeah, that was probably my dad and he feels bad about that.
Yeah?
Yeah, sure.
You know, the World War ll vets are looking to reach out to you guys... but they feel guilty and, you know, that other stuff....
Well, you should get together and talk about it.
Look, they want you to come to a barbeque. Just hear them out.
We'll meet them. But no promises.
One more thing.
Do I need to bring a bathing suit?
Vietnam boys? No gat dang way!
The VFW stands for Veterans of Foreign
Wars not Reefer-Smoking Losers!
But they fought and died for their country just like you guys did.
Zip it, boy! I'm trying to watch my nudie channel. Now, get along.
What?
Well, now, where's my nudie channel?
Hold it.
I think this one's ready to take her top off.
That's Diane Sawyer, Dad.
She's not gonna take her top off, is she?
You know, if the Vietnam vets started paying dues...
I bet you could afford a whole bunch of nudie channels.
[groaning]
If any of these sissies whines about Agent Orange...
I'll split him butt to brow.
Look at those guys!
All over each other. Sickening.
Now, that's probably just part of the therapy.
That's, well.... Okay, that is a little creepy.
Hey, you found us.
No sweat. I did recon in Nam.
And we saw the balloons from the highway.
Well, greetings, fellow veterans.
I'm the CO here.
Colonel Cotton Hill, 77th Division,
US Army.
As I was just telling my boy here, we think you are all... worthy to join the VFW and start paying dues immediately.
Whoa.
Slow down, Colonel.
We're not sure we want to join.
The Arlen VFW has ignored us for 25 years.
Heck, the Vietcong invited us back before you did... and they gave us free mopeds for the week.
Look, I'm sorry.
I guess we weren't used to losing a war.
Well, excuse us for not just dropping a couple of atomic bombs.
Hey, fellas.
I know something we can all agree on.
Beer. What say we invade the cooler?
(all) Yeah.
(Ronnie) This one time my buddy, Lenny, was showing me a picture of his wife.
Wind comes up out of nowhere and blows the picture away.
Lenny goes chasing after it.
Sniper got him in the right temple.
My best friend got killed just because he missed his wife.
I spent four years away from my wife in dogfights... with Zeroes over the Pacific.
Those four years in my F6 Hellcat were the only peace and quiet I ever got!
[all guffawing]
-Anyone got a bottle opener?
-Yes, sir, Colonel, sir.
(Cotton) Hey, a bayonet.
Toss that over here.
Boy, this takes me back.
Topsy, remember that kamikaze you gutted back on lwo?
What did he say?
[both exclaiming]
[both grunting]
Stop it! Stop it!
You're freaking Ronnie out, man.
Maybe, you should ease up a little, Dad.
[exclaiming]
Colonel, these guys are trauma cases.
They've got delicate psyches.
Stop it! Stop it!
Oh, come on, boy! This bothers you?
How about this?
[grunting]
[gibbering]
Cut it out!
[screaming]
Easy there, big boy.
[groaning]
Come and get me, you cowards.
[grunting]
[panting]
(Hank) Oh, no.
Let's get that midget son of a bitch.
[all yelling]
Come on, people, remember your breathing exercises.
That big loony swung on me.
I was just defending myself.
But why did you push him?
I found those guys at a trauma ward.
Well, maybe we can go back when they've cooled down.
I'll get them drunk and we'll put things right.
Dad, listen to me.
They're gonna cut our heads off.
[men whooping]
They're getting close.
Quick, Dad, hop up on my back.
I ain't no papoose.
Well....
Look, on account of your combat experience... maybe you could see what's going on better from up there.
Not a terrible idea.
This will be my command post.
Over there!
(Cotton) Move it!
This is real bad, man.
You guys might have undone
30 years of therapy.
Dirty hippie.
You know, you could benefit from a little group therapy.
Clear up some of that anger.
I haven't slept in 50 years.
I'm so tired.
Come on, faster, mule! Faster!
[panting]
[Cotton grunting]
Hell, it'd be faster if I'd carried you on my shoulders.
Despite my expert navigation, you still managed to get us lost.
Nice job.
Hold on, Dad. I know the highway runs along the southern edge of the forest.
If we keep heading south, we can eventually find help.
Well, how we gonna find south?
You pack a compass in your Boy Scout purse?
Moss. Moss always grows on the north side of a tree.
All right, Dad, saddle up.
[men yelling]
Goddang, we're trapped like rats.
No, we're not. There's a beaver hole.
See the tracks?
Where there's a beaver hole, there's got to be a beaver dam.
Now, let's follow the current.
The dam's got to be downstream.
There it is.
[men yelling]
(Cotton) No, this ain't a flashback.
You're losing again!
[cheering]
If you're wondering where the falcon is,
I let him go in the woods.
Kept the glove, though.
Keeps my beer from cooling my hand... and keeps my hand from warming my beer.
It looks pretty bad-ass.
-Do you think I could wear--
-No.
Well, not to beat a dead horse, fellows... but what is your favorite kind of sausage?
Chicken and apple, breakfast patty...
Italian, spicy ltalian, sweet ltalian--
[screaming]
[falcon screeching]
He found his way home.
(Hank) We should head downhill.
There's more tree cover and we should be able to hit the highway.
You draft-dodging ninny!
The first rule of combat is to take the high ground.
Now uphill, boy. March! Schiell! Schiell!
[Hank panting]
Oh, hell. I pooped the bed.
[men chattering]
Dad, you wait here.
I'll try to find some footholds that will support both of us.
[gasping]
There's got to be a way out of here.
Boy... we're surrounded.
All right, get behind me.
I'll try to fight them off.
I've got a pretty thick neck.
Maybe while they're sawing through it, you can slip down the hill.
I ain't leaving.
They're gonna have to gut me, too.
I'm sorry, Dad. It was a bad idea to try to get everyone together.
-I guess, I just--
-No!
Dang it, Hank, don't apologize!
You did everything right.
I screwed up.
Sometimes you can do everything right and still lose.
It ain't your fault.
You gave it everything you had.
That's all I ever asked of my men.
Thanks for trying, soldier.
[men sobbing]
That's all we ever wanted to hear.
You did your best.
Thanks for trying.
Well, I gotta say I'm surprised you fellas are as good as you is.
Shoot, you captured Cotton Hill.
The whole Nazi army couldn't do that.
As commanding officer of the local VFW post...
I would be honored to have you fellas join our organization... on the one condition, that you stop all this goddang bawling.
We'll do our best, Colonel.
Oh, what are you smiling about?
You think you're getting your propane bill paid.
Well, you ain't.
You're in a long line, behind cable, hooch, and scooch.
-You ever get shot?
-I got a plate in my head.
No kidding? I got no shins.
[Bill screaming]
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!
You shall not pass!
No! No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No! Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural. None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?!
You never know.
Sam. My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here,
Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam...
...but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes. Lovely.
Lembas bread. And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food...
...but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves. The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before...
...haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us! Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears...
...to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on...
...on the precious.
Gollum. Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes...
...on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down! I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says. Yes!
No! We won't go back.
Not there. Not to him.
They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No. Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey! Come back now! Come back!
There! What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry? Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water. Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See? I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it? What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food. No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard...
...and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman...
...and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron...
...we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear...
...and the iron fists of the Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many!
They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Éothain! Éothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord...
...is ready to fall.
Théodred.
Find the king's son!
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Éomer, over here!
He's alive.
Théodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grima.
Grima.
Grima.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked. Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent...
...your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since
Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan...
...and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing. That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further...
...until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall...
...and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper...
...talk to each other...
...even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the Ring.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful...
...a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan...
...what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...
...if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Glóin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king...
...and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say...
...as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel! Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle...
...into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees. Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side...
...because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are...
...and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See? See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master. We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.
I found it. I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place. It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
We are famished! Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then. And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us...
...it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead. All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes. Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now! Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones...
...and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us. Not its business.
Gollum. Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead
When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Sméagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Sméagol.
Black Riders!
Hide! Hide!
Come on, Frodo. Come on!
Quick! They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them. No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory...
...and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
Something's out there.
What do you see?
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire...
...and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak...
...I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
U ntil at last I threw down my enemy...
...and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me...
...and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead...
...and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back...
...until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now...
...at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here...
...in this horrid, dark, dank, tree-infested...?
I mean, charming...
...quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones...
...that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
I n one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up...
...and find that they are strong.
- Strong?!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
I n fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
That is one of the Mearas...
...unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses...
...and has been my friend through many dangers.
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
U pon a summer's day
U pon your head
How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest...
...near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dûr, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Nûmenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet, Saruman, to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge...
...for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning...
...we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it...
...has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor...
...in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed...
...and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed? Good.
Yes, very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No! No, master!
They catch you! They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No! There's another way.
More secret. A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes. There's a path...
...and some stairs.
And then...
...a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then...
...you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
You just said something... Treeish.
No, I didn't. I was just stretching.
You're taller.
- Who?
- You!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
Merry, don't! Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back. Merry!
What's happening?!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
Help!
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die? No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan...
...whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman 's hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son...
...he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king...
...to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness...
...in the bitter watches of the night...
...when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring...
...still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late...
...Théoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you...
...Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour...
...in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Láthspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death...
...to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Théoden...
...son of Thengel...
...too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you...
...from the spell.
You have no power here...
...Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me...
...you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Éowyn.
Éowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better...
...if they grasped your sword.
I've only...
...ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord! No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmynë.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live...
...to see the last days of my house.
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Éomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Éomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me...
...but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked...
...Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king...
...the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end,
Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do. Leave him.
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
Your name is kingly.
I have heard of the magic of Elves...
...but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell...
...for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man...
...was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.
One of the Dûnedain Rangers,
I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings...
...a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable. He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep...
...the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him...
...what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating. You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine! My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked. Tricksy. False.
No. Not master.
Yes, precious. False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening. I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum. Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me. We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now...
...and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone! Gone! Gone!
Sméagol is free!
Look.
Look. See what Sméagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender. They are nice.
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will...
...behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters? Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw...
...and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Sméagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Wait! We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is...
...where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there...
...in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
Moving onto the Hollywood Freeway, we have a multiple vehicle...
multiple injury accident.
An absolute mess from VineStreet to the valley.
If you're in it, expect a long commute.
If you're not, seek alternate routes.
If Dan doesn 't want to do a daily rate, we can talk about a weekly rate.
But I'm tellin' you right now,
I'm not goin' below a million.
I mean, think about it.
I'm risking my reputation... as the host of this country's number-one... nationally syndicated talk show to do a cameo in some cheap slasher flick.
I mean, why can't these guys write me a fuckin' decent part?
You know?
I lived through the fuckin' thing.
By the way, did you talk to Cathy about that Navy SEAL script?
Hang on a sec.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Who's this?
- Who's this?
- Who are you calling?
- Oh. You know what?
- I'm sorry. I have the wrong number.
- That's okay.
Wait a minute. I know your voice.
You sound a lot like that guy on TV.
Um, Cotton Weary.
- I do, huh?
- Yeah.
I think he's got a really sexy voice.
- Well, thank you.
- Wait a minute.
You are Cotton, aren't you?
Oh, my God.
I am talking to Cotton Weary.
I can't believe this.
You got me. Look, I've...
I've got someone on the other line.
Can you hold on one second?
I'll be right back, I promise.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
Andrea, uh, I gotta call you back.
Someone's on the other line.
So, uh, you a big 100% Cotton fan?
- Yeah! One hundred and ten percent.
- That's very good.
So, um, why don't you tell me who you are?
Ooh! You're a naughty boy, Cotton.
Now, what would your girlfriend say?
What makes you think
I have a girlfriend?
I know you do.
- I'm right outside her bathroom door.
- Who is this?
She's in the shower.
She's got a nice little voice.
Let's come in for a closer look.
She's very pretty, Cotton.
A step up from
Maureen Prescott.
Speaking of which, let's play a little game.
Answer right, your girlfriend lives.
Answer wrong, she dies.
- Where's Maureen's daughter, Sidney?
- Who the fuck is this?
Somebody who'd kill to know where Sidney Prescott is!
One chance, Cotton!
You've got connections. Where is she?
You listen to me, you fuckin' psycho.
You lay a finger on Christine...
- and I swear to God I'll kill you.
- Wrong answer!
No! Wait!
Hello? Shit!
- Hey!
- Get outta the way!
- You just hit me!
- Move!
Christine, if you're there, pick up the phone!
Christine, pick up the phone!
Oh, shit!
You have reached 911.
Due to the volume of calls...
Someone pick up the goddam phone!
Move outta the way!
Shit! Shit!
Cotton, is that you?
Cotton?
Honey?
Okay, Cotton.
You know I don't like your Stab games.
- Who is it? Who's there?
- Christine?
Hon, you all right?
- I'm home.
- Jesus! You scared the shit outta me.
- You're not gonna believe what just happened to me.
- What are you talking about?
- Get the hell out of here!
- Okay. Okay, I'm sorry, babe.
I didn't mean to scare you that bad.
It's me. Come on, open the door.
- What are you doing?
- What?
- What the fuck are you doing?
I was... I was just, you know, trying to take the game to the next level.
- I'm sorry. Come on, open the door, Chris.
- The game?
- Yeah, the game!
- What are you talking about?
I'm talking about how much fun it's gonna be to rip your insides out!
Now, open the fuckin' door, Christine!
- Oh, my God!
- Now you're fuckin' history, baby!
Christine?
Hon?
The recent epidemic of roadrage in Los Angeles.
- Innocent commuters mercilessly terrorized, even killed...
- Chris?
- By these madmen of the freeway.
- Don't mess around, okay?
We're gonna make them confront their victims face-to-face, mano a mano...
right here on 100% Cotton.
There is carnage on our streets.
And remember, it could happen to you.
Tomorrow on 100% Cotton!
Roadrage.
L.A. drivers fight back.
The news is next on channel six with our exclusive entertainment report live...
from tonight's celebrity premiere in Hollywood...
followed by...
Oh, shit.
Chris?
Is that you, babe?
Chris, if you're in there, open the door. Okay, honey?
Chris? Come on, baby.
Open the door.
Chris! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Jesus!
- It's me, Chris. What are you doin'?
- Stay back.
Stay back.
- Chris, what's goin' on, babe?
- You've gone crazy. That's what!
- Chris, was somebody in the house?
- No! Get back!
Okay, okay, okay.
Just calm down, okay?
- Why do you want to kill me?
- What are you talking about?
- Why do you wanna kill me?
- Gimme the club. All right, honey?
Gimme the club.
Gimme the club, please.
Christine, get outta the way!
Behind you!
Shit!
It was a simple game, Cotton.
You should've told me where Sidney was.
Now, you lose.
Come on.
Come on, Cherokee.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, Cherokee.
California Women's Crisis Counseling.
Hey, it's Laura from Monterrey reporting to work. Can you patch me in?
- Sure. Thanks, Laura.
- Thank you.
California Women's Crisis Counseling.
How can I help you?
Hi. Um, do I have to say my name?
No, you don't have to say anything you don't want to say.
- How can I help?
- Um...
I'm 18 years old, and I have a boyfriend.
- Sometimes he hits me.
- It's okay.
- You can talk to me, all right?
- Thanks.
So, in closing, as the future journalists of America... there is one thing that you need to remember.
Being the best means being willing to do what the others would not.
Break the rules.
Stop at nothing.
Be willing to have the world hate you, because that is the only way... that you'll get the story, the facts and the fame.
Thank you.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Yes?
So you're saying that we should be ready to go out... and cut each other's throats because that's what you did.
- Metaphorically, yes.
- Well, tell me, Miss Weathers.
- Was it worth it?
- I'm so sorry. We're out of time.
Gale Weathers, anchor woman for
Total Entertainment.
Thank you very much!
There is a young man outside who wants to see you.
- He says he's with the police.
- The police?
- Detective Mark Kincaid, L.A.P.D.
- Hello.
- That's quite an impressive resume.
- Thank you.
I assume you're not here for an autograph.
I'm here because
Cotton Weary's been murdered.
- Someone killed Cotton?
- And his girlfriend.
Someone who left something he wanted us to see.
I'll show you this because you're the Woodsboro authority and because you knew him.
But I promise you, if you share this with the world, it's you I'll be arresting.
I swear on my Pulitzer Prize, which
I plan to win one day, Detective.
This was left on Cotton Weary's body.
You have any idea who the girl might be?
Oh, my God.
This is Maureen Prescott.
This is Sidney Prescott's mother.
Hollywood is reeling today from news...
of the murder of controversial talkshow host Cotton Weary.
Weary had only recently finished shooting a cameo as himself...
in the film
Stab 3, Return to Woodsboro...
the third and final part of the famous horror series...
based on the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders.
Before his rise to television fame,
Cotton had been imprisoned...
and was later exonerated for the murder of Maureen Prescott, his former lover...
Just yesterday, Cotton Weary was shooting here at Sunrise Studios...
his first cameo in a feature film, Stab 3.
Security here is tight, but we'll see if we can get a statement. Excuse me.
Always a controversial man...
Channel Eight news.
We gotta get in. We gotta get in.
No press beyond this point.
Alone at night he crosses flames
Ashe makes a fist with his red right hand
Look, you're worried about the movie, then protect the movie, okay?
Hire more security. Hire the National
Guard. Just don't kill the movie.
Violence in cinema is a big deal right now, Roman.
This is not the kind of news this studio is after.
So if we stop making scary movies, what?
All the psychos in the world will retire? Come on.
I've been makin' horror movies for
30 years, never had a psycho problem.
He was your goddamn idea, guys.
All right?
An ex-con with a trashy talk show?
He must've pissed people off every day.
Detectives, there's no reason to presume that Cotton's death... had anything to do with this movie, is there?
He was making a movie called Stab.
He was stabbed.
Probably some psycho fan pissed off they killed Randy in Stab 2.
Well, Tyson, that'd make you next, wouldn't it?
I am not a Randy substitute.
I'm my own character.
Named Ricky, who works at the video store.
It's an homage.
Hey! What if the killer's
Sidney Prescott?
I mean, what the hell ever happened to her? She's probably off in the woods... livin' like the fuckin' Unabomber, man.
I'm starting to see why
Tori Spelling and David Schwimmer didn't want to come back.
Guys, this was about Cotton.
We are not in any danger.
"We are not in any danger," says Candy, page 15.
I don't see you leavin'.
You think serious black actors my age can just throw away jobs?
It's all a business now. They got
Usher doing Pinter off-Broadway.
L.L. Cool J's
Shakespearin' in the park.
- Yeah!
- Maybe it's not meant to be.
Not meant to be? You win that talent search for the new Sidney.
50,000 girls and they pick you. You gotta be praying this movie keeps going.
Of course I am, but not at the expense of people's lives.
Oh. Cue the violins, right?
Jesus.
Deja voodoo.
We need this area cleared, please.
Clear it.
- Gale Weathers! Oh, my God!
- Shit.
L... Listen, l-l... I know we've never met... and I don't mind you never returning my calls, but I have to tell you... after two films,
I feel like I am in your mind.
Well, that would explain my constant headaches.
You know, I'm sorry things didn't work out on 60 Minutes II.
- But Total Entertainment, that's a pretty good fallback.
- Thank you.
I'm sorry that things didn't work out with Brad Pitt... but being single, that's a pretty good fallback.
Gives me more time for my work.
After all, Gale Weathers, you're such a complex character.
Oh, and to be played by an actress with such depth and range.
Uh, Jennifer,
Nick said you wanted to...
Gale.
Dewey.
Well, surprise, surprise.
Someone dies and Gale comes running.
Gale, I think you'll really appreciate my character work in this one.
- Someone's helped me understand the real you.
- Someone?
Your ruthless ambition, your private self-loathing... and that lost and lonely little girl inside.
Lost and lonely what?
You heard me.
Thanks, Dewey, I'll return it.
Lost and lonely what?
- Little girl inside.
- I thought you were supposed to be in Woodsboro.
Well, I'm surprised you thought about me at all.
Listen, I gotta get back to work.
I really don't have time for this.
- Wait a minute. You work here?
- Yeah.
The movie needed a technical advisor.
Someone who went through the real experience, knew the real people.
- Hey, Dewey.
- Hey, Tom.
Hey! It's the real Gale Weathers.
Real from top to bottom.
Tom Prinze.
Watch your show all the time.
You're so right. Pop culture is the politics ofthe 21 st century.
- Thank you.
- And that story that you did... last month on me crashing my car?
- Wow, was that ever powerful journalism.
- Right, uh...
I especially liked the way you implied that it was caused by drinking and drugs.
And that the tyre blowout was faked.
That was great.
Tom, sometimes in journalism you have to...
Are you parked in the lot?
'Cause I should check to make sure... that nobody's messed with your brake line.
Who's he supposed to be?
He's playing you? Him?
What?
I did not come here to fight with you, Dewey.
- Cotton's killer left a picture.
- Of Sid's mom.
- The detectives told me.
- Well, does Sidney know about it?
Listen, Sidney doesn't need you and your camera in her life.
Do you see a camera?
Right. You bought me this purse, didn't you?
- Yeah.
- Look, it's-it's a habit.
- I-I walk outta the house, I turn it on.
- What the hell is this?
- It's like perfume.
- Gale Weathers?
- Could I be more popular?
- No press.
Mo press on set.
Get that woman outta here.
- Yes, Mr Milton. Let's go.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Where is Detective Kincaid?
- I am working with Kincaid, Dewey.
- Come on. Move along, miss. Let's go.
Rules are rules, Gale.
But, really, it was great seeing you.
Stab 3 is a closed set. But just up ahead is the old Seinfeld stage.
Now, does anybody need a potty break?
- Oh, I do.
- Yeah, me too.
Okay, let go!
Thanks for your help, boys.
Holy shit, Silent Bob. It's that
TV news chick, Connie-fuckin'-Chung!
Hey, Connie, how's Maury?
Dude, I think she likes me.
See how she's lookin' at me?
It's happening again.
Cotton had a lot of enemies, Sid.
The police aren't saying it's related to us.
Do you ever think about her?
Your mom?
None of this would've ever happened if she hadn't... if she hadn't...
Why'd she have so many secrets, Dad?
Listen, maybe it's time you came home.
I'm worried about you, kid. Out here by yourself. You never see anyone.
The only people you talk to don't even know your real name.
It's as if you don't exist.
That's the idea. Psychos can't kill what they can't find.
Sid, come here.
Mother needs to talk to you.
Everything you touch, Sid, dies!
You're poison.
You're just like me.
You're just like me.
Oh, my God!
What have they done to me?
They'll do it to you.
- They'll do it to you, baby.
- Mom?
Roman?
Stab 3.
Jesus, I gotta get a new agent.
Roman?
Someone here?
Stan, my man.
He does good work, huh?
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Fuck you very much.
- Tyson, go to hell.
- Well, excuse us, Sarah. Makeup tests.
Yeah, makeup. You can use it.
Damn it, have you seen Roman?
Look, everyone in the office has gone home already.
- He said it was important.
- Everything's important to Roman.
Oh, shit!
- Director's office.
- Sarah, it's Roman.
I'm sorry I'm running late. I'm still on the 405. I'm about ten minutes away.
Oh, it's no problem. I'm just lookin' at your music video awards.
Since I got you on thephone, let's... let's talk about your character, okay?
What character? I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.
- I'm only in two scenes.
- You're not happy with your part.
I'm not happy that I am
35 playing a 21-year-old.
I'm not happy that I have to die naked.
And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid to have a gun in the house... after her boyfriend's been cut into fish sticks.
Great, okay.
So let's... let's run the lines.
Fine.
Page28.
Candy's big moment.
Page 28.
Ring-ring.
Hello?
- Hello?
- Who's this?
- Who's this?
- This is Candy.
Hang on.
Let me get some clothes.
See? I don't understand why I have to start the scene in the shower.
The whole shower thing's been done.
Vertigo. Hello?
And I mean, my boyfriend just died.
Why am I showering?
Why don't we just read the scene?
Candy. Nice name. Is that like
Candy Cane or Candy Apple?
Whatever.
Come on.
Who is this?
I think you have the wrong number.
- But you know my favourite name?
- I'm hanging up right now.
It's Sarah.
Roman, that's not the line.
It is in my script.
Has there been another goddam rewrite?
How the fuck... are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
It's not just a new script.
It's a new movie.
- What? What movie?
- My movie.
And it's called Sarah Gets
Skewered Like a Fuckin' Pig!
Still in character, Sarah?
Shit.
Thank you for calling
Sunrise Picture Studios.
If you'd like today's commissary menu, press one.
Mr Bridger?
If you'd like to hear previews of upcoming Sunrise Pictures'releases...
press four.
If you'd like information about
Sunrise Pictures' merchandise...
- Come on. Come on.
- Press five.
If you're trying to reach Lot Security or you have an emergency, press six.
Shit!
Oh! Fuck!
Look, I wanna get something straight.
I only got into this because the police asked for my help.
- Why would the police come to you?
- Well, I did write... the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.
I'm sure you just can't wait to write another one.
- What about you?
- What about me?
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro.
"It's the only place that's real."
But now you're here.
Not with me.
Dewey, I took care ofyou.
I waited until you were well, but I couldn't stay there.
It was like dog years. One year in
Woodsboro is like seven anywhere else.
So it's off to Paris for a week?
New York for a month? L.A. forever?
It was fucking 60 Minutes II.
- I couldn't say no. I could've been the next Diane Sawyer.
- Wait a minute.
What's wrong with just being
Gale Weathers? I liked her.
It didn't work, Dewey.
We tried. We're different.
You used to say that was our strength.
- Well...
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second-rate K-Mart... straight-to-video version of me, are you?
Brace yourself, Gale.
All of this is actually not about you.
All of what, Dewey?
You do know something, don't you?
- Off the record?
- Always.
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman... who said she was with Stab 3.
She wanted to see the file on Sid, "for research."
- And?
- The boys said no.
And she wouldn't give her name.
A month later, the station gets broken into.
- The file room gets ransacked.
- And someone stole Sid's file?
I already removed it.
I think someone on the film is tryin' to find Sid.
- I'm sorry, this is incredible.
- I said, "off the record."
Right.
It's Jennifer.
She needs me.
- Jennifer?
- Gotta run.
- Wait! Dewey, where are you going?
- I'm on duty.
Stop following me.
I happen to be working for the police, damn it!
- You're not a detective, Gale.
- Neither are you, Mr Incognito.
- Uh, you left your motor running.
- Damn it.
Fans, I can handle. Fans, they want a picture, they want a conversation.
I can handle fans!
You see this, Dewey?
I haven't had one ofthese in a year and a half. Someone's gonna pay for this.
- Jennifer, settle down. What happened?
- I'm with him.
- You.
Like I'm ever going to win an award playing you.
- There's been a second murder.
- Who?
- Sarah Darling.
- Where?
- At the studio.
- Where? Nancy Drew wants to know where.
Cotton Weary. Sarah Darling.
Don't you get it?
Someone's killing them in the order they die in the movie.
- Dewey, who gets killed third?
- Who gets killed third?
You do.
I get killed in Stab 3?
I get killed?
- Yeah.
- Dewey, where are you going?
I have to get something from my trailer.
Your...
You live here with her?
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God!
I needed a place to stay, and she said she liked having me around.
- Why?
- She says I make her feel safe.
- She says I'm her rock.
- Her rock?
Yeah. If you weren't so concerned with pretensions and appearances... you'd be able to appreciate the positivity and emotional centeredness...
I provide a woman.
Stone, I'm headed to the crime scene.
You stay by Jennifer's side.
I suggest a search of the grounds.
Hey, Dewdrop.
Can I have a word?
Just so it can be straight. I'm the professional celebrity guard here.
My resume lists Julia Roberts,
Salmon Rushdie, Posh Spice.
You are the Hollywood hanger-oner.
'Cause you're just no good as a cop any more.
Your resume reads like the obituaries.
So how about you take suggestions from me? All right?
Whatever you say.
Hmm. Same deal?
Found with the body?
- Yeah, Maureen Prescott again.
- This is great.
Ten more murders and we can publish a calendar.
The old "killer playing with the cops" routine.
Very Hannibal Lecter.
Very Seven.
Doesn't the killer come after the cops in those movies?
Usually one cop makes it.
- And?
- One cop doesn't.
- Usually.
- Detective Kincaid.
- What do we know? Same killer?
- Hey, hey.
Terminal Entertainment, this is a crime scene, okay?
Wallace, Miss Weathers is working with me now.
- Thank you, Detective.
- You're welcome.
Well, in that case, I'm gonna go dust for fingerprints with Jane Pauley.
Uh, photos, Wallace, please?
Thank you.
New pictures, same person.
Anything turn up on your research yet?
- Nothing that will help with these.
- What about an increased police presence around Jennifer?
- She's the next one to get killed in the script.
- She has a bodyguard.
And besides, the producers told us that there were three different versions of the script.
Something about trying to keep the ending off the Internet.
You should know that.
You're the technical advisor, right?
Three versions.
Three different characters die next.
And we don't know which one the killer read.
Hey, hold up.
All I ever wanted to do was make a real classic lovestory.
And the studio said they'd let me.
I just had to do a scary movie for them first.
And now we're shut down, and I am fucked!
God, it's not the end of the world, Roman.
That is so easy for you to say. You can always go back to, to MustSee TV.
You know, I have no movie,
I'm about to turn 30, and it looks like I'm now the next target.
- What?
- You? Why you?
Do you think this wasn't a message?
- Roman Bridger?
- What?
Mr Bridger, you didn't tell us... you spoke with Sarah Darling before she was murdered.
Uh, spoke with her, uh, when?
The guard said she was here for a meeting with you.
- What meeting? I don't...
- We talked with her roommate too.
Says you called Sarah, told her to come down to the studio.
- Roommate answered the phone.
Says it was you.
- Wait a minute. No, no.
I-I never called her.
I never told her to go anywhere.
Roommate says she knows your voice, Mr Bridger.
Well, she wasn't speaking with me! God!
Look, I did not call Sarah Darling.
- Sarah Darling said you did.
- Someone's trying to ruin my movie.
Someone wants to kill my movie!
All right, we'll talk about your movie down at the station.
- All right.
- This is the scene where you come with us.
Dewey, Jennifer...
Wait a minute.
She wasn't talking with me on the phone. I'm coming!
I'll call him in. Battery. Mr Riley, do you have a cell phone I can borrow?
Yeah.
- Thank you.
- God. Roman.
Remind me not to sleep with him again.
Come here, Cherokee.
California Women's Crisis Counseling.
My name is Laura. How can I help you?
Oh, Laura.
I do have a crisis.
Okay, well, whatever it is, you can tell me.
Oh, my God.
I've killed someone, Laura.
- Are you sure?
- Uh-huh, I'm sure.
I killed someone, I know it!
Oh, my God.
- Well, then, um...
- I did.
Then the people you need to call are the police.
No, I need to call you!
Just you.
I'm sorry, your-your voice...
Don't you wanna know how you can help, Laura?
Are you listening to me?
Huh?
- Who is this?
- It's Mother, Laura.
Now, be a good girl and turn on the news.
Do as Mother tells you!
You're not my mother. How did you get this number? Who is this?
You know your mother's voice when you hear it!
Now, turn on the news!
And with a second cast member murdered, Stab 3...
has been officially shut down, prompting those involved...
to hope and pray that these killings maybe over.
Just one question.
Do you think it's over, Sidney?
Do you?
The sky was dark this morning
Not a bird in a tree
Is this a wrap party or is this a wrap party?
Scene 34.
"Maureen's Murder Flashback."
- I never liked that scene.
- That's 'cause you weren't in it.
Scenes 40 through 47.
- "The Prescott House Flashbacks."
- Tom, stop it.
You're scaring me.
Two people are dead.
Scaring you?
Give the sweet, young ingenue act a rest.
- You're drunk.
- I'm coping.
I bet she fought and clawed for that Sidney part.
I bet she stepped on any poor girl that got in her way.
- So you asked her out and she said no?
- That has nothing to do with it.
Right.
Come on, Dewey.
Scene 50.
"Dewey Saves the Day."
She's so focused on success that she never thinks... about who she's hurting to get it.
And you saved her life, like, how many times?
Gale wants the whole world to love her.
One person's never enough.
She's a dreamer.
- No, she's a narcissistic, psycho bitch.
- No, she's not.
She's got a good heart.
She does.
She just hides it away because she thinks people see that as weak.
This is a good picture of you.
You look just like her.
God, Dewey.
You make it sound like you're still in love with her.
And I left out the part that she's cruel... and selfish, obsessive and annoying.
We have one Gale Weathers here.
We don't need two.
Hey, Dewdrop, got your girlfriend out here.
Look who I found slinkin' around the yard. The nightly news.
I wasn't slinking.
I was walking.
You were eaves dropping at the bedroom window.
Yeah, a bedroom that you seemed awfully at home in.
All right, let's talk.
Come on.
- What's this about, Gale?
- Did you know they released Roman?
Sarah's call didn't come from his cell phone.
- Where did it come from then?
- A cloned cell phone. It's untraceable.
Well, thanks for the update, Gale.
Why don't you just go back home?
Dewey, wait a minute.
Just wait one second.
How old do you think
Maureen Prescott is in this picture?
- Nineteen, twenty.
- That's what I thought, so I checked it out.
I cannot find any information about her at this age. I mean, nothing.
She lived in Woodsboro her whole life.
Someone there must know something.
Almost her whole life.
Two years before... she met Sidney's father, she left Woodsboro.
No one has any idea where she went or what she did.
I mean, it's-it's like she fell into a black hole, Dewey! She vanished!
- So?
- So?
Why is the killer leaving pictures of-of Maureen?
And why these pictures at-at... at that point in her life?
I don't know! If I thought like a homicidal maniac... then I'd know how a homicidal maniac thinks.
What?
- Jennifer.
- Jennifer?
Look at the buildings.
The second story. There and there.
It's the same!
It's the same street 28 years ago.
Oh, my God. Maureen Prescott was at the back lot at Sunrise Studios!
- Oh, my God.
- I gotta make some calls.
Steven Stone
Protection Services.
Stone, where are you?
I'm just checking your tin can, Dewdrop.
Well, come back inside and stay with Jennifer.
Something's happened.
I have to go to the police.
Is that an order, Dewdrop? 'Cause
Steven Stone doesn't work for you.
Get back in the house, Stone.
Would I call you if it wasn 't important?
- What are you doing in there anyway?
- Me?
I'm just checking to make sure there's no killer in here... waitin' to off you like he did your little sister.
What did you say?
I can't believe you said that.
That makes me... angry!
Fucker!
Gotta call Kincaid.
Dewey, where is everybody?
- Oh, God.
- Jennifer?
Angelina?
Tom?
Oh, my God!
What happened?
Don't do that.
I'm overreacting.
Dewdrop?
- Stone?
- Oh, my God!
Oh, God, Stone!
Oh, God!
- Dewey, is he dead?
- Yeah.
Everyone back inside!
It's all right.
Don't panic.
Okay, outside. Everyone, stay together and try to remain calm.
A phone!
- It's not mine.
- It's not mine.
Shit!
It's the fax.
"Interior, Jennifer's house. Living room, night." It's a script page.
- W-W-What's it say?
- "With the bodyguard stabbed to death, the five stand trapped.
- He's rewriting the movie.
- As the killer waits outside... suddenly the fax machine sends news of their fates."
It's a trick!
Everybody, outside!
- Outside where he can pick us off one by one?
- Shut up!
"The killer prepares to grant mercy to only one of them."
Don't you get it? The killer says he's outside because he wants us here inside.
- Which one is it?
- Come on!
"Who will survive? Is it Jennifer?
Tom? Angelina? Dewey? Gale?
- The killer will give mercy to..."
- Everyone outside!
He grants mercy to who?
I wanna know what happens!
- I wanna know what happens!
- Wait for the fucking movie!
- I've gotta know! I'm goin' back in!
- No.
All right, everyone, back.
Stay together.
- What's it say?
- "And the... killer will give mercy to...
- whoever..."
- Whoever?
Whoever?
Piece of shit.
"Whoever...
Whoever smells the..."
I can't stop rolling down the hill!
Gale! Jennifer!
- Dewey!
- Dewey!
Dewey, where are you?
Over here, Dewey!
- Dewey!
- Gale!
Gale, behind you!
Dewey!
Are you all right?
Yeah, never been better.
Yeah, I'm all right.
Where'd he go?
- He must've rolled under the car.
- All right, stay close.
Is he back there?
- No.
- No?
He's fast.
Could've sworn I hit him.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
Thanks for saving me.
Ah, it's habit.
Oh, God.
What the fuck happened to you?
- Jennifer, wait a minute.
- Who gave you a place to stay?
- Who are you supposed to be protecting?
- Jennifer!
Hey!
My lawyer liked that.
Not as much as I did.
- Angelina?
- Tom was in the house.
- How'd you end up way over there?
- Oh, my God! Tom was in the house!
- Are we safe?
- Safe from who?
Wait a second!
Another picture.
Whoever it is is now taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.
But we know who killed Maureen
Prescott. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.
- I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it.
- Yeah, but if I'm not mistaken... you said in your book that
Sidney got it wrong once before.
She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother.
And he was sent away for it.
Maybe there is a third killer.
Sidney might know something.
I told you.
I don't know where Sidney is.
And even if there was a third killer,
Sidney doesn't know about it.
That is for me to decide.
I need to talk to her, Mr. Riley.
She is a key element in this case.
I have a press conference in an hour.
I need to explain... why there are three dead celebrities and a bodyguard.
And a very angry mayor.
Okay, look, we all know this has something to do with Stab 3.
But what we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving pictures... of Maureen Prescott taken over 25 years ago.
And the photographs taken at the same studio Stab 3 is shooting out of.
What does this have to do with Sid?
Who knows more about Maureen
Prescott than her own daughter?
Well, Sid's dad couldn't help you, and he was married to Maureen.
What's your problem?
Last night you were almost charcoal.
You gonna help us or what?
Do you wanna have this conversation with a polygraph?
- Is that a threat, Detective?
- When it's a threat, you'll know it.
- Was that a threat?
- Boys, boys.
Why don't we compare our gun calibres later?
- The issue is Maureen Prescott.
- Wrong. The issue is Sidney Prescott.
And either Mr Riley is going to obstruct justice or he's going to put me in touch with her.
So, where is she?
Hi, you've reached the machine.
You can leave a message.
Talk as long as you want.
Sid, it's me.
This is the fifth time I've called.
Please pick up.
I wanna make sure you're... okay.
- Sid!
- Dewey!
What are you doing down here?
Actually, what was I doing up there?
- Jesus, Dewey. Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah, I'm all right.
- Is she all right?
- Hey, you know Gale.
It'd take a direct hit.
So the news said this was the precinct.
Who's this guy Kincaid?
Come here.
I told you to stay hidden.
- It's not safe for you to be here.
- The killer called me.
- What?
- Yeah, he found me.
I'm no more safe there than I am here, and at least here I'm not alone.
Okay, come on.
- Detective Kincaid?
- Yeah.
There's someone here who wants to help.
Oh, my God.
Sidney.
Is the man fast or what?
- Hi.
- Hi, Gale.
- I'm glad you're all right.
- Thank you.
- Sid, this is Detective Kincaid.
- Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.
- The killer called her.
- What? When?
- What did he say?
- Oh, you know, the usual small talk.
What's new? How you been?
How do you wanna die?
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
He could have monitored her calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
- No.
- Do you have her number stored in your memory?
- Phone memory!
- Oh. Yeah, guess I do.
- Has anyone else ever used your phone?
- Just Jennifer.
And you.
Hey, I'm the cop here.
You're in my office, Riley.
The killer leaves a photograph after each murder, Sidney.
They were taken in Hollywood at the same studio that they're shooting Stab 3.
Why didn't you tell me?
This is my mother, Dewey.
- Why didn't you say something?
- I was afraid they were bait.
Something to, you know, trick you out of hiding.
Sidney, was she an actress or a model?
Because they look a lot like publicity stills.
I, uh, don't know.
Detective, I wanna see this place in the pictures.
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.
- Slow it down.
- Sorry.
Watch the fuckin' aliens.
I'm gonna go talk to the studio brass about those photos.
Yeah, right.
I know where you're goin'.
- Yeah, keep an eye on Sidney.
- I know where you're goin'.
You're gonna get her some flowers and candy, huh? Huh?
- Gimme a break.
- Yeah, gimme a call.
Just keep your eye on her.
That stairwell over there, that's where one of the pictures was taken.
God. I can't believe she never mentioned any of this.
- She probably just...
- Dewey!
- Sorry.
- Martha!
- Oh, my God, Sid.
- Hey, hold it right there! Hey!
- Don't shoot!
- I'm only 17.
- It's okay. We know her.
We do?
Tell me that's his ex-girlfriend,
I'll shoot myself.
- It's Martha Meeks, Randy's sister.
- Randy's sister?
- Yeah, can't you tell?
- We miss you in Woodsboro, guys.
- Martha, what are you doing here?
- There's something you guys should see.
Told ya I'd make a movie someday. Huh?
- Oh, my God.
- Well, if you're watching this tape...
it means, as I feared, I did not survive these killings...
here at Windsor College, and that giving up my virginity...
to Karen Kolchakat the video store was probably not a good idea.
- Karen Kolchak?
- Yes, Karen Kolchak.
- "Creepy Karen"?
- Shut up! She's a sweet person, okay?
We were workin'late. We were puttin' away some videos in the porno section...
and, you know, shit happens.
- Open the door, Randy!
- Fifteen minutes.
- It's my room too!
- Paul,15 minutes.
I'm leaving my legacy.
Fifteen minutes, Paul!
Damn! Anyway...
the reason I'm here is to help you so that my death will not be in vain.
That my life's work will help save some other poor soul from getting mutilated.
If this killer does come back and he's for real...
there are a few things that you gotta remember.
Is this simply another sequel?
Well, if it is, same rules apply.
But here's the critical thing.
If you find yourself dealing...
with an unexpected back-story and ap reponderance...
of exposition, then the sequel rules do not apply.
Because you're not dealing with the sequel. You are dealing with...
the concluding chapter of a trilogy.
- Trilogy.
- That's right. It's a rarity in the horror field...
but it does exist, and it is a force to be reckoned with.
Because true trilogies are all about going back to the beginning...
and discovering something that wasn 't true from the get-go.
Godfather, Jedi, all revealed something...
that we thought was true that wasn 't true.
So if it is a trilogy you are dealing with...
here are some super trilogy rules.
One: You've got a killer who's gonna be superhuman.
Stabbing him won't work.
Shooting him won't work.
Basically, in the third one, you've gotta cryogenically freeze his head...
decapitate him or blowhim up.
Number two: Anyone, including the main character, can die.
This means you, Sid.
I'm sorry. It's the final chapter.
It could be fuckin' Reservoir Dogs by the time this thing is through.
Number three: The past will come back to bite you in the ass.
Whatever you think you know about the past, forget it.
The past is not at rest!
Any sins you think...
were committed in the past are about to break out and destroy you.
So in closing, let me say...
goodluck, Godspeed...
and for some of you,
I'll see you soon.
'Cause the rules say some of you ain't gonna make it. I didn't.
Not if you're watching this tape.
Thank you. And you be careful.
Say hi to your folks for me.
You be careful too, Sid.
- Bye, Dewey. Come visit us soon.
- I will, Martha.
- Thank you.
- Bye.
I've got an idea.
I'll hook up with you guys later.
- Do you want us to come with you?
- I work better alone.
Why don't you try to figure out where those other pictures were taken.
- I can see nothing's changed.
- No.
Oh, shit.
Hello!
- Jeez.
- What the hell are you doing?
Being Gale Weathers.
What the hell are you doing?
- I am Gale Weathers.
- Here's how I see it.
I've got no house, no bodyguard, no movie, and I'm being stalked.
Because someone wants to kill me?
No, because someone wants to kill you.
So now, starting now,
I go where you go.
That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you.
And since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.
- Make sense?
- None.
You know, in the movies,
I play you as being much smarter.
And as a sane person.
For you, that must be quite a stretch.
- That's funny.
- Ha!
- Need to get in that building?
- Yeah.
- Is there a story in that building?
- Maybe.
Gale Weathers would find a way.
Bitch. All right, wait. Just...
Don't tell me what to do.
Basements, wow.
Basements creep me out.
You'd make a fascinating interview.
Hello?
Hi. Excuse me.
I am Gale Weathers... and I'm here researching with the police this photo.
It was taken at the studio.
Her name is Maureen Prescott.
Back then it was probably Roberts.
- Hey, are you...
- No.
- But you look just...
- Like her?
- I've been hearing it all my life.
- It's uncanny.
I was up for Princess Leia.
I was this close.
So, who gets it?
The one who sleeps with George Lucas.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring up a-a sore subject for you.
Sure, you didn't.
None of them did.
So, how can I help you? Or do you want me to tell you who you look like?
How about some information on Maureen Roberts?
I don't work for the cops, sweetie.
I work for the studio.
Really? Well, would you work for... the president?
The president of the studio.
Fifty dollars? Who are you?
A reporter for Woodsboro High?
It's worth two grand.
Are you gonna help
Gale Weathers or not?
I know every face in here.
I got a respect for the unknown actor.
If they're looking for Maureen Roberts, they're never gonna find her.
Rina Reynolds they will.
Rina Reynolds.
Stage name.
You should talk, Judy Jurgenstern.
What are these movies?
Amazombies, Space Psycho...
Creatures from the San Andreas Fault.
Horror pictures back in Milton's heyday.
- Back in what?
- Back in what?
- John Milton.
The horror producer?
Those were his movies.
Come on, Sid.
Oh, my God!
Sidney Prescott!
Oh, my God! I'm Angelina Tyler.
I'm you! I mean, I'm not.
I mean, I was.
I-I thought... Well, if there's no movie... then no one would care if I took some souvenirs.
Souvenirs?
I may never win another role, so these may be... my only memories, you know, of Hollywood.
I-I know it's weird 'cause it's your life and all, but...
I wanted to make you proud, Sidney.
Oh. Well,
I'm sure I would've been.
The real Sidney.
The real person.
I wish...
I wish it would've worked out.
Hey...
Angelina?
Hello?
Close call.
What are you doing here?
It occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.
See what you do to me?
What have I done to you?
About the, uh, sex stuff?
You know, I'm not trying to rush you at all.
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?
Dewey!
Dewey!
Sidney, I'm in here.
Over here.
Yes. Mother will protect you from the bogeyman.
Come into the bedroom.
Hide in Mommy's bed.
I lied, Sidney.
I can't protect you at all.
You don't deserve to be protected!
You didn't protect me!
We did your mom a favour, Sid.
That woman was a slutbag whore...
who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone.
'Cause let's face it, Sidney, your mother was no Sharon Stone.
- Sidney's mother was fucking my father.
- Sid, where are you?
Dewey!
Dewey, help me!
Sidney? Give Mommy a kiss and we'll make up.
- No!
- Sidney!
Sid!
Sid, are you okay?
What happened?
The killer's in the house, Dewey.
He's upstairs.
- And my mother...
- Let's go, let's go.
I heard her voice.
I saw her, Dewey.
- Upstairs. Come on, let's go.
- It's okay, Sid.
You weren't supposed to go in that house.
It's all set up for the murder scene.
- I'm sorry you had to see that.
- He was in there, Dewey.
- He was in there, I swear, I swear.
- You know I believe you.
- What happened?
- Kincaid, hey.
There's nobody up here.
Come on.
- Come on.
- Okay, so I stole the mask.
Whatever. I didn't know you got the gas chamber for that.
- You stole the mask?
- I took it.
- You took the mask or you stole the mask?
- I-I took it as like a souvenir.
- Don't look at me. I didn't take shit.
- I know he was there.
I am not dreaming,
I am not crazy.
- He was there in Woodsboro.
- That's not Woodsboro, Sidney.
You know what I mean. But he was there.
He or she, or whoever this is.
We're gonna take you back to the station, keep you under watch.
Put you in a safe house.
Whatever it takes.
Come on.
It's all right, Sid.
We all believe you.
- He's watching.
- And he wants you.
- Hey, Dew.
- Dew.
- Come on.
- We have to go catch up with Sid.
- Take a look at this first.
- Someone we know?
- Where'd you get this?
- We got it. Archives.
- Sidney's mother was an actress.
Three movies.
- Horror movies.
- Wanna know who produced all three?
- Who?
- There'll be other movies, Roman.
- Not only did they... did they kill the film, but they killed my cast.
Now, nobody's gonna wanna work with me. Variety called me a pariah.
I don't even know what a pariah is.
Why-Why couldn't someone have killed the cast from Stab 1?
Huh? Or Stab 2? Why me?
What... John, what did we do wrong?
Hollywood is full of criminals whose careers are flourishing.
I'm not a criminal!
I was questioned.
Yeah, but that's all.
I was questioned. That's it.
- That's good for your mystique.
- You think it will help me get work?
Roman. John.
Jennifer, and guests.
To what do I owe the honour?
- Rina Reynolds.
- Rina Reynolds? Who's Rina Reynolds?
Why don't you head to the house?
Tell everybody not to cut the cake without me.
- Oh, God, I forgot. Your birthday.
- Yeah.
- Happy birthday, Roman.
- Yeah, as if life isn't tragic enough.
Shut the doors behind you, please.
So, you knew
Sidney Prescott's mother.
- Who?
- Rina Reynolds?
Do you know how many actors have worked for me? Hundreds. Thousands.
- He didn't say she was an actor.
- Good catch.
- So what's the point?
- Uh, no point.
I'm just gonna give, uh,
Detective Kincaid a call.
I remember. She was a bit player in a couple of my movies.
- A nobody. So what does it matter?
- Oh, come on.
You have made millions off the story of her murder.
You're obsessed with her, and you're obsessed with her daughter!
All right, easy, Geraldo.
Why don't you tell us the truth?
What the hell are you guys getting at?
I make horror films, that's what I do.
The studio came to me with Stab.
They came to me.
Check it out.
- But you knew who she was.
- When we did the first Stab...
I realized I had known
Maureen Prescott before.
I mean, as Rina.
I couldn't tell anyone.
Can you imagine the press?
And now?
I mean, murders on your set.
- And-And still you say nothing?
- Get real.
- That would make me a suspect.
- Just because you knew her?
- Yeah.
- I don't think so.
Just what did happen to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
Now, you listen to me, Lois Lane.
Let it go. It's dead and buried.
How would you like to see it dug up on national TV?
Why don't you tell me what happened?
It was in the '70s.
Everything was different.
I was well-known for my parties.
Rina knew what they were.
It was for girls like her to meet men.
Men who could get them parts... if they made the right impression.
Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite... in one way or another no matter what she said afterwards.
- Are you saying she...
- I'm saying things got out of hand.
Maybe they did take advantage of her.
You know, Maybe the sad truth is... this is not the city for innocents.
No charges were brought.
And the bottom line is...
Rina Reynolds wouldn't play by the rules.
You wanna get ahead in Hollywood?
You gotta play the game, or go home.
What do you know about trilogies?
- You mean, like movie trilogies?
- You seem to like movies, Detective.
Call me Mark, would you? 'Cause
I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
All I know about movie trilogies is that in the third one... all bets are off.
- Did you request this case?
- No. They tend to put me... on the ones that deal with the business.
I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
Huh.
Must be exciting.
Beautiful place, beautiful people.
To me, Hollywood is about death.
Excuse me?
I'm a homicide detective, remember?
And when you see what I see day in and day out... the violence that people do to each other... you get haunted.
I think you know about that.
What do you mean?
I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't go away.
To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not.
Watching it alone.
Ghosts are tough.
You can't shoot ghosts.
Can't arrest ghosts.
But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.
You're here, you're not hiding.
You've done the right thing,
Miss Prescott.
What did you know about your mother?
I always thought
I had the perfect mom.
Perfect family.
Till I found out I was wrong.
She, um...
She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and, um... soon as I thought that I had, more secrets.
I don't know who my mom was.
You know who she was to you.
Here's the deal.
I'm off to search the set.
I think what you saw is real.
That's the good news.
- How is that good news?
- Because that means... that we're dealing with an ordinary flesh-and-blood killer.
- And I know how to handle guys like that.
- Oh, yeah? How?
Catch him or kill him.
Hey, Detective.
What's your favourite scary movie?
My life.
Mine too.
We have to think.
Strategize.
- Milton's the key to everything.
- He's a pervert, he's not a killer.
He's gotta be involved somehow.
We should follow him.
We're gonna go back to the precinct and we're gonna tell Kincaid and Sidney... what we found out.
My Gale would be much more aggressive.
My Gale would suspect everybody.
- My Gale would...
- Shut up!
- Shut up!
- Riley here.
- Dewey, it's Sidney.
- Hey, Sid.
- I'm with Gale.
We're on our way to see you.
- No.
Listen, I'm not at the station.
John Milton called me and said he had something to tell me.
Something about my mom.
I'm going to meet him at his house.
Wait, Sid, I'm not so sure that's a good idea.
It's okay. Kincaid's with me.
I've got official big-time...
L.A.P.D. protection, but
I'd feel better if you were there.
- We're on our way, but still, Sid...
- Thanks.
- What?
- Looks like we're going to that party after all.
Hey, guys. Come on in.
Join the party.
Yeah, well, actually, we're here to see Sidney.
- Really? Sidney's here.
- Where?
- Where's Sidney?
- She's right there!
Jesus!
Not "Sidney," Sidney.
- Like I'm "Gale" and she's Gale.
- Sidney Prescott?
- Yeah.
- No, I'd never invite her here.
- She's on her way.
- Well, the more the merrier.
God, this house is incredible.
- It's old Hollywood.
- Yeah. Could the dude have more money?
Supposedly, Milton has a secret screening room... that was like the scene back in the '70s, you know.
It was, like, drinks and drugs and girls and movies and shit.
Wow! Wish I could've seen it.
Big old screening room shouldn't be too hard to find.
I'm gonna go...
I'm gonna go check this place out.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Just one damn minute.
There's a psycho killer on the loose.
And you want to go traipsing around this gigantic mansion?
Have you ever actually seen the Stab movies? Every time... this dude enters a room, he ends up a goddam shish kebab.
- I'll go with you, Roman.
- There you go. You guys wanna come?
It'll be okay.
We're gonna stick together.
- You're not stickin'. Wait up.
- We're gonna stay here and wait for Sid.
We'll be right back!
If-lf you were a screening room... where would you be?
I bet in the basement.
I don't like basements.
Ooh, it's spooky.
- Ooh, Weredad.
- Damn, it's dark in here.
- I loved that movie.
- Forget the movie!
What if Milton's crazy... and he's gonna jump outta his screening room with a sling blade or something?
- He won't.
- You sure about that?
- What's down there?
- Zombies and aliens.
You know, what you look like without make-up, Jennifer.
Jesus. Stop pretending
I wasn't the best you've ever had.
- Oh, stop pretending I even remember.
- Stop pretending!
Roman?
Roman?
- Any sign of her?
- No.
This is so strange.
It sure is.
Dewey, do you have caller I.D.
On your cell phone?
- Yeah.
- All right, use it and-and press "send."
What the hell?
What is this thing?
Is this what he...
What the hell?
Dewey, he's got our voices.
He's got Sid.
He's got us all.
- Oh, my God. We gotta find her.
- Come on.
All right, take the gun.
Go find Roman and Jennifer.
I'm gonna get the others.
- Be careful.
- You too.
Tyson! Angelina!
You up there?
- Roman!
- Tyson!
Angelina!
Damn it!
Okay, come on.
We gotta get out of here.
- Where's Angelina?
- I don't know. She went in here.
- I came in after her. Now she's gone.
- Great.
- What's wrong?
- Looks like Stab 3 is back in production.
Roman!
Jennifer!
Jennifer!
Roman!
Jennifer!
Roman?
- Is he dead?
- Yeah, very.
Dewey! Dewey!
Dewey?
Dewey!
God, I'm sorry.
Jennifer, Gale, look.
- I found a secret passage.
- Roman's dead.
- What?
- The killer's here.
- What?
- Come on.
- Let go of me! I'm getting out of here!
- You're not safe alone!
Listen to me!
I did not fuck that pig Milton to get a leading role... just to die here with second-rate celebrities like you two!
- Gale! I'm up here.
- Come on.
- Dewey!
- You guys should get out too.
It's crazy to still be here.
- Wait!
- Come on!
- Dewey!
- Gale, Jennifer, up here!
Dewey, here.
He got Roman and Angelina too.
- We'll be safer if we stick together, won't we?
- Of course. Why...
What's goin' on?
Oh, shit!
- Hey!
- Dewey!
Dewey!
No!
Help! Police!
Help! Help!
Police! Help!
Oh, you motherfucker!
Damn!
Dewey! Dewey!
Behind the mirror, Dewey!
Gale! Get away! Dewey!
- Do you hear something?
- Get away from me, you asshole.
- Get away from me! You don't scare me!
- Look, Gale. The mirror's moving.
- Gale! Gale!
- Stand back, Gale.
You can't kill me. I'm the killer in Stab 3. I'm the killer!
Gale, cover!
Dewey!
- Tyson!
- Tyson!
I'm gonna check down here.
You call for help.
Okay.
Tyson!
- Tyson?
- Any sign of him?
- No.
- All right. I'm gonna check out front.
Dew...
Gale!
Gale!
Gale!
- Dewey?
- Gale!
Gale!
- Who is this?
- Dewey, it's me.
Gale, where are you?
I'm in the basement.
I'm trapped.
- Where?
- There's a door in the kitchen.
Hurry.
Wait. How do I know this is you, Gale, and not the killer?
Dewey, open the fucking door.
It's me.
Well, don't you think that's what the killer would say?
Come on. He's out cold at the bottom of the stairs.
Hey!
Dewey. Dewey.
All right, all right.
It's pizza, not a party.
Everybody get back to work.
Anybody seen my fuckin' partner?
Hey, Morgan, what did you pay?
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Who is this?
- Who is this?
- Um, w-who's calling?
- Um, w-who's calling?
Gale, Dewey, whoever, um, call me back.
I can only hear myself.
I only hear you too, Sidney.
- Who is this?
- The question isn't who I am.
The question is:
Who's with me?
- Sidney, stay away!
- Sidney!
Don't do it. If you do one thing to attract attention to yourself...
one thing,
I'll kill them both.
Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?
- Yes.
- Yeah. Go there.
Oh, it's hard being friends with you, Sidney.
When you're friends with Sidney, you die.
Well, these friends don't have to,
Sidney. It's up to you.
- How do I know their voices are...
- Are real?
How do you know you're not hearing things?
How do you know I'm not someone in your head? Somewhere you know.
- Don't come here, Sidney!
- Dewey!
- Or do you?
- You're dead.
I don't want them.
I want you.
It's simple.
You show yourself, they survive.
- You run, they die.
- Oh, God!
Don't you wanna know, Sidney, who killed her?
Don't you wanna know who killed your mother?
- Have you seen Kincaid?
- Yeah, I saw him go out.
- Wallace is still lookin' for him.
- Where?
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
- Where?
- I'll call you when you're on your way.
Shit. Shit. Shit.
Holy shit.
- What?
- You follow directions well, Sidney.
Now, welcome to the final act.
See that metal detector?
Use it.
All over, Sidney.
Everywhere.
Everywhere.
The other leg too.
Show it to me.
Throw it in the pool.
Now, come inside, Sidney.
No fucking way. How do I know they're not dead already?
They're right inside, waiting for you.
Look for yourself.
Now that we're all here, the party can begin.
- Dewey.
- Sid.
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
He's right there!
Oh, shit.
Think again.
It's your turn to scream, asshole.
Yeah!
- It's okay. Just give me a second.
- Okay.
- Hurry, Sid.
- Sidney? Sidney?
Where is he?
Be careful!
I heard shots. Tyson's dead.
What's goin' on?
- What're you doin' here, Kincaid?
- Lookin' for you.
Tyson said there was a party here tonight, and I thought, uh-oh.
Third act celebration.
Thought I better check it out.
Alone?
Where's your partner?
Hey, Miss Prescott.
I'm here to help.
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down.
No!
Sid! Wake up, Sid!
Sid, come on!
- Wake up!
- Sidney!
Sid, shoot him! Sid!
Shoot the fucker!
Shoot him!
You want me, motherfucker?
Come and get me.
Run!
Sid.
Sid.
Come in here, please.
It's just me, Sid.
Oh, I was so pretty.
Everybody loved me.
Have you missed me, Sidney?
Would you like to hold me one last time?
What's the matter?
What are you staring at?
Don't you remember your mother?
You're not going anywhere, Sidney.
It's time you came to terms with me and with Mother.
Maybe you never knew her at all, Sidney.
Maybe you just can't get past the surface of things.
- Who the hell are you?
- The other half of you.
I searched for a mother too, an actress named Rina Reynolds.
Tried to find her my whole life.
And four years ago,
I actually tracked her down.
Knocked at her door, thinking she'd welcome me with open arms.
But she had a new life and a new name: Maureen Prescott.
You were the only child she claimed, Sidney.
She shut me out in the cold forever.
Her own son.
Roman Bridger, director.
And brother.
She slammed the door in my face, Sid.
She said I was Rina's child... and Rina was dead.
And it struck me.
What a good idea!
So I watched her.
I made a little home movie.
A little-little family film.
It seems Maureen...
Mom...
She really got around.
I mean, Cotton was one thing.
Everybody knew about that.
But Billy's father?
That was the key.
Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my film too much.
He didn't like it at all.
But once I supplied the motivation, all the kid needed was a few pointers.
Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame.
It was like he was making a movie.
You. This is all because ofyou.
I'm a director, Sid.
- I direct.
- Oh.
I had no idea that they were gonna make a film of their own.
- Oh, shit.
- What a film it turned out to be, huh?
I mean, introducing Sidney, the victim.
Sidney, the survivor.
Sidney, the star!
All right. You're gonna be all right.
Just apply pressure.
Here, take this.
Get the son ofa bitch.
Let's go.
Fine, you got what you wanted, hero and villain face-to-face.
- Well, you know what happens now?
The villain dies!
- Exactly!
But I'm not the villain, Sid.
You are.
Here he is, the man who gave away your mother's innocence.
Huh? What he did to her made her a slut.
Didn't it? Huh? She never recovered from that night, right here in this room.
They fucked her three ways from Sunday.
Ruined her life.
Ruined yours too, didn't it, Sid?
You hate him, Sid?
Come on, I know you do.
I'm sure you do.
I know who you are.
I know what happened to my mother.
And I want you to understand,
I'm gonna make you pay!
That's what the police are gonna find on Milton's answering machine... right next to his lifeless, mutilated corpse.
- What? Can't hear ya.
- You don't have to do this, Roman.
Just tell me what you want.
I can make it happen.
Any picture.
Name your budget. Script approval.
- Final cut!
- I already have it.
No!
God! You spineless bastard!
No, Sid, that would be you.
You did it all.
You did it, you called them all.
Even your closest friends.
Living in total isolation, the pressure ofanother movie about you... the discovery that Milton destroyed Mommy dearest... you finally just snapped!
One, two, three!
And who's our hero, huh?
The sole survivor. Who's the one... who bravely faced down the psychopath and killed her with her own knife?
You're gonna pay for the life you stole from me, Sid.
For the mother, and for the family, and for the stardom and...
Goddam it! Everything you have that should've been mine!
God! Why don't you stop your whining and get on with it?
I've heard this shit before!
- Stop!
- You know why you kill people,
Roman? Do you?
- I don't wanna hear it!
- Because you choose to!
There is no one else to blame!
- Stop it! Fucking damn it!
- Why don't you take some fucking responsibility?
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!
Sid? Sidney?
Sidney?
Sidney!
Sidney!
Leave her alone!
Dewey, do something!
- Stand back!
- Dewey!
Sid! Sid.
Sid?
Where is he?
Hey. Lose something?
Found something.
There's gotta be another way in there!
Come on!
You hurt her,
I swear I'll kill you!
- Dewey!
- Down this way. There's another hallway.
There's another door down here.
- This thing's not budging.
- Look around for something heavy.
- Go that way.
- Okay!
I shot you.
I guess we think alike.
Mother's dead.
And there is nothing you can do about that.
I still got to make my movie.
Stab 3, right?
Kincaid, hang in there.
Roman? It was Roman?
Be careful, Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.
Yeah, well, he wasn't superhuman, Dewey.
He wasn't superhuman at all.
- You can't fuckin' kill me!
- Head!
- Head! Head, Dewey!
- What?
Head!
Shoot him in the head.
Thanks.
No problem.
Look.
Come on, Cherokee.
Come on.
- Yeah, she's doin' great.
- Yeah.
Look.
What are you doing with that?
Um, will you sign it for me, Gale?
You hate that book.
Besides, I'm-I'm done with that kind of reporting.
For me.
Will you sign it for me?
You're a nut.
Okay.
- Will you?
- Dewey.
I know it'll never work, and you know it'll never work.
But what I'm asking is just to see ifwe're wrong.
We don't know everything, Gale.
I mean, you thinkyou do, but...
You're a brave man,
Dewey Riley.
I'm really scared right now.
Inside.
Sid, we've been waiting for you.
We're gonna start a movie.
- What kind of movie?
- You have to come and see.
Take a little walk to the edge of town
Now, spread your wings and fly
Don't the lights of the city look so damn pretty
When you're flyin' so high
It's hard to know about there down below
The streets fade
They're swimmin'deep in blood
It seems to make me groan and cry
You really wanna know what's wrong with this land
Just scratch your head with your red right hand
I'm talkin'about blood, babe
It's in your veins
Your mommy and daddy
They've got the same
You're under the mirror day after day
You see a pretty face crumblin' away
As you become your mom and daddy
Scream once, scream twice
Now scream again
Cover that face with your red right hand
So, is this the end
Forus, my friend
So, is this the end
Forus, my friend
So, is this the end
Forus, my friend
Well as though we rise
As the day breaks the dawn
And as the moon hides the sun
Oh, the sun
No more sorrow
All those crying days are gone
No more sorrow
Now it'sgone
Now it'sgone
Now it'sgone
So, is this the end
Forus, my friend
Spoke to my god today
Asked him why he'd gone away
Hitched on a rocket ride into the sun
Said, son I got one for ya
Down there in California
Just take a look around at all you've done
You're automatic like a burnin' gun
You're a star like everyone
Talked to my soul today
Couldn't keep my brain away
So I found a holiday behind the sun
Took all the friends I could
Spun out in Hollywood
Hit up on a climate everyone
You're automatic like a burnin' gun
You're a star like everyone
You could save the world
Could be shining on my pearl
You could save the world
Just might find your way mypearl
Shine
Shine
You're automatic like a burnin' gun
You're a star like everyone
You could save the world
Could be shinin' on my pearl
You could save the world
Could be shinin' on my pearl
You could save the world
Just might find your way my pearl
Shine
Shine
Here we are, folks,
on the red carpet at the grand opening...
... of the Coolsonian Criminology Museum.
Tonight's premiere exhibit
is a rousing look back...
... at the exploits of Mystery Incorporated.
And here they are.
Folks, this crowd is going crazy over Mystery Inc.
Here you go, girls.
I got an ascot for each of you.
Hello!
Check it out! It's a Shag and Scoob quake and the whole city's shaking!
Yeah!
Come on, Scoob.
Sorry.
I consider it a privilege, sir.
- Daphne!
- Don't you two look beautiful. Thank you.
Daphne! Daphne! Daphne!
Hi! We love you! We have you tattooed on our chests! Look!
That's very sweet.
Velma! Velma!
- Sign it, please.
- We love you, Velma.
Thanks.
- I love her so much.
- May I have a word...
...with Coolsville's hottest detectives?
- Absolutely.
That's your word.
Come on, dear. We're late.
Heather Jasper-Howe at the grand opening...
...of the new Coolsonian
Criminology Museum...
...with our guests of honor, the master detectives of Mystery Incorporated.
Shaggy!
Right on!
Hello! Hello!
With all your success, will you still have time for us in little old Coolsville?
Of course little old Coolsville can solve its problems without us...
...but we'll always be here to help.
The people of Coolsville are the best in the world!
- Can you tell us a little about the exhibit?
- Absolutely.
Mystery Inc. Is proud to donate the costumes of criminals we've unmasked.
- Like The Black Knight Ghost.
- Our very first case.
The 10,000 Volt Ghost.
The Skeleton Men, and even the dreaded Pterodactyl Ghost.
We've also donated the costumes of some of our more ridiculous foes.
Like Chickenstein.
Can we get a shot of you next to The Black Night?
Ridiculous? Obviously she forgot that dude tried to pluck us.
- Remember what I told you?
- Never pick your nose in public?
No, but that's good too.
- Image is everything.
- Yes! Lmage is everything.
The whole city's watching, so try and keep a brave face.
- They're costumes.
- Right.
She's right, Scoob.
Up close, they look totally fake.
The Tar Monster scared the locals of Byzantius away to take their treasure.
But on the positive side, he'd pave your driveway for free.
Isn't that right, Velma?
Velma?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Daphne, this is Patrick Wisely.
He's the curator here at the museum.
It's very nice to meet you, Patrick.
I hope you'll be working closely with
Velma on this ever-expanding exhibit.
I know that you're a glamorous, mysterious, jet-set adventurer...
...preoccupied with international intrigue and all...
- Yes. That's me.
- I know, but...
There's a symposium coming up on syntactic reasoning in the criminal brain...
I have always found a criminal's inclination...
...to incorrectly use the interrogative pronoun in place of the relative...
...delightfully absurd.
- Me too!
- Really?
So maybe you'd want to go together?
Suppose you mean like...
Like a...
Like a date. With me.
No, I can't, Patrick.
Mystery is my mistress.
I must heed her sweet call.
Okay.
What's happening?
Oh, boy.
Daphne!
Go, Ned! Get it! Get it!
- We need to come up with a plan.
- Hiding is our plan.
In case you haven't noticed, there's an unidentified freaky object in here!
- The curtains!
- We're on them!
- Come on, you chickens! Grab those ropes!
- But chickens aren't good with ropes!
- We got him!
- Shaggy, use the ropes to tie him up!
It's just a costume!
It's just a costume!
It's just a costume!
We tied it! Let go!
Sorry!
- We have to save Shaggy and Scooby!
- As usual!
Fire!
Mystery Incorporated.
This is only the first rung on the ladder of your demise.
Look out!
And this time, you'll be the ones unmasked...
...as the buffoons you truly are!
Any clues to the cause of the attack? How did the dinosaur get through security?
Where did Mystery Inc.'s plan go wrong?
A secret hatch!
The real Pterodactyl Ghost must have come through here!
A reptilian scale.
A most wonderful clue.
He stole two costumes: The Black Knight
Ghost and The 10,000 Volt Ghost. Why?
Fred, Daphne. Could you answer a few questions for the press?
Fred, I don't think that's a really good idea.
We always face the press after we've unmasked the creeps.
We looked ridiculous back there.
Don't worry about it, sweetheart.
The press loves us.
The higher the pedestal,
the harder the fall.
And Mystery Inc. Fell far
in the embarrassing debacle...
... that tarnished the reputation
of the once-great gang.
It was an utter disaster
as two of the gang's key members...
... Norville "Shaggy" Rogers
and Scoobert "Scooby-Doo"...
... caused untold damage to Coolsville's
hottest new tourist attraction...
... which took a full two years to complete.
When asked for comment, Fred Jones,
leader of Mystery Inc., said this:
Coolsville can solve its
problems without us.
I didn't say that! I mean...
I did, but that's out of context!
This is Heather Jasper-Howe,
disillusioned from Coolsville.
It's all my fault.
I'm the one who told Shaggy and Scooby to get the ropes.
No, Velma, it's my fault.
I should have checked that they were tied before I let go.
It's my fault too.
We all know how Shaggy and Scooby can be.
But it's all right.
We just need to stay strong, in control, and work fast.
Come on, gang. Let's get to the lab.
We'll figure a way out of this Jurassic jumble.
Shaggy?
- We're screwups.
- Yeah.
I guess, looking back, every time they made a plan, we did screw it up somehow.
- I just never noticed before.
- Me neither.
There's gotta be some way we can prove that we actually belong in the gang.
We've gotta do something totally unlike us.
You know, Scoob...
...we could act like real detectives!
Really?
Scooby-Doo, raise your right paw.
No, your right paw. Your other paw.
Repeat after me. From this day forward we will no longer be our goofy selves.
We will be awesome detectives.
And we will act more like Fred and Velma and Daphne.
We will be terrific and fantastic and spectacular...
...and cease to be "loser-iffic,"
"lame-tastic" and "suck-tacular. "
Suck-tacular.
Right, like, it's time to solve the mystery.
Let's kick this investigation up to an 11!
What the heck are you guys doing?
We figured the first step in solving a mystery...
...would be to wear the right attire.
I'm sorry, Daph, but your go-go boots didn't fit...
...me!
Scooby! Those so don't go with that sweater!
Really?
Clues!
Alas, what are these strange markings?
Words.
Words!
Scooby-Doo, take notes.
- Gotcha.
- Come on, you kooks.
Okay.
It's come back positive.
This is a real pterodactyl scale.
Precisely!
That masked figure was out to humiliate us.
Maybe it's someone we unmasked.
But who would be able to make a real Pterodactyl Ghost?
The original Pterodactyl Ghost.
Dr. Jonathan Jacobo.
That's right!
Jacobo wreaked havoc
in a statewide crime spree.
Jacobo stole millions...
... which he used to finance his failed
experiments trying to create monsters.
Come alive! Come alive!
You think Jacobo 's behind this?
Impossible. Three years ago
he attempted a prison escape.
So long, suckers!
Help me, suckers!
His body was lost at sea.
How about this? Jacobo's cellmate was released from prison two months ago.
Jeremiah Wickles.
The Black Knight Ghost. That was one of the costumes that was stolen.
Right! And...
Scooby-Doo! What's your conclusion?
Bunny.
It seems Old Man Wickles
deserves a visit...
... before any of our other creepy
conquests make a comeback.
Freddy, up on the right.
Old Man Wickles' ancestral manor.
Oh, man. Another creepy crib!
How come we can't ever investigate, like, a KFC or something?
Shaggy!
All right. Then again, creepy is my middle name.
Scoob!
Come on, Scoob!
Looks like a bit of a fixer-upper.
Nice job last night. Losers!
Quick, we need to think of a comeback.
What dorks.
Hey! Shut up!
That's a good one.
You are trespassing on Wickles Manor.
- Leave now or pay the price.
- What jerk makes that his doorbell?
Dude.
He just said we'd pay the price.
Shaggy, Shaggy, Shaggy.
What could possibly happen by ringing a doorbell?
Help me!
Shaggy!
I think I pulled something.
That's what can happen by ringing a doorbell, Fred. That!
At 7 p.m., the owner
will be home to set you free.
You want to buy a box of cookies?
Excuse me.
Have you heard the Good News?
Yeah. There's cookies!
Watch the junk!
Sorry.
Oh, brother.
The lock's on a laser thumbprint scanner.
- Let me just get to my makeup.
- Daph, now?
You know what, Velma? It's never too late to learn to properly apply makeup.
Okay. The last good thumbprint should still be there, so...
...a little blush...
...a pore strip...
...and voilà.
All right, Daph!
I enjoy being a girl.
- Thank you!
- See if I can get my mechanic's job back.
- Twenty, 30, 40...
- Thanks for the cookies.
...50... Welcome!
Sixty, 70, 80...
Okay, gang. Let's, like, split up and search for clues.
Scoob and I will go this way.
Come on, Scoob.
He stole my thing that I say!
Search for clues. Search for clues.
A clue!
Shiny footprints.
The glow is similar to the pterodactyl scale.
A clue!
It looks like Wickles shares Jacobo's fascination with the supernatural.
He collects everything from Piri Reis to Aleister Crowley.
He collects dust too.
No. The dust is good.
We can tell what he's been reading lately.
Like here!
What is it?
It's an obsolete Celtic text used by secret societies in the mid-19th century.
Look. The book belonged to J. Jacobo.
The original Pterodactyl Ghost.
Maybe he gave it to Wickles before he died.
Can you read it?
It's an amalgamation of magic and science.
Here's a list of ingredients...
...on how to create your own carbon-based...
...organic, composite predators.
This is an instruction manual on how to create monsters.
Scoob.
Clues!
Those aren't clues, Scoob.
Those are just things you want.
Like, why is a toilet brush a clue?
Just because you can sing in it doesn't make it a clue. It makes it awesome.
Like, what's this?
"The Faux Ghost. "
We're in luck.
It's tonight, Scoob!
- We are detectives.
- Really?
You found an actual clue!
I found a clue!
Do the clue dance! Do the clue dance!
We're going back, we're going back!
Black Knight Ghost!
Run, Shaggy!
Let's go.
Like, lock the door!
Heavy stuff, Scoob!
Give me a hand, Scoob!
See him get through this!
Heavy!
We outsmarted that moron!
Yeah! What a moron.
Look at me.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
- Yo, metalhead!
- Yes?
Bring it.
He brought it.
Daphne! Hold him off!
I'll look in the book.
Maybe there's a formula for finding his weakness.
Here. "To find a creature's weakest point...
...take the angle between the current position of the sun...
...and your geographical point..."
- Velma!
"Add this point, 28 and a half feet up from sea level. "
That tickles.
This is bad.
"Multiply this number..."
"Add the square inches of..."
Velma!
"... the square root... "
Now it's good night, ladies!
"... your X-axis. "
"And subtract 9034. That's your Y-axis. "
Look. No hands!
Any time would be great, Velma!
I'm trying.
"Subtract one, divide by B, follow upward eight degrees north. "
Which makes his weakest point right here!
Right in the roundtables.
Run!
In your face! Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
Come on, Scoob! Inside!
I'll compare the glow of those footprints to the pterodactyl scale.
We'll check out Wickles' book.
Dude, The Faux Ghost is an awesome clue. But what do we do with it?
Let's solve the mystery.
If we solve the mystery by ourselves...
...it would certainly prove to the gang that we belong.
Let's head to The Faux Ghost...
...find Wickles, and see what he knows.
But first, let's give the gang the old "slipperooney. "
Hey, guys.
Scooby's feeling kind of...
...like he's got rabies.
We're just gonna go outside to get some fresh air.
Jinkies!
What's up, Velms?
The analysis of the pterodactyl scale.
It contains randamonium, which this books says...
...is the critical ingredient needed to make monsters.
Doesn't randamonium glow, like those footprints in Wickles' mansion?
If we prove Wickles is behind this, this mystery goes down like a dot-com...
...and Coolsville digs us again.
- Where would he get randamonium?
Randamonium is the byproduct of silver mines.
Like the abandoned mining town in old Coolsville.
Then we better get to that mining town and see what's...
I'm invisible. I'm invisible.
Get rid of him!
Keep him busy.
What are you doing?
He wants to ask me on a date.
It's okay to be scared.
I am not scared.
I've fought werewolves and ghosts.
But in the end, we usually unmask them and it's a little scared man inside.
It's the same with dating.
Velma, have you ever considered that maybe werewolves and ghosts...
...are just distractions to keep you away from what really frightens you?
Intimacy with another person.
And by intimacy, I mean someone who thinks you're really hot.
But I'm more comfortable in the world of logic and facts.
And...
...I'm not hot.
Me neither.
Everybody has flaws, Velma.
The object of a healthy relationship...
...is to never let the other person know they're there.
- To museums.
- To museums.
Daph, I really like this guy.
What would you do if someone thought...
...that you were some glamorous and mysterious jet-setter?
I'd make myself one.
Who's your mommy?
My mommy?
Come on, let's solve a mystery.
- Do you have to go to the bathroom?
- No, I can't in this outfit.
Okay, Scooby-Doo, the coast is clear.
Here we go.
That's it, Scoob. The Faux Ghost.
Man, I recognize a lot of these cats.
Like, that's C.L. Magnus.
He used to dress up as Redbeard's ghost.
And that's Aggie Wilkins, a.k.a. The Ozark Witch.
These are all folks we unmasked.
If they spot us, they'll invite us to a weenie roast.
One where we're the weenies!
Hot dogs!
There's gotta be some way that we can use our awesome, fearless new skills...
...to get us in there without being recognized.
Everyone part like the Red Sea.
It's me, Shizzy McCreepy, and my brother, S.D. McCrawley.
We are in the house and ready to party.
Hey, handsome.
Hello, baby.
- Zoinks!
- Jinkies!
- Hey, gang.
- Jinkies!
- Hey!
- Yipe!
A Ghost Clown is a heck of a lot scarier than a Cotton Candy Glob!
Watch out, idiot.
- Old Man Wickles!
- Leave me alone.
No!
I just wanted to say thank you.
Your portrayal of the Black Knight Ghost was inspirational to my brother and me.
Have you done anything cool and creepy lately?
Listen, I'm not normally one for giving advice...
...but I feel sorry for you because of your brother's hideous nose deformity.
Get out of this game while you got a chance.
All of us here ain't nothing to admire.
We needed people to believe we were different than we were.
Maybe because we believed...
...that there was something wrong with who we were in the first place.
I guess you're sort of grateful to Mystery Inc...
...for unmasking you.
- Are you kidding?
If I see those twerps,
I'd tear their eyes out of their skulls.
Make them eat the one eye while watching themselves eat it with the other eye!
Bye.
Here's a clue for you.
That dude's wearing his freak hat 24/7.
I gotta take a whiz.
Don't do anything to attract attention.
Gotcha.
Hey, doll.
You wanna dance?
Groovy.
Here we go.
Shake it, baby.
Give me five!
Oh, yeah!
Everybody!
Oh, yeah.
Hey, Shaggy!
It's Scooby-Doo! The meddling mutt what helped throw us in jail!
Who, me?
No, wait, that's not Scooby-Doo!
That's S.D. McCrawley.
He's just wearing a mask.
And that's Doo's beatnik best pal,
Shaggy Rogers.
- Where?
- There.
Zoinks! Gangway!
Run, Shaggy. Wait for me!
And stay out!
That wasn't so bad, Scoob.
That was my outfit, I swear.
You know, Velma, you are as beautiful as ever.
You're just so different than I expected.
You know, I'm just...
- Oh, my goodness!
- What the heck's going on?
This cannot be good.
My museum.
Wait!
Any comments on the museum robbery?
Mystery Inc. Is investigating the two stolen costumes.
No, the one that just happened.
Where The Black Knight and Pterodactyl
Ghost stole the rest of the costumes?
The rest of the costumes?
So, what you're saying is it's all downhill for Mystery Inc.
No! You're doing that thing again where you take everything I say out of context.
You're trying to make it look like I think Coolsville sucks.
No! Don't record that!
Patrick, I'm so sorry.
It must be so hard for you.
I'm sorry, I have to go. Okay?
- I'll go with you...
- No! Just...
No, I have to figure out what's going on.
All Fred Jones had to say was:
I think Coolsville sucks!
In light of the city's recent chaos...
... Jones ' response was disheartening
to the fans who have supported them.
Perhaps it's time for the crime-solving
gang to shape up or ship out.
I'll be right back.
This is Heather Jasper-Howe for Investigative Probe Reporting.
What's with the personal attacks?
Look, I'm a huge fan. It's just my editor...
Who are you kidding?
Who are you kidding?
Don't think I don't know your game.
What do you do for the gang?
Really?
Velma's the smart one. Fred's the leader.
All you are is a pretty little face.
Why are you doing this?
Because it's my job to unmask those who pretend to be who they're not.
"Unmask those"? You sound like...
Sound like who?
The evil masked guy.
But you know that, because just as you know I'm standing here...
...you know I know who you know you are...
...which is him, who's a her, which is you.
Now I see what you do for the gang.
You're in charge of incoherent babbling.
Mystery Incorporated.
Once again, you are proven useless before my power.
Because of you, soon Coolsville...
...will be mine.
Darn it.
Thanks a lot!
The scoop of the night, gone.
Can't you do anything right?
Ned, get your camera and follow me.
Guess not.
Stop wasting my time!
You hear me? Now I want you to question all your scum-bucket friends.
Find out what they know about those stolen costumes.
Or else you'll be known as the Soiled Underwear Ghost!
I want answers. Now, go! Now!
Yes, sir!
- Sorry.
- It's okay.
Patrick.
Shaggy. Scooby.
What are you guys doing here?
We just came down here to be undercover and stuff.
Me too.
My museum got broken into again...
...so I had to come here and try and get some answers.
Gotta put on the tough-guy act, or these guys will eat me alive.
What's the matter, you don't believe me?
I'm kidding!
- It's the tough-guy act.
- That's good.
I got you.
That was a joke? That was good!
You're a lot of fun. Try it, Scoob.
It needs work.
Look, Patrick...
...we could stay here, do this all night, and something tells me you would...
...but we gotta make like your personality and split.
Okay.
Scooby-Doo. Scoob!
Hello?
Scooby-Doo, can you hear me?
Hello, Shaggy.
Wickles has led us into a terrifying ghost town!
- Ghost town?
- Yes, a ghost town!
Darn bushes yowling at me again.
- Keep quiet, Scoob.
- Okay, Shaggy.
Like, where did Old Man Nutjob go?
Through here, Scoob?
I don't know.
Oh, boy.
Run, Scoob! It's a "skelly" thingy!
Elevator.
Good work, pal!
Like, let's skedaddle.
So, what's your assessment, Velmster?
This place seems harmless enough.
I mean, whether the Evil Masked Figure could've gotten his randamonium...
...from here at the mine?
- Oh, sorry.
I was just thinking about Patrick.
He seemed so upset when he left.
- Right. So...
- And...
...he doesn't like me.
Okay. So your assessment is?
- Love stinks.
- Fred?
Do you think I'm just a pretty face?
No.
I mean, yes.
I mean, not fat!
Definitely not fat.
Is this sort of what you're looking for?
Fat? Why would you even use that word?
Never again will they underestimate us.
That's right.
I've gathered you here today for something big.
At last.
All these years of careful planning...
...have culminated in this one glorious moment.
Old Man Wickles, caught red-handed in your foul monster-making scheme.
With your ugly, evil henchmen.
Henchmen?
Young man, we're investors, and we're listening to his pitch.
So as I was saying...
...the Old Tyme Mining Town, a summer camp for kids...
...where they can have an authentic mining experience.
They can dig for 18 hours straight, just like in the golden days of yore.
They have the time of their lives, and we get free miners!
Mr. Wickles, we need to ask you about...
...your ties to recent monster attacks.
- I don't know nothing about no monsters.
Then how come there was randamonium on the floor of your mansion?
There's randamonium all over the place.
I come home with it in my shorts.
Are you continuing the work of your old pal Jonathan Jacobo?
Old pal? Jacobo?
We hated each other.
In the prison cafeteria, he used to steal my Tater Tots!
And he got the lead in My Fair Lady.
Then why did we find the monster book in your library?
Wait a second. You're the runts what vandalized my home.
Which one of you stole my toilet brush?
Gentlemen.
- I'm sorry, Jeremiah.
- What happened? I haven't finished!
Wait, fellas!
Wowee, Scooby-Doo!
I think we're onto something.
It's like a huge laboratory.
- Go ahead.
- Okay.
This place is like Clue-topia, Scoob.
Refrigerator!
Lemonade!
Check it out.
Look at those weird letters, Scoob.
Shaggy?
Scooby-Doo, you turned into a freaky monster.
You don't eat stuff that glows.
There's got to be an antidote in here somewhere.
Try this, Scoob. It looks medicinal.
Tastes like...
Strawberries.
I'm okay, Scoob.
I've got a chick's body!
I'm the Tasmanian Devil!
Check it out, dude!
I'm buff.
My God.
It seems as if I've become ludicrously intelligent.
It's awful! I long for the blissful ignorance of my former self.
Chasing cats, licking my own rear end, eating my own vomit.
Those were wonderful times.
Check out my pecs, little man!
Hush now, buffoon.
This is a highly combustible synthesis.
A what?
I'm going to transform us back!
No way, geek!
I'm gonna stay this way forever!
No!
Let's go!
Careful, gang.
This "Schwarzeneggian" oaf almost destroyed us.
Go boom.
You are embarrassing.
That was almost exactly like my freshman year in college.
What are you guys doing here?
You're supposed to be sick, Scooby.
I invented a potion.
You lied to us. We're a team.
You don't just go off half-cocked doing whatever you want.
Hey, gang.
"Beware who enters the Monster Hive.
Inside your fears will come alive. "
Oh, my.
Look! It's the costumes from the museum!
- Zombie.
- Miner 49er.
- Captain Cutler.
- I bet they're all here.
He must have used the costumes to make real monsters, which implies...
He needs the costumes to make the monsters, which implies...
He already had a Pterodactyl Ghost costume somehow, which implies...
Patrick's the one.
Velma's in love.
No, I mean the one.
The bad guy.
That's why he wanted to go out with me.
To see what we knew.
We just saw Patrick at the bad guys' hangout.
He was working both sides of Psycho Street.
I don't know who's behind this, but we don't need him...
...transforming more costumes.
Let's find a way to shut down this monster-maker for good.
Guys? What's over here?
This light is strange.
Scooby-Doo.
We're the ones that found this place.
Score one for the big guys!
Now we need to keep acting like mondo-groovy detectives. Come on.
Like, wowee.
Cool! Like, "tuneage. "
Like, what's that weird sound?
Captain Cutler!
Miner 49er!
The Tar Monster!
We have...
...to remain...
...calm.
Calm, Scooby-Doo!
You're not being calm!
I needed that.
I needed that too.
You're pushing your luck, Scoob!
You girls find anything?
- He did it.
- Scoob!
Fred, disconnect that control panel!
Maybe it'll stop the machine!
Come on, this way! Quick, the elevator!
- Like, The 10,000 Volt Ghost!
- Come on, Scoob!
We're gonna die!
- Think positive!
- We're gonna die quickly!
Wait for me!
Come on, girls!
- An exit!
- Run, Shaggy!
Stop them!
Destroy the city if you have to, but get me that control panel!
With it, they can destroy everything
I've set out to do.
Hurry up, gang.
We need to find Shaggy and Scooby.
End of the line, Mystery Inc.!
Die!
Let's book, Scoob.
Oh, boy.
Let's rip it, Scoob!
Zoinks!
I don't know.
Banzai!
We're getting rad!
Like, this pipe's ripping, Scoob!
Zoinks!
Hello.
Scooby!
Are you guys okay?
Sure. As long as you define "okay" as "in massive agony. "
We should get back to headquarters.
No! That'll be the first place they'll look for us.
I think I know where to go.
Move that worthless piece of tin!
Unlike some of you,
I have a very important meeting!
Citizens! Turn in Mystery Inc.
Your reward: We'll let you live.
My monsters can make life very unpleasant.
Find me Mystery Inc., now.
Heather Jasper-Howe with an emergency update for Investigative Probe.
A monster army has invaded Coolsville.
Angry citizens have gathered
outside Mystery Inc. 's offices in protest.
They're insisting the gang cooperate
with the Evil Masked Figure's demands.
Mystery Stink! Mystery Stink!
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have anything to say for yourself?
I beg you, Mystery Inc.
If you can hear me, turn yourselves in.
If we do, he'll get the control panel back, and the city will be in worse shape.
We'd be playing right into his hands.
Please. For our city's sake.
Sorry. You're cancelled.
The old high-school clubhouse.
We should be safe here.
We haven't been here in years.
Freddy, are you okay?
- Do you wanna talk?
- Talking's for wimps.
It's time for action.
You know, Scoob...
...this Evil Masked Figure is turning Coolsville into Ghoulsville.
And the gang is totally taking a hit for it.
Like, this is the most "our-faultiest" screwup ever, Scoob.
Still works.
Look, all my old tools.
After all our so-called success...
...we're back in this old firetrap.
Hit me, Fred.
Good throw, Velm!
- Mine.
- Gotcha!
Throw it to me!
- Go long!
- Okay.
Go, Scooby-Doo!
Dude!
It all seemed so easy back then.
We solved mysteries for the love of them, not to prove anything to anyone.
And the mysteries all seemed to unravel themselves.
Sometimes, the answers would just appear like magic.
My first multiple-resonance imaging device.
Made out of a crystal radio and old video games.
Wait a minute.
Randamonium has an algorithmic cross-currency of negative 4. 121.
With it, maybe...
Well, just maybe...
We could reverse the current and reverse the monster-making process!
All we need to do is rewire the control panel...
Bring it back to the Monster Hive and plug it into the base.
- Push the button...
- And instead of creating monsters...
...all the monsters will be destroyed.
Like, they're totally having a montage in there without us.
I'll tell you one thing for sure.
They don't need our help to figure it out.
We're screwups.
The only time we do anything right...
...is when we accidentally plow into the Snow Ghost...
...because we've accidentally glued our feet to rocket-powered roller-skates.
Eight stupid times.
Face it, Scoob.
We'll never be anything but our old goofy selves.
I wish once...
...just once...
...I could do the right thing on purpose.
You know, Scoob?
Like, be a hero...
...and save the day.
But who are we kidding, right?
Captain Cutler's Ghost.
Captain Cutler's Ghost!
They found us. Finish that in the van when we get to the Monster Hive.
- Come on, guys! In the van!
- Hurry!
Go, Fred! Hit it!
- What do we do?
- What do we do?
Fine. Let's go back!
That's the wrong way!
Shaggy! Give me a hand.
This is tied for the most terrifying day of my life.
- Tied with what?
- Every other freaking day of my life!
It's done!
Jinkies! Tweety's back.
- Shaggy!
- Yeah?
I'm putting her in cruise.
Take the wheel.
Go!
Take this!
- This is bad.
- No doubt.
- Shaggy?
- Yeah.
Who's driving?
Hello.
- Scoob.
- What?
- Turn the wheel!
- Wheel?
- Turn the wheel!
- The round thing, Scoob!
- Scooby!
- Okay.
I'm driving!
Watch out, Scoob!
You did it, Scoob!
All right, gang.
The Monster Hive is right over there.
Let's get this control panel and plug her in.
You go nowhere, knave.
You guys take the long way around.
And I'll hold him off.
- Come on.
- Go get him, Fred.
- Come on, Daph!
- I'm coming!
Not so fast!
You guys go. I'll take care of Sparky.
Just get that control panel to the Hive.
- Go!
- We've got it, Daph!
Scary.
Taste the pain, Mr. Glowy Ugly Thing.
Daph?
- Daph, are you okay?
- I think so.
Guess this is it, huh?
Oh, baby.
I'm afraid.
What a wimp, huh?
That doesn't make you a wimp.
Makes you human.
The Skeleton Men.
- He does that when he gets nervous.
- Sorry.
- Here, Shaggy, take this.
- Why are you giving this to me?
I'll distract those skeletal screwballs.
- Get this to the Monster Hive.
- Us?
You're faster than me.
Once there, just plug it into the base.
Push this button.
I fixed it so it will destroy all the monsters.
But...
...we can't.
- We're screwups.
We tried to be heroes like you guys, but we're not.
- We're just not.
- No.
Like me?
That's funny.
I always wanted to be like you guys.
You guys are so free. You're never afraid to be who you really are.
Whether you're fearful or joyful or hungry.
I think you've been heroes all along.
You just haven't known it.
Here I go.
Heroes.
Heroes.
On your knees, knave.
Can't you see we're talking?
Talking is for wimps.
You can't fool me with that macho facade.
You're just afraid to show your sensitive side.
You've touched my inner child.
And he's really mad!
Come on, Scoob.
Miner 49er!
I'll get you, you varmints!
Dead end.
Remember when we were young and you used to wear that jumper?
- What? Me? In a jumper?
- And we used to watch cable?
Do it!
Lights out.
Blackout! Blackout!
Oh, crap.
Take this, daddy-o. It's a real gas.
Come on. Let's go, Scoob!
My glasses.
Oh, brother. Not again.
I've got to consider contact lenses.
What?
Some kind of scary bat.
Wait a minute.
That's the pterodactyl.
The Pterodactyl Ghost.
What's this?
A shrine!
To Jonathan Jacobo?
But who would be so obsessed with him?
Velma.
Lose something?
Patrick.
What are you doing here?
I'm trying to solve this mystery.
Same as you.
That is what you're doing, right?
Trying to solve this mystery?
Yes.
Why are you so obsessed with Jonathan Jacobo?
- What are you talking about?
- No way, Jose.
Velma.
Stay away from me.
I know who you are.
- Velma, let go of the grate.
- So I can fall to my death?
No, so I can pull you up.
- You gotta trust me.
- No. I only trust the facts.
And all the facts say that you're the Evil Masked Figure.
What does your heart say?
I don't know.
It's beating too loud for me to hear.
Look deeper. You gotta trust me.
You saved my life.
Patrick!
Velma!
That thing just flew off with Patrick!
The best we can do for him is get that control panel back where it belongs.
Where is it?
I gave it to Shaggy and Scooby.
That's weird. It sounded like you just said you gave it to Shaggy and Scooby.
I think we lost them.
Scoob, we made it.
You should never have locked those locks.
Now you're stuck in here with me!
The Cotton Candy Glob.
- Cotton Candy Glob?
- Cotton Candy Glob?
Yes.
- No! I'll give you cavities!
- I don't see Shaggy and Scooby anywhere.
Poor guys are probably running around helpless and terrified.
This is like the greatest day of our lives, Scoob.
Finally, a monster we could sink our teeth into.
I'm kind of thirsty. I wonder if there's a Liter-sized Soda Glob anywhere?
- Come on, guys. We have to hurry.
- Come on.
We have to get this control panel back before...
Before exactly that happens.
At last I have you, Mystery Inc.
You'll never make it past my monsters.
We've taken these jerks before, gang.
Let's do it again.
- Fred!
- It's not them you need to worry about.
Now you are stuck in my trap.
Daphne!
Daph!
Gotcha!
Go! Daphne!
Run, Velma! Run, Velma!
Shaggy! Here!
Come on!
Soon your friends will be dead...
...and Coolsville destroyed.
My revenge will be final...
...and there's nothing you can do about it.
Help, Velma!
Daphne?
- Shaggy?
- Scoob...
Dude.
- Like, frostbite never felt so good!
- Stop them!
- Go long, Scoob!
- Okay.
Here, doggy-doggy.
Rail glide!
- Watch this!
- Roll barrel!
Hang time!
End of the line, Doo!
Come here, you worthless mutt!
Scoob!
You can do it, buddy!
You can't do this to me!
Who do you think you are?
Scooby...
...Dooby...
...Doo!
No!
My monsters!
You did it! You saved us all!
I know.
Do you know the identity of the Evil Masked Figure behind it all?
If our hunch is correct, the Evil Masked Figure is...
No!
Heather Jasper-Howe.
But she was at the museum when the Masked Figure was on the roof.
You almost had me there, didn't you?
Lucky for her, she had an assistant helping her with her evil plans.
Ned.
When I realized
she was the Evil Masked Figure...
... he quickly changed into her costume.
But why did she do it?
Because Heather Jasper-Howe is actually...
...Doctor Jonathan Jacobo.
The original Pterodactyl Ghost.
But how do you know this?
A photo, taken of Jacobo in front of the Coolsonian.
Jacobo supposedly died a year before construction even began.
So Jacobo survived that fall off the prison wall.
He adapted the false Heather Jasper-Howe persona to turn the press against us.
Then he framed Old Man Wickles...
...by putting that book and
The Black Knight Ghost in his mansion.
As if you getting the lead in My Fair Lady wasn't enough!
I was an excellent Eliza!
You were too act-y.
And stealing my Tater Tots!
You kept saying you felt puffy!
And the real identity of Ned is...
Ned.
I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling punks...
...and their dumb dog!
- You were a dude this whole time?
- Of course, dummkopf.
But we cuddled.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Listen, Velma, I know that must have seemed very suspicious...
...but you've got to believe me that I had nothing to do with...
I trust you.
Listen, Patrick.
I'm not glamorous or mysterious.
But one thing that's true is...
...that I like you.
Very much.
And I would like to go out with you again.
But this time, I will go as myself.
Yeah, I'd like that, more than anything.
Okay.
Mystery Inc.! Mystery Inc.!
They're cheering for us again.
Yep.
I always thought that was the best thing in the world.
I guess I found something a little bit better.
- Can we get your photo in this?
- Yes.
Yikes! A monster!
- Like, Scoob, it's me, man!
- Shaggy!
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
Sing it up, Ruben.
Everybody.
Come on, Shaggy.
Get down.
Game Boy Advance secret code.

BBra
What are you doing?
We don't stop here.
Get out of the car.
The boys found this on the floor, in the back of the Caddy.
Yeah, they showed me.
Could be unrelated.
Could be.
Any of those dead kids wearing pearl earrings?
No.
Could be someone's missing, maybe.
That’s what I'm thinking.
Just one more bag after that.
I just wanted to come here.
To Winkie's?
This Winkie's.
Okay. Why this Winkie's?
It’s kind of embarrassing.
Go ahead.
- I had a dream about this place.
- Oh, boy.
See what I mean?
Okay, so you had a dream about this place.
Tell me.
Well... it’s the second one I've had.
But they're both the same.
They start out that I'm in here but... it’s not day or night... it’s kind of half-night, you know?
But it looks just like this.
Except for the light.
And I'm scared like I can't tell you.
Of all people... you're standing right over there.
By that counter.
You're in both dreams and you're scared.
I get even more frightened when
I see how afraid you are, and... then I realize what it is.
There's a man... in back of this place.
He's the one who's doing it.
I can see him through the wall.
I can see his face.
I hope that I never see that face ever outside of the dream.
That’s it.
So... you came to see if he's out there.
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
Right then.
It’s around the back.
Dan! Dan, are you all right?
What is it, Dan? Dan?
Hello?
The girl is still missing.
- Talk to me.
- The same.
I can't believe it.
Well, it's time to say good-bye, Betty.
- It’s been so nice traveling with you.
- Thank you, Irene.
I was so excited and nervous. It was sure great to have you to talk to.
- I'll watch for you on the big screen.
- Okay, Irene.
Won't that be the day?
Good luck, Betty dear.
- Take care of yourself and be careful.
- I will.
Thanks, again.
Betty, it was so nice meeting you.
All the luck in the world.
Thank you.
- My bags?
- Where to?
1612, Hayvenhurst.
Got it.
- Ten bucks says you're Betty.
- Yes, I am, Mrs. Lenoix.
- It is Mrs. Lenoix, isn't it?
- In all my living glory, baby.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Call me Coco. Everybody else does.
- Wait there and I'll go get the key.
- Okay, Coco.
Wilkins!
Wilkins!
If that damn dog craps in the courtyard one more time...
I'm just gonna bank his little butt for breakfast! You don't have any pets?
- No, I don't.
- They're allowed.
I just don't like them in here for obvious reasons.
There was a man that lived here once that had a prizefighting kangaroo.
You just wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard.
Let’s go see your aunt’s apartment.
It’s a good one.
I can hardly wait.
- It’s unbelievable!
- I told you.
You and your aunt probably have an understanding, so here's the key.
And if you need anything, just give a holler.
Everybody in this building is pretty much okay with me... or they wouldn't be here.
If you like, later on
I'll introduce you around.
Well, no hard feelings if you don't.
I'm sorry. My aunt Ruth didn't tell me someone was gonna be here.
- I'm so sorry.
- It’s okay.
I'm Ruth's niece. My name is Betty.
I'm sure she told you I was coming.
There was an accident.
I came here.
I understand. I saw the dress.
I'm sorry. Are you all right?
What happened?
A car... a car accident.
Are you okay?
I think so.
I was just... taking a shower.
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
I'll let you get back to that.
I'm gonna get unpacked.
What’s your name?
I'm sorry, I'll get out of here.
We can talk later.
My name is...
Rita.
Do you work with my aunt?
- No, I...
- I'm sorry... it's none of my business.
She has pretty red hair.
She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie... that's being made in Canada, but I guess you already know that.
I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years.
Unless, of course, I'm discovered and become a movie star.
Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star... but sometimes people end up being both. So... that is, I guess you'd say, the story of why I came here.
I'm sorry. I'm just so excited to be here.
I just came here from Deep River,
Ontario, and now I'm in this... dream place!
Well, you can imagine how I feel.
Sit down.
Where were you hurt?
- We should call a doctor.
- No.
- But this could be serious.
- No, I need to sleep.
If you have a concussion, you shouldn't sleep.
I'll be okay if I sleep.
I just need to lie down here and sleep.
You see, Adam, there are some suggestions... that ought to be brought forward.
And I know you said you would entertain suggestions.
And that's all anybody here is asking you to do.
- What are you talking about?
- An open mind.
You're in the process of recasting your lead actress, and I'm... we are asking you to keep an open mind.
What was it the last time?
- Okay, lets try the next one.
- He's not gonna like it.
We'll see.
Castigliani brothers!
Let me introduce you around.
Please... take a seat. This is Mr. Darby, whom you know.
And this is the director,
Adam Kesher.
And his manager,
Robert Smith.
She's very pretty.
May I offer you gentlemen anything?
- Espresso.
- Nothing.
- What's the photo for?
- One espresso.
No, that's it.
I think you're going to enjoy your espresso this time.
I've done quite a bit of research... knowing how hard you are to please.
This one comes highly recommended.
- What's the photo for?
- It's a recommendation.
A recommendation to you, Adam.
- It's not a recommendation.
- This is the girl.
What girl? For what?
What is this, Ray?
We'd be happy to put her on the list for considerations.
You'd be pleased to know, there's quite a bit of interest in this role.
Interest? There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
This is the girl.
- Ray, take care of this.
- Hold on, hold on, Adam.
Hold on?
There's no way!
There's no way!
Napkin.
Pardon?
Napkin.
Of course.
Excuse me.
Is that all, sir?
- Shit.
- Sorry. That was highly recommended.
That is considered one of the finest espressos in the world!
What's going on here? There is no way that girl is in my movie!
- This is the girl.
- Hey, that girl is not in my film!
It's no longer your film.
This is the girl.
Castigliani brothers get out of that limo?
- The two guys in dark suits?
- Yeah.
- Yes.
- Leave that door open.
Castigliani brothers?
Beat it, pal.
Good afternoon, Mr. Roque.
Her name is Camilla Rhodes.
The director doesn't want her.
Do you want him replaced?
I know they said...
Then?
Then... that means we should...?
Yes?
Shut everything down?
Is that something that...
Do you want us to shut everything down?
Then we'll shut everything down.
Oh, man, that's unheard of.
An accident like that, who could have foreseen that, man?
- It's unreal, right?
- Yeah.
Unbelievable, man.
So, bro? God, you look good.
- What have you been doing?
- You know, just... doing some stuff for this guy.
Are you making ends meet?
Hardly.
I know, man, look at my digs.
Times are tough, bro.
Hey... man, it's not that bad.
I hope you're not gonna get in any trouble.
That was just a thing, man.
That story? That made you laugh!
- That was a funny story, man.
- Fucking car accident!
Hey, so that's... that's it, huh?
That's Ed's famous black book.
The history of the world... in phone numbers.
Oh, man!
Something bit me bad!
Hey, man!
She's hurt real bad! Could you come here and call on the phone, please?
She's hurt real bad! You gotta come in here and call the hospital!
Come on, man! I'm serious about this!
I can't do everything by myself!
Hey, man.
Oh, man!
Aunt Ruth, I'll try. I'm gonna study those lines until I know them... inside out.
Either right here on this fabulous leather couch... or I'll take them with a coffee into the courtyard... like a regular movie star.
I got a real shock to find your friend Rita here.
She was in the shower and I opened the door!
Rita!
What do you mean?
She was in an accident.
Rita. Your friend.
No, Coco unlocked the door.
No, she didn't see her.
She's sleeping.
I'm sure there's some explanation for this. I don't think we have to do that.
Please, don't worry. Aunt Ruth, we don't need the police.
You're awake.
I think I misunderstood.
I thought you knew my aunt and that's why you were here.
I just talked to my aunt on the phone and she wants me to call the police.
Rita?
I'm sorry, I...
What is it, Rita?
I thought when I woke up...
I thought sleep would do it.
What's wrong?
I just don't know who I am.
- What do you mean? You're Rita.
- No, I'm not.
I don't know what my name is.
I don't know who I am.
This is your purse.
Your name must be in your purse.
You wanna know, don't you?
- Yes, but...
- Open it.
- Sure you don't want anything?
- Not here.
- Thanks.
- A drink or something?
No. Thanks, though.
I'll take a cigarette, if you have one.
Yeah, just reach inside my shirt pocket there.
Any new girls on the street lately?
No.
I haven't seen any.
A brunette?
Maybe a little beat-up?
No.
- Keep your eyes open for me, okay?
- Sure.
You bet you will.
That money... you don't know where it came from?
When you think of them, the money and the key... does it make you remember anything?
There's something... something... there.
What did you say?
- They fired everyone.
- Who fired everyone?
Ray did!
Wait! I'm talking on the phone.
They closed the set. Everybody's gone. You'd better get down here.
No.
You've gotta talk to Ray.
You've gotta fix this.
I'm going home.
Home?
Meet me at the office, we gotta do something. You gotta do something!
- I'm going home, Cynthia.
- Adam, this isn't like you.
Please, come to the office. There's gotta be something we can do!
I'm going home.
I wonder where you were going.
Mulholland Drive.
Mulholland Drive?
That's where I was going.
Mulholland Drive.
Maybe that's where the accident was.
There must be a police report.
We could call.
We could call anonymously just to see if there was an accident.
It'll be just like in the movies!
We'll pretend to be someone else.
I wanna walk around, anyway.
I'm in Hollywood and
I haven't even seen any of it.
Come on, Rita, do you feel up to it?
Okay.
But just... just to see.
Just to see if there was an accident... on Mulholland Drive.
Lorraine?
You're home?
Lorraine?
Now you've done it!
Just forget you ever saw it.
It's better that way.
What the hell are you even doing here?
What are you doing?
That's my jewelry!
- That bastard. You bastard!
- He's probably upset, Lorraine.
What are you doing?
Stop it!
Stop it!
Adam, stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
You're hurting me! Gene!
You're hurting me!
That ain't no way to treat your wife. I don't care what she's done.
Throw him out!
Throw him out!
Damn you, Adam!
Throw him out!
Get out!
Let's hide it.
There's one.
- Los Angeles Police Department.
- I'm inquiring about an accident...
...last night on Mulholland Drive.
- I'll connect you to Traffic.
- Sergeant Baker.
- Hi, I'm inquiring...
I heard a sound last night that sounded sort of like a car crash.
I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Yes, there was.
- Can you tell me what happened?
- No, I can't.
- Was anyone hurt?
- May I have your name, please?
There was an accident.
He wouldn't tell me anything else, but that was your accident, Rita.
Maybe there's something about it in the papers.
Come on, I'll buy you a cup of coffee and we can see.
Maybe it happened so late it's not in today's paper.
There's nothing?
Not that I can see.
That's okay.
Thanks.
Diane.
Will that be all?
Would you like your check?
Rita, you want something?
- No, just... just the coffee.
- We'll take our check.
What is it, Rita?
I remember something.
I remember something!
- What is it?
- Diane Selwyn.
Maybe that's my name!
"D. Selwyn." It's the only one.
I'm gonna call.
- It is strange to be calling yourself.
- Maybe it's not me.
Hello, it's me.
Leave a message.
That's not my voice.
But I know her!
Maybe that isn't Diane Selwyn's voice. Maybe that's your roommate.
Or if it is Diane Selwyn, she could tell you who you are.
Maybe.
Maybe, maybe...
Adam Kesher?
- Adam Kesher?
- Get lost!
- This is Adam Kesher's house.
- Like hell it is! Get out now!
Get out!
Adam Kesher?
Get out of here!
He's never coming back! Ever!
- Bastard.
- I guess you don't understand English.
She said leave. Here's the door.
Gene!
Get out!
Get out!
Adam Kesher?
- Yeah, what is it, Cookie?
- I'm sorry, Mr. Kesher... but there seems to be some problem with your credit cards.
What? I pay you cash, Cookie.
Listen, two guys from your bank came by.
My bank?
- How'd they know I was here?
- I don't know.
What'd they say?
They said to tell you that you're maxed out at your bank... and that your line of credit has been canceled.
That's unbelievable.
Well, look...
I don't know what's going on.
That is so much baloney.
- I got enough cash for you, Cookie.
- I know, I know. Don't worry.
But I'm sorry, it's my duty to inform you... listen, man, whoever you're hiding from... they know where you are.
Right.
I'm sorry.
Hello?
- Someone maybe shut off my money.
- I know. Where are you, Adam?
- Sorry, what do you mean you know?
- Somebody called... they told me you were as good as broke. So I made a few calls.
- And?
- You're broke.
I'm not broke!
I know, but you're broke.
Where are you?
- I'm at Cookie's, downtown.
- Do you know somebody called...
"The Cowboy"?
- "The cowboy"?
- Yeah.
"The Cowboy". This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you.
Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.
Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to go see the Cowboy.
Should I wear my 1O-gallon hat and my six-shooters?
Something tells me that this guy is connected to what's happening.
Adam, I think you should do it, and you should do it right away.
- What's going on, Cynthia?
- It's been a very strange day.
And getting stranger.
Where do I meet this Cowboy? Do you have to ride out to the range?
Sort of, funny boy.
If I tell him the meeting's on... you'll go to the top of the Beachwood
Canyon, there's a corral up there...
...where he'll be.
- You've gotta be kidding me.
Will you meet with him?
Yeah.
Sure. This has been that kind of a day. When?
I'll call him right away and then I'll call you back.
You know, you could stay at my place, if you wanted.
- I don't think that'd be a good idea.
- I was just offering a place to stay.
Yes, and I appreciate the offer,
Cynthia. I'll find a place.
Just go on and give that cowboy a yodel and get on back to me.
Okay. But you don't know what you're missing.
Just get along, little doggie.
And call me back.
It's right about here. Sierra Bonita.
It's not too far away.
What's wrong with that?
I'm not sure about this.
I know you're afraid of something.
We'll be careful. I promise.
Tomorrow. We'll go over there... and we'll find out.
It'll be okay.
It's probably Coco.
- Yes, may I help you?
- Someone is in trouble!
Who are you?
What are you doing in Ruth's apartment?
She's letting me stay here.
I'm her niece. My name's Betty.
No, it's not!
That's not what she said.
Someone is in trouble!
Something bad is happening!
I'm sorry, but I don't know who you are and...
Louise?
What are you doing, Louise?
I've been trying to get hold of you since 3 o'clock this afternoon.
That one is in my room and she won't leave!
I want you to get her out.
I want you to get her out now.
This is Louise Bonner.
I'm sure she meant well.
Louise, this is Betty, this is Ruth's niece.
I was on my way over here to see
Betty. Betty is a young actress.
I was delivering some faxed pages of a scene for a big audition tomorrow.
- Well, here they are, honey.
- Thank you.
Come along now, Louise.
I'll take you home.
I'm sorry.
It happens sometimes. Come on.
No, she said it was someone else who was in trouble.
Stop it, Louise!
I'm taking you home. Come on.
- Good night, Betty.
- Good night.
Good night.
Cowboy...
- Howdy.
- Howdy to you.
Beautiful evening.
Thank you for coming all the way up here to see me from that... nice hotel downtown.
No problem.
What's on your mind?
Well, now. Here's a man who wants to get right down to it.
Kind of anxious to get to it, are you?
Whatever.
A man's attitude... a man's attitude goes some ways the way his life will be.
Is that something you might agree with?
Sure!
Did you answer because that's what you thought I wanted to hear... or did you think about what I said... and answered 'cause you truly believe that to be right?
I agree with what you said. Truly.
What'd I say?
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
So since you agree... you must be a person who does not care about the good life.
How's that?
Well, stop for a little second... and think about it.
Can you do that for me?
Okay. I'm thinking.
No, you're not. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinking.
Now, I want you to think and stop being a smart aleck.
Can you try that for me?
Look, where's this going?
What do you want me to do?
There's sometimes a buggy.
How many drivers does a buggy have?
One.
So let's just say
I'm driving this buggy.
And if you fix your attitude, you can ride along with me.
I want you to go back to work tomorrow.
You were recasting the lead actress.
Audition many girls for the part.
When you see the girl that was shown to you earlier today, you will say:
"This is the girl."
The rest of the cast can stay.
That's up to you.
But that lead girl is not up to you.
Now, you will see me one more time if you do good.
You'll see me two more times if you do bad.
Good night.
- You're still here?
- I thought that's what you wanted.
- Nobody wants you here!
- Really?
My parents are right upstairs.
They think you've left!
- So? Surprise.
- I can call them. I can call my dad.
- But you won't.
- Lf you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work! You're playing a dangerous game here.
You know what I want.
It's not that difficult.
Get out!
Get out before I call my dad!
He trusts you!
You're his best friend.
This will be the end of everything.
What about you?
What will your dad think about you?
Stop! Just stop it! That's what you said from the beginning.
If I tell what happened, they'll arrest you and put you in jail.
Get out of here before...
- Before what?
- Before...
...I kill you.
- Then they'd put you in jail.
Then I cry, cry, cry, and then I say with big emotion...
"I hate you! I hate us both!"
- Such a lame scene.
- But you are really good.
Thank you, darling.
Hi, there. Who are you?
Betty?
Betty, can I see you outside for a minute?
What is it, Coco?
Your aunt called.
I was afraid of that.
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
It's just for a night or two.
Until she finds her own place.
I tried to explain that to aunt Ruth but the connection was bad... and her plane was leaving, and she got it all mixed up.
I kept telling her that it was my friend Rita... and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas.
- Look at me straight, sweetie.
- Coco, she's very nice.
Honey, you're a good kid... but what you're telling me is a load of horse puckey.
Even though it comes from a good place.
I'm gonna trust you to sort this thing out.
- Thank you.
- Don't make me out to be a sucker.
Louise Bonner said there is trouble in there, remember last night?
Well, sometimes she's wrong... but if there is trouble, get rid of it.
Is everything all right?
- Is it bad for you that I'm here?
- No, no, everything is A-Okay.
Now, I've gotta fix that sandwich.
And my audition is in one hour!
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours.
- And don't drink all the Coke.
- Good luck.
When I get back, I'll keep the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
"Voilà!"
Betty Elms, I would like you to meet...
Jack Tutman, my assistant.
Woody Katz, who we have cast in the part of Chuck... and will do the scene with you.
Bob Rooker, our director... and Julie Chadwick.
Now, our surprise guest,
Lynne James.
Alas, we can't afford her to cast our show but... well, as casting agents go, she is the best.
Why, thank you, Wally.
Hello, Betty.
- Very pleased to meet you.
- This is my assistant, Nikki.
And the ever lovely Martha. Martha
Johnson, whom you met out front.
Hi.
So, shall we give it a go?
Would you like a water, a coffee before we begin?
No, I'm fine.
Well then, let's everyone take a seat.
Betty, why don't you join Woody over there and we'll play the scene.
Bob, do you have anything you wish to say?
Something to Betty before we begin?
No. It's not a contest.
The two of them... with themselves.
So don't play it for real... until it gets real.
Okay.
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
What?
I wanna play this one nice and close like we did with that other girl... what's her name? With the black hair. It felt good, what do you think?
That's good, Woody. Just don't rush that line again. I told you... the line where you say:
"Before what?"
Bobby, acting is reacting.
I just play off them. They all say:
"They're gonna arrest you", like that, and: "They'll put you in jail."
They say it the same way.
So when they say it, I just react.
- What's your name?
- Betty.
Betty, look. You don't rush it,
I don't rush it, okay?
Now, we're gonna play this nice and close just like in the movies, okay?
Dad's best friend goes to work.
Bob?
And... action!
You're still here.
I came back.
- I thought that's what you wanted.
- Nobody wants you here.
Really?
My parents are right upstairs.
They think you've left.
So, surprise!
- I can call them, I can call my dad.
- But you won't.
You're playing a dangerous game here.
If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not gonna work.
You know what I want.
It's not that difficult.
Get out.
Get out before I call my dad.
He trusts you. You're his... best friend.
This will be the end of everything.
What about you? What'll your dad think about you?
Stop.
Stop it.
That's what you said from the beginning.
If I tell them what happened, they will arrest you and put you in jail.
So get out of here... before...
Before what?
Before...
I kill you.
Well, then they'd put you in jail.
I hate you.
I hate us both.
- I'm gonna take her over there.
- Yeah, big time.
Well, there it was.
Yeah, there it was, all right. Baby, you got a way with you. Really.
Bob?
Very good. Really.
I mean, it was forced maybe, but still humanistic.
Very good. Really!
Really.
Oh, I thank you, Betty.
And I really mean that, sincerely.
I mean, it was... extraordinary.
You've done your aunt proud today.
I'm going to tell her that first chance I get.
Now, you and I are going to speak again very soon.
- Thank you, Mr. Brown.
- Thank you, Wally.
I'm sure you all have a lot to talk about. We'll walk Betty out.
Yes, indeed.
And it was our pleasure, Lynne.
Don't you be a stranger around here.
We'd love to have you here.
- Come on, Betty.
- Thank you again, Mr. Brown.
And it was nice meeting all of you.
Bye.
Bye!
She's a slam-dunk! Where the hell did you find her?
God, that was awful!
Not you, Betty. You were stellar, and I mean that. But poor Wally.
He'll never get that picture made.
Wally's days were up 2O years ago.
You know Woody Katz is only doing it for a favor.
And the cast they have so far is terrible.
Oh, God, terrible!
That poor old fool Wally.
He was very nice and he seems so sweet.
And Wally... Mr. Brown is a very close friend of my aunt's.
Don't get me wrong, I love Wally.
I ought to, I was married to him for 1O years.
And I love actors. All actors.
We just get a little catty sometimes.
We want to take you across and introduce you to a director... who's a head above the rest.
He's got a project you will kill for.
Knock right out of the park!

Thank you very much for coming in.
I know how busy you are.
Are you kidding me? I loved the script.
Just show me where to sign.
I love you, but there's no way they're gonna let me cast this thing... until I've seen everyone. I'll let you know as soon as I can.
I know you will. Because my manager is gonna be bugging you. And me!
- My pleasure. Now get outta here.
- You're so cruel to me.
- I'm the girl who's playing this part.

Playback and action.
Why haven't I told you?
Oh, baby, I told
Every little star
Just how sweet I think you are
Why haven't I told you?
- Get Jason over here.
- Cindy, Adam wants to see Jason.
Made my heart an open book
Why haven't I told you?
Friends ask me
Am I in love
I always answer “yes"
Might as well confess
If the answer's yes
Maybe you may love me too
Oh, my darling, if you do
- Why haven't you told me?
- Did you want to tell something?
This is the girl.
Excellent choice, Adam.
Oh, my goodness.
I have to be somewhere.
I promised a friend.
- I'm sorry, I must go.
- Now?
Should be around here.
259O. That's it.
Up there!
Does it look familiar?
- Don't stop!
- What is it? What do you see?
- Those men, in front, in the car.
- Do you know them?
Keep going.
Go around to the back.
Selwyn, number 12.
Now you got me scared.
You see?
I told you there was nothing to be afraid of.
Betty, wait. Wait!
Don't.
No one's home.
Yes?
Diane?
Number 17.
But it said number 12.
I switched apartments with her.
She's in 17.
It's down at the end, on the left.
But she hasn't been around for a few days.
We'll leave her a note.
I'll go with you.
She still got some of my stuff.
You go ahead.
I gotta get that.
- Guess you're not Diane Selwyn.
- Guess I'm not.
There's still no one home, I guess.
- What are you doing?
- Come on, help me in.
Come on, I'll open the front door.
No!
Come on.
Come on!
I know what you're doing.
I know what you have to do.
But let me do it.
Let me do it.
You look like someone else.
Good night, Betty.
You don't have to wear that in the house.
What?
The wig!
I was just looking at myself again.
I'll take it off to sleep.
You don't have to sleep on that couch.
- No, it's okay.
- No, it's not. This is a huge bed.
Come on, just get in and get a good night sleep.
It's more comfortable than the couch, isn't it?
Thank you, Betty.
It's nothing. I shouldn't have let you sleep on the couch last night.
No, I mean... thank you for everything.
You're welcome.
Good night, sweet Betty.
Good night.
Have you ever done this before?
I don't know.
Have you?
I want to with you.
I'm in love with you.
I'm in love with you.
Silence.
Silence.
Silence.
There's no band.
There's no band.
There's no orchestra.
Silence!
- Rita?
- There's no band.
Rita, wake up!
It's okay. It's okay.
No, it's not okay.
What's wrong?
Go with me somewhere.
It's two o'clock. It's two o'clock in the morning.
Go with me somewhere.
Sure.
Now?
Right now.
There's no band!
There is no band!
This is all... a tape recording.
There's no band, and yet... we hear a band.
If we want to hear a clarinet... listen...
A muted trombone.
A muted trumpet.
It's all recorded.
There's no band!
It is all... a tape.
It is an illusion.
Listen!
Ladies and gentlemen, let Club Silencio introduce to you...
"La Llorona de Los Angeles".
Rebekah del Rio.
I was all right
For a while
I could smile for a while
But I saw you last night
You held my hand so tight
As you stopped to say hello
You wished me well and you
Couldn't tell
That I've been crying
Over you
Crying
Over you
Since you said “so long"
I've been miserable and alone
Lonesome and crying
Crying
Crying
Crying
It's hard to understand
That upon seeing you again
I'd be crying
I thought
That I was over you
But it's true, so true
I love you even more
Much more than I did before
But darling, what can I do
You don't love me anymore
And I will always be
Crying over you
Crying over you
Your love has captured
The whole of my heart
That was left crying
Crying
Crying
Crying
Betty?
Betty?
Where are you?
Hey, pretty girl.
Time to wake up.
- Where have you been?
- What do you want?
My lamp and dishes.
Come on, Diane, it's been three weeks.
I put your dishes in that box.
- That's my ashtray.
- Take it.
- Anytime.
- I'm just making sure, Diane.
This is it?
By the way, those two detectives came by again looking for you.
Camilla!
You've come back.
What was that you were saying, beautiful?
I said... you drive me wild.
We shouldn't do this anymore.
Don't say that.
Don't ever say that.
Don't, Diane!
Stop it!
Diane, stop!
I've tried to tell you this before.
It's him, isn't it?
I'm not trying to show you how to do the scene, but just... watch me and I think you'll understand what I'm getting at.
Don't sit so rigid, just... just relax.
Now, the two of you are alone and it's real comfortable.
Like you've known each other forever.
Even if you don't say anything, it's real comfortable.
Hank, can you just clear the set?
There's too many people around here.
- Let's get this worked out.
- Clear the set!
Everyone have a cup of coffee.
- Everyone, please!
- Can Diane stay?
Yeah, sure, Diane can stay.
Hank, let Diane stay!
Diane!
Now, when she starts to cry, don't pull her towards you.
Let her fall into you.
Just let her fall.
And when you kiss her... it's just a continuation of that move.
There's no break.
Kill the lights!
Don't be mad.
Don't make it be like this.
Oh, sure, you want me to make this easy for you.
No fucking way!
It's not gonna be!
- It's not easy for me!
- Diane!
Hello, it's me.
Leave a message.
Diane?
- Hello?
- Diane?
Camilla.
Diane, the car's waiting.
Are you okay?
You coming?
Good. It means so much to me.
Go on. The car's right outside your house.
It's been waiting, okay?
Okay.
It's 698O, Mulholland Drive.
Mulholland Drive.
What are you doing?
We don't stop here.
A surprise.
Shortcut.
Come on, sweetheart.
It's beautiful.
A secret path.
Perfect timing.
Welcome, Diane.
Well...
Here's to love.
Here's to love.
Here she is!
I don't believe you met my mother.
Hi. I'm Diane Selwyn.
Just call me Coco, everybody does. Pleased to meet you.
Well, let's eat!
I'm starving!
I'm sorry I was late.
I'm from Deep River, Ontario.
- A small town.
- So you rolled in here from Canada.
I always wanted to come here.
I won this jitterbug contest.
That sort of led to acting.
You know, wanting to act.
When my aunt died...
Anyway, she left me some money.
- She worked here.
- In the movies?
Yes.
How did you meet Camilla?
- On the "Sylvia North Story".
- Camilla was great in that.
I never went to
Casablanca with Luigi.
- What a pity!
- Then go!
I wanted the lead so bad.
Anyway, Camilla got the part.
The director...
Bob Rooker?
Yes.
He didn't think so much of me.
Anyway, that's when we became friends.
She helped me... getting some parts in some of her films.
I see.
So I got the pool, and she got the pool man.
I couldn't believe it. I wanted to buy that judge a Rolls Royce.
Sometimes, good things happen.
So I guess we've saved the best for last.
- Do you want to tell them?
- No, you tell them.
Camilla and I... are going to be...
Sorry about that.
No, I'm fine.
This is the girl.
Don't show me this fucking thing here.
It's just an actress' photo resume. Everybody's got one.
You got the money?
I sure do.
Okay, now, once you hand that over to me, it's a done deal.
You sure you want this?
More than anything in this world.
When it's finished, you'll find this where I told you.
What's it open?
Silencio.
{1587}{1618}Don't move!
{1627}{1693}I know it's difficult,|but please, try not to move.
{1696}{1729}What's your name?
{1740}{1772}Get me out of here.
{1775}{1795}What we got?
{1796}{1832}This one was thrown from the car.
{1834}{1849}I can't move!
{1850}{1913}Caucasian male, mid-thirties.
{1916}{1990}Open wrist fracture,|massive head trauma.
{2003}{2050}I'm not getting a pulse here.
{2053}{2113}Okay,|I need a collar and a saline drip.
{2117}{2146}Where does it hurt?
{2147}{2204}I can't move my fucking legs!
{2207}{2289}I wanna get a line in|before he loses consciousness.
{2294}{2334}Fourteen gauge or browns?
{2337}{2388}Fourteens, and some bags, now!
{2401}{2433}Come on, come on.
{2462}{2510}I'm gonna give you something|for the pain.
{2568}{2618}We're gonna|get you out of here.
{2621}{2661}Keep clam.
{2663}{2728}That's it. Good
{2749}{2775}Move it.
{2785}{2811}Move it.
{2812}{2832}Shit!
{6308}{6379}Bitch, ass, motherfucker
{6380}{6458}"Peter Pie assed nigger"
{6463}{6505}Nat,|could you turn that off, please.
{6508}{6572}How the fuck you|gonna bite somebody else's dick, nigger?
{6575}{6621}Yours ain't long enough to|put in your mouth
{6624}{6650}Come on, Nat.
{6706}{6752}...make it rough punk ass
{6755}{6838}Let's talk about the one|who had my back
{6839}{6897}Down in the west coast|So let me kick it
{6901}{6970}Who the motherfucker|who calls himself quick
{6976}{7012}How can you|listen to that stuff?
{7014}{7054}"Cutting up my ho".
{7057}{7083}It's just words.
{7085}{7123}It's not like anybody|takes them seriously.
{7125}{7165}That's what I'm worried about.
{7168}{7219}Besides, it's the only way|I'll ever get to hear them.
{7222}{7282}Please don't go on about|that concert, okay.
{7285}{7309}It's a music festival.
{7310}{7358}Whatever it is,|you're not going.
{7362}{7411}But all of my friends|are going.
{7500}{7549}You've never let me do anything|I wanted to.
{7552}{7643}That's not completely true.|You got to do what you wanted today?
{7648}{7746}While I sat waiting in front of your|father's house in the car for two hours.
{7871}{7943}You're listening on|your favorite radio station WSNP.
{8128}{8236}"You're an easy target.|Don't make him your pimp."
{8242}{8272}What is he going on about?
{8916}{8971}What is going on up there?
{9126}{9160}It's a delay or something.
{9162}{9196}Thank you, Nat.
{9198}{9253}What am I?|Like X-ray Vision Man?
{9748}{9780}Oh, shit.
{9782}{9811}What?
{9812}{9852}Oh my God, is somebody dead?
{9854}{9895}I don't know,|I don't wanna know.
{9897}{9917}I do.
{10056}{10076}Sorry.
{10937}{10982}Come alone, move it!
{14160}{14184}What is it?
{14258}{14279}It's nothing.
{14280}{14310}God, mom!
{14317}{14391}It's all right,|somebody must have put a little doll...
{14502}{14550}You're half asleep.
{14553}{14586}Pull in. I'm not, I'm fine.
{14589}{14636}Look,|there's a rest stop coming up.
{14645}{14719}It's late, I wanna get home.|You've got school tomorrow.
{14723}{14762}Not if I'm dead I don't!
{14787}{14851}My one and only prayer
{14864}{14932}Is that some day you'll care
{14940}{15004}My hopes, my dreams come true
{15018}{15084}My one and only you
{15093}{15154}No-one will ever know
{15168}{15236}How much I love so
{15250}{15311}My only prayer will be
{15325}{15385}Some day you'll care for me
{15388}{15493}But it's only make...
{15526}{15611}...believe
{15619}{15660}Praise the Lord.
{15685}{15733}Only a Christian|could be that happy.
{15751}{15793}White coffee, please.
{15796}{15830}A Red Bull.
{15896}{15994}Leave it to your father to move six|hours away to make my life easier.
{16063}{16130}Look, I'm sorry.|At least you had a weekend.
{16134}{16168}I had to spend mine,|all day yesterday, in the office.
{16170}{16215}It's not our fault your job's|not going well.
{16218}{16246}Who said it's not going well?
{16265}{16288}You do.
{16484}{16501}Thank you.
{16699}{16737}You're gonna keep on seeing things|in the middle of the road
{16739}{16781}if you keep talking those.
{16783}{16863}I had n sleep all last week.
{16954}{16984}You've changed.
{16986}{17052}Good. Who wants to be|the person I used to be?
{17064}{17097}The person who had me, you mean?
{17162}{17185}Where are you going?
{17202}{17246}To phone Geena. Am I allowed?
{17248}{17273}Can't you do that here?
{17275}{17334}I can't get a single.|Any other questions?
{17370}{17386}No.
{19773}{19796}Mom.
{19846}{19876}You ready?
{20480}{20509}Hey, buddy.
{20666}{20689}Let's go.
{20714}{20743}Let's wrap it up.
{21730}{21761}Jerk-off!
{21851}{21879}Hey, mom.
{21880}{21939}I told her we wouldn't mind|giving her a ride.
{21943}{21967}Hi.
{21998}{22050}She's going the same way as us.
{22214}{22242}GAME OVER
{22671}{22697}SERIOUS ACCIDENT
{22785}{22825}Have you got|your belly button pierced?
{22828}{22870}Yeah,|I got it done in Rajasthan.
{22873}{22906}Seat belt, Nat, please.
{22975}{23022}I'd love to go to India.
{23025}{23070}It totally turned me around.
{23073}{23092}Really?
{23093}{23134}Yeah, the people there are cool,|you know.
{23137}{23179}They don't worry about|material things.
{23182}{23272}Not like here, where traveling's|about what kind of car you drive.
{23276}{23320}It should be about|broadening the mind.
{23323}{23386}That's fine, as long as you've|got somebody to do the driving.
{23390}{23427}I can never wait to get home.
{23429}{23452}To your husband?
{23453}{23479}She's divorced.
{23480}{23502}That's too bad.
{23504}{23537}Not necessarily.
{23652}{23732}So what do your folks say about|you going to all these places?
{23736}{23837}It's funny, isn't it? In India they|have religious icons in their car.
{23843}{23900}What do we have?|Air fresheners.
{23935}{24013}I picked up this really amazing CD|out there. You wanna hear it?
{24018}{24049}Yeah, sure. Fuck me.
{25382}{25427}So, do you see him? Your dad?
{25442}{25456}Sometimes.
{25458}{25506}What kind of music|is this anyway?
{25531}{25563}Sometimes.
{25595}{25631}What about yours?
{25636}{25666}Your family?
{25668}{25707}We parted ways|a long time ago.
{25709}{25757}You know what they say,|you can choose your friends,
{25760}{25794}but yu can't choose your family.
{25803}{25828}Who says?
{25992}{26047}Sometimes family chooses you.
{26109}{26194}You can just drop me off at this|picnic area coming up on the right.
{27079}{27104}Here.
{27128}{27180}A very wise person|gave that to me once.
{27202}{27272}He said "nobody in|chains soared up to the sun".
{27331}{27381}Are you sure|we can't take you any further?
{27393}{27417}No.
{27418}{27454}Where are you going?
{27457}{27489}I'm not sure...
{27507}{27560}...but I never get lost any more.
{27643}{27671}So long.
{27910}{27944}Nice move.
{27947}{27973}What?
{27999}{28048}Oh no, mom, her CD.
{28057}{28090}Okay, don't panic.
{28838}{28864}She's not here.
{28865}{28914}She must be. Look for her.
{29320}{29360}Forgot your CD.
{30623}{30653}EAST
{30654}{30678}WEST
{31526}{31545}She's gone.
{31558}{31597}Mom,|what are you talking about?
{31606}{31673}How could she|just disappear in thirty seconds?
{31676}{31738}Don't worry.|She never gets lost.
{35277}{35301}Hello?
{35325}{35440}Oh my God, you're kidding?
{35459}{35507}Yeah, yeah, of course I do.
{35564}{35627}Yeah, but what happens|if it doesn't arrive in time?
{35675}{35699}We just passed some picnic area
{35700}{35788}with a grizzly|bear statue beside the road.
{35797}{35828}Are you sure?
{35849}{35890}Okay, we'll do that.
{35900}{35947}Thanks. Bye.
{36034}{36061}Anything to report?
{36062}{36107}Yeah,|I forgot my birthday present.
{36130}{36184}But dad said he can bring it|to the next rest stop.
{36206}{36235}You're kidding?
{36257}{36302}Call him up and tell him|to send it in the mail.
{36305}{36373}Don't be a drag, he said he could|meet us in thirty minutes.
{36377}{36436}After offering a ride to|Ms Barefoot Bombay?
{36440}{36506}I don't wanna stop again.
{36941}{36969}Thank you.
{37354}{37392}So what did your dad get you,|anyway?
{37426}{37503}I don't know why you're asking.|It's not like you're interested.
{37800}{37838}Who are all these people?
{37901}{37939}What are they all doing here?
{38019}{38062}What are we doing here?
{38455}{38536}It's natural to be afraid|of failure.
{38564}{38633}But it doesn't have to|limit us.
{38643}{38730}Or keep us from realizing|our own potential.
{38756}{38850}From creating opportunities for|success in the boardroom...
{38856}{38936}...on the playing fields|and in the bedroom.
{38947}{39067}We are bombarded with answers,|but are we asking the right questions?
{39073}{39159}Now, I want you|to do something for me.
{39170}{39203}Close your eyes.
{39240}{39270}Go on...
{39280}{39308}...just for a minute.
{39326}{39352}Close your eyes.
{39427}{39477}I want you to visualize...
{39515}{39543}...a door.
{39585}{39621}Now...
{39623}{39671}...reach into your pocket...
{39706}{39749}...where there is a key.
{39781}{39822}Feel it?
{39840}{39948}That key in your pocket...
{39953}{39995}...unlocks the door.
{40014}{40084}Only you can open the door.
{40118}{40208}Behind the door is the truth.
{40224}{40249}Go on...
{40281}{40329}...unlock the door.
{40343}{40380}Look inside.
{40398}{40460}Face the truth...
{40468}{40491}...Senga.
{40544}{40570}Hi, dad.
{40655}{40712}Yeah, okay, I'll see you outside.
{40768}{40836}Stay here.|I'll be back in a minute.
{41986}{42032}Senga, thanks for waiting.
{42035}{42059}Which time?
{42085}{42116}Let's see it then.
{42172}{42213}Come on, show me the present.
{42325}{42357}Well, this is great.
{42358}{42380}Not only do you lie to me,
{42381}{42429}but you go straight to your father|and sweet-talk him.
{42432}{42526}I didn't lie.|He asked me what I wanted.
{42531}{42616}Hold on, I didn't realize that|you two already talked about this.
{42621}{42637}If you had,|do you think she's old enough
{42637}{42705}to go off on her own for|a whole weekend in the wilderness?
{42709}{42736}She's not a kid any more.
{42739}{42802}She's not exactly|an adult either.
{42805}{42852}If you spent more time with her,|you'd understand that.
{42855}{42917}If you wanna go with her,|I don't have a problem in the world with this.
{42921}{42965}It's not about you|and me any more.
{42968}{43038}If you want to make a scene,|do it without me, okay?
{43042}{43086}This is something you two|have to sort out.
{43088}{43123}God, how familiar this sounds!
{43124}{43211}Dad, we talked about this.|Tell her what you think.
{43266}{43297}I'll call you, sweetheart, okay?
{43317}{43337}See you.
{43352}{43384}We'll do something special.
{43418}{43439}Dad!
{43537}{43578}I'm going and you can't stop me!
{43581}{43603}You want a bet?
{43683}{43706}Dad!
{43722}{43758}Get used to it, Nat.
{43759}{43824}Bailing out is the only thing|your father knows how to do well.
{43828}{43879}I'm not fucking surprised,|with you!
{43882}{43972}Why is it only your way is right|and nobody else has a say in the matter?
{43977}{44030}No wonder you screwed up|your marriage.
{44034}{44055}Stop it.
{44056}{44144}You're afraid I might get pregnant young|and screw up my life like you did?
{44148}{44189}Well I'm not that stupid.
{44192}{44202}Get in the car.
{44204}{44223}No.
{44242}{44305}Nat, get in the car now!
{44309}{44327}No.
{44328}{44365}Fuck you. I hate you.
{46864}{46900}Nat?
{47038}{47079}My daughter, she has long hair...
{47081}{47160}...we were staying right over there|a few minutes ago. Have you seen her?
{47165}{47181}Miss?
{47201}{47227}Pretty face, long hair?
{47228}{47254}Yes, yes, that's her.
{47256}{47284}I'm sure she went that way|with her friend.
{47285}{47302}What?
{47420}{47443}Natasha.
{47516}{47556}Natasha.
{47997}{48016}Nat?
{48126}{48154}Nat.
{48224}{48251}Oh God.
{48252}{48277}Nat.
{48483}{48498}Nat.
{48657}{48685}Nat.
{49030}{49085}You gotta help me.|It's my daughter.
{49089}{49160}These people, they took her. I don't|know who they are but she's gone.
{49164}{49189}Jesus, she's only fifteen!
{49190}{49226}Ma'am, you gotta take it easy.
{49228}{49274}They just took her.|You've gotta do something now!
{49277}{49373}I can't help you I if I can't|understand what you're saying.
{49392}{49450}Now, what does your daughter|look like?
{49454}{49566}She's tall and skinny with|medium brown hair to here.
{49575}{49638}I've got a picture. Here.
{49732}{49756}What was she wearing?
{49757}{49798}Denim jacket and blue jeans.
{49801}{49835}Please get out there|and do something.
{49837}{49875}Bear with me.
{49878}{49948}I need to ask these questions|in order to be able to help you.
{49958}{49981}What's her full name?
{49982}{50050}Natasha Wilson.
{50203}{50258}Was she upset in any way?|Has she done this kind of thing before?
{50262}{50333}No, no. Took her, okay?
{50340}{50440}It was a backpacker|and a couple in an RV.
{50503}{50590}Okay, Mrs. Wilson, you stay put,|so we know where to find you.
{50594}{50650}A local unit will be coming|shortly to get your full statement.
{50654}{50693}What if they leave the freeway?|What if they get away?
{50695}{50761}Ehicle out there does one hundred and fifty miles per ho
{50765}{50794}They won't get away.
{51759}{51828}Are you familiar with the words|of Jesus Christ?
{51844}{51929}Are you familiar with the words|"fuck off"?
{52790}{52824}Shit!
{56396}{56429}Nat?
{57027}{57052}Nat?
{57985}{58062}I don't like talking about|my past life...
{58066}{58136}...because it hurts me.
{58140}{58180}Really,|do we have to talk about this?
{58183}{58212}And your father?
{58213}{58280}I don't even know|who my dad was.
{58284}{58358}Not that my mother|even knew his last name.
{58395}{58433}And my mother died...
{58481}{58506}CHRISTINE
{58524}{58606}My parents... they were nice.
{58611}{58662}But, there were fucking boring.
{58665}{58740}I mean,|really fucking boring, okay.
{58754}{58862}And my brother, we were close.
{58870}{58966}We got along but we seemed, like,|totally different, I mean...
{58971}{59117}...he's a mechanic, and he's|gonna be that his whole life.
{63884}{63944}Touch it and|I'll rip your fucking neck off.
{63995}{64053}Put your foot down, bitch!
{64057}{64099}What have you done|with my daughter?
{64102}{64160}Shut the fuck up|and put your fucking foot down.
{64258}{64292}Faster!
{65736}{65817}Forty-five three four seven,|civilian call on nine 0 two.
{65821}{65899}Possible crashed or abandoned|vehicle by the side of the freeway...
{65903}{65970}...approximately three miles east|of junction thirty-seven.
{65974}{66046}Described as a dark SUV|or similar.
{66062}{66166}Vehicle remains upright,|unknown if persons inside.
{66562}{66651}Relax. You get any stiffer,|rigor mortis will set in.
{66757}{66805}Come on, Nat, relax.
{66808}{66881}I know how you feel.|I had to go through it myself.
{66890}{66982}You see, Nat, there's this|whole community of people...
{67001}{67035}...just like us.
{67038}{67098}You know,|it's like an extended family.
{67111}{67142}Only better.
{67165}{67222}It seems like ever since|I met The Father...
{67226}{67295}...my old life feels like it|belongs to someone else.
{67299}{67338}He makes us feel special,|like...
{67340}{67436}...we finally fit in or belong to|something bigger than ourselves.
{67451}{67508}He's the reason|we're all here together.
{67612}{67687}"No time for criticizing"
{67697}{67774}"Music hypnotizing"
{67790}{67874}"Everybody's temperature's rising"
{67881}{68068}"So get back"
{68639}{68680}How do you feel?
{68694}{68766}I feel...
{68770}{68805}...different.
{68815}{68854}Do you wanna look different?
{68883}{68906}Yeah.
{68913}{68945}Then come on.
{69857}{69894}You all right?
{69926}{69980}I just ran my car off the road.
{69984}{70006}Really?
{70078}{70128}There are a lot of|maniacs out here.
{70172}{70214}You're alive...
{70222}{70259}...that's the main thing.
{70439}{70501}Look, could you just...
{70505}{70553}...please get my car on the road?
{70563}{70604}Why don't you come with me?
{70628}{70677}It's not safe out on the freeway.
{71199}{71231}Should see to that cut.
{71550}{71585}Who is this?
{71586}{71621}That's my sister.
{71623}{71649}What's her name?
{71668}{71729}Christine. She's dead.
{72043}{72115}Do you wanna use my phone?|Call your husband?
{72119}{72139}No.
{72168}{72199}Maybe he's worried about you.
{72201}{72251}I said no.
{72728}{72764}I'm gonna make the next stop.
{72765}{72826}And there you can report|your accident to the police.
{72834}{72880}They can help you|find your daughter.
{73744}{73775}It's the Bradford district.
{73897}{73920}Right.
{73946}{73997}Thanks a lot. Right.
{74343}{74419}There's no record of|a reported abduction.
{74423}{74489}In fact, there's nothing matching|your daughter's description.
{74493}{74544}Of course not,|she's not a real police officer.
{74558}{74593}Do you have a photograph|of your daughter?
{74595}{74641}No, that woman took it.|I told you.
{74644}{74711}But I saw a picture of|another girl in the pick-up truck...
{74715}{74778}...and then I saw a cassette|of the very same girl...
{74782}{74814}What has this got to|d with your daughter?
{74816}{74861}If you stop|and think about it for a minute...
{74864}{74904}you'd see that|they're all in it together.
{74907}{75004}The recovery man, the backpacker,|the couple with the RV!
{75009}{75033}We have no record of|an officer responding.
{75034}{75091}No radio broadcasting,|no...
{75095}{75146}Why aren't you calling the|FBI right now
{75149}{75191}and reporting|my daughter missing?
{75194}{75227}These people are deranged!
{75228}{75250}Is that what they are?
{75279}{75307}Deranged?
{75510}{75555}That's her father.|My ex-husband.
{75558}{75618}That's his cell phone.|Call him.
{75811}{75855}Sorry to trouble you.
{75858}{75917}Detective Stephens here,|from Bradford Police Division.
{75929}{75945}I'm sitting here with a woman,
{75947}{76039}Senga Wilson,|she says she's your ex-wife.
{76068}{76132}Look, Detective,|before you go any further...
{76136}{76204}...there's something you|need to know about my ex-wife.
{76207}{76295}This isn't exactly the first time|I've gotten a call like this from the police.
{76300}{76334}Especially at this hour.
{76337}{76435}She's been on medication since|the divorce. She's delusional.
{76440}{76515}I understand you have a fifteen|year old daughter, Natasha, is that correct?
{76519}{76580}Yes, my daughter's|here with me now.
{76584}{76618}She's been with me all weekend.
{76619}{76645}Okay.
{76646}{76700}I'm afraid Senga's wasting|everyone's time.
{76734}{76771}I'm sorry I can't be|of more help, Detective.
{76774}{76819}Thank you for your time,|Mr. Wilson.
{76854}{76956}Your husband has just told me|that your daughter is safe at home with him.
{77006}{77046}Mrs. Wilson?
{77060}{77108}You know,|you're obviously very upset...
{77111}{77159}...but filing a fraudulent police|report is a crime.
{77163}{77203}You do realize that?
{77212}{77231}Now, look...
{77255}{77304}...if you're in a|domestic situation...
{77312}{77333}...that's okay.
{77345}{77384}Talk to one of|our female officers.
{77626}{77658}God damn it.
{80127}{80176}Come on.
{80179}{80213}Hi, you've reached|Lois and Marek.
{80216}{80243}Bastard.
{80245}{80340}It's natural to be|afraid of failure.
{80362}{80440}I remember what you remember.|I remember what you remember.
{80444}{80494}But it doesn't have to limit us.
{80497}{80604}Or keep us from|realizing our own potential.
{80623}{80698}From creating the opportunities|for success in the boardroom...
{80703}{80790}...on the playing fields|and in the bedroom.
{80826}{80935}We are bombarded with answers,|but are we asking the right questions?
{80993}{81016}Now...
{81017}{81059}...I want you to...
{81062}{81106}...do something for me.
{81234}{81272}Close your eyes.
{81309}{81341}Go on.
{81411}{81446}Just for a minute.
{81468}{81515}Face the truth.
{81530}{81578}She's gone.
{81622}{81668}She's with me now.
{81694}{81753}I know your secrets.
{81783}{81849}I remember what you remember.
{81859}{81893}Senga.
{82249}{82296}What have you done|with my daughter? Where is she?
{82349}{82389}What have you done with her?
{82392}{82425}Tell me where she is?
{82426}{82497}Ma'am, you have to leave|the restaurant right now.
{82588}{82632}I know what you're doing.
{86469}{86514}Before I met The Father...
{86527}{86615}...the only thing that|ever gave me a rush was joyriding.
{86649}{86712}He's got this amazing power to...
{86716}{86787}...work out all the|fucked up shit in your life.
{86818}{86844}Yeah...
{86865}{86985}...don't get me wrong,|I still got a soft spot for jacking cars.
{88249}{88292}He's gonna love you.
{91400}{91444}He's ready.
{91475}{91540}Wait, wait, I don't know,|I mean, what's gonna happen?
{91544}{91602}Nothing,|unless you want it to.
{92478}{92541}Wait, no.|I feel weird.
{92552}{92623}No, weird's good.|You're gonna be fine.
{92627}{92652}Just have fun, you know.
{92692}{92728}Come on.
{92783}{92808}It's okay.
{92838}{92862}Come on.
{94041}{94165}NO ENTRY TESTING NO ENTRY
{94449}{94567}Nobody in chains.|Ever soared up to the sun.
{94656}{94690}I read that.
{95076}{95128}Cast off those chains.
{95286}{95314}You know...
{95333}{95420}...love's the warmest place|to be in when it's cold outside.
{95463}{95497}I wore that.
{100689}{100826}PRESSURE LOCK OPEN CLOSE
{103117}{103142}What the fuck?
{103239}{103268}Get out of the car now!
{103269}{103307}Come with me now!
{103309}{103323}Let go of me.
{103323}{103366}There's no time...
{103392}{103428}What the hell|are you doing here?
{103429}{103462}Listen to me,|you have to go now.
{103464}{103490}Let me go!
{103557}{103576}Hurry up.
{103590}{103609}Mom.
{103610}{103657}Nat, run.
{103690}{103741}Nat, leave now, please.
{104536}{104620}This time kill her.
{106931}{106972}It's all right, Nat.
{106997}{107042}You don't have to go with her.
{107072}{107138}You don't have to do anything|you don't want to.
{107200}{107232}You're free now.
{107318}{107383}Nat, where are you?
{107457}{107492}Say something.
{107530}{107571}Nobody's gonna hurt you, Nat.
{107611}{107672}She's just terrified of|letting you go.
{107685}{107725}Having your own life...
{107752}{107798}...your own dreams...
{107827}{107906}She just wants to take you away|from the ones who understand you.
{107910}{107954}Don't listen to him, Nat.
{108043}{108103}You always knew she was crazy,|didn't you?
{108112}{108188}Unhinged. Illogical.
{108205}{108271}A fantastic... liar.
{108320}{108375}We wanna give you a real family.
{108407}{108442}With no lies...
{108460}{108501}no pills...
{108517}{108554}...no restrictions...
{108564}{108604}...no screaming matches...
{108638}{108696}...just... love.
{108699}{108734}That's bullshit, Nat.
{108744}{108791}I'm here. I can see you.
{108799}{108832}They wanna kill you!
{108835}{108889}Funny you should mention that.
{108906}{108960}Isn't that exactly|what you tried to do?
{108994}{109029}She tried to kill you.
{109078}{109113}Did you know that?
{109115}{109135}No.
{109136}{109168}Before you were even born.
{109191}{109252}She wanted an abortion, Nat.
{109277}{109312}Tried to flush you away.
{109488}{109507}Sorry.
{109545}{109560}I'm sorry.
{109603}{109653}I remember what you remember.
{109803}{109862}You gotta hang on.
{109946}{110034}Because the truth is with us|in the house tonight.
{110108}{110149}Close your eyes.
{110220}{110278}See that door.
{110319}{110391}Hold that key.
{110452}{110539}You don't have to fight any more.
{110568}{110609}It's over.
{110647}{110673}Come on.
{110733}{110777}Come into the light.
{112335}{112367}Nat...
{112420}{112457}..."m sorry you had to see it.
{112458}{112542}But I had to show you through|the hypocrisy and the lies.
{112578}{112650}Pain is all in the past,|not in the future.
{112728}{112805}All you have to do|is meet me halfway.
{113061}{113125}Where's my daughter?|I want my daughter back.
{113129}{113162}What have you done|with my daughter?
{113163}{113182}Listen.
{113211}{113240}You've got to trust me.
{113290}{113348}Nat was the only way|I could find them.
{113623}{113669}There's something|you should see first.
{113874}{113933}They kill people by knocking|them off the road.
{113970}{114041}Your husband didn't even|get five miles past the rest stop.
{114248}{114350}Come on, Nat,|don't lose your faith.
{114355}{114383}Join us.
{114583}{114617}What did you do with her?
{114933}{114959}Nat?
{115039}{115081}You just don't get it, do you?
{115084}{115141}This man is not|who he says he is.
{115144}{115173}Don't listen to them.
{115186}{115218}They're full of lies.
{115347}{115382}I'm calling Marek.
{115427}{115466}He killed your father.
{115499}{115526}Wait, Nat.
{115551}{115578}Hey, Senga.
{115579}{115621}See you on the other side.
{115685}{115739}You stole my sister.
{115755}{115800}She was my sister too.
{116032}{116058}Hey, Senga...
{116076}{116135}..."m only here to|fill the void.
{116139}{116178}The void you created...
{116180}{116278}...by not listening to|who Nat really is.
{116298}{116347}Get him out of your head.
{116350}{116406}This is how he works.
{116409}{116490}He's got them so fucked up|they're killing people for blood.
{116595}{116634}I was too late for Christine.
{116657}{116743}I had to kill her to stop|her from killing anybody else.
{116883}{116930}You're lucky you're alive.
{117488}{117553}Why can't you|just leave me alone?
{117684}{117711}I'm your mother.
{117725}{117766}I don't always get things right.
{117788}{117849}But please, Nat,|you have to trust me now.
{117953}{117985}Let's get out of here.
{118046}{118068}Let's go.
{118259}{118286}In here. Now!
{118535}{118551}Come on, Nat.
{118553}{118581}Wait.
{118666}{118690}You killed Christine...
{118704}{118728}...now I'm gonna kill you.
{118751}{118807}She was already dead|when I found her.
{118810}{118863}Not dead... free.
{119309}{119420}The day you tried to murder|your daughter is the day you let me in.
{119456}{119515}Truth is in the house tonight...
{119529}{119548}...Senga.
{119851}{119891}Fuck you.
{119921}{119953}Fuck you.
Testing. Testing, testing.
One, two, three.
Turn it up.
Hey!
Dang!
That's what I'm talkin' about. LA!
Hold up. Ho!
- Radio station ID.
- Coming to work.
Joe Dirte.
Don't try and church it up, son.
Don't you mean Joe Dirt?
Naming you that, your daddy must've really hated you.
- You're wrong, brother.
- I got a good name for this car,
Rusty.
- Shit'll buff out.
- Don't bother.
Jeez, drive this piece of crap off a cliff.
Do us all a favor.
This look like a piece of crap to you?
You like them spinning tires, do you?
- You suck!
- You do!
Did he hurt you, baby?
People like that security guard, they don't really mean what they say.
They just got their own issues and whatnot.
All's I got to do is keep being a good person.
No matter what, good things'll come my way.
Everything's gonna happen for me, just as long as I never have
"no" in my heart.
Can't a guy even take a dump in peace?
Psycho.
Right on.
Things are gonna happen for me.
I'm Joe Dirt!
I think I'm gonna go to the restroom and take a big Joe.
Don't forget to wipe your dirt.
You boys got something to say to me?
Why don't you talk in the microphone?
I got a backup mic right here.
Check, one, two. Testing, testing.
Yeah, they're both working, and guess what?
They don't like no feedback. What's up?
What's going on out here?
You got to keep it down.
Zander Kelly's on the air.
What's the deal with your haircut?
I'm sorry about the noise, sir.
This ain't no haircut. This is a wig.
A wig?
Look at you. Jesus.
You know what?
I got somebody I want you to meet.
Why don't you come with me? Come on.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
This is Zander Kelly.
You're listening to 98.6, KXLA.
All aberration radio, all the time.
Hey, Zander, Zander,
You got to see this guy.
God almighty. Manna from inbred heaven.
Hey, freak boy.
1976 called, it wants its hairstyle back.
- Zander, get this. This is a wig.
- It's a wig?
What are you wearing a wig for?
What are you doing, stunt work for Billy Ray Cyrus?
Freddy, go get Free Bird boy here an all-access laminate for the show in perpetuity.
I'm wringing this chamois as long as I can.
You are exquisitely pathetic.
What's your name, pal?
It's Joe Dirt. But if you're just gonna make fun of me, man,
I'll just go back to mopping.
Sit down, let me take another tact here.
Mr. Dirt, what's with the wig?
Well, I was born without the top of my skull, and I guess a little bit of my brains was showing.
It was grossing everybody out, so my mom put this wig on me to cover it up.
And then the bones grew together and it got all infused and entwined.
I mean, I don't mean to get all scientific or whatever.
Why didn't your mom change the wig later?
Actually, we got separated when I was eight.
I got lost.
You trying to tell me you've been on your own since eight years old?
Pretty much, man.
It's a long story, actually.
Listen to you. What's the story here?
"I'm a white-trash idiot." The end.
Hey, is this where you want to be when Jesus comes back, man?
Making fun of poor little Joe Dirt?
Probably, because I'm sure Yahweh would be chiming in, too.
That's funny,
'cause my mom used to say that to me if she caught me doing stuff.
Like one time, I was jerkin' my gherkin.
Can I say that?
And she goes, "Is this where you want to be when Jesus comes back?"
She sounds like a real winner, and it's amazing to me that you turned out like you did with that sort of mentoring.
Hey, man, I...
I can't say don't make fun of me, but you really shouldn't make fun of my mom.
Hey, you guys, you gotta come hear this guy on the Zander show.
Listen. You're on your own.
The family's ditched you.
What happens next?
I mean, do you really care?
It's actually not an easy story to tell.
Hey, I got four hours a day to fill, man.
It's not often I get a freak like you plopped into my lap.
Go ahead. I'm a roast. Baste me.
All right, man.
See, my parents and my sister and I all went to the Grand Canyon.
And while they was checking out the sights and the donkeys and whatnot,
I somehow got separated from 'em.
Easy shot.
Hey, Dad, look. It's the good stuff.
None of that pussy Skoal, right, Dad?
Dad?
Mom!
Dad!
Mom! Dad!
Where are you?
Dad!
Mom!
Where are you?
You can come out now.
So, there I was.
A lot of kids would have been scared, but I was all tough about it.
I started walkin' till the cops picked me up and put me into a foster home.
Like this one guy
I fostered out to for about a month, he'd take me hunting with him and his dog.
I thought hunting would be, you know, more fun than it was.
Now, see, boy?
He goes off and fetches the duck.
You see how that works?
- Fun, huh?
- Yeah!
After that I spent some time with these people who worked on a farm.
I learned cows don't find bottle rockets as funny as I do.
Yeah.
Then there was this one old lady, she had me for a couple of weeks.
I don't wanna be unkind, but this woman was a little off-balance.
You're to be scrubbed clean before supper, and that means washed under your fingernails and back of your ears and dressed in your Sunday best.
I expect your schoolwork to be done every night and laid out for my inspection.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, ma'am.
Can I push him off my leg?
He'll stop humping as soon as he's done.
Well, the year was 1982.
I was 11 years old now, and I'd gotten into a little trouble here and there, so I was living in a juvie home for boys, and I was getting ready to split that scene, and pronto.
Ramblin' man
Lord, I got to gamble
Gamblin' man
Bob Seger? Be honest. Back then you were listening to Leif Garrett.
It's probably more like this.
I was made for dancin'
I...
No, sir, man. I don't like that crap.
I'm a rocker, dude, through and through.
Here's my favorite bands. AC/DC, Van Halen, not Van Hagar, Skynyrd, Def Lepp...
All right. I want you to settle down.
Don't make me call your probie officer here.
And riddle me this.
Other than the fact that you dig looking like Jane Fonda in Klute, why don't you cut the wig now?
Well, yeah. I guess I could do that.
Zander just asked this Joe Dirt guy why he doesn't cut his wig right now, and you can tell he's never even thought of that.
Now, you know, except for the ratty 'stache and the pork chops, you're pretty clean-shaven for a kid who lives in a trash can, no?
Well, I don't need to shave, 'cause it don't grow in right here and right here.
Now, you're telling me that you're so ingrained with white-trash DNA that your facial hair actually grows in on its own all white-trashy like that?
I don't know what you're saying, but that's what's going on, yeah.
So, back to the story here.
You're on your own...
I'm just kinda campin' out or whatever, and this goes on for years, until one night something amazing happened.
Man, a shooting star.
I gotta make a wish.
I wish I knew what happened that one day at that Grand Canyon place.
It's a meteorite.
Check it out! That's cool!
Man, look at you.
You're probably made out of some precious metal and everyone's gonna want you, but you want to be with me!
Right on!
You're Joe Meteorite, and I'm Joe Dirt!
Here on Earth, we call this place a town.
A town is a place where everyone hates you.
Kids all try to beat you up.
- That's so flat.
- Awesome.
This is gonna be awesome.
Holy crap, ladies.
Hey, Junior Dirt Bag.
You talkin' to your rock?
It ain't no rock, it's a meteor, dum-dum.
What did it do, land on your barber's head while he was cuttin' your hair?
Why don't you go practice falling down.
I'll be there in a minute.
Hey. You wanna fight, you little queer?
Queer? Is this queer?
Are these queer? What's up? What's up?
Look at this guy. He must be retarded.
Hey, retard, you aren't worth it.
- Come on. Let's go.
- Yeah? You are.
- What a wuss.
- I mean, you aren't... Worth it.
I told them, Meteor. You had my back.
You're cool.
What's that?
$5. That's mine now.
You're my lucky meteor. Right on.
I'll hold your half for ya.
Meteor, we call this here
"Bein' in burger heaven."
Yeah.
I need to find a home, Meteor.
We need some stability in our lives, man.
We need to settle down.
Life gets hard, you know?
Yeah. Come on, now.
It's a little bumpy.
Look at that town, Meteor.
That's pretty.
I bet people in a town like that will be nice to us.
Let's go down there.
Come on.
Yeah.
No way I'd ever sell you, Meteor.
Not in a million years.
But just for laughs, let's see how much you're worth.
Well, it ain't a meteor.
Yeah, it is. It came out of the sky.
Well, I'm sure it did, but it ain't no meteor.
It's a big old frozen chunk of shit.
- What?
- Yeah.
See, them airplanes, they dump their toilets 36,000 feet, and the stuff freezes and falls to earth.
We call 'em Boeing bombs.
No, that can't be.
That's not what it is.
Afraid so.
You see the peanut?
Dead giveaway.
Yeah, that's... That's a space peanut.
Well, afraid not.
This is a big old frozen chunk of poopie.
Dude, you were eating off it.
Okay, okay, that's too much, too much.
Then what happened?
Well, then I got a dog.
You're telling me you'd rather have a dog than a frozen hunk of crap?
See, it wasn't really my dog.
It was this girl's dog.
I was livin' in the woods outside of that postcard town I said.
It's called Silvertown.
And I'd come in to steal stuff, you know, food, whatever.
And then one winter...
Are you okay, boy?
No. Are your nuts frozen to the porch?
That sucks.
Don't pull up.
- Who are you?
- It's okay. I was just walking by.
- I think your dog's in a little trouble here.
- What's wrong?
I think his... Well, you know how when you get your tongue frozen in a freezer 'cause it's all wet?
I think he got...
- Nuts frozen to the porch?
- Yes, exactly.
- Baby! What do we do?
- We got to do something,
- so do you have something inside?
- Yeah.
Don't pull up.
It's okay, don't move.
It's gonna stretch 'em more. That's bad.
No. That's... That's wrong.
That's way wrong.
Do you got, like, warm water and...
- A fork!
- Yeah. No. What?
No, no. A spatula thing. The flat one.
I'm sorry, buddy.
Just give her a second. Dang.
I got it. Now what?
Here's what we do.
I just pour a little water on here.
Now, you hold him.
Easy.
Now, this ain't no flapjack.
Gotta go real easy.
Should loosen it up a little bit.
And I'm gonna go...
I don't wanna look. I'm sorry.
One, two, three, go.
There. Hey, buddy, you're free.
- Dang.
- Good boy!
Good job!
You might want to spray this whole porch down with PAM, you know, so it doesn't happen again.
- Okay.
- What's his name?
- Charlie.
- Charlie.
- And mine's Brandy.
- Hi, Brandy. I'm Joe Dirt.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.
Brandy, get your ass in the kitchen and fire up that stove.
You got some cookin' to do.
- Daddy?
- Yeah.
Can we have my new friend Joe over for supper?
What, are you nuts, girl?
We ain't runnin' no soup kitchen here, boy.
Scat! Get out of here!
Long-haired hippie freak.
I'll be your friend.
For some reason, and I have no idea why,
Brandy always wanted to hang out with me.
And I had Charlie, so that was cool.
For the next couple of years, the three of us was hanging out at the farm in Silvertown.
And that was the closest thing
I ever had to a home.
Till one day...
Dirt, did I get you?
- Nah, I'm cool.
- No, you're not.
Where's Brandy?
She's out riding her horse.
She'll be back in a minute.
- You guys want to play bumper pool?
- No.
How does she put up with you, Dirt?
That's a good question, man.
She's great, though, ain't she?
You know, sometimes it's like she likes me or something.
Yeah, dream on, Dirtboy.
A girl like that's way out of your league.
She wants my body.
No, I know, man.
That's all... That's for you.
I'm... I'm not... We're just totally friends.
She's out of my league.
Don't ever forget it, Dirt.
Check this out, Robby.
This is a good month. Dang.
This guy's got a dash mat for a '69 Nova he wants to sell, and a car cover for any Dodge from '79 to '84.
Man, you don't even have a car.
I know, but that's a deal, what he wants.
They're usually 80 bucks at Checker, and this guy wants 40, man.
Hey, look at this. Charlie, see that?
This guy's selling a Hurst speed shifter with a pool-ball grip.
One day I'll have a car that badass,
I'll be chirping gears and pulling brodies, going...
You'll stick your head out the window and check out chick dogs, going,
"What's up, baby?"
Boy, I swear I oughta slap you silly.
I tell you what. Why don't you practice spittin' out teeth,
'cause I swear I'm gonna...
- Dang.
- Dang.
Hi, Joe. Come here.
- What's up, goat-roper?
- Not much, pig-licker.
Watch the gun, baby.
That's how I get the gals.
Come on. I'll treat you to a Dairy Queen.
Why are you being all nice?
- I am always nice to you, Joe Dirt.
- Hey, Brandy.
Can I come, too?
Robby, I only have enough money for me and Joe.
Come on, Joe.
- Let's do it!
- Come on, Charlie!
Come on, boy!
Oh, God. She is so fine.
Yeah. One day,
I'm gonna marry that girl.
Stop!
There you are.
Gimme that mutt.
I'm takin' him huntin' with me.
Daddy, you been drinkin'.
Shut the hell up and just give me the mutt now.
Hey, if you're taking the dog,
I'll go with him.
- 'Cause I've been hunting before.
- You, hunt?
Wouldn't even use you as a retriever.
That was a good one.
All right, Charlie, get in the car.
Charlie, you mangy mutt.
Get in the damn car, you flea-bitten, butt-lickin', flea-lickin' son of a bitch.
Two!
Yeah!
What?
Hey!
Hey, my foot's stuck!
Charlie. Charlie, come here.
Come here, Charlie.
My foot's stuck, see?
See, my foot's stuck?
I need your help.
I need you to go find Sheriff Williams.
Now, go on, go get him. Go bring help.
Go get help now.
Go get him. Run, Charlie!
Run like the wind!
Run!
Run, Charlie.
That stupid dog better be bringing somebody.
Your dad always hunt this long?
- Hey, there's Charlie.
- Charlie!
- Hi!
- There's my buddy.
Where have you been?
There you go, Don. Take 'er easy.
- Oh, my God!
- There's that worthless mutt!
- What happened?
- This is all that goddamn dog's fault!
- And I'm puttin' him down.
- No, you can't!
- Guess who came back, Charlie?
- Dad, no!
No!
Joe, he's okay now. He's in dog heaven.
You gave him a great last couple years.
Well, I'll sprinkle his ashes.
They'll drift out to sea.
He would've liked that.
I can't do it.
I'm taking him with me.
Taking him with you? But...
Where are you going?
Brandy, you see that moon?
You don't know how many nights
I spent alone staring at that moon wondering if at that exact moment, my mom or my dad was looking at the same moon.
And for that brief second, we were together again, kind of, you know?
When I was with Charlie,
I didn't miss that moon so much.
Brandy, I got a hole in my heart.
I don't know how to fix it.
I got to find out what happened that day at the Grand Canyon.
I don't care how long it takes.
I gotta do it.
But what if when you're gone some guy asks me to marry him, and you're not here?
Brandy, what's that got to do with me?
We're always gonna be buddies, right?
Well, if I get married, we might move, and you might not know where to find me.
You are gonna make some guy so happy.
I just hope whoever he is, he deserves a girl like you.
God, that Brandy has a nice ass, doesn't she?
I mean, I get this loser talking about the moon and walking his dog, and all the time I'm thinking about
Brandy's well-manicured backyard in those cutoff shorts. Ouch!
Yeah, she's cool.
Anyway, so there I was, on my own again, looking for my parents, but I don't know their last names.
It's Dirt. Isn't that the name on the family crest? Dirt.
No, see, my last name's Dirt.
My dad made my last name Dirt for some reason.
Anyway, I just put an "e" on it, pronounce it "Deer-tay."
It's no big deal.
It actually sounds pretty cool.
But see, I don't know their last name.
And I remember my sister yelling it in my face when I was growing up.
That's why Dad named you Joe Dirt!
That's why Dad named you Joe Dirt!
That's why Dad named you
Joe Dirt instead of...
I couldn't remember my real last name.
So, I knew it was gonna be hard to find 'em.
- Right, so what'd you do?
- Right, so then I needed some money.
I hopped a train out of Silvertown and headed east for the big city.
Then I got lucky.
I got myself a real important job in advertising.
Molar World. Walk-ins welcome.
There you go.
Molar World. One for the kid? Sure.
Molar...
What's up?
Oh, my God.
Competition orange, '67.
This thing's a Hemi.
Ma'am, are you selling this car?
Yeah. It literally just went on to the market.
Well, how much you want for it?
- What do you got?
- Practically nothing.
I'm looking for my parents.
They lost me at the Grand Canyon more than 10 years ago.
So, all my money goes towards that.
I don't have pictures of them or nothing.
You don't even have a picture of them?
Well, you know, my ex-husband, before he died...
I'm sorry.
Nah. I killed him.
He used to beat me, so one night I just pushed him into the wood chipper.
Told the cops he fell.
- Good for you.
- But he used to be a police sketch artist.
He was damn good, too.
The victims would give him the worst descriptions, and he would draw them out like photographs.
He could do anything, you know?
Like age progression and...
That's it. That's what I'll do for my parents.
How much does that cost?
About 360 bucks.
Then that's what I need to make.
Thank you.
And I'm sorry I can't buy your beautiful Hemi.
No, you can.
Give me what you got in your pocket, and she's yours.
For real?
You hear that, Charlie?
We got us a Hemi, brother.
- That lady gave me a great idea.
- Hey, Dirt! Dirt!
Storm's coming in!
Get up on the roof and put some bricks in the tooth!
Gotcha.
My tooth! My tooth!
Help!
Hey! Go back!
- I can see down your shirt.
- What an ass.
Hey, boss, I'm goin' on a break.
Hey! Airplane! Help me!
That's not professional.
I'd floated all the way to North Dakota.
And there I was, scared to death, as I dropped like a stone from the sky.
Go back! Go back!
But then the most amazing thing happened.
I landed next to an oil rig, and they was hiring people.
And what they paid was like a sign from above that I was meant to find my parents.
- Coming down!
- Hey, bro, come on down!
Yeah, baby. Come on, now. Get loose.
Man, I got it. It's comin'.
I'll pay for this. I'm new!
I'm new! I don't know what to do!
Hey, man, you done with that apple core?
I'm done with that fart. You want that?
Maybe if it came out of
Charlene Tilton's ass, I'd take a bite.
Yeah, you probably like J.R., you queer.
I saw your bumper sticker,
"Cowboys' butts drive me nuts."
Is that right? You think that's queer?
Is this queer? They're large and in charge and lookin' for chickies.
You wanna back that up?
You wanna fight?
Why don't you stick your head up my butt and fight for air?
That's it. You and me. Let's go.
You know, I would. I'd love to beat your ass up and down this place.
I got to go back to work.
Yo, Dirt. You're fired.
Here's your week's pay.
Dang.
Yeah!
What's up here? Look down there.
What's going on? Here I come.
Luckily, my neck broke my fall.
I guess you won the battle.
- Yeah!
- But I won the war.
If you're covered in oil, don't stand next to a fire.
Now that's day-one stuff.
Keep that Skoal, baby.
That's what I'm talking about.
So, I had my 360 bucks.
The next day I was gonna try the police sketch thing, but something happened to my head.
See, I spent the night in what I thought was an abandoned circus tent.
But I guess it wasn't no circus.
I was totally bombed on insecticide, I think.
So, needless to say, I was in no shape to do anybody any good with my recollections.
The guy doing the police sketch thought I was messin' with him,
'cause my dad came out looking like Father Time.
And my mom came out too butch, and looking way too much like Richard Ramirez.
You know, the Night Stalker?
Remember that guy?
As my head cleared,
I realized I needed a different approach.
Then I got a brainstorm.
Hire an Indian tracker to help me.
Man, that's a great idea.
They could find anything.
It's like in the movies.
So, I headed for a reservation.
You want me to put my ear to the ground, listen for hoofbeats, check for footprints?
Look for broken twigs?
But this is the modern age.
That stuff doesn't work anymore, which is why I had to open this fireworks stand.
I wasn't getting by on my tracking wages.
Come on. You're supposed to be good at tracking stuff, man.
I've got to find my parents.
And I've got to figure out a way to sell more fireworks.
I'm going broke with this venture also.
Well, I see you got them snakes and sparklers, but where's the good stuff, man?
Good stuff?
This is the good stuff, snakes and sparklers.
Are you nuts, dude?
You need stuff that explodes, go boom!
Why is that good?
You might as well ask,
"Why is a tree good?
"Why is a sunset good?
Why are boobs good?"
Man, firecrackers.
You stick 'em in mailboxes, you drop 'em in toilets.
You shove 'em up bullfrogs' asses.
I would never do that,
'cause I'm gonna be a veterinarian.
Well, there you go.
Someone shoves an M-80 up a bullfrog's butt, blows him to pieces, he comes back to you to fix it.
You win twice, brother. It's good biz.
So, you're gonna tell me that you don't have no black cats, no Roman candles or Screamin' Mimis?
- No.
- Come on, man.
You don't got no Ladyfingers,
Buzz Bottles, Snicker Bombs,
Church Burners, Finger Blasters,
Gut Busters, Zip-a-Dee-do-dahs or Crap Flappers?
No, I don't.
You're gonna stand there owning a fireworks stand and tell me you don't have no Whistling Bungholes, no Spleen Splitters, Whisker Biscuits,
Honky Lighters,
Husker Du's, Husker Don'ts,
Cherry Bombs, Nipsy Dazers, with or without the scooter stick, or one single Whistling Kitty Chaser?
- No.
- Wha...
'Cause snakes and sparklers are the only ones I like.
Well, that might be your problem.
It's not what you like.
It's the consumer.
Lookie there.
That's happening, man.
We should get bleachers over here.
People'll come from miles around to see this thing.
Feast your eyes on a feast of smoke.
Dang. It's out.
CNN's gonna turn around and go home now.
What's going on, man?
I saw a snail over there and he said,
"That thing's slow. It ain't movin' fast.
It's boring and dull. I'm yawning."
- That's a snail watching that.
- There's a snail in the desert?
Yeah, a spaceship dropped him off.
Don't focus on the wrong part of the story, brother.
And the snail can talk?
Yeah, because they gave him powers, the aliens.
They made his little voice box...
Dude, I'm just sayin' it's dull, all right?
This ain't fun.
Look at that little piece of char.
You need explosions.
You need stuff going on, man.
No wonder this thing's going under.
You got nothing. It's wussy stuff.
Well...
I got these two sticks.
Dang. These are yours?
These are Roman candles, brother.
That's good stuff.
Get this thing full of lighter fluid.
Yeah.
The Roman candle.
Step back a little bit.
That's what I'm talkin' about.
That's beautiful.
Beautiful? I'm looking for
"righteously kick-ass."
You know what we need?
Gasoline. Yeah.
Breakfast of champions.
All right, you might want to take a few extra steps back on this one.
God.
Man. What did I trip over?
There's something metal sticking out of the ground.
You okay?
What is this thing, man?
Maybe we should take it over to that place, the laboratory over in the next town,
Los Alamos.
That symbol looks very stern.
Yeah, man. That's definitely what we should do. That's the right thing.
But first...
Yeah, jam that in the gas bucket.
We'll shoot fireballs at it.
We gotta step way back.
This is gonna be fun.
Look at that shit!
Man, we're gonna get so busted!
Let's get out of here!
What happened, man?
You tripped over that object in the ground. You were knocked out.
That thing's an atom bomb, man.
I got an idea.
"Canyon Rubberneckers tour bus.
"The Grand Canyon's number-one purveyor of fine bus tours."
I still don't see why we're going to the tour bus company.
Don't you see? All the tourists at the canyon that day my parents lost me, they had cameras.
And you can't tell me, in all those pictures they took, there won't be some that accidentally have me and my parents in 'em, man.
The company'll have records of who used the tour that day.
But that was more than 10 years ago.
Besides, they won't just hand the records over to us.
We're just an Indian and some guy.
Man.
You can't have "no" in your heart.
"No" is not an option, brother.
You're not just an Indian.
You're Kicking Wing. All right?
And one day, you're gonna be
Kicking Wing, animal doctor.
And then you should change your name to Kicking Ass. I would.
Man. Swerve them potholes.
You know, because of the atom bomb.
One swing, and this here ball-peen hammer will trigger this A-bomb, and it'll blow up the whole city, maybe even half the country.
Now, here's what I need.
I need you to give me the records of everybody who toured the Grand Canyon on them buses
June 13, 1979.
I'm not messin' around. I'll hit it.
And then it goes bang. All right?
Now, while I'm up here waiting...
- You.
- Me?
Show me them boobies.
Dang.
Now, even you liked the way that chick looked, didn't you?
Even me?
What's that supposed to mean, man?
I'm just saying, I'm beginning to doubt your hetero street credentials here.
I mean, never putting the moves on Brandy...
Brandy, man. Well, she's too beautiful.
She's way too hot for me.
He has no idea that Brandy even likes him.
- His voice is so sexy.
- I wonder what he looks like.
You're standing there with an atom bomb.
Could be Fat Man, could be Little Boy.
We'll nail that down later.
But anyway, did you get the names you wanted?
Yeah, I did, but by the way, it wasn't no atom bomb.
Turns out, some skateboarder slapped a Biohazard band sticker on the side of this septic tank for an RV.
Anyway, the cops knew it wasn't a bomb right away.
Yeah. Who hasn't seen that scenario played out?
It's just an old crapper tank, people.
Kicking Wing!
- Stop it!
- Get it out of here!
Somebody help me!
Help me!
Is it done? How much is in there?
I got the poo on me.
You are so pathetic.
They decided not even to arrest me.
They said being covered in that stinky stuff was punishment enough.
Don't you get it, man? Stinky stuff is your milieu. Okay? This is your deal.
You are an underachievement nexus in the universe, and it's always gonna be like this, Joey.
No, man, but you gotta keep going.
What am I gonna do, quit?
That's not an option.
You got to keep on keepin' on.
Life's a garden, dig it?
You make it work for you.
You never give up, man.
That's my philosophy.
You hear that in there?
And, you know, the thing that drives me crazy and fascinates me at the same time is that you are so unrelentingly upbeat about your plight.
I need more, man. I'll be honest with you.
I want to see you in here tomorrow.
I want to hear more of the saga of Joe Dirt.
All right. Thanks, you guys.
- All right, Joe!
- Yeah, baby.
You're listening to the Zander Kelly show on KXLA.
All right. Good morning, troops.
This is Zander Kelly, and you, of course, are careening headlong into yet another hellish day in the tiny existence you laughingly refer to as your life.
I'm here with Joe Dirt.
Joey, the tale could not be told in one day, and we've asked you back today.
I might say the joint looks great.
The toilets are freshly scrubbed.
The floor is spick-and-span.
Hey, Joe, did you use the stuff with the tiny scrubbing bubbles?
They clean the bowl so you don't have to.
No, I didn't.
Yesterday, provide a little backstory for the listeners, you were telling us that you were covered in crap, and you are a complete loser.
Have I nailed the pertinent facts?
Well, let me emphasize to the listeners those are your words, not mine.
Sorry, Billy Jack.
So, now you have a bunch of names of people who might actually have a photograph of you and your parents, right?
Right. I got a big bunch of names.
So, now I got to span the country to find all these people, to see if anybody's got a photograph from that one day.
"Anderson, Anders, Asnov, Ast..."
I mean, all these people were on them tour buses that day?
"Belitnikoff..."
It's gonna take forever, man.
But I gotta do it.
Joe Dirt, I wish you luck.
I hope you find what you're looking for.
And remember that town you're always talking about.
Yeah, Silvertown, man.
Yes. Silvertown. You make it sound like the most wonderful place.
So, you've always got Silvertown.
Remember that, Joe Dirt.
And you remember to keep on keepin' on, man, and you'll be a veterinarian,
'cause I believe people get what they really, really want, especially a cool guy like you,
Kicking Wing.
You know what?
You're my first real friend I've found, outside of Charlie and Brandy.
Okay.
That's good. That's good.
That hug was completely asexual.
You know, he kind of snuck it up on me.
Whatever you gotta tell yourself, Joe Dirt.
I love you, Joe Dirt.
So, I hit the road with my list of names, looking for tourists who might have photos of my folks.
I hit pay dirt when I got a job with a traveling carnival, and that's when things got a little weird.
Dang.
Can I go again? Please?
No, you've been on the ride long enough.
It's time to go home.
I got you, buddy.
Hey, who's this chick over here?
Is that your girlfriend?
You should see my girlfriend.
You'd shit yourself.
Really?
I tell you what, buddy.
I'm gonna give you a free spin.
I'm gonna talk to your lady friend over there. How 'bout that?
Yes!
Good job, sir. Yeah, keep 'em straight like that. Good strategy.
You know, the life of a carnival worker keeps me free and untethered.
I know.
That's why I was immediately attracted to you.
I could tell you were an outlaw.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I am kind of an outlaw through and through, baby.
- Damn.
- Good toss there, sir. Good one.
You know, society's got no hold on this outlaw.
- Damn it!
- All right, all right. Real close.
You know, I'm like a bird. Actually, more like a hard-ass pterodactyl.
This is bullshit!
Hey, God forbid you don't win after throwing only two quarters, man.
It's a business. It ain't UNICEF, okay?
I got a good mind to take my outlaw ass and... Yeah, you better walk away, hard-ass.
- Some people, right?
- I know.
So, later on today, I'm pickin' up my Hemi
Road Runner. That's right, I said Hemi.
A Hemi?
- Balls to the wall.
- Yeah.
I left it here. Friend's house.
Well, actually it got towed two years ago.
But I'm gonna pick it up this afternoon.
I might need a pretty little lady to sit on the front seat with me while I break her in.
The car, I mean.
What do you say?
That's a big 10-4.
Hey, my man. I got a big date tonight.
I'm here to pick up my ride.
- License and registration?
- Yes, sir.
She's gonna freak out when she sees my wheels.
Total impound fees come to $3,496.
- Plus 35 bucks for the tow.
- What?
Three thousand, man, that's more than I paid for the whole car!
Interesting.
- You want it or not?
- Yeah, but,
I think that all I got's, like, 450 bucks.
Okay, this is a business.
This is not a charity.
I mean, maybe one day UNICEF will get into the impound business.
But, you know, until then, we're the people to see.
Now, I'll tell you what I could do.
I could sell you a car for 450 bucks, but it ain't gonna be no Hemi.
I thought you had a Hemi.
Yeah, I had to have a footprint gas pedal installed.
So, I stole this pile.
My outlaw.
That's right. Let's go.
So, I had fun tonight.
Even though you took me to the carnival that I was already at.
Yeah, I had fun, too.
Hey, listen. Can I ask you a question?
If I told you you had a beautiful body, would you hold it against me?
Sure would.
- Wanna go to my place?
- Sure do.
All right. So, finish your story.
Now, why do you live with foster parents?
Well, because when I was, like, nine or 10 years old my parents pulled over on the side of the road to look at that big dinosaur out there in California, and the next thing I knew, they were gone.
Wait a minute. Did you have a brother?
I did.
So, you wanna go back in the house?
We can have sex.
She's your sister, dude. She's gotta be!
And you made out with her, man!
What's wrong with you, you pervert!
Well, I didn't know she was my sister when I kissed her.
So, it's not my fault.
And she's one of the hottest girls on the planet.
You just said your sister's hot!
What a freak! You're goin' to hell, man!
I got to tell her what happened, why I got weird.
And for God's sakes,
I got to treat her like a sister.
Joe...
Joe, no!
We've got questions comin' in from...
Boss, the phones are goin' nuts.
That was a bombshell.
Wait, wait, man. I found out later that she wasn't my sister.
Thank God!
Thank God, dude!
That was gonna be a little much.
So, I did a real bad thing there,
'cause I think you're my sister.
Is that all? No!
My family's last name is Buckwalter.
My brother's name is Cletis.
So, you see, we're not related.
We can have sex again.
Joe, what's the matter?
Don't I turn you on?
I don't know what the problem is.
Well, would it help if you went back to thinkin' I'm your sister?
Like I'm some sort of white-trash perv.
I'm your sister! I'm your sister!
You're my sister!
- No!
- I'm kiddin', I'm kiddin'.
I just made that last part up for laughs, you guys, I'm tellin' you.
Let's break it off for today.
You haul your mangy ass in here tomorrow morning, and we will continue the...
The fascinating saga that I'm now referring to as
"The Legend of Dirty Joe."
Hi, this is Brandy.
I'm not here right now.
Please leave a message.
Hey, Brandy, it's Joe. I'm out in LA.
They got me on a radio station tellin' my story to everybody.
I didn't get to the sad part yet.
I'm guessin' you had reasons for doin' what you did.
And I guess I'm just callin' to say goodbye.
I miss you, Brandy.
Okay.
You're listening to the Zander Kelly show on KXLA.
Good morning, LA. Zander here.
We're sittin' with the king of all dirt-balls, Mr. Joe Dirt.
You know, last night when I went home, rented The Andromeda Strain, just so I could simulate immersion into that bacteriologically unsound world you call your day-to-day life.
And I feel like I know where you live.
I've got you in my crosshairs now.
We're gonna go back to your story, pick it up.
What really happened was,
I had a car now, so I left the carnival and kept runnin' down the names on my list lookin' for people who took those photos at the Grand Canyon.
Somewhere in Indiana
I hit a little snag.
I found a guy who had pictures, but he turned out to be a freak.
I guess this is the place.
Buffalo Bob's kind of a weird name.
But people say Joe Dirt's a weird name, and how cool am I?
- Excuse me, sir.
- Hey, there, young fella.
Hey. I'm lookin' for a guy named Buffalo Bob.
Real name's Tim. How can I help you?
Well, I wanted to talk to you about the time you went to the Grand Canyon.
Sure. Why don't you come on inside?
- What'd you say your name was?
- Joe Dirt.
Joe Dirt.
It puts the lotion on!
You have no idea what kind of hell I can bring you!
All right!
Enough, you broken record! Okay!
I've been down here for two weeks, man.
What do you want?
It puts the lotion on its skin, now!
Well, say it, don't spray it, brother! Dang.
I need a towel now.
It does what it's told!
There. Look.
I'm puttin' the lotion on the skin.
I'm rubbin' it in.
Hey, to tell you the truth, brother, between you and me, that thing with the dog is comin' off a little fruity.
That's just me talkin'. I don't...
Where's my supplies?
Yeah. Come on, man.
I thought we had a deal.
For Christ's sake! Here!
Auto Trader!
August. I don't got this one.
There's some deals in here.
Check this out. A '71 'Cuda, plum crazy purple.
This guy wants 14 grand.
What?
I'd give him 7,500. I used to have one of these. This guy's crazy.
We've got the place surrounded.
Come out with your hands in the air.
- Hey, a little help?
- There he is, boys! Get him!
- Get him!
- Man in the hole.
- Down here.
- Stay on your back!
I hear people.
Hey, it puts the Joe Dirt in the hole.
Yeah, he was gonna flay you alive, then use your skin to cover himself like a Joe Dirt trench coat.
Yeah? That's gross, man.
I think these are pictures from the Grand Canyon.
Yeah, he's been takin' hundreds of photos over the years, lookin' for skin that he liked.
Then he was gonna wear the skin around the house with his wiener tucked under, kind of like a woman.
That's sick, man.
I think that's little me in the garbage can!
No way. And that's my...
My dad and my mom.
And this is our car.
And it's got Louisiana plates.
Hell, yeah, I'm going to Louisiana, brother!
So, I cruised down south to New Orleans and found a base of operations for my search at a local grade school.
I was gonna be a janitor.
Mostly mopping.
Once in a while you got a problem with the boiler.
You have to hit it with a hammer, but it's a good job.
That's all right.
I appreciate this job, man.
This'll be a good base for me here in Louisiana while I look for my parents.
I got a picture of 'em.
I don't recognize them.
If you find them, are you gonna tell 'em what happened to you?
That Buffalo Bob thing?
There's not much to tell.
I heard some things.
It's not good. He's a bad guy.
What... What exactly did you hear?
The past is past, the future's now.
That's true. Amen to that.
Clem, are you from around here?
'Cause your accent sounds like
- New York or somethin'.
- No. I'm from here.
Born and raised. No, not here.
Over in Kansas.
- Is this your wife?
- Ex-wife.
She was shot six times.
New York City. I mean, Kansas.
She was somethin'.
Her eyes were somethin'.
Azure, you know.
Honey-blonde hair. Her body...
Her legs went on for days.
If she was here right now, maybe we'd have a house with a little fence up in Silvertown, that place you talk about.
That's a nice place.
You... You really loved her, huh?
- You might say that.
- Yeah.
Clem, a kid puked in the cafeteria again.
We need a cleanup right away.
I'm on it!
That's you.
Hey, I'm Joe. Where's the throw-up?
Over there in the middle of the lunch room.
Hey, I'll get that cleaned up lickety-split.
Speakin' of lickety-split, let's meet up later, see what's goin' on.
I'm kiddin'.
But seriously, let's hook up.
I'm new in town, kinda lonely, lookin' for my parents.
Yeah. Well, the puke pile's right over there.
It's a pretty big pile of puke.
So, clean the puke. Okay.
Well, well, lookie here.
Corn off the cob.
This kid should get his money back.
- Look! The janitor's gonna eat the puke!
- They're hilarious, huh?
I assure you I won't. I'm a vegetarian, and it looks like there's some meat in there.
I like kids. They seem to like...
They seem to like me.
I'll try the old reverse psychology.
I like gettin' hit with hot dogs.
It don't bother me none.
Stop it!
I guess I'm lucky it wasn't hot chili day today.
Okay, class, let's hear what these results are.
If my calculations are correct, this will create ice.
No! Killer mustard gas!
What'd you say?
You're talkin' to me all wrong. It's...
It's the wrong tone.
You do it again, I'll stab you in the face with a soldering iron.
Is that right?
Let me ask you somethin'.
Does your mother sew?
Get her to sew that!
You'd think those stupid punks could come up with somethin' funnier than
"Don't eat it! Don't eat it!
Here's a hot dog!"
Hey, what's goin' on, man?
Did you kick their asses?
He saved us from the mustard gas.
You saved our lives, Clem.
Not me! That's the guy!
No, you're the one that carried us out.
Shut up, you hard-on.
That's the guy! That's the hero!
All right, well, then, thank God for Joe Dirt.
- No, man, It wasn't me.
- That's Joe Dirt!
- Joe Dirt! Joe Dirt!
- Joe Dirt! Joe Dirt!
Joe Dirt! Joe Dirt!
Come on, Joe Dirt!
How does it feel to be a hero, Joe?
- Over here, Mr. Dirt.
- Well, it's like this.
Probably feels pretty good, especially after that brutal run-in with Buffalo Bob.
I don't know why you ask about that guy.
Nothin' happened.
That's not what I heard.
What's the deal with your haircut, Joe?
It's a wig.
I was born without the top of my skull.
Everybody, I'm lookin' for my parents.
Here's a picture of them. It's taken
15 years ago at the Grand Canyon.
If anybody has any information on the whereabouts of 'em, please call this number, okay.
You might get a machine.
But if a girl answers, her name's Brandy.
Give her your info.
I appreciate any help I can get.
That bein' said, here's the real scoop.
I ain't the guy that saved them kids.
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry, man. Here's the real hero.
His name's Clem Doore, and he's from Josette, Louisiana.
- He's a friend of mine.
- No.
He's your real hero, people, not me.
Let's go. Come on, come on.
Move it, move it.
Move your asses. Come on.
Okay, this is where that rat bastard lives.
You two shoot him low, you shoot him high.
- I'm gonna shoot him right through his heart.
- All right, let's go.
Come on, let's move it!
Kick it in! Kick it in!
Hey.
- What happened here?
- Don't I know you from somewhere?
I don't know. What's goin' on?
Hey, wait a minute, yeah.
You're that guy that had that run-in with that psycho over in Indiana.
Buffalo Bob, right?
- Yeah. It was really no big deal.
- No big deal?
- That's not what I heard.
- Is Clem all right?
No, he's dead.
He's dead? Man, what happened?
Your buddy Clem's real name was Anthony Benedetti.
He was the former boss of the Cammalleri crime family.
He was in town here on the Federal witness relocation program.
- What?
- He turned informer when the Syndicate executed his wife.
His old cronies must've somehow found he was down here and they came and killed him.
He killed all them, too.
It's a big mess.
Oh, my God, man. This is my fault.
Hey, hey, hey!
Can you be cool and let me just talk to him for a second here, man?
I just... He's a friend of mine.
This whole thing's my fault.
All right, go ahead.
Clem, I didn't know you didn't wanna be on TV.
I was just tryin' to get the word out about my parents, man. I'm so sorry.
But maybe you'll find your wife in heaven.
She'll be just how you remembered her.
Them big doe eyes.
That soft honey-blonde hair.
Smooth tan skin.
Huge pert rack.
Long legs goin' up to that tight butt.
Clem, you asshole. Are you alive?
They're pretending I'm dead so's they can move me.
I just didn't know you were in this witness protection thing, brother.
I never would have said your name on TV, man.
It's okay. I felt it was time to move on anyway, you know.
Maybe find a better town.
Joe, there's somethin' you should think about.
I was thinkin' about that car.
The Rambler wagon. That's a rare car.
People would remember selling a car like that.
Where's that dead guy?
Wait, wait, Joe. Wait.
Take care, Joe Dirt.
Watch my hair.
Yep, those came with a six-cylinder 258 automatic with three on the tree.
Sweet-lookin' little things, weren't they?
For sure, man. How many?
Well, that's what I'm tryin' to call up here.
Now let's see.
In Louisiana, 1968, we sold...
Wee, doggy!
Seventy-three of those little buggers.
Now you tell me your daddy's name, and I'll tell you the dealership where he bought it.
That's just it. I don't know his name.
That's what I'm tryin' to find out.
Well, then, the best I can do is give you a printout of all 73 people who bought the car.
Later, if you come up with their last name, you can go on from there.
By the way, I'm only doin' all of this
'cause I heard that that Buffalo Bob guy shoved a road flare up your bunghole.
What?
- Hoorah.
- What...
I keep hearin' about this guy.
Nothin' happened with him.
Nothin' weird. Nothin'.
Anyway, that list had names from all over the state.
But I was flat broke.
I didn't have no money for gas.
So, I found a job, and that led to the biggest break In my case yet.
I don't know, Joe.
The way you describe that town out in the northwest, Silvertown.
Hell, I have half a mind to move there myself.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure, honey. Shoot.
Your mom and dad still alive?
No.
Did they die?
One night, they got swallowed up by the biggest damn gator we ever had.
- No.
- Before they died, they killed that gator from the inside by punchin' out his heart, is my guess.
- That's brutal.
- The brutal part?
Later that night,
I took my mama's hedge clippers and cut open that gator and pulled my folks out of its belly.
See, I just couldn't stand the thought of my parents being turned into alligator shit.
God, I hate these nasty things!
Hurry up, Phillip.
If I met the right man,
I mean, hell, I'd just shut this old gator farm down and...
But, you know, you probably don't wanna hear all my problems.
Folks, grab the kids.
- The gator show's about to start.
- Yeah.
Well, I'd better go. It's show time.
There's three things to remember when dealin' with a deadly alligator.
And, yes, they are deadly.
Don't kid yourself.
Rule number one, I'm number one.
You hear that? I like to kid around.
Rule two, the croc's number two.
Now, before I begin...
- Hey, what's rule three?
- What's that?
Kid, give me a break now.
- So, you don't know rule three?
- Yeah, you want a match?
My face and your ass.
How about that, friend?
I mean, your ass and my face.
What's up? Here we go.
I'm a bit of a crocophile, so don't try this at home.
This here's Rocky, and he ain't no puppy.
Now, let's see if Rocky's got some cavities.
Now, this mofo knows not to mess with Sir Joseph Dirt.
You didn't listen to me!
Rocky! Rocky! No!
Come on. Rocky!
Rocky!
When bad pets go bad, dang!
Joe, are you all right?
It's like the cartoons.
I'm seein' all tweet-tweet.
Joe, what can I do for you?
- You're not makin' any sense.
- Not makin'?
Not makin'?
That's why Dad named you
Joe Dirt instead of Nunamaker!
Nunamaker! Nunamaker!
That's what my sister said on the way to the Grand Canyon.
My last name's Dirt, her last name's Nunamaker!
That's my parents' last name!
I checked my list of Rambler wagons.
And there it was, Nunamaker.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
I was finally home.
Sir.
Hey, Mister, you know the people who live here, Nunamaker?
- They moved.
- What's that?
Moved!
They moved. 'Bout 15 year ago.
Had a little boy.
Had exact kind of haircut you got now.
Goddamn, you outta date, boy.
Yeah, man. That little boy, that's me.
My parents were... This was my home.
I thought this was it this time.
Nah. Home is where you make it.
You like to see homos naked?
Home is where you make it.
Yeah. You like to see homos naked.
- That's cool, man. Whatever.
- No, no, no, no, no!
Home is where you make it!
Home where you make it.
Everybody know that. Goddamn, boy.
Guy likes to see homos naked.
That don't help me.
So, there I was, right back where I started all those years ago, and no closer to findin' my parents.
And I think a little part of me died right there.
But you know that saying,
"Things get the darkest before dawn"?
I thought I had broken my ass bone.
So, I tried not to move.
And I'm lyin' there starin' at the moon.
And for the first time in my life,
I think about not gettin' back up.
Maybe I'll just lie there for the rest of my life, you know.
But then, suddenly, while starin' up at the moon,
I had this strange feeling that exact moment,
Brandy was starin' at that same moon.
And we were together.
And just then, all the tumblers fell into place.
And this door opened in my head, and all at once I understood everything.
You have to find the real answer inside yourself.
And the answer for me was that I had a home all along, with a friend that really cared about me.
Brandy. I missed her like crazy, and I decided it was time to go home.
My search was over.
Brandy, wish I hadn't gotten the machine.
It's me, Joe.
I got some crazy stuff to tell you, but the most important part is
I'm comin' back to Silvertown.
I can't wait to see you and tell you everything.
Brandy, I...
Message deleted.
Yeah!
Well, well, well, if it isn't dirty Joe Dirt.
Hey, Robby, what's crappenin'?
Don't get smart with me, you motherless dirtbag!
- You been here long enough.
- I'm here to see Brandy.
Brandy? My Brandy?
You haven't heard?
Me and her are gettin' married.
Yeah. And besides, she don't wanna see you anyway.
- I don't believe that.
- Well, it's true.
- She found your stupid parents.
- What?
Yeah, she found 'em down in California.
But she didn't wanna tell you,
'cause she wants you gone, out on the road lookin' for nothin', so you won't be here.
She's sick of all your crap.
She's sick of helpin' you.
And she's just plain sick of you.
No, she wouldn't do that. I know Brandy.
She wouldn't not tell me about my parents.
I don't care how sick of me she is.
Yeah? Well, check out this note she left me.
In case you called and I answered the phone.
"Dear Robby,
"if Joe calls,
"don't tell him
"I found his parents.
"I'll be back in a few days."
See, she signed it right there.
"Brandy. XOXO."
That's right, Dirt.
Nobody wants you in this town.
Nobody wants you around, period!
Look at him, fellas.
You cryin', boy? You cryin', boy?
Maybe we'll go back down to McDonald's and get you a whaa-burger and some French cries!
How about a Whineken?
You little sissy boy! Def Leppard sucks!
For the record, I wasn't crying'.
There was dirt in my eyes.
Joey, it's not cuttin' it, man.
It's jive.
- My story? No, man. Everything I said is true.
- No, not your story.
Brandy. Brandy is jive.
And I wanna get her on the phone right now.
I wanna track her down.
And I wanna ask her why she was playin' these games with you.
No, man.
No, you don't need to bother her none.
Freddy? Freddy, get line 3 on speaker.
No. No. You know what, guys, I'm fine.
Everything's cool with me.
I mean, I got a place up in Malibu,
I got lots of friends.
I do worry about you, man. You know why?
Because you're livin' In a boiler room, Joe.
Yeah, I got a couple places.
You know what, Joey? I think you...
You know what,
I can't believe I'm sayin'...
I think we need some resolution here.
We need a little closure.
I wanna get this woman on the phone, and I wanna ask her what the hell was goin' on back then.
Did she find your parents?
Did she ever track 'em down, and if she did, well, why couldn't she have called you?
Hello?
Well, well, well, the famous Brandy,
Tokyo Rose of the trailer park.
Hey, Brandy, I'm sittin' here with a friend of yours, a little white-trash treasure that you might know by the name of Joe Dirt.
- Ring a bell?
- Joe?
Yeah, Joe.
And I don't think he wants to talk to you, Brandy.
And you know why?
'Cause over the last few days, my listeners and I have heard an amazing story.
You know what? When he first started this story, I thought of you as a good person.
But the more it rolled on down the road,
I'm not sure you are a good person, Brandy.
Why didn't you tell him you'd found his parents?
Oh, my God. How'd he find out?
So, the letter Robby showed Joe is true?
You wrote that?
Yes, I wrote that letter, because I wanted to tell Joe in person.
And months went by, and he never came home.
Joe, I did find where your parents were.
Joe, brace yourself for this.
Your parents are dead, Joe.
They died that day at the Grand Canyon.
Their car was hit by a passin' truck, a hit-and-run.
I'm so sorry, but your search is over.
Come home, Joe, so I can take care of you.
Man.
- I gotta go.
- Sure.
Thank you.
All right, we'll... We'll take a break.
Yeah, he's Joe Dirt!
He's Joe Dirt! Yeah!
Joe Dirt! Joe Dirt! You rule, Joe!
You rule, Joe!
You rule! Joe Dirt! Joe Dirt! Joe Dirt!
Joe Dirt! Joe Dirt! Joe Dirt!
Joe Dirt! Joe Dirt!
The phenomenon of Joe Dirt has captured the city's imagination.
The little man, the ordinary person who endured enormous adversity, and all the while maintained his positive outlook on life, teaching us along the way,
"You can't have 'no' in your heart," and "Life's a garden. Dig it."
Mr. Dirt is seen here meeting one of his longtime idols, Eddie Money.
Welcome back to TRL.
We are here with America's sweetheart, Joe Dirt.
Joe? Joe, come back over here.
Joe! We have a show to do here.
People forget we're live.
You like the window, don't you?
Yeah!
Joe, before we wrap this up, is there anything else you wanna say?
I just wanna say thanks to all the people that stop me in the street and tell me my story helped them somehow.
And your story is really cool.
It's like a Behind the Music without the music.
But are you depressed? I mean, your parents, who you were looking for, all along, were dead.
Was the last decade a complete waste?
Well, no one's really put it like that, but I don't think so.
I've had some good times, I met some cool people, cruised around, cranked some tunes.
What about Brandy? Is there any chance you guys are gonna hook back up?
Well, you know, she's a good friend of mine, and she's off doin' her own thing right now, but I've always said she's a little too hot for old Joe Dirt.
I agree. So does America.
In fact, in our latest
"Is Brandy too hot For Joe Dirt?" poll,
61 % of you agreed.
Even worse, 4% said the dog was too hot for you.
- Dang.
- I'm just kidding.
You're on TRL, California.
Hello, California.
Hey, wait... Am I... Am I on? I'm on?
Hey, baby, I'm on! Yeah.
Hey, Carson, how big's your Johnny?
Joe, I think happy hour started a little early in California.
- A little drinky-drinky.
- The reason I'm really callin' is Joe Dirt's parents ain't dead.
I'm lookin' at his father right now, and I'm his mama.
Ma'am, you should never drink the bong water.
Yeah, listen to 'im.
Carson, just where you wanna be when Jesus comes back?
- Makin' fun...
- Sorry, Joe.
- Wait, wait. Where's that call comin' from?
- California.
- Listen, I gotta go.
- No, Joe!
- Joe?
- Joe?
So, Carson helped me trace the call, and it led me to this old trailer park in Simi Valley, California.
That's our old car!
Right here, guys. There he is.
Joe, can I have an exclusive?
Your parents are alive after all?
Joe! Joe! How are you feeling?
Mom, Dad, is that you?
Our baby's home.
Damn. We tried so hard to find him.
We looked high and low.
I got some pictures here. Look at this.
Here's a picture of Joe when he was a baby.
Did you get it? Yeah. Baby.
You were a cute baby, Joe Dirt.
That's why we were so crazy when we lost him.
I mean, he's here and now he's gone.
- Mama, it's all right.
- Where'd he go?
Did they get it? Where'd he go?
I was at the canyon, yeah.
You know what?
It was right by the garbage can where you left me.
Wha... Is that where you were?
Well, I'll be dipped.
- The one place we didn't look.
- I knew you looked for me.
I told everybody you would.
And was there ever a time when you would look at the moon, and was hopin' maybe I was lookin' at it, too?
Wouldn't you know that I've been doin' this clown sort of thing?
Can everybody get a shot of these?
Do you see these clown figurines?
Whenever I used to get sad,
I'd just look at a clown, and then I just can't help it.
I just can't stop grinnin'.
They're available for purchase.
We're startin' this Clown.com kind of a thing.
- Yeah.
- I...
I don't mean to interrupt your clown pitch there, but... But how exactly do you not go right back to the place where you saw me?
Hey, how exactly is a rainbow made?
How exactly does the sun set?
How exactly does the Posi-Trac rear end on a Plymouth work?
- It just does.
- It just does.
I'm not talkin' about Posi-Trac.
I'm talkin' about me.
How long did you look for me before you gave up?
How long were you ridin' in that car before you realized I wasn't in it?
Exactly how long?
All right! We didn't lose him.
We just left him.
So what? The dude's doin' fine!
Look at him!
How could you do that to me?
I was only eight years old.
I was just a little kid.
Do you have any idea what it's like to be a kid and have nobody around to talk to?
No one that cares if you're alive or dead?
Every day you just think you're worthless, and there's a void in your life.
- Come on, honey. Lose that frown!
- Lighten up, buddy.
When you're down, stare at a clown.
- That's right.
- Hey, sit down!
- You're blockin' the cameras!
- Move over.
I don't care about that!
And I don't care about you!
And I don't wanna see you for another 25 years!
Joe, wait!
I wish he'd never found us!
Look what he did to my children!
Hey, hey, TV people!
- Hey, you're grounded!
- Hey, TV people! Why are y'all goin' away?
Come over here!
You don't have to follow him!
What are you gonna do now, Joe?
Somebody do something.
Joe, just turn around now.
It's not worth it, Joe.
We are here at Wallace Bridge, where local celebrity Joe Dirt is threatening to kill himself.
Come on, Joe.
Remember what you said on the show?
Life's a garden. Dig it.
You gotta get down from there, brother.
You don't wanna do this.
Why not, man, I got nothin'.
I've been lookin' forever for those people, and everyone lies to me, man.
I'm worthless.
Joe!
Joe!
- Hey, sorry, lady. You can't cut through here.
- Joe, it's me, Brandy!
- It's Brandy? Like, the Brandy?
- Yes!
Okay. Why didn't you say so? Come on!
Hey, everybody, Brandy's here!
- Hey, it's Brandy!
- Come on, come on.
That's her!
- Joe!
- Brandy?
I'm here, Joe.
You told me my parents were dead, and I saw 'em.
They're horrible. Why did you lie to me?
They saw you on the news when you saved those kids. They thought you got a reward.
So, you did see 'em first.
So, it's just like Robby said.
Yes, but once I met them,
I knew I had to protect you from them.
They're bad people.
You're not like them, Joe.
They didn't leave you. You left them.
You've gotta see that.
And, Joe, if you had stayed with them, you wouldn't have turned out as wonderful as you are.
Robby said you didn't want me around, and he said that you was always laughin' at me behind my back.
Why would Robby say such a thing?
Of course, that's not true.
I love you, Joe, with all my heart.
I wanna get married, Joe, and have little Joe Dirts. Come home, Joe.
You had a home all along.
You just couldn't see it.
You really love me?
I did it! I did it!
I roped him with a bungee cord.
No!
Dang!
- No!
- Joe! Joe!
Man. I just had the weirdest dream.
You were in it.
So were you.
Oh, my God. Brandy, I'm home?
Clem, Charlene, Kicking Wing.
It's not Clem anymore.
- It's Gert B. Frobe.
- Wha?
Witness Protection relocated me.
I asked for Silvertown, on account of how you talked about it.
It's wonderful here.
Hello, Joe Dirt.
You taught me to sell the good stuff.
Now I have 30 fireworks stands, which completely fund my animal shelters.
- It's all because of you, Joe.
- Good job, brother.
I sold the gator farm, after one of those bastards snapped off my thumb and middle finger.
I came up here to check up on you, and, well, I met Gert B. Frobe.
And it's a good thing that gator didn't get my ring finger, because Gert's asked me to marry him.
Yeah.
- Right on.
- Joe?
When you were in the hospital for your head injury,
I had the doctor surgically put on a wig that's a little more contemporary.
Dang! That's cool.
And, Joe, we have a big surprise for you.
What's up?
My Hemi! You got it outta hock for me?
Dang! Yeah!
- Somebody else wants to get in here.
- Who's that?
Come on, boy! Come on!
Looks like Charlie!
Yep. Apparently, back in the day,
Charlie had a little sexual encounter with this one's ma.
Say hello to Charlie Two.
- Good boy.
- You got a big family now, Joe Dirt.
- You better be good to us.
- I will.
Hey, Dirt! I thought I told you, buddy, nobody wants you around!
Hey! You're talkin' to my guy all wrong.
It's the wrong tone.
Do it again, I'll stab you in the face with a soldering iron.
- You're his dad?
- What if I am?
What if we're his family?
Okay.
At least I know my car will blow his off the road!
You actually think you can match that little
Slant Six of yours against his 426 Hemi?
Well, then let's do it, little boy.
That's my girl.
- Let's rock, Dirtboy.
- Let's go!
Damn.
Now, it's time for the good stuff!
Yeah! Light her up!
This next song goes out to our good friend,
Joe Dirt, the dirt man.
Joe, wherever you are, this is for you, buddy.
Welcome home, Joe.
Welcome home.
It's time to wake up...
...and get a life.
We live in a three-dimensional world.
Until now, the world of computing's been flat,
consisting of two-dimensional imagery.
Now, through the use of exclusive breakthrough technology,
ARC has made it possible for you to get a life.
A Life, where we can work and play
in a lifelike world of three-dimensional reality.
A Life, the living monitor. lmpressed?
Yeah, I am.
Would you put one of those in a box for me?
- Are you the lawyer?
- I'm Rita Dunne.
Obviously, no one from Nexim could be here today.
- I'd invite you in, but...
- Good luck, Mr. Jennings.
- I'll see you in two months.
- Yeah.
Home sweet home.
What do you think?
This is the exact same technology?
Not the exact same technology, no.
Ultimately, I decided to reconceive some of it.
Ultimately, I decided to reconceive some of it.
I never liked the way the monitor looked.
And then it occurred to me...
...who needs it?
Gentlemen,
I am the future of computing.
And I would like to present you
with Nexim's new Freedom Line of display technology.
New from Nexim.
Freedom is in your future.
Launch this now.
ARC is not gonna last.
Who said 100 percent market share's impossible?
Get me Marketing immediately.
This far exceeds our expectations.
Congratulations.
Well...
...thank you.
You understand, Mr. Jennings, you've done in two months what we've been trying to do for three years.
Sometimes it's easier if you work backwards.
Cheers.
You won't remember me, will you?
No.
That's too bad.
Marker reached.
OK.
We're now extracting his memory from the marker forward to the present.
Jesus, Rita.
Jesus Christ!
This is dangerous enough.
If this man's brain temp goes one C above 43, he's a veg.
Come on, Mike.
Here we go.
It's all clean.
Good morning, sunshine.
Hey, how you doing, big guy?
- OK?
- Yeah.
All right. Thank you. Take it easy.
Slow, slow, slow.
There's no hurry, OK?
- That's it. Good?
- Yeah.
Good man. Hey, Mike, look at me.
Look at me. Right here.
What's the last date you remember?
- October 19.
- Very good.
Mike, what's the last thing you remember?
The Red Sox made the playoffs.
OK. Let's get the legal out of the way, shall we?
Mr. Michael Jennings, under the terms of your non-disclosure agreement, you are considered never to have been an employee.
You also understand that all your work is the intellectual property of Nexim...
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I never worked here. I never saw anybody. I never was here. I got it. ls my paycheck ready?
Alrighty.
- How you feeling, tiger?
- Good.
- Now let's hear you.
- All right.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Go! ln order to zero the full eight weeks
I had to heat your brain to 42.5 C.
- I'm fine.
- I'm saying it's getting harder, Mike.
- I said, I'm fine.
- You're slowing down. Come on.
I'd be faster if you'd shut up.
Show me what you've got, grasshopper.
That's it. That's more like it!
Yes! Go, go, go!
Go! Go!
Yes! Faster!
Beautiful!
Yes! One more! One more, Mikey!
See how you did that?
How you focused?
- Yeah. I focused on your face.
- You know you love me.
Come on. Don't be mean to the one who does everything for you.
Do you realize you've never once asked me what I see when I erase your memory?
Basically, the last two months just never happened for you.
What's to know?
20 hours a day in a clean room ripping off a guy's idea for a computer, selling it to somebody else.
What'd you do the last two months?
The last thing I remember is driving in Spain in the Aston Martin, learning to dive in Belize with what's-her-name.
The seven-stadiums-in-seven-days trip. It's great.
I mean, my memories are basically highlights.
It's good. It's a good life.
The stuff you erase, it doesn't matter.
What is it with guys like Rethrick?
He's gotta have everything, huh?
Say what you want about Jimmy, he started Allcom in his garage.
Wait, wait.
Don't you leave me alone.
What? You'll be fine. Talk. Mingle.
I don't want to mingle.
Hello.
I'm Michael.
I'm Rachel.
Rachel Porter. ls that Miss or Mrs.?
That would be Dr. Porter.
Doctor. Well, excuse me, doctor.
It's all right.
What kind of a doctor are you?
- I'm a biologist.
- Really?
Do you work for Jimmy?
It must be very top-secret biology that you practice.
Oh, yes. lsn't everything?
Let's go.
Excuse me?
I mean, I'm happy to continue blathering on, trying helplessly to charm you, but I thought maybe, you know, cut to the chase and just, you know, go somewhere.
I'll tell you what, Michael.
I'm gonna walk over there and talk to a friend of mine.
If you get the urge to have a real conversation, you'll know where to find me.
OK. Fair enough.
It was nice to meet you.
Giving up so easily?
You don't believe in second chances, now, do you? ln my experience, no, I don't.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Mike.
- Jimmy.
- How you doing?
- Good.
- Good to see you.
- You too.
- Thanks for coming.
- Thanks for having me.
- Come back this way.
- Sure.
Hey, Jimmy.
Now you're talking. Thank you.
Wait a second. lsaac, disable fire protection, please.
Alarm disabled.
I don't think you'd look good covered in foam. Even in that suit.
What's the pitch, Jimmy?
I know you're trying to sell me something. What is it?
When there was a time we were in school, we wanted to change the world.
I thought we wanted to save the world.
Well, that's semantics.
- What's the job, Jimmy?
- Can't tell you.
Other than to say that it involves optics.
And you get stock options for this one.
Get a real piece of the company.
What if it doesn't work?
I get a real piece of nothing.
I promise you, it won't fail.
How do you know that? ls this a real crystal ball?
I wish. The point is, I'll guarantee that you do eight figures.
- Minimum.
- What's the catch?
The job may require a little bit more time than you're used to.
- How much more time?
- Two years. Maybe three.
- You're kidding.
- Deadly serious.
Jimmy, that's impossible.
You can't do it.
The longest ever is eight weeks.
It was me.
Assuming it were possible, would you do it?
- Give up three years of my life?
- Not give up, trade.
Three years in return for the rest of your life.
One big paycheck. You're done.
A lot can happen in three years.
You blink, it'll be over.
Two seconds.
A heartbeat, then snap, you're rich beyond your wildest dreams.
One big paycheck. You're done.
Mr. Jennings. John Wolfe.
Welcome.
You won't be allowed to leave the grounds.
You'll be assigned a residence here on campus.
Your mail will be screened, no phone calls.
Anything you receive will have to be inspected.
OK.
I'll need your personal belongings.
Watch, wallet, anything else.
Nothing's allowed to be brought in.
These items will be returned to you when you pick up your paycheck.
Sorry. Those too.
- Mike, hey, you made it.
- Yeah.
- Good to see you.
- You too.
- Everything OK?
- Yep.
Sit down.
I assume Mr. Wolfe gave you all the fine print.
Yeah. He also took the last pair of sunglasses I've managed not to lose.
I'm sorry.
What is this?
It's for your memory wipe.
We inject you with an isotope, migrates to your brain serves as a marker.
Another injection erases everything back to the marker.
No barbaric cooking of the brain.
All right.
Wow.
- What have I gotten myself into?
- Let's go find out.
lnitiating Blue Script directory. lmpressive.
This used to be our smallest unit.
Now it's our most profitable.
Mr. Rethrick, may I speak with you for a moment?
- Have a look around. I'll be right back.
- OK.
Cycle complete.
Begin transmission of data.
All right! I give up! I give up.
Don't give up.
Dr. Porter. I guess I'm lucky you didn't use thunder and lightning.
True.
OK, well, I won't question your powers in the future.
Sorry, I just couldn't help myself.
I thought you said Marianne was on a plane.
She was planning to make the conference call from the plane, sir.
Look. I should probably apologize for my behavior the other day.
I get like that sometimes, and I shouldn't. I'm sorry.
Careful. You are in danger of sounding like you want a second chance.
- Everything OK?
- Yeah.
- Say something else.
- Excuse me?
Say something nice.
Quick, otherwise I'll forget it.
Was that little breeze for our boy here?
Well, I owed him one. Now we're even.
Be nice, Mike's moving into the neighborhood.
Oh.
- See you around.
- OK.
- You ready?
- Yeah. Let's go.
You can still back out.
No hard feelings.
No, I want to stay.
Michael Jennings, meet the other half of your team, Dr. William Dekker.
- Nice to meet you.
- It's a pleasure.
Gentlemen. Let's have a look at the next three years of your lives.
What happened?
Michael.
You're done.
- How long was it, Jimmy?
- It's been three years, Mike.
- How'd I do?
- You did good.
Your money's been transferred to your account at Reddy Grant.
You've got an appointment there at 1:00.
Just go home, do the paperwork.
When you feel up to it, give me a call.
We've got a lot of catching up to do.
Ninety-two million dollars.
Everyone at Reddy Grant appreciates your business.
Well, not as much as I appreciate my business, I promise you.
OK.
Just sign there.
- All right.
- Great.
- Your personal items.
- Yes.
You only needed four stamps.
Oh, well, guess I could afford the extra 50 cents.
I don't think this is my stuff.
- It's not?
- No.
- I don't know what happened.
- It's all right. Don't worry about it.
It doesn't matter.
Let's talk about my shares.
What I'd like to do is get some money now, and, you know, put the rest away for long term, to live off.
So how do we do that?
Mr. Jennings, you forfeited your shares.
I beg your pardon? What?
Yeah, here. Dated four weeks ago.
You surrendered the shares and stated to deliver only the envelope of personals.
- Don't you remember doing that, sir?
- No.
I don't remember that, because I didn't do that.
Why would I do that? I wouldn't do that. It doesn't make sense.
A mistake has been made, and it needs to be corrected.
- I agree. It's a strange thing you did...
- It's not strange.
Strange is a little out of the ordinary, but still plausible.
Giving away $100 million in shares in a Fortune 500 company for some knickknacks isn't strange, it's insane.
No one would do that.
Doesn't make sense.
Unless you think this is a $40-million can of hair spray, which is pink.
What, this is a $100-million book of matches?
I've been out of it a few years. ls this back in style now?
Are these $100-million sunglasses?
I'll look into it, but it's gonna take me some time.
This is crazy. I'm gonna make some phone calls.
Mr. Rethrick's office.
- It's Michael Jennings. It's important.
- I'm sorry, he stepped away.
He won't be back until this afternoon.
I can try him on his cell phone.
Just have him call me as soon as he gets in. OK?
- OK.
- Thank you.
Listen, guys, a mistake has been made here. All right?
- I'm not a traitor. I'm an engineer.
- A reverse engineer, right?
We know that you accepted payment of classified government technology.
Mike, that's called treason. ln this country, people get fried for that one. ln this country when the FBl harasses you, you also get an attorney.
Not today you don't.
What the hell is this?
The attorney general calls me and says that Michael Jennings' cooperation is a matter of national security.
Look, first of all, that stuff isn't mine, OK?
A mistake...
What is...?
Perfect fit. You were saying?
Well, let me show you a few pieces of the puzzle that we're solving.
William Dekker, government physicist, weapons division.
Three years ago, his project gets shelved.
He didn't like that, so he sold his work. Classified work.
Showed it to several corporations.
We think Rethrick bought it.
Unfortunately, we can't link Rethrick to the sale, because Dekker died.
Natural causes.
''Natural'' being gravity after a 1 40-foot fall out of his apartment building.
What does this have to do with me?
Patent applications filed this month.
They show designs based on Dekker's work.
Look whose signature is on every one of those documents.
Get it?
It's your name on those patents!
Rethrick can claim he knows nothing about Dekker or the design.
You need to tell us everything you did for Rethrick.
- I can't.
- You'd rather spend your life in prison protecting your friend?
- Help us, and we can work with you.
- I can't. I can't!
He wiped my memory!
I don't remember!
I'll tell you whatever I know.
I was set up. Believe me.
I don't remember what I did for the past three years!
What?
Wait a second!
Wait!
We figured Rethrick tried a wipe, so we'll try an extraction.
You're not gonna see anything.
You're wasting your time.
We're getting something here.
Come on!
Come on!
Shit.
We got nothing.
Hold on a second.
I need a smoke.
Hold on a second.
I need a smoke.
Boss.
He won't mind.
- Smoke!
- Shit!
- Goddamn it!
- I can't see anything!
Secure the door!
Where the hell is he?
- He's loose!
- Don't worry, he can't go anywhere!
Cover the door!
I'll get the lights!
I can't see!
Get low to the ground!
Stay low to the ground!
Mitchell!
See anything?
- ls that him?
- Klein, where'd you go?
Al, shut the door!
What's going on?
Good night, Mikey.
Copy that.
- Watch it, coming through!
- Go! Go! Go!
- Coming through!
- Out of the way!
- See him?
- I see him!
- Out of the way, lady!
- There!
Move! Move! Move!
- Coming through!
- Let's go!
Excuse me.
Coming through!
- Out of the way! Open those gates!
- Watch it, man.
Come on! Come on!
Where did he go?
I'll get men at every stop!
He'll be long gone by then!
How the hell did he do that?
- Sorry.
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.
- Be careful.
Hey! Hey!
Watch it!
Hey! Hey!
Jane. Relax.
Everything's fine.
You talked to federal agents.
It's OK.
It's been worked out now.
I just need to find out who sent these items.
Will you help me out?
- They were sent three years ago.
- No. There was a mix-up.
Somebody else sent these. I need to find out who that is and talk to them.
Replacements were sent a few weeks ago.
- Who sent it?
- Well, you did.
That's you right here.
See? Twenty items.
I'm gonna need all your personal belongings.
Michael Jennings died at three minutes after 3.
The government, left with no case, closed its investigation of Allcom.
So you see, it's impossible that he escaped unless you changed something.
I didn't.
- What were you doing, exactly?
- I was eating pie.
He left the attorney's office exactly when it predicted.
The Feds took him exactly when it predicted...
But he didn't die like it predicted!
Michael Jennings is not a super agent.
He's an engineer.
Yet somehow he managed to escape from a double-locked room.
How? Was it fate?
No, fate was on our side.
That means someone changed something. And it wasn't me.
And if it wasn't you, then who the...?
Has anyone checked the machine since Michael walked out of here?
Find him.
''If you only look where you can't go,
''you will miss the riches below.''
Yeah, I'm already missing my riches.
A combination? A code?
A password?
''New Liberty Savings.''
New Liberty Savings Bank, please.
What does that mean?
You're saying the bank doesn't exist?
That's comforting.
Who sent these items?
You did.
That's you right here.
See? Twenty items.
These are patent applications.
Look whose signature is on every one of those documents!
A mistake has been made here.
I'm not a traitor!
Dekker died!
Rethrick can claim he knows nothing about Dekker or the design.
Believe me! I don't remember what I did for the past three years!
Michael.
Michael.
You're done.
Hello?
Jesus, Shorty.
You don't know how good it is
- to hear a familiar voice.
- Michael?
Listen, man.
I'm in a... I'm in a jam, and I need you.
All right.
All right.
Meet me at Union Station at 9:00.
- I'll be there.
- OK, buddy.
Outbound local from Seattle to Kent departing from track five.
Eastbound Spokane, gate ten.
Michael.
Say one word about this hat and I'm out of here.
Oh, man!
Oh, my God.
I told you not to take that job, Mike.
- Come on, let's get a table.
- OK.
- lnjections?
- Yeah.
You would have to do it that way, I guess.
But, of course, that's a chemical process.
So?
Well, you'd have some latent memories.
Maybe that's what I'm seeing.
Most likely. Memories that made it through the wash, stirred up when the feds went in your head.
Why would I have these things?
Explain this.
I sent myself this junk instead of the money.
Oh, brother.
I don't know.
That's not the question you should be asking.
- No?
- No. You should be asking yourself, why did you give up all that money?
That's the most bizarre part of this whole thing.
Ninety million dollars. Nobody changes that much in three years.
OK, all right, buddy.
I wanna figure out what you built.
All right, let's work backwards.
They told me I was working on a design by someone named Dekker.
- Dekker?
- Yeah.
- William Dekker?
- I think so.
What I heard was, he was working on something level five for the feds.
They came in, shut him down.
- What was it?
- Well, the consensus was a laser.
- Why?
- Because Dekker's drawings called for a mirror and a lens.
The only thing that uses those is a laser or a satellite camera to see things from far away.
Here comes the first number, 1 7.
Followed by 44.
- The lens required perfect optics.
- Four.
- The mirror...
- Twenty-six.
- So the capital outlay is huge.
- Thirty-seven.
- Word was it was gonna cost
- Forty.
- 500 billion dollars.
- And
the bonus number is 22.
Who's gonna spend 500 billion dollars just to see something?
What?
No way I get out of that extraction room without the cigarettes and the glasses.
I would've never gotten on the bus without the ticket.
If I didn't have the ring, I wouldn't have followed that kid to Reddy Grant.
- Right.
- I gave up that money just to make sure that I would pay attention to these items.
Why?
Because I know what you'd spend 500 billion dollars to see.
The future.
If you selected five numbers
and the bonus number, you're a second-prize winner.
He used a virus.
The machine went down at 3:03 this afternoon.
Can you program around the virus?
No. It's not that kind of virus.
Come on, I'll show you.
It's not in the software.
It's in the hardware.
He put a circuit somewhere in here.
It's like a poison pill.
But you can find it, right?
Yeah, I can.
Then do it.
Slight change of plans.
According to Mr. Stevens, we don't need Jennings.
Look, if we know anything, we know that time travel's not possible.
Einstein proved that, right?
Time travel, yes.
But Einstein was very clear that he believed time viewing
- theoretically could be accomplished...
- Mike, Mike. Come on.
Maybe we should just find Dekker...
- I can't talk to Dekker.
- Why not?
- He had an accident.
- An accident?
Yeah, he...
He fell out of his bedroom window.
Fell out of...?
He fell out of his bedroom window!
I see. Sure.
That could happen.
Jesus. Wait a minute!
- We've gotta get out of here!
- Shorty, listen to me.
I think what happened was I used this thing,
I saw my future.
And I saw what I needed to change it.
But all I could get out of Allcom were these innocuous items.
Each item has to be used at a specific time and place to accomplish whatever
I needed to get done.
I mean, without the stuff in here,
I'd already be dead.
Yeah, well, it's too bad that you don't know what the rest of them are for.
What?
Gotcha!
Hey!
Great seeing you again, Mike!
Jesus!
Those guys do not look like feds.
Here. Listen to me.
Take this.
This will get you through that door.
Close it behind you. Understand? Go!
- OK!
- Go! Go on!
Shit!
Go!
Oh, God, I hope that was a good thing to do.
Shit.
Go.
Where's your gun?
He's got it.
So...
...how are you, Mike?
You?
Why?
Don't remember?
You brought this on yourself, Mike.
So how does it feel knowing you're going to die?
Shit.
He designed his own escape?
Mr. Attorney General, sir, we have no explanation.
After looking at the evidence the only logical, albeit hard-to-accept conclusion, is he was able to predict what was going to happen to him.
These are memories extracted from Jennings before he fled.
They don't seem to add up to anything.
Gladys.
That's all for today.
We knew Dekker was trying to design something, but when he sold his plans, he wasn't even halfway done.
I don't understand.
Dekker was working at JPL on a laser-enhanced lens.
He claimed the lens was powerful enough to see around the curvature of the universe.
He believed if you could see around a curve that went on forever you would end up back where you started, looking at yourself.
Except you're not looking at yourself now, in the present.
No, you are not.
You're looking at the future. lmagine what will happen if Jennings figures it out and tries to profit from it.
- Any nation will give a king's ransom.
- He won't do that.
I was this close. He never lied.
When he was accused he was hurt and scared.
Bring him in,
I'll give him the Medal of Honor.
That's if Rethrick doesn't find him first.
You think he really saw the future?
That would be something.
Café Michel?
My name is Michael Jennings.
And I can't remember if I made a reservation there recently.
Would you check that out for me?
Thanks.
I did?
OK.
Right. How many is it for?
Oh, no, thank you.
No, I'll be there.
Thank you.
Hello, you two.
Did he feed you?
Rachel, it's Jimmy.
- You all right?
- Why?
You don't know?
No.
May I come in?
When was the last time you saw Michael?
Yesterday morning.
He was pulling an all nighter at his lab.
Rachel, I'm sorry to have to be the one to tell you this.
Michael left Allcom yesterday.
Permanently.
- What?
- He finished his work.
- We erased his memory, and he...
- No.
- He left.
- No. He promised me.
He said he wasn't going to go through with it.
He made a lot of money on this one, Rachel.
He said he didn't care about the money.
So she doesn't know anything.
He wouldn't leave without her.
It's Michael. He'd be smart.
We're missing something.
Soon as she leaves for work, get in there.
Make sure she can't go anywhere alone.
I want to know what just happened.
Bye, guys.
Good morning, Dr. Porter.
Going somewhere?
Good morning.
Good morning.
I'm going to go up top.
Take my bag.
- You're gonna need this.
- Got it. Thanks.
Coming?
No, thanks.
I'd rather watch from down here.
Suit yourself.
We've been through the bathroom and the rest of the apartment. Zero.
This is what I want you to do.
Go back in the bathroom.
OK, start turning left.
Tell me what you see.
The mirror.
We've got him.
She's supposed to meet him at Café Michel, 1 p.m.
Well, let's make sure she does.
I'm here to meet someone.
Michael Jennings.
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.
Sit at that table right there. ln the seat, with your back to the window.
Michael, thank God you're all right.
I thought I was never gonna see you again.
Michael, it's me.
Rachel.
Look...
You can't remember me.
No. I'm sorry.
Cops. We can't go in.
I'll have to wait for a clear shot.
Maya, stall for time.
Tell him you thought he'd remember something.
That you two were engaged.
I guess I thought you'd remember something.
We've been together for three years.
I don't know what to say.
I'm really sorry.
I'm trying.
That's how he's doing this.
Listen to me very carefully, Maya.
This is what I want you to say.
Michael, I can see you still have the envelope.
That means it's working.
I know you switched the personal items. I helped.
- You left me a note on a mirror.
- You left me a note on a mirror.
I'm supposed to take something.
Something I can use to get to Stevens.
- He's a man you worked with.
- He's a man you worked with.
He's trying to fix the machine.
Work backwards, Michael.
Yeah. Take the swipe card.
That's the swipe card for the campus.
You're supposed to give that to me.
Rachel wouldn't be hurt if he hesitated, she'd be impatient.
Look, Michael, if you can't trust me right now, then we are lost. For good.
Nice.
OK.
I'd better get back.
They'll get suspicious soon.
Wait here.
I'll be back in half an hour.
And don't worry, we end up together.
Michael...
I love you.
- What's my favorite baseball team?
- What?
What's my favorite baseball team?
Who cares?
Who cares?
That would be the Red Sox.
- I think maybe we should go.
- Wait!
Now we can leave.
Come on.
Wait! Hold on.
- You have a car?
- I might.
You might?
Look for a BMW!
You gotta be joking.
Shit! Shit!
- Let me see that key.
- Why?
You're in the wrong section.
Jennings bought the BMW on the lnternet.
He had the key mailed to him four weeks ago.
- What's the color of his car?
- It isn't a car.
They just turned on Pine. lntercept them on Sixth.
- How good am I on this thing?
- You're OK!
- Look, I just said you're OK, OK?
- OK.
Hang on!
- Report of shots. Southgate BMW.
- Got it.
Stop! I lost the envelope!
- I'll come back and get you.
- See you!
Got it!
Let's get out of here.
Take us down!
Mike, we can help you!
We know what's going on!
Let us bring you in!
He's headed for the tunnel!
Cut him off! Cut him off!
Duck!
Split!
You think Jennings foresaw that?
Maybe next time he'll see a nice quiet stakeout.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's OK.
It's all for you anyway.
And I...
I brought you some clothes.
I thought you might need them.
I hope it's OK.
Thank you.
These are mine?
You don't remember?
No.
You don't remember me, do you?
Well...
These are for you.
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
You're so sweet.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I just don't remember.
I shouldn't have left.
You're saying he sent himself a different set of personal items after using the machine, and nothing our security would flag.
Everyday things combined with the power of foresight transform Michael from engineer to escape artist.
I don't know about you, but I'd like to return the favor.
Michael, are you OK?
I'm all right.
Michael, I don't know what you saw in your machine, but I remember, a few weeks ago, you came back from your lab, pale.
You asked me the strangest question.
- What?
- If I knew it wouldn't work out for you and I, before we were together, would I have done it?
What did you say?
That I wouldn't trade our time for anything.
That's all we are, the sum of our experiences.
Besides, some of the best things in life are total mistakes.
- What?
- You know, when I checked this envelope out, they told me I signed in 20 items, but there were only 19.
I don't understand.
What are these pictures of?
Michael, look at the rest of the pictures.
Look at the last one.
Oh, my God. It's the future.
The machine predicts a war, and we go to war to avert it.
It predicts a plague. We herd all the sick together, create a plague.
Whatever future this predicts, we make happen.
We give over control of our lives completely.
I did this.
Seeing the future will destroy us.
If you show someone their future,
they have no future.
You take away the mystery, you take away hope.
I have to go back.
I have to destroy that machine.
It's impossible. The campus is huge.
There are hundreds of guards.
I wouldn't have given up the three years we had unless I was sure
I could get us 50 more.
OK. So how do we get in?
- We don't.
- You said everything was happening for a reason, and that includes me being here.
So come on.
Hey, Rachel.
Another day at the most.
I don't have many places to look.
I guess you weren't as smart as you thought, Stevens.
Hey, Jennings wouldn't find it any faster unless he knew where to look.
We've got the feeds from mass transit.
- He could be anywhere by now.
- Except he's not running away.
He could've given himself a way to disappear, but look what he gave himself instead.
His Allcom security pass.
He's going back.
Get a warrant to tap phone and data lines coming out of Allcom.
Put some bodies on that campus.
I want that machine!
Jennings and the girl were spotted.
What do you want me to do?
Nothing.
- Stay where you are.
- Nobody gets through!
- Sir!
- I didn't do anything!
Settle down!
All the metal detectors on level four just went off. Ball bearings.
Just down the hall from the metal detectors.
Pull the guards off the Jennings lab.
Let him slip in, think he's fooled us.
Once he's fixed the machine, take him.
I built this.
This door shouldn't be open.
There's something wrong.
They're expecting us.
Better close this door behind us.
And keep it shut.
- He's in.
- Confirmed. He's in.
Once we confirm he's at the machine, let's go after him.
I thought we were gonna wait for him to come out.
I can't wait! Jennings or the machine, I don't care, as long as I get one. Let's go!
This will do. Watch out.
- What are you doing?
- Smashing the lock.
Hold on a second.
You can't just smash the thing.
They'll still be able to get in.
We gotta jam the outside reader.
Let's go.
Let's take a look at the future before we destroy this thing.
I bugged it. I rigged it so Jimmy wouldn't use it against me.
Then you can fix it, right?
Now, where would I have planted that bug?
Maybe on one of the motherboards.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, we won't be needing this, OK?
You're dangerous with that thing.
You must have given yourself something to help you find it.
The only things left are the bullet and...this.
- Crossword?
- Yeah.
Look at this.
Twelve down.
Maybe it's here.
Nine, ten, eleven, twelve.
Let's take a look.
Maybe it's a circuit diagram.
I wouldn't have put it in the primary path.
Twelve down.
Take him.
OK, corridor three, sublevel A,
Jennings' lab.
All right, let's put this thing to good use one last time.
Let's get us out of here.
That's in the lab.
It's the catwalk.
Look, I've changed my future before, using this thing. I can do it again.
Don't have time. Gotta destroy this before they get it.
Reprogram the door to Jennings' lab, please.
Now.
He must've done something to the controller.
- How are we gonna get out of here?
- I don't know.
Clear!
- What are you doing?
- These are liquid hydrogen.
They're used to cool the machine.
They fire in order.
Number one just fired.
When it gets down to number six here, that's all she wrote.
I'll see you when this goes off, Jimmy.
Come on!
You see?
You judge too soon.
They went out through the vent.
Spread out, find them.
Position three standing by.
Come on.
Freeze!
Look out.
Seal off all exits to the lab.
All right, Jennings, let's see what you've been up to.
Rachel, go for the door, OK?
Drop the gun.
Drop the gun.
Looks like Michael's got a date on the catwalks.
Let's make sure he makes it.
- Let's go.
- We can't take the catwalk.
I know. We won't, I promise.
Come on, let's go.
- Michael! What are you doing?
- Go. I'll distract them.
- Go, please.
- No!
Listen to me. This is my debt.
I built this machine.
- I have to pay for it.
- You come with me now!
You promised you'd change your fate!
Please, we don't have time.
If you love me, if you care about me, go. Have a good life.
Remember me.
Damn you.
Jimmy.
You want to kill me, come do it yourself.
Here I am. You want me?
Come get me.
- Hi, Jimmy.
- Hi, Mike.
- Looks like this is it, huh?
- It is, Mike.
- You only have yourself to blame.
- That's a lie.
You can't change your fate.
You're gonna die today.
Maybe.
But you're not going to kill me.
That's right, Mike.
I've seen the future.
Still think you can change your fate, Mike?
I am the future, Mike!
- Rethrick has Jennings.
- Retire him.
- What?
- We have the machine.
We can't risk its creator falling into the wrong hands. Come on.
Don't blame me.
You and Michael would've lived happily ever after, no memory wipe.
He saw something he didn't like.
He's the one who decided he wanted to stop the program.
Look at it this way, you did change the future, Michael.
Before you interfered you both would've lived and we would still be friends, instead of ending up like this.
It wasn't meant to be.
Giving up so easy?
Don't you believe in second chances?
To tell you the truth, I do.
Go, go, go.
Rachel!
Let's go.
Look.
Any records? Any papers?
Explosion destroyed everything.
- Are we trying to salvage that or what?
- I guess we don't get the machine.
Any sign of Jennings?
No, I'm afraid he didn't make it.
What was Shorty thinking, starting a nursery?
I mean, these plants are on life-support.
What do you mean? Really?
He told me he had a green thumb.
Gangrene is more like it.
Lucky for Shorty, I'm a biologist.
Lucky for both of us.
Since I failed biology,
- I'm no help to either one of you.
- So you say.
Too bad, though, because I'm looking for a partner
- for a start-up company.
- Really? Doing what?
We're gonna save the world.
I don't think I'm your guy.
But would you settle for someone who wants to help you change it?
- OK.
- Good.
So how does it end for us, Michael?
I mean, what's in our future?
You know, I don't know.
I kind of like it that way.
- I do know one thing.
- What's that?
I never want to forget anything ever again.
Break it up, break it up.
The birdman cometh.
- Shorty.
- It's dinner.
- You found them.
- Yes, I did.
- Who does everything for everybody?
- You do.
- You're right.
- You're my hero.
Thank you very much.
- You hear that? I'm a hero.
- That's great.
I think I remember.
Are those our birds?
Yes, of course they are.
We bought them together.
You remember the birds? Well done.
You could see into the future and all you remember are Polly and Tweety there.
Why not remember something that'd make us rich?
- Wait a second.
- What is it?
- I think there was something else.
- No, no, no.
The envelope's empty.
Don't worry about it.
Hold on. I'm working backward here.
''If you only look where you can't go, you will miss the riches below.''
I must've known you'd never get rid of these birds.
Of course not. They're family.
So I knew this would be here.
What only looks where it can't go?
A caged bird.
''You will miss the riches below.''
The riches below.
What is that?
Well, that's a $90-million lottery ticket.
- Wait. Wait a minute.
- It's $90 million.
- Nice.
- Yes, I'm proud of it.
Wait a minute. No.
- Wait.
- What are you doing?
You know what?
I think now's a good time to discuss my commission, 33%.
- I thought it was 5.
- No, 33.
- Thirty-three percent!
- He deserves it.
It was found on my premises.
I'll get back to you.
I'm gonna cash this in.
Who am I? You sure you want to know?
The story of my life
is not for the faint of heart.
If somebody said
it was a happy little tale...
... if somebody told you I was just an
average guy, not a care in the world...
... somebody lied.
But let me assure you, this,
like any story worth telling...
... is all about a girl.
That girl. The girl next door.
Mary Jane Watson.
The woman I've loved
since before I liked girls.
I'd like to tell you that's me
next to her.
Aw, heck, I'd even take him.
Hey! Stop the bus!
That's me.
Tell him to stop! Please!
Stop!
Hey! Stop the bus!
Stop! He's been chasing us since Woodhaven.
Catch a cab, Parker!
Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.
What a geek!
- Don't even think about it.
- You're so lame, Parker.
Would you date him?
Midtown High seniors.
No wandering. Proceed direct...
Knock it off.
Remember, it is a privilege to be here.
We're guests of Columbia University's
Science Department.
So behave accordingly.
Let's not have a repeat of our trip to the planetarium.
Come on, stay together.
Proceed up the steps and into the building.
- Where were you?
- Checking out the library.
- Looking at the books.
- Yeah, right.
- Can we drive around the corner?
- Why?
The entrance is right there.
Dad, this is public school.
I can't show up in a Rolls.
I should trade my car for a Jetta...
...because you flunked out of private school?
- It wasn't for me.
- Of course it was.
- Don't ever be ashamed of who you are.
- I'm not ashamed of who I am.
It's just...
Just what, Harry?
Forget it.
Pete!
- Hi, Harry.
- Hey, man. What's up?
- Won't you be needing this?
- Thanks.
- This is my father, Norman Osborn.
- I've heard so much about you.
- It's an honor, sir.
- Harry says you're a science whiz.
I'm something of a scientist myself.
I read your research on nanotechnology. Brilliant.
- You understood it?
- Yes, I wrote a paper on it.
Impressive.
Your parents must be very proud.
- I live with my aunt and uncle.
- Hey, you two! Let's move!
- Nice to meet you.
- Hope to see you again.
- He doesn't seem so bad.
- Not if you're a genius.
I think he wants to adopt you.
There are over 32,000 known species of spider in the world.
There are over 32,000 known species of spider in the world.
They're in the order Araneae, divided into three suborders.
That's amazing!
This is the most advanced electron microscope on the East Coast.
It's unreal.
Arachnids from all three groups possess...
...varying strengths to help them search for food.
For example, the Delena spider, family Sparassidae...
...has the ability to jump to catch its prey.
For the school paper?
Next, we have the net web spider, family Filistatidae...
...genus Kukulcania.
Spins a funnel- shaped web whose strands have a tensile strength...
...proportionately equal to the high-tension wires used in bridges.
- Leave him alone.
- Or what?
Or his father will fire your father.
What's Daddy gonna do? Sue me?
What is going on?
The next person who talks will fail this course.
- This spider...
- Let's go.
...hunts using reflexes with nerve- conduction velocity so fast...
...that some researchers believe it borders on precognition.
- An early awareness of danger.
- Jerks.
A spider- sense.
Hey, look at that spider.
Some spiders change colors to blend into their environment.
It's a defense mechanism.
Peter, what makes you think
I'd want to know that?
Who wouldn't?
Over five painstaking years,
Columbia's research facility...
- You gonna talk to her now?
- Oh, no. Come on. You talk to her.
With these DNA blueprints, we have begun what was once thought impossible.
- Disgusting.
- Yeah, hateful little things.
I love them!
Yeah, me too.
You know, spiders can change their color...
...to blend into their environment.
- Really?
- Yeah, it's a defense mechanism.
- Cool.
- Transfer RNA to encode an entirely new genome...
...combining the genetic information from all three...
...into these 15 genetically designed super- spiders.
There's 14.
I beg your pardon?
- One's missing.
- Yeah.
I guess the researchers are working on that one.
Do you know that this is the largest electron microscope on the East Coast?
You were talking throughout that woman's entire presentation.
Let's talk about listening.
I don't know what it's like at those fancy private schools...
I don't know what it's like at those fancy private schools...
...but at Midtown High...
Could I take your picture?
I need one with a student in it.
- Sure.
- Great.
Where do you want me?
Over here?
Yeah, that's great.
Don't make me look ugly.
That's impossible.
Perfect.
- Is that good?
- Great.
That's great.
M.J., let's go!
Wait. Thanks!
Parker, let's do it.
We've solved the horizon glide and the balance issues.
I've already seen the glider.
That's not what I'm here for.
General Slocum, good to see you again.
Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.
- Norman.
- Mr. Osborn.
Always a pleasure to have our board of directors visit.
I want the report on human performance enhancers.
We tried vapor inhalation with rats.
Their strength increased by 800%.
- Excellent.
- Any side effects?
Once.
All the tests since have been successful.
In the trial that went wrong, what were the side effects?
Violence, aggression...
...and insanity.
- What do you recommend?
- That was only one test.
Except for Dr. Stromm, our staff certifies the product...
...ready for human testing.
- Dr. Stromm?
We need to take the whole line back to formula.
- Back to formula?
- Dr. Osborn.
I'll be frank with you.
I never supported your program. We have my predecessor to thank for that.
The general has approved
Quest Aerospace...
...to build a prototype of their exoskeleton.
- They test in two weeks.
- And if your performance enhancers...
...have not had a successful human trial by that date...
...l'm gonna pull your funding.
I'm going to give it to them.
Gentlemen. Ladies.
And the Lord said, "Let there be light."
And voilà! There is light.
Forty soft, glowing watts of it.
Good boy. God will be thrilled.
Just don't fall on your ass.
I'm already on my ass, May.
When the plant's senior electrician is laid off after 35 years...
...what would you call it?
I am on my ass.
Hand me that dish. The green one.
The corporation is downsizing the people...
...and upsizing their profits.
Oh, Ben, you'll get another job somewhere.
Well, let's look in the paper and see.
There are the want ads.
What do we got here?
Computer...
Computer salesman, computer engineer, computer analyst.
My Lord, even the computers need analysts these days.
I'm 68. I'm too old for computers, and besides, I have a family to provide for.
I love you. And Peter loves you.
You're the most responsible man
I've ever known.
We've been down-and-out before.
But somehow, we survive.
Hi, sweetie. You're just...
Just in time for dinner.
How you doing? How was the field trip?
I don't feel well.
I'm gonna go to sleep.
- You won't have a bite?
- Had a bite.
Did you get some pictures, Peter?
I gotta crash. Everything's fine.
What's that all about?
In this recombination lab...
... we use synthesized transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...
... combining the genetic
information from all three...
... into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.
Dr. Osborn, please.
The performance enhancers aren't ready.
The data just doesn't justify this test.
Now, I'm asking you for the last time.
We can't do this.
Don't be a coward.
Risks are part of laboratory science.
Let me reschedule, with a medical staff and a volunteer.
- Just give me two weeks.
- Two weeks?
In two weeks? We'll have lost the contract to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.
Sometimes you gotta do things yourself.
- Get me the Promachloraperazine.
- For what?
It begins catalyzation when the vapor hits the bloodstream.
40,000 years of evolution...
...and we've barely tapped the vastness of human potential.
Oh, that's cold.
Norman?
Norman!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Norman!
Back to formula?
Weird.
- Peter?
- Yeah?
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
- Any better this morning? Any change?
- Change?
Yep. Big change.
- Well, hurry up. You'll be late.
- Right.
Okay.
- Goodness me!
- Jeez. I thought you were sick.
- I got better.
- See?
- Bye, guys.
- Have you got your lunch money?
Don't forget, we're painting the kitchen after school.
Sure, Uncle Ben.
Don't start without me.
And don't start up with me.
Teenagers. Raging hormones.
They never change.
You're trash!
You're always gonna be trash!
- I have to go to school.
- Who's stopping you?
Hi, M.J.
Hey, M.J.
I don't know if you realize this, but we've been neighbors since I was 6.
And I was wondering if we could get together sometime?
I got the car. Hop in.
Do something fun?
Or, I don't know.
I thought it'd be time to get to know each other.
Or not.
Sorry, Parker, the bus is full!
- Stop the bus!
- Catch a cab!
Tell him to stop.
- Check him out!
- Dork!
Dad!
Dad, are you all right?
Harry.
What are you doing on the floor?
I don't know.
Have you been there all night?
Last night I was...
What?
- I don't remember.
- Mr. Osborn?
Sir, I asked her to wait.
- My father's not feeling well...
- Mr. Osborn, Dr. Stromm is dead.
What?
They found his body in the lab.
He's been murdered, sir.
- What?
- And the flight suit and the glider...
- What about it?
- Stolen, sir.
Wow! Great reflexes!
- Thanks.
- No problem.
Hey, you have blue eyes.
I didn't notice without your glasses.
You just get contacts?
Well, see you.
- What happened?
- He's freaking weird.
Did you see that?
Parker?
- It's a fight!
- Think you're funny?
- It was an accident.
- So is my breaking your teeth.
- Flash, stop.
- I don't want to fight you.
- I wouldn't want to fight me neither.
- Kick his ass.
Help him, Harry.
How'd he do that?
Which one?
He's all yours, man.
Flash, get up!
Jesus, Parker, you are a freak.
That was amazing.
I'm out of here. Come on.
Go, web!
Fly.
Up, up and away, web.
Shazam!
Go! Go!
Go, web, go!
Tallyho.
- Is she back with the beer yet?
- What?
Bring me some beer.
- Get up off your ass.
- I paid for beer...
- Stop yelling.
- Stop it!
You're as stupid as your mother.
Where's she going?
Where you going?
The dishes aren't done.
Somebody's gotta do dishes.
- Why don't you do them?
- Get in here and do the dishes.
- You do them. They're yours, anyway.
- I'm going out!
- Were you listening to that?
- No.
Well, I heard, but I was just taking out the trash.
I guess you can always hear us.
Everybody shouts.
Your aunt and uncle don't.
Oh, they can scream pretty good sometimes.
Listen, M.J., about today at school with Flash...
You really freaked us out.
I'm sorry. Is he okay?
He's just happy you didn't give him a black eye for graduation.
So where are you going after you graduate?
I wanna move into the city.
And hopefully, get a job as a photographer.
Work my way through college.
What about you?
Headed for the city too.
Can't wait to get out of here.
I wanna...
What?
No, come on. Try me.
I wanna...
...act...
...on-stage.
Really?
Oh, that's perfect.
You were awesome in all the school plays.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I cried like a baby when you played Cinderella.
Peter, that was first grade.
Well...
...even so.
Sometimes...
...you know people.
You can just see what's coming.
What do you see coming for you?
I don't know.
Whatever it is, it's something
I never felt before.
And what for me?
For you?
You're gonna light up Broadway.
You know...
...you're taller than you look.
I hunch.
Don't.
Hey, M.J.! Come take a ride in my new birthday present.
Come on.
I gotta go.
Bye.
- Oh, my God, it's gorgeous!
- Yeah, right.
- Look at it!
- Hop in.
Oh, my God. What a cool car!
Pretty tight, huh?
Wait till you hear the sound system.
Hey, don't scratch the leather.
Cool car.
What's going on in there?
I'm exercising.
I'm not dressed, Aunt May.
Well, you're acting so strangely, Peter.
Okay. Thanks.
Something's wrong.
Maybe he's too embarrassed to tell me.
Maybe I'm too embarrassed to ask him.
I just don't know anymore.
I'm going to the library.
See you later.
- Wait. I'll drive you there.
- I'll take the train.
No, I need the exercise.
Go on. Go, go.
- Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.
- Wait. We need to talk.
- We can talk later.
- Well, we can talk now. If you let me.
What do we have to talk about?
Why now?
We haven't talked for so long.
May and I don't know who you are.
You shirk your chores. You have all those weird experiments in your room.
- You start fights at school.
- I told you I didn't start that fight.
- You sure finished it.
- Was I supposed to run away?
No, you're not supposed to run away, but...
You're changing. I went through exactly the same thing at your age.
No. Not exactly.
These are the years when a man changes...
...into the man he's gonna become the rest of his life.
Just be careful who you change into.
This guy, Flash Thompson, he probably deserved what happened.
But just because you can beat him up...
...doesn't give you the right to.
Remember, with great power comes great responsibility.
Are you afraid I'll become a criminal?
Quit worrying about me, okay?
Something's different.
I'll figure it out. Stop lecturing.
I don't mean to lecture or preach.
And I know I'm not your father.
Then stop pretending to be!
Right.
I'll pick you up here at 10.
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!
- One, two, three. That's it!
- Who's the man?
Ladies and gentlemen...
...give it up for Bone Saw McGraw.
For $3000...
...is there no one here man enough to stay in the ring...
...for three minutes with this titan of testosterone?
Who?
I know who.
The Flying Dutchman!
Next.
There's no featherweight division here. Next.
No, no. Sign me up.
Okay. You understand the NYWL is not responsible...
...for any injury you may and probably will sustain in said event?
And you're participating under your own free will?
Down the hall to the ramp.
May God be with you. Next.
Told you! Told you!
Winner!
Next victim!
Are you ready for more?
Bone Saw is ready!
Will the next victim please enter the arena at this time?
If he can withstand just three minutes in the cage with Bone Saw McGraw...
...the sum of $3000 will be paid to...
- What's your name, kid?
- The Human Spider.
That's it? That's the best you got?
- Yeah.
- Oh, that sucks.
The sum of $3000 will be paid to...
...the terrifying, the deadly...
...the amazing Spider- Man!
- It's "The Human Spider."
- Get out there.
- No, he got my name wrong.
- Get out there, moron.
Bone Saw will eat you up and spit you out.
I hope you brought your mommy.
- We'll break you!
- You'll need someone to cry to.
I'm gonna rip all eight of your feeble legs off one by one.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my legs!
Oh, God. I can't feel my legs.
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Cage! Cage! Cage!
Cage!
Hello? Guys?
Will the guards please lock the cage doors at this time?
This is some kind of mistake.
I didn't sign up for a cage match!
Unlock the thing! Take the chain off!
Hey, freak show!
You're going nowhere.
I got you for three minutes.
Three minutes of playtime.
- What are you doing up there?
- Staying away from you.
That's a cute outfit.
Did your husband give it to you?
Finish him off!
Smash him!
- Hit him!
- Harder!
Kick his spider ass!
Hit him!
One, two, three!
That's it! That's it!
Winner!
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for the new champion, Spider- Man!
Now get out of here.
A hundred bucks? The ad said 3000.
Well, check it again, webhead.
It said three grand for three minutes.
You pinned him in two.
For that, I give you 100.
You're lucky to get that.
I need that money.
I missed the part where that's my problem.
- Hey, what the hell...?
- Put the money in the bag.
Hurry up!
Hey! He stole the gate!
Stop that guy!
Stop him! He's got my money!
Thanks.
What's wrong with you?
You let him go!
Cut him off and call the cops!
You could've taken that guy apart.
Now he'll get away.
I missed the part where that's my problem.
- You gotta get back.
- I can't see. What happened?
- You gotta get back.
- I can't see. What happened?
Old dude, man.
Come on, folks. Keep moving, please.
Keep moving. Let's go!
- What happened?
- Someone got hurt.
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Stay back.
- Stay back!
- That's my uncle!
- What happened?
- Carjacker. He's been shot.
We just called the paramedics.
They're on their way.
Uncle Ben?
Uncle Ben.
Uncle Ben?
Peter.
I'm here, Uncle Ben.
Peter.
They got the shooter.
He's headed south on Fifth.
We got three cars in pursuit.
All right, folks. Come on, move back.
Get a unit to the rear!
I got the back!
Who's there?
Don't hurt me. Give me a chance.
Give me a chance!
What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance? Did you?
Answer me!
Stop that guy!
Thanks.
See you.
Freeze! We've got the place
completely surrounded.
Oh, no. My God.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God. No!
- Good evening.
- General. Good to see you.
Our exoskeleton's got real firepower, general.
Well, if it does what you say it can,
I'll sign that contract tomorrow.
- He's clear! Go!
- You're confident about this test?
Absolutely. Curtis is our top pilot.
Now, what about your commitment to OSCORP?
Nothing would please me more than to put Osborn out of business.
Preflight complete. Mark.
An unidentified object
is closing fast.
What's that?
Can you see anything?
Oh, my God!
- Say "chess."
- Chess!
Peter!
Darling, I'm so proud of you.
You looked so handsome up there.
Dad got the place in New York, so we're all set for fall.
- Great!
- You made it.
It's not the first time
I've been proven wrong.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Dad.
Peter, the science award.
That's terrific.
Yeah.
I know this has been a difficult time for you...
...but I want you to try to enjoy this day.
Commencement:
The end of one thing, the start of something new.
I don't want to be with you anymore.
Here's your ring.
You know what? Whatever.
Your loss.
You're like a brother to Harry.
That makes you family.
And if you ever need anything, give me a call.
Can I fix you something?
No, thanks.
I missed him a lot today.
I know.
I miss him too.
But he was there.
I can't help thinking about the last thing I said to him.
He tried to tell me something important, and I threw it in his face.
You loved him...
...and he loved you.
He never doubted the man you'd grow into.
How you were meant for great things.
You won't disappoint him.
With great power
comes great responsibility.
Remember that, Pete. Remember that.
Hurry up!
He's not a man. My brother saw him build a nest in Lincoln Center.
I think he's human, a man.
Could be a woman.
Bobby. Get a load of this!
He throws up his hands, ropes come out, and he climbs up them.
I see the web, his signature, and I know Spider- Man was here.
The guy protects us, protects the people.
Some kind of freakyloo or something.
He stinks and I don't like him.
Don't move, lady!
Guy with eight hands. Sounds hot.
Those tights and that tight little...
Dresses like a spider
He looks like a bug
But we should all just give him
One big hug
Look out
Here comes the Spider-Man
"Who is Spider- Man?"
He's a criminal, that's who he is.
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?
Mr. Jameson, your wife needs...
Mr. Jameson, your wife needs...
- There's a page six problem.
- We have a page one problem.
- There's a page six problem.
- We have a page one problem.
- Well?
- He's news.
- The clients can't wait.
- They're about to.
- He pulled six people off a subway.
- From a wreck he probably caused.
Something goes wrong and he's there.
Look! He's fleeing the scene.
He's probably going to save somebody else. He's a hero!
Then why the mask?
What's he got to hide?
She needs to know if you want chintz or chenille.
- Whichever's cheaper.
- It's like this:
We double- booked page six.
Macy's and Conway's both have...
- We sold out four printings.
- Sold out?
Every copy.
Tomorrow, Spider- Man, page one.
Move Conway to page seven.
- That's a problem.
- Then make it page eight.
- That can't be done.
- Get out!
We can't get a decent picture. Eddie's on it, but we can barely see him.
Aw, what is he, shy?
If we can get Julia Roberts in a thong, we can get this weirdo.
On the front page:
"Cash for a Spider- Man picture."
He doesn't want to be famous?
I'll make him infamous!
Buzz off.
- M.J., it's me, Peter.
- Hi!
- What are you doing around here?
- Begging for a job. How about you?
- I'm headed to an audition.
- An audition? So you're acting?
Yeah.
I work steady.
In fact, I just got off a job.
That's great.
- You're doing it. Living your dream.
- Glamour girl!
Your drawer was short $6!
Next time, I'll take it from your check.
Excuse me, Miss Watson?
I'm talking to you! Hey!
Yes, Enrique! Okay? I get you.
It better not happen no more.
Don't roll your eyes at me.
Some dream, huh?
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.
- Don't tell Harry.
- Don't tell Harry?
Don't you guys live together?
We're going out. Didn't he tell you?
Oh, yeah. Right.
I think he'd hate the idea of my waiting tables.
- He'd think it was low or something.
- It's not low. You have a job.
You know, Harry doesn't live on a little place I like to call Earth.
No, I guess not.
Thanks, Pete.
We should catch up sometime.
Let's get some lunch some evening.
I'll come by and have some of your
Moondance coffee some day.
- And I won't tell Harry.
- Don't tell Harry.
I won't.
I won't tell Harry.
Timing's perfect. Hey.
Five new contracts. It'll be great.
Norman's making his weekly inspection.
Spent half of it on the phone.
Look, man, I'm glad you're here.
I need your help. I'm really lost here.
Are you all right?
You look like you just got second place in the science fair.
I was late for work and Dr. Connors fired me.
You were late again?
I don't get it.
Where do you go all the time?
Around.
Peter Parker.
- Maybe you'll tell me who she is.
- Who?
- This mystery girl Harry's been dating.
- Dad.
When do I get to meet her?
Well, sorry.
Harry hasn't mentioned her.
Pete, you're probably looking for a job now, right?
Dad, maybe you can help him out.
- I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.
- I'll make a few calls.
I couldn't accept it. I like to earn what I get. I'll find work.
I respect that.
You want to make it on your own.
That's great.
What other skills do you have?
I was thinking about photography.
Hello.
Let's go! Move it!
Watch the street!
Cheese!
They're crap.
Crap, crap. Megacrap.
- I'll give you $200.
- That seems a little low.
Take them somewhere else.
- Your wife says the tile's out of stock.
- We'll put a rug there.
Sit down. Give me that.
Give you 300.
That's the standard fee.
- Scrap page one. Run that.
- Headline?
"Spider- Man, Hero or Menace?
Exclusive Photos."
- Menace? He was protecting...
- You take the photos...
...l'll make up the headlines. Okay?
- Yes, sir.
- Goody.
Give this to the girl up front.
She'll see you get paid.
- I'd like a job, sir.
- No jobs. Freelance.
Best thing for you.
You bring me more shots of that clown, maybe I'll buy them.
But I never said you have a job. Meat.
I'll send you a box of Christmas meat. Bring me more photos.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Mr. Jameson told me to give that to you.
- Welcome to the Daily Bugle.
- Thank you.
I'm Peter Parker.
I'm a photographer.
Yes. I can see that.
As of today...
...OSCORP Industries has surpassed
Quest Aerospace...
...as the principal supplier to the United States military.
In short, ladies and gentlemen of the board...
...costs are down, revenues are up...
...and our stock has never been higher.
Wonderful news, Norman.
That's why we're selling the company.
What?
Quest is recapitalizing in the wake of the bombing. Expanding.
They made a tender offer we can't ignore.
Why wasn't I told?
They don't want a power struggle with entrenched management.
The deal is off if you come with it.
The board expects your resignation in 30 days.
You can't do this to me.
I started this company.
You know how much I sacrificed?!
- Oh, Max. Please.
- Norman, the board is unanimous.
We're announcing the sale after the World Unity Festival.
I'm sorry.
You're out, Norman.
Am I?
Welcome to OSCORP Industries
Unity Day Festival.
Welcome to OSCORP Industries
Unity Day Festival.
Let's hear it for Macy Gray.
Let's hear it for Macy Gray.
Let's hear it for Macy Gray.
Let's hear it for Macy Gray.
M.J., why didn't you wear the black dress?
Just, I wanted to impress my father.
He loves black.
Well, maybe he'll be impressed no matter what. You think I'm pretty.
I think you're beautiful.
I forgot my drink inside.
- Oh, hi, Mr. Fargas.
- Oh, Harry.
- Have you seen my father?
- Well, I'm not sure if he's coming.
- What is that?
- Must be new this year.
What is that?
That's our glider!
What the hell was that?
Code three!
- Oh, my God! Harry!
- M.J.!
Harry! Help me! Harry!
Out, am I?
- Mary Jane!
- Harry!
Hello, my dear.
It's Spider- Man!
- Come on. Move, kid.
- Billy!
Somebody help him!
No!
Mommy!
- Hold it!
- I surrender.
- Oh, boy.
- Hold it right there!
Lmpressive.
- Mary Jane!
- Help! Someone please help me!
Hold on!
Watch out!
We'll meet again, Spider- Man!
Well, beats taking the subway.
Don't mind us.
She just needs to use the elevator.
Wait.
Who are you?
- You know who I am.
- I do?
Your friendly neighborhood Spider- Man.
Incredible?
What do you mean he's incredible?
No. All right, wait.
Stay there. I'll come over.
No, I'm gonna come...
All right. Fine.
Will you call me in the morning?
And we'll go and have breakfast and...
...I want to buy you something.
Because I want to.
It'll make you feel better.
Okay. And what do you mean, incredible?
All right. I'm sorry. Sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs...
She's all right.
She's just a little rattled.
Look, Pete, I should have told you about us.
But you should know
I'm crazy about her.
It's just, you know, you never made a move.
You're right.
I didn't.
I'm gonna get some rest.
I'm gonna stay up for a while.
What was that thing?
I don't know.
Whatever it is, somebody has to stop it.
Somebody there?
Somebody.
Somebody.
Who said that?
Don't play the innocent with me.
You've known all along.
Where are you?
Follow the cold shiver
running down your spine.
I'm right here.
I don't understand.
Did you think it was coincidence?
So many good things, all happening for you.
All for you. Norman.
What do you want?
To say what you won't.
To do what you can't.
To remove those in your way.
The board members.
You killed them.
We killed them.
We?
Remember?
Your little accident in the laboratory.
The performance enhancers.
Bingo. Me!
Your greatest creation.
Bringing you what you've always wanted:
Power beyond your wildest dreams.
And it's only the beginning.
There's only one who can stop us.
Or imagine if he joined us.
Spider- Man. And the Green Goblin.
The Green Goblin. You like that?
Made it up myself.
- These weirdos all got to have a name.
- Mr. Jameson...
- Hoffman!
- Yeah?
Copyright "Green Goblin."
I want a quarter every time it's said.
How about "Green Meanie"?
Spider- Man wasn't attacking.
That's slander.
It is not. I resent that.
Slander is spoken.
In print, it's libel.
You don't trust anybody.
I trust my barber.
Are you his lawyer?
Let him sue. Get rich like a normal person. That's what made this country...
Jameson, you slime.
Who takes the pictures of Spider- Man?
- I don't know. His stuff comes by mail.
- Liar!
- I swear.
- He's the one who can bring me to him.
- I don't know who he is.
- You are useless.
Set him down, tough guy.
- Speak of the devil.
- I knew you two were in this together!
Kiddo, let Mom and Dad talk for a minute.
Sleep...
Wake up, little spider. Wake up.
No, you're not dead yet.
Just paralyzed...
...temporarily.
You're an amazing creature,
Spider- Man.
You and I are not so different.
I'm not like you. You're a murderer.
Well, to each his own.
I chose my path, you chose the way of the hero.
And they found you amusing for a while, the people of this city.
But the one thing they love more than a hero...
...is to see a hero fail, fall, die trying.
In spite of everything you've done for them, eventually, they will hate you.
Why bother?
- Because it's right.
- Here's the real truth.
There are eight million people in this city.
And those teeming masses exist for the sole purpose...
...of lifting the few exceptional people onto their shoulders.
You, me...
...we're exceptional.
I could squash you like a bug right now.
But I'm offering you a choice.
Join me.
Imagine what we could accomplish together.
What we could create.
Or we could destroy.
Cause the deaths of countless innocents in selfish battle...
...again and again and again until we're both dead. Is that what you want?
Think about it, hero.
In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.
It's me again.
How was your audition?
- How'd you know?
- The hot line. Your mom...
...told my aunt, told me.
So you just came by?
I was in the neighborhood.
Needed to see a friendly face.
I took two buses and a cab to get in the neighborhood, but...
So how'd it go?
They said I needed acting lessons.
A soap opera told me
I needed acting lessons.
Let me buy you a cheeseburger.
The sky's the limit, up to $7.84.
I'd like a cheeseburger.
Oh, but I'm going out to dinner with Harry.
Come with us.
No, thanks. How's it going with...?
Never mind.
That's none of my business.
It's not?
Why so interested?
I'm not.
You're not?
- Well, why would I be?
- I don't know.
Why would you be?
I, that's a...
I don't know.
Sorry you won't come with us.
I'd better run, tiger.
Hey, check it out, man.
Come on, man.
Hey, where you going, baby?
Come on!
Get off me!
Wait!
You have a knack for getting in trouble.
You have a knack for saving my life.
I think I have a superhero stalker.
I was in the neighborhood.
You are amazing.
Some people don't think so.
- But you are.
- Nice to have a fan.
Do I get to say thank you this time?
Wait.
Let me in! My baby's in there!
- Let me go!
- The roof's collapsing!
- Somebody save my baby!
- The roof's about to collapse!
Look! Up there!
Save my baby, please!
No!
- It's okay. Your baby's fine.
- Oh, my baby!
God bless you, Spider- Man.
Bless you.
Don't let him get away!
Hold it! You're under arrest.
I'm taking you in.
Oh, my God, there's somebody still up there!
I'm going.
- I'll be here when you get back.
- Not coming back.
Go! Go!
Where are you?
Where are you?
I'm gonna get you out of here!
It's okay.
You're pathetically predictable.
Like a moth to the flame.
What about my generous proposal?
Are you in or are you out?
- It's you who's out. Out of your mind.
- Wrong answer.
Oh, great.
No one says no to me!
- M.J., will you stop goofing around?
- Harry, relax.
He's here.
Are you ready?
Aunt May. I'm sorry I'm late.
Work was murder.
I picked up a fruitcake.
Thank you, Mr. Osborn.
We're so glad you could come.
Who is this lovely young lady?
I'd like you to meet my father.
Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.
I've been looking forward to meeting you.
- Happy Thanksgiving, sir.
- Now, where is Peter?
He'd better remember that cranberry sauce.
Oh, that's weird.
I didn't know he was here.
Peter?
Is that you?
How strange. There's nobody here.
- Bit of a slob, isn't he?
- All brilliant men are.
- Hey, everyone.
- Oh, Peter!
It's a jungle out there.
Had to beat an old lady with a stick to get these cranberries.
Thank you.
Now then, everybody sit down...
...and we can say grace.
Here we go.
- There we are.
- It looks delicious.
Will you do the honors?
Why, Peter, you're bleeding.
I stepped off a curb and got clipped by one of those bike messengers.
Well, let me see.
Oh, my goodness.
- That looks awful.
- No, it's nothing.
I'll get the first-aid kit.
Then we'll say grace.
This is the boys' first Thanksgiving here, and we'll do things properly.
How did you say that happened?
Bike messenger.
Knocked me down.
- If you'll excuse me, I've got to go.
- Why?
Something has come to my attention.
Are you all right?
I'm fine, just fine.
Thank you, Mrs. Parker. Everyone.
- Enjoy the fruitcake.
- Dad!
I planned this so you'd meet M.J., and now you have to leave?
I've got to go.
- This girl is important to me.
- Harry, please. Look at her.
Think she's sniffing around because she likes your personality?
- What are you saying?
- Your mother was beautiful.
They're all beautiful until they're snarling after your money like wolves.
You're wrong, Dad.
A word to the not-so-wise about your girlfriend:
Do what you need to with her, then broom her fast.
Thanks for sticking up for me, Harry.
- You heard?
- Everyone heard that creep.
That creep is my father.
With luck, I'll be half of what he is.
Shut up about stuff you don't understand!
Harry Osborn!
I'm sorry, Aunt May.
Spider-Man is all but invincible.
But Parker, we can destroy him.
I can't.
Betrayal must not be countenanced.
Parker must be educated.
What do I do?
Instruct him in the matters
of loss and pain.
Make him suffer.
Make him wish he were dead.
Yes?
And then grant his wish.
But how?
The cunning warrior attacks
neither body nor mind.
Tell me how!
The heart, Osborn.
First, we attack his heart.
Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses...
...as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us...
Deliver us!
Finish it!
- Finish it!
- From evil!
Two milligrams IV.
Get the BP.
Aunt May. Is she gonna be okay?
What happened?
You have to leave.
- What happened?
- Those eyes!
Those horrible yellow eyes!
He knows who I am.
I'm sorry.
- Will she be okay?
- She'll be fine.
She's been sleeping all day.
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.
How are you?
You okay about the other night?
Yeah, I'm fine. I just felt bad about leaving Aunt May.
- Have you talked to Harry?
- He called me.
I haven't called him back.
The fact is...
...l'm in love with somebody else.
- You are?
At least I think I am.
- It's not the time to talk about it.
- No. Go on.
Would I know his name, this guy?
You'll think I'm a little girl with a crush.
Trust me.
It's funny.
He's saved my life twice, and I've never even seen his face.
- Oh. Him.
- You're laughing at me.
No, I understand.
He is extremely cool.
But do you think it's true, all the terrible things they say?
Not Spider- Man, not a chance in the world.
I know him a little bit.
I'm sort of his unofficial photographer.
- Has he mentioned me?
- Yeah.
What'd he say?
I said...
He asked me what I thought about you.
And what did you say?
I said, "Spider- Man."
I said, "The great thing about M. J...
...is...
...when you look in her eyes...
...and she's looking back in yours...
...everything feels...
...not quite normal.
Because you feel...
...stronger...
...and weaker at the same time.
You feel excited...
...and at the same time...
...terrified.
The truth is, you don't know what you feel...
...except you know what kind of man you want to be.
It's as if you've...
...reached the unreachable...
...and you weren't ready for it."
You said that?
Well, something like that.
Dad?
Dad, is that you?
What is it?
You were right about M.J.
You're right about everything.
She's in love with Peter.
- Parker?
- Yeah.
And how does he feel about her?
He's loved her since the 4th grade.
He pretends like he doesn't, but there's no one Peter cares for more.
I'm so sorry.
I haven't always been there for you, have I?
You're busy. You're an important man.
I understand.
That's no excuse.
I'm proud of you.
I've lost sight of that somewhere.
But I'll make it up to you.
I'm going to rectify certain inequities.
Wake up, little spider.
Wake up.
Go home, dear.
You look awful.
- And you look beautiful.
- Thank you.
- I don't like to leave you here.
- But I'm safe here.
- Can I do anything for you?
- You do too much.
College, a job, all this time with me.
You're not Superman, you know.
A smile. Finally.
Haven't seen one of those on your face since Mary Jane was here.
You were supposed to be asleep.
You know, you were about 6 years old when M.J.'s family moved in next door.
When she got out of the car, and you saw her for the first time...
...you grabbed me and said,
"Aunt May, is that an angel?"
- Gee, did I say that?
- You sure did.
Well, Harry's in love with her.
- She's still his girl.
- Well, isn't that up to her?
- She doesn't really know who I am.
- Because you won't let her.
You're so mysterious all the time.
Tell me, would it be so dangerous...
...to let Mary Jane know how much you care?
Everybody else knows.
I'll be right back.
But...
Come on, pick up.
- Hey M.J.
- Hi. Sing your song at the beep.
M.J., it's Peter. You there?
Hello? You there?
I'm just calling to check up on you.
Will you call me when you get in?
All right, well...
Don't...
Don't go up any dark alleys.
Hello?
Can Spider-Man come out to play?
Where is she?
- What is that?
- That's cool!
The itsy-bitsy spider
Went up the water spout
Down came the goblin
And took the spider out
Goblin, what have you done?
Spider- Man!
This is why only fools are heroes.
Because you never know...
...when some lunatic will come along with a sadistic choice:
Let die the woman you love...
...or suffer the little children.
- Spider- Man!
- Save us!
Save us!
Make your choice, Spider- Man...
...and see how a hero is rewarded.
Don't do it, Goblin!
We are who we choose to be.
- Now, choose!
- No!
Everybody stay still!
Ahoy up there!
We're gonna bring the barge right under you.
- He's coming back!
- Listen. I need you to climb down.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!
M.J., you can do it. You have to.
Trust me.
Hold on tight and go quickly.
- Hurry!
- I can't. I can't do it.
Hang on, Mary Jane!
- He's not gonna make it.
- He's gonna make it!
It's time to die.
- I got something for you!
- We ought to kick your ass!
Leave Spider- Man alone!
You'd pick on a guy saving kids?
You mess with Spidey, you mess with New York!
You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us!
Spider- Man, watch out!
Misery, misery, misery.
That's what you've chosen.
I offered you friendship...
...and you spat in my face.
You've spun your last web, Spider- Man.
Had you not been so selfish, your girlfriend's death...
...would have been quick.
But now that you've really pissed me off...
...l'm gonna finish her nice and slow.
M.J. And I...
...we're gonna have a hell of a time.
Peter, stop!
Stop! It's me.
Mr. Osborn.
Thank God for you.
You killed those people on that balcony.
The Goblin killed!
I had nothing to do with it!
Don't let him take me again.
I beg you. Protect me.
You tried to kill Aunt May.
You tried to kill Mary Jane.
But not you.
I tried to stop it.
But I couldn't stop it.
I would never hurt you.
I knew from the beginning...
...if anything ever happened to me...
...it was you I could count on.
You, Peter Parker, would save me, and so you have.
Thank God for you.
Give me your hand.
Believe in me as I believed in you.
I've been like a father to you.
Be a son to me now.
I have a father.
His name was Ben Parker.
Godspeed, Spider- Man.
Peter.
Don't tell Harry.
What have you done?
What have you done?!
I'm so sorry, Harry.
I know what it's like to lose a father.
I didn't lose him.
He was stolen from me.
One day Spider- Man will pay.
I swear on my father's grave,
Spider- Man will pay.
Thank God for you, Peter.
You're the only family I have.
No matter what I do...
... no matter how hard I try...
... the ones I love will always
be the ones who pay.
You must miss him so much.
It's been so hard without him.
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.
When I was up there...
...and I thought I was gonna die...
...there was only one person who I was thinking of.
And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.
It was you, Pete.
I kept thinking:
"I hope I make it through this...
...so I can see Peter Parker's face one more time."
Really?
There's only one man who's always been there for me...
...who makes me feel...
...like I'm more than I ever thought I could be.
That I'm just...
...me.
And that's okay.
The truth is...
...I love you.
I love you so much, Peter.
All I wanted was to tell her
how much I loved her.
I can't...
You can't what?
Tell you...
...everything.
I mean, there's so much to tell.
Yeah. There's so much to tell.
I want you to know...
...that I will always be there for you.
I will always be there to take care of you.
I promise you that.
I will always be your friend.
Only a friend...
...Peter Parker?
That's all I have to give.
Whatever life holds in store for me...
...I will never forget these words:
"With great power
comes great responsibility. "
This is my gift.
My curse.
Who am I?
I'm Spider-Man.
I was dreamin'.
Dreamin' my dick was out and I was checking to see if that infected bump on the head of it had filled with pus again.
If it had, I was gonna name that bump after my ex-wife Priscilla and bust it by jackin' off.
Oh, man.
Or I'd like to think that's what I'd do.
Dreams let you think like that.
Truth was, I hadn't had a hard-on in years.
Oh, man.
My God, man.
How long have I been here?
Am I really awake now, or am I just dreamin' I'm awake?
How could my plans have gone so wrong?
When the hell are they gonna serve lunch?
Considerin' what they serve, why the hell do I care?
If Priscilla discovered I was alive, would she come and see me?
Would we still wanna fuck?
Or would we merely have to talk about it?
Is there, finally and really, anything to life other than food, shit, and sex?
Well, goddamnit.
How could I have gone from the "King of rock and roll"to this?
Old guy in a rest home in East Texas with a growth on his pecker.
And what is that growth, man?
Cancer? Nobody's talkin'.
No one seems to know... or wants to.
Makes you wonder, doesn't it, what kind of life this old guy had?
What kind of life he had, you know.
His kids, his grandkids, his legacy.
Look at him now.
Oh, who gives a shit?
Well...
Make you comfortable.
No.
I'm gonna squish you, cockroach!
Help me.
You know, I was thinkin'...
What? You gonna get all weepy on me again?
No. I was merely gonna suggest that you use some of this here deodorizer and spray it on that corpse because she's smellin' pretty ripe.
Good idea.
Excuse me, miss?
You gonna throw all that stuff out?
Yeah.
Could I have one of them pictures of Bull?
Maybe his... his Purple Heart?
I mean, he was pretty proud of that.
And maybe that... that tin of chocolates there?
I suppose.
The revealin' of her panties wasn't intentional or unintentional.
She just didn't give a damn.
She saw me as so physically and sexually non-threatenin', she didn't mind if I got a bird's-eye view of her love nest.
It was the same to her as a house cat sneakin' a peek.
I felt my pecker flutter once like a pigeon havin' a heart attack... then it laid back down and remained limp and still.
'Course, these days, even a flutter was kind of reassurin'.
- Here.
- Thank you.
Say...
Bull your kin?
My daddy.
Never seen you here before.
I've only been here once before.
When I checked him in.
That's three years ago, wasn't it?
You and him friends?
No, we just roommates. I mean, he never felt good enough to say much.
I just hated to see what was left of him go away so easy.
Seemed like an all right guy.
Mentioned you a lot.
You're... you're Callie, right?
Yeah.
Well... he was all right.
But not enough so you'd come and see him, though.
Don't lay some guilt trip on me, mister.
I did what I could.
I mean, if it hadn't been for Medicaid or Medicare... whatever that stuff was... he'd have been in some ditch somewhere.
And I sure didn't have the money to take care of him.
My own daughter...
Lost long ago to me... if she knew I lived, would she come and see me?
Would she even care?
You could've come and seen him.
They don't charge you for that.
Mind your own business.
I was busy.
Well, well, well.
If it isn't my favorite patient.
How are you this morning, Mr. Haff?
I'm all right.
But I prefer Mr. Presley or Elvis.
I keep tellin' you that.
I don't go by
Sebastian Haff anymore, okay?
I'm not tryin' to hide anymore.
Well, of course I knew that.
I forgot.
Good morning, Elvis.
Did you know we have a celebrity here, Miss Thomas?
Elvis Presley. You know, the rock and roll singer.
I thought he was dead.
Well, actually, Elvis is dead.
Mr. Haff knows that. Don't you, Mr. Haff?
Hell, no. I'm right here.
I ain't dead.
Yet.
Now, Mr. Haff!
I don't mind calling you "Elvis."
But you're a little confused and you like to play sometimes.
You were an
Elvis impersonator, remember?
You fell off the stage and broke your hip... when was it?
Twenty years ago.
It got infected and you were in a coma for quite a while.
You came out with a few... problems.
Look, I was just impersonatin' myself.
I couldn't do nothin' else.
I don't have any problems.
You're tryin' to say my brain's messed up, aren't you?
Why would you wanna be somebody else?
I got tired of it.
I was hooked on pills, you know.
I wanted out.
And this boy Sebastian Haff... he was an Elvis imitator.
He was the best of 'em.
He took my place.
Problem is, he had a bad heart.
He liked drugs, too.
Liked them more than I did.
So it was him that died, not me.
I just took his place.
But why would you want to leave all that fame, Mr. Presley?
All that money?
I don't know.
'Cause they got old.
The woman I loved... Priscilla... she was gone.
The rest of the women... were just women.
I mean, the music wasn't mine anymore.
I wasn't even me anymore.
Just this thing they made up.
And my friends...
Well, they were suckin' me dry.
So I took a little road trip down to Nacogdoches... to check out this Sebastian Haff.
It's all right, boys.
Just wait here.
Oh, my God.
I didn't think you'd really...
It's all right, boys.
Just another freak.
Let's split.
- Sorry, man.
- King, I got it. I got it.
It's all yours, baby.
So I signed everything over to Sebastian.
Except for enough money to sustain me if things got bad.
I was determined to make myself a new life.
A better one.
But me and Sebastian, we had us a deal.
If I wanted to trade back, he'd let me.
It was all written up in the contract.
The thing was...
I lost my copy in a barbeque accident.
But that wasn't so bad, either.
I was makin' new friends and enjoyin' myself.
Cheers!
Oh, my God.
Did you see that thing?
It just went up like that.
- Now, Elvis.
- Yes?
Don't carry it too far.
You may just get way out there and not come back.
Oh, fuck you.
Shit.
Get old, you can't even cuss someone and have it bother 'em.
Everything you do is either worthless or sadly amusing.
Well...
I've got what I want.
The clothes can go to Goodwill or Salvation Army.
Very well. And I'm sorry about your father. He was a nice man.
Yeah.
It was nice to meet you, Mr. Presley.
- Get the hell out.
- Now, now.
I'll be back later to do that little... thing that has to be done. You know.
Elvis!
Poor Bull.
In the end... does anything really matter?
No one here ever listened to me.
Except this one guy... only, he was certifiable.
That's where they took a piece of my brain.
They got it back in D.C. in that goddamn jar.
I got a little bag of sand up there now.
Jack... no offense, but...
President Kennedy was a white man.
That's how clever they are!
They dyed me this color.
All over!
Can you think of a better way to hide the truth than that?
I was livin' simple.
The way Haff had been.
Going from town to town doin' the Elvis act.
Only, I felt like I was really me again.
Can you dig that?
We're diggin' it, Mr. Haff...
Mr. Presley.
Women were throwin' themselves at me
'cause they could imagine I was Elvis.
Only, I was Elvis playing
Sebastian Haff playing Elvis.
It was all pretty good.
I didn't mind the contract being burned up.
Didn't even try to go back and convince anybody.
Then I had the accident.
I was gyratin', see, takin' care business, and then my hip went out.
I'd been havin' trouble with it.
Damn. It's cold in here tonight.
No way. That's it.
This time, I make it.
No more piss or crap in the bed.
Shake it out...
There we go.
Man... that is one big bitch cockroach.
All right, man. Let's go.
Damn.
Hot damn!
Got you, you six-legged bastard.
Even a big bitch cockroach like you should know...
Never... but never fuck with the King.
Hey! Is anybody out here?
I think we got some major bug problems in this place, man!
Oh, man...
Hey, Jack?
Hey, man, you okay?
What the Sam Hill is that?
Mr. Kennedy?
Hey, man... you're on the floor.
No shit.
Who are you?
Look, I'm...
Sebastian. Sebastian Haff.
Did you see him go by in the hall?
He scuttled like.
- Who, man?
- The one they sent.
- Who's "they"?
- Oh, you know who.
No, Jack, I don't.
Come on, man.
Lyndon Johnson.
Castro, maybe.
They sent somebody to finish me off.
I think maybe it was Johnson himself.
Real ugly.
Real goddamn ugly!
Look, man,
President Johnson's dead.
Shit. That ain't gonna stop him.
Get his feet.
So, you say you heard a... a noise?
Well, a sound's a sound, you know?
I mean, I heard something.
It was like a... I don't know.
Like a... like a scuttling.
- A scuttling sound?
- Yes, sir.
Were you awake or were you in bed when you heard this noise?
I was in bed first, then I was awake
'cause the damn bugs woke me up.
You got bugs all over this place.
Bugs... well, Mr. Haff, what kind of bugs have you been seeing?
Look, do I look like an ichthyologist to you?
Big damn bugs, all right?
The size of my fist. The size of a peanut butter and banana sandwich.
What do I care?
I got a growth on my pecker.
Okay, Mr. Haff.
Don't worry about a thing.
We'll call the exterminator tomorrow and we'll take care of the problem.
Good. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
It's time for that little thing again.
A doll like this handlin' me without warmth or emotion...
Twenty years ago.
Just twenty, man.
I could've made with the curly-lip smile and had her eatin' out of my asshole.
Doctor says this cream ought to do the trick.
Corticosteroids.
Should heal the inflammation, stop the pus.
Where'd my youth go?
Why didn't fame hold off old age and death?
Why the hell did I leave the fame in the first place?
Do I want it back?
Could I have it back?
And if I could... would it make any damn difference?
Mr. Haff!
Lord almighty.
You old rascal.
I think you better take a cold shower, Mr. Haff.
There'd been two presidential elections since I had a boner like that one.
What gave here?
Then I realized what gave.
I was thinkin' about something that interested me.
Not my next meal or goin' to the crapper.
I'd been given a dose of life again.
You get in there with me,
I'll take that shower.
You silly thing.
Come on, now.
Why don't you pull on it a little?
You ought to be ashamed.
Where at? Where at?
I haven't seen my kids.
It's an ambush!
Under the bridge.
I saw him under the bridge.
It's an ambush!
Tonto, my boots, Tonto!
That's my friend Kemosabe.
We used to play cards together.
- My boots!
- Now he doesn't even know who I am.
Daddy.
Baby?
Sebastian. Sebastian! It's loose!
What's loose?
It. Listen.
Jesus Christ. What's that?
I thought it was Lyndon Johnson, but I was wrong.
I've come across new evidence to suggest another assassin.
Assassin?
He's after another target tonight.
Come on, I wanna show you something.
I don't think it's safe if you go back to sleeping.
For chrissake, man.
Just tell the administrators.
Suits and white starches?
No, thank you!
I trusted them when I was back in Dallas, and look where they got my brain and me.
I'm thinkin' with sand here.
I mean, I pick up some waves, maybe, from my brain, but someday, who knows.
Somebody might just disconnect the battery at the White House.
Oh, yeah. That's something to worry about, all right.
Listen here. Listen.
I know you're Elvis.
There was a rumor, you know, that you hated me.
But I thought about that.
If you hated me, you could've finished me off the other night.
What I want from you is that you look me straight in the eye and assure me you had nothing at all to do with that day in Dallas, and that you did not know
Lee Harvey Oswald or Jack Ruby.
Look, man...
I had nothing to do with Dallas.
And I knew neither
Lee Harvey Oswald nor Jack Ruby.
Good. May I call you Elvis instead of Sebastian?
You may.
Excellent.
You wear glasses to read?
Well, I wear glasses when I really want to see.
Get them. Come on.
Come on.
Right down the hall.
The walker was swingin' along easier now.
Not even like I needed it.
Damn, this here Jack was a nut.
Maybe I was nuts, too... but there was an adventure goin' on.
It's in here.
In here.
That's it?
We're investigating a scuttling in the hall, trying to figure out who attacked you, and you bring me here to look at stick pictures on the shit house wall?
Look close.
It's Egyptian.
Right-a-reen-o.
Hey, you're not as stupid as some folks made you out.
- Thank you.
- Now, I copied this down yesterday.
I came in here to take a shit because they hadn't cleaned up my bathroom.
Saw that on the wall, took it back to my room, looked it up in my books, and I wrote it all down.
Now, this top line translates roughly into,
"Pharaoh gobbles donkey goobers."
And the bottom line,
"Cleopatra does the nasty."
Say what?
Well, pretty much.
That's the best I can translate it.
All right, so, one of the nuts in here... present company excluded... thinks he's Tutankhamen, comes in here, writes hieroglyphics.
Big deal! What's the connection?
Why are we standin' here in the toilet?
Well, I don't know what the connection is, exactly... not yet.
But that thing caught me asleep last night.
And I came awake just in time.
He had me on the floor.
I had his mouth over my asshole.
A shit-eater?
I don't think so.
He was after my soul.
Now, you can get that out of any major orifice of a person's body.
I read about it.
Yeah? Where, man? Hustler?
The Everyday Man Or Woman's
Book of the Soul by David Webb.
And they got pretty good movie reviews in there about stolen soul movies in the back.
Come on. I'll show you.
I think that there might be some sort of electrical problem in the gardener's shed.
That light... looks like it's shortin' out.
This whole damn place is fallin' apart.
But you don't have to think about that.
Mrs. Biddlestein is waitin' on her enema.
All right. All right. I'm comin'.
Just let me finish my cigarette, first.
God.
Here's an ugly son of a bitch.
Damn! Hey, Jack.
What it says here is that you can bury some dude, and if he gets the right tanna leaves and spells said over him and such bullshit, that he can come back to life thousands of years later, man.
But hold on, now.
To stay alive, he has to suck on the souls of the livin', and that if the souls are small, his life force doesn't last long.
Small.
What's that mean?
Read on.
No, never mind.
I'll tell you myself.
But first, would you like a Ding Dong?
I don't mean mine.
I mean a chocolate Ding Dong.
Of course, mine would be chocolate now that I have been dyed.
You got Ding Dongs, man?
I got Paydays and I got a box of Baby Ruths.
Oh, mama!
Which will it be?
Let's get decadent.
I'll take a Baby Ruth.
All right.
Now... small souls... are those that don't have much fire for life.
You know a place like that?
Man, if souls were fires, they couldn't burn much lower than in here.
Exactamundo.
What we have here at Shady Rest is an Egyptian soul sucker of some sort.
You know, a mummy hiding out.
Coming in here, feeding on the sleeping.
It's perfect, you see?
We're small souls, so we can't provide him much.
But if that thing comes back two or three times in a row and wraps his lips around some elder's asshole, that elder is going to die pretty soon.
And who would be the wiser?
Asshole.
A mummy can't be getting too much energy from all this... not like with big souls... but the prey is easy.
With new people comin' all the time, he can keep this up forever... this soul robbin'.
That's what they brought us here for... to get us out of the way until we die.
And those who don't die first from disease or just plain being old, he gets.
Look, that's all well and good, Jack, but there's one thing that still throws me.
How does an ancient Egyptian wind up in an East Texas rest home, and why is he writin' on the shit house walls, man?
Well, he went in to take a crap, got bored, started writing on the walls.
He probably wrote on pyramid walls centuries ago.
Come on. What would he crap?
It's not like he'd eat.
Well, he eats souls.
So, I assume that he would crap soul residue.
By that, I would mean that if you die from his mouth, you don't go to the other side where the souls go.
He digests souls until they don't exist anymore.
And you're just so much toilet water decoration.
And speaking of toilets...
This is how I figured that whole thing out.
He's just like anybody else when it comes to taking a dump.
He wants a nice, clean place with a flush.
They didn't have that in his time.
No, no.
Don't go out in the hall.
- That's all right. I'm not asleep.
- That don't mean he won't hurt you.
"He" my ass. There isn't any mummy from Egypt.
Nice knowin' you, Elvis.
Asshole.
Kemosabe was dead of a ruptured heart before he hit the floor.
Gone down and out with both guns blazing.
Soul intact.
Once again, we got scolded.
This time, we got quizzed about what had happened to Kemosabe, but neither of us told the truth.
I mean, who was gonna believe a couple of nuts?
Elvis and Jack Kennedy explaining that Kemosabe was gunning for a mummy in cowboy duds?
Some kind of Bubba Ho-Tep?
So, what we did was... we lied.
Life sure is fleetin', you know?
- What?
- Life. I'm saying it's fleetin'.
One minute you're here, and the next minute you're gone...
Shit! Shit! Come on!
Come on. Move it!
Come on. Get it!
Nonchalant. Nonchalant.
Nonchalant.
Get it in there.
You are one fuckin' idiot.
Mr. Haff?
Mr. Presley?
Now, now, Mr. Presley.
You are looking much stronger, but you shouldn't be out here too long.
It's time for your nap.
And it's also time for us to do that little... you know.
You fuck off, you patronizing bitch!
I'm sick of your shit! I'll lube my own crankshaft from now on.
You treat me like a baby again,
I'll wrap this goddamn walker right around your head!
How in the hell did that mummy do that?
Well... what the hell.
Where did old Bubba Ho-Tep go?
Where did he come from?
How the hell did he get here?
Wait a minute.
Under the bridge.
I saw him under the bridge.
Come on, mama.
It's a cancer.
They're keepin' it from me 'cause I'm old, and to them, it don't matter.
They think age will kill me first, and they're probably right.
Well, suck them!
I know what it is, and if it isn't... it might as well be.
Station KROP is proud to present the Elvis Presley movie marathon.
It's 24 hours of Elvis in the roles he made famous.
Watch that two-fisted Hound Dog out-strum, outrace, out-fight, and outwit the bad guys.
And at the same time, watch the King slay the girls.
Shitty pictures, man.
Every single one.
Here I was complainin' about loss of pride and how life had treated me, and now I realized...
I never had any pride.
And much of how life had treated me had been good.
The bulk of the bad was my own damn fault.
Should've fired Colonel Parker by the time I got in the pictures.
Old fart had been a shark and a fool, and I was an even bigger fool for following him.
If only I'd treated Priscilla right.
If I could've told my daughter I loved her.
Always the questions.
Never the answers.
Always the hopes... never the fulfillments.
I had the woman who calls herself my niece come get me.
She took me downtown this morning to the newspaper morgue.
She's been helping me to do some research.
- Research on what, man?
- On our mummy.
You know somethin' about him?
I know plenty.
Now, one of the lesser mummies, on loan from the Egyptian government, was being circulated all over the United States.
You know, museums, stuff like that.
What do you mean?
Like King Tut or whatever?
No, more like King Tut's brother.
His mummy was flown or carried by the train from state to state.
When it got to Texas, it was stolen.
Stolen?
Evidence points to it being stolen at night by a couple of guys in a silver bus.
Bus? Hey, I've seen that!
Anyway, the thieves broke into the museum, stole it in hopes of a ransom, when in comes the worst storm in East Texas history.
Let me guess.
The bus was washed away, see?
'Cause I think I saw it today.
It was way back in the creek.
The mummy was imprisoned by the debris.
Look here... how'd it come back to life?
And how did I end up inside its memories?
Speculation broadens here, but from what I've read, some mummies get buried without their names... a curse put on their sarcophagus.
Hey, now, maybe our boy's one of them.
I mean, when he's in the coffin, he's just a dried-up old corpse, but when the bus got washed away, maybe it overturned or broke open, and now he's free of coffin and curse.
He's free from imprisonment, but he still needs souls.
Now he's free to have them.
He can just keep on feedin' unless he's finally destroyed.
So, what do we do, Jack?
Changing rest homes might be a good idea.
I can't think of much else.
But I will say this...
Our mummy is a nighttime kind of guy.
So, I'm gonna go and sleep now.
I'll set my alarm for just before dark, then I can get myself a couple of cups of coffee.
Damn straight.
If he comes in here tonight, I don't want him slappin' his lips on my asshole.
Yes. Consider it.
He's got the proverbial bird's nest on the ground here.
What do I really have left in life but this place?
It ain't much of a home... but it's all I got.
Well, goddamnit.
I'll be damned if I let some foreign, graffiti-writin', soul-suckin', son of a bitch in an oversized cowboy hat and boots take my friends' souls and shit 'em down the visitors toilet!
In the movies,
I always played heroic types.
But when the stage lights went out, it was time for drugs and stupidity and the coveting of women.
Now it's time.
Time to be a little of what I had always fantasized bein'... a hero.
Hello?
Mr. Kennedy?
Ask not what your rest home can do for you.
Ask what you can do for your rest home.
Hey, you're copying my best lines.
Then let me paraphrase one of my own.
Let's take care of business.
Just what are you getting at, Elvis?
I think you know what I'm gettin' at, Mr. President.
We're gonna kill us a mummy.
Two bottles of rubbing alcohol.
Check.
Don't even have to toss 'em.
Look here.
Found this in the storage room.
I thought they kept it locked.
They do. I stole a hairpin and picked the lock, baby.
Great.
Matches.
Check. Even scrounged up a cigarette lighter.
Good. Uniform.
Big check on that, baby.
Well, I got a nice pair of shoes to go with this.
Check.
Scissors.
Check.
All right.
Now, I got my chair oiled and ready to roll.
That's good, man.
We could use some wheels.
And I picked some words of power from my book of magic.
I don't know if they'll stop a mummy, but they're supposed to ward off evil.
I wrote them down.
One for each of us.
Well, we'll use what we got, baby.
All right, 2:45 a.m., we hook up right back here.
No, at the rate we travel, maybe we ought to start at 2:30.
Say, Jack?
Do we know what the hell we're doin', man?
No. But they say that fire cleanses evil.
Let's just hope that they... whoever they are... is right.
Check on that, too.
All right, synchronize watches.
And... mark.
Now, the two key words for tonight are "caution" and "flammable."
And also...
"watch your ass."
What's that you got hanging around your neck?
That's my medicine bag.
Indians used to wear 'em into battle.
Full of all kinds of lucky stuff.
See here?
Mucho mojo.
That's my daughter.
I know.
We weren't there for our kids when they needed us, were we?
Man, if I could just talk to her again... tell her I love her... try and make things right somehow.
No time for regrets, Elvis.
We were the best fathers we could be under the circumstances.
Yeah, I guess, no time for regrets.
We got business to take care of.
Look here.
Top it off with this.
I stole it from the gardener when he wasn't lookin'.
It's gonna be one hell of a barbeque.
Let's do it, amigo.
Hey, Jack?
I just got one last question.
Marilyn.
Come on, man.
Marilyn Monroe?
What was she like in the sack?
That is classified information.
Top secret!
But between you and me...
Wow!
You old dog.
Watch your back, Jack.
Gotta hump it.
Shit... when Bubba Ho-Tep comes out of that creek bed, he's gonna come out hungry and pissed.
When I try and stop him, he's gonna jam this paint can up my ass and jam me and that wheelchair up Jack's ass.
Shit.
Hey, Jack.
Don't make me use my stuff on you, baby.
Damn!
Where did he go to?
Hey! You stay put!
I'll flush him out!
You be careful, man.
No, Jack!
Oh, man.
Come and get it, you undead sack of shit.
Sorry, man.
Mr. Kennedy?
The President is soon dead.
So, now... it's up to you, Elvis.
You got to get him.
You... got to... take care of business.
That's right, man.
T.C. B...
It's just you and me.
Mr. President.
"You nasty thing from beyond the dead...
"No matter what you think or do, good things will never come to you.
"And if evil is your black design,
"you can bet the goodness of the Light Ones... will kick your bad behind"?
For chrissake...
That's it?
That's the chant against evil from the Book Of Souls?
Yeah, right, boss.
And what kind of decoder ring comes with that, man?
Shit, it doesn't even rhyme well!
This is dog shit.
It's time for A-C-T-l-O-N.
Come on, baby.
Here we go.
I was goin' out.
And if I did, not only would I be one dead son of a bitch, but so would my soul.
I'd be just so much crap.
No afterlife, no reincarnation, no angels with harps.
Whatever lay beyond would not be known to me.
It would all end right here for Elvis Aaron Presley.
Nothin' left but a quick flush.
T.C.B., baby.
Your soul-suckin' days are over, amigo.
I felt somethin' inside gratin' against somethin' soft.
I felt like a water balloon with a hole poked in it.
I was goin' down for the last count.
And I knew it.
But I still have my soul.
It's still mine.
All mine.
And the folks up there at Shady Rest... they have theirs, too.
And they're gonna keep 'em.
Every single one.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Don't you watch me!
You think you're going to crawl into my brain and see a show?
Is that what I am?
Is that what you think?
What I think, Mr. Ledbetter, is the temperature's dropping.
Well, I got legions of angels up here, like little moths, and they're going to beat the hell out of you with their wings.
Freaks.
I'm gonna crap you out,
Stuyvesant!
- Who-Who's Stuyvesant?
- You're Stuyvesant.
I'm not Stuyvesant.
- I'm with the department of social services.
- No, you're a zit... on Stuyvesant's ass, but you're Stuyvesant just the same.
You're all Stuyvesant.
Tell him... don't send no more no-face errand boys to catch me, 'cause I hear ya coming.
I hear your chains, clink, clink.
You sound like defeat.
You even smell like defeat.
You smell like, like degradation.
Happy Valentine's Day,
Caveman.
Hey, yo, Caveman. Give us a fucking tirade, yo.
Yo, what's that fucker
Stuyvesant up to, man?
Help you?
I don't know you.
No, no, no.
You on your own, son.
You got your troubles,
I got mine.
Do I look like
I can help you, huh?
Help you? I don't even know who the fuck you are.
All right, Michael, thank you.
Mr.? Mr.?
Got a pencil?
A pencil? What do you want a pencil for?
I wanna balance it on the end of my nose.
You want to write something?
I got a pen.
Hey, keep it.
What the hey, right?
Can I ask what you're writing there?
You want your pen back?
No, no, no.
It's okay.
- You a musician or a...
- Mm-hmm.
- What do you play?
- My skull.
- I used to play piano.
- You had a piano, huh?
There were a great many at the school I attended.
- What school did you go to?
- Julliard.
Julliard?
You went to Julliard, huh?
How the hell did you wind up here?
I'm here because that bastard wants me here.
What bastard?
Don't play stupid. The bastard that lives in that tower.
He sits in his tower, and he watches.
And what he sees, he doesn't like.
I mean, it curls his stinking, rancid blood what he sees.
And what he sees is a free man!
That old Stuyvesant, you know what he says to that?
He says, "We're gonna crush that nigger.
Oh, yeah, send some Y-rays that nigger's way. "
Don't back off, pinstripes, you fucking coward.
Stuyvesant's gone and laced your mind with Y-rays.
You're living like a jackrabbit.
Oh, yeah, run, Stuyvesant.
But I see ya.
Stuyvesant!
You see me? Well, I see you right fucking back!
What lies are you telling us now?
- Yep?
- Lulu, listen to me.
- Romulus?
- Stuyvesant killed someone.
Where's he calling from?
- Tell her I'm home.
- He got a phone in that cave now?
Tell her, my home is not a mansion, but it suits me fine.
He freezes to death, I'm not paying for his funeral.
She says
- I heard her. Listen, Lulu, this time
I've got the evidence.
You do, huh?
There's a body outside my cave.
That's rough, Rom. Listen,
I just pulled a night shift.
I am sound asleep.
Please, child.
Please, just come on over.
I know what you're thinking.
But this dead thing he left outside my cave, it's real.
It's so shiny real, it hurts the eyes.
...believed to be another victim of the Arctic cold wave.
The dead man was identified as Scott Gates, 20 years old, unemployed and homeless.
Oh, that sucked.
Can I go again?
A young man has been found frozen to death here in Inwood Park.
You saw this no-face prop the body in the tree? That's right.
But you were in there in your bed the whole time?
How'd you see all this?
I told you,
I saw it on my TV.
What kind of shows you get on that TV?
All of them. The whole heady broth of American culture, right?
- You get cable?
- Lieutenant.
Can I talk to you for a moment? Yeah, sure.
Look, I know this guy.
I've seen him around.
He's completely delusional.
- Why don't we just...
- Get your hands off her!
Take it easy, pal, we're just having a little chat.
Don't touch my daughter, squashface. Ever!
Your daughter?
This man is your father?
Why didn't you say something?
Maybe I don't meet her momentous expectations.
But I'm still a witness. I know who the murderer is. Now you write it!
Write what? The name of the murderer, which you already know.
- Cornelius Gould Stuyvesant, now write it!
- Daddy!
Tell him to write it.
I can't tell him anything, he's my boss.
Hey, what the hell, pal, that's the way I like 'em, open and shut.
How do you spell Stuyvesant?
You know how to spell it.
Aah!
Go ahead and kill me.
For Christ's sake, Rom.
- I'm dead already.
- Matthew?
- It's you who found him, wasn't it?
- Found who?
Scotty.
He knew they were going to kill him.
Matthew, you're shivering.
I don't care.
You're too cold.
I loved him, Rom.
I wanna die too.
Okay. Okay.
Not right now, okay?
Come on.
They killed him, Rom. He was just too beautiful for them.
Ah, God, Rom, wasn't... wasn't he beautiful?
He was dead when I saw him.
Yeah, but... you met him.
The dead kid?
I don't think so.
Well, he knew you.
He said you weren't afraid to speak the truth.
No shit, Rom.
He called you "The Voice. "
- He did?
- He was just a kid.
He was fucking innocent till that bastard got his fucking hands on him.
Stuyvesant?
David Leppenraub.
- Who?
- David Leppenraub.
Don't you know, Rom?
The photographer?
I mean, he's fucking famous. He does these pictures of angels, and everyone's always going on about how beautiful Leppenraub's angels are.
And, yeah, they're beautiful because they're Scotty.
Scotty was
Leppenraub's model?
He was his fucking slave.
He was so ashamed of the pictures, he wouldn't even show them to me.
That bastard took him up to his farm, tortured him, got him strung out on dope.
He-He even branded him, Rom.
He burned a heart on Scotty's ass.
And then when he was done with him, he threw him away, like a fucking piece of trash.
I found him on the street like that, you know?
I didn't care.
He was still beautiful.
He was beautiful to me.
But he couldn't let it go, you know?
All the shit that happened to him.
He kept telling me that he had this tape of the torture.
He was going to get a bunch of money from Leppenraub for it.
That's what got him killed.
You tell the cops this,
Matthew?
Come on, Rom, look at me.
Who do you think they're going to believe, huh?
Me?
Or the great
David Leppenraub?
What sins have you committed?
Y- rays.
They're listening.
There's nothing you can do,
Matthew.
You and me, we're too small.
He knows that.
He likes that.
You know him?
You know Leppenraub?
I don't have to know him.
I know the man he works for.
You have any-any sins to confess, my child?
Come on, Rom,
I feel ridiculous enough.
You can call me Daddy, no one listening.
So what are we doing here, Daddy?
Suppose I-I told you I knew who killed Scotty Gates?
You did tell me and my boss.
Just-Just hear me out.
Suppose I told you that Scotty Gates was killed by a very famous artist?
And suppose I found a way to slip you his name? David Leppenraub?
You-You know about Leppenraub?
Apparently, everybody knows about Leppenraub.
Scotty Gates was going all over town crying how Leppenraub had abused him.
So what? I think the same thing about my employer.
He told everyone he was going to get revenge.
So, Lieutenant Cork made a call, and Leppenraub said, yeah...
Gates had tried to blackmail him, and he politely told Scotty to go to hell.
Ya, and then he politely murdered him.
- There's no evidence of that.
- Hell, there's a body in the tree.
Daddy, Gates was a nutcase.
No offense.
But he was running around in the middle of winter with no shirt on.
Everyone thought he was going to freeze to death.
We think it's reasonable for us to assume that that's what happened.
Very, v-very reasonable, except for one thing.
- What's that?
- He was murdered.
Daddy, you live in a cave.
You watch the news on a TV that's plugged into nothing.
You think there's a guy on top of a tower that's trying to take over the world.
You're not well. Why don't you let me get you some help?
And just who would you get to help me, Lulu?
Just-Just who you got in mind for your old man?
Rom, I-I got to get back to work.
That what you call it, Lulu?
You call that work?
Terrorizing innocent people while murderers roam the streets like rats, huh?
And you ashamed of me.
I should be ashamed of you!
You tell your boss he can't snake this one over on me.
Tell him he can't kill me,
'cause I'm reaching for my wallet.
He can't torture me with his anal broomsticks.
You tell Stuyvesant I'm going to tear his tower down! You...
Bored? Depressed? Tired? Need a lift? An added dimension?
Baby girl, baby girl, I got what you need. Fuckin' taste, man.
I- I just need a front, man.
I got that smoke.
You know I'm fucking good for it, man.
Please, man, please.
Don't make me fucking beg.
I got that smoke. I'll take whatever you got, man.
- I'll lick your fucking cock.
- Come here.
Junkie, you offend me. People like you, you're like fucking tumors, and I just want to cut your ass out
- Shaker, Shaker, undertaker, look what your garden has grown.
Get the fuck away from me, Caveman.
Yo, got that smoke.
Yo, yo, I'll give you two...
I'll give you two for one. Can I offer you some? Sardine, be a sardine.
Get caught in the net. Get squeezed in the cage. Caveman!
You want to disappear from this world, huh? Huh?
You want to learn that trick?
'Cause I can teach you.
You stinkin' motherfucker.
Yo, yo, got that? Come here, I got the smoke with me. Roll with me, roll with me.
Matthew, come on.
You-You said there was a tape, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Of the torture?
- And Leppenraub made it?
- Yeah, he made it.
So sick, he liked watching it.
But the guy running the camera, he wasn't into it.
Just doing what he was told.
So he made a copy of the tape for Scotty.
I guess he thought he was doing him a favor. Protecting him.
So now Leppenraub has the tape back?
- I don't know.
- But the cameraman, he must have the original, right?
So what's his name?
Where can we find him?
How am I supposed to know?
Why don't you ask Leppenraub?
So, now you think you're a detective?
I got eyes, Sheila, I can see things other people can't.
Like me?
You still think I look like this after all these years?
You're no smarter than when I married you, are you?
I'm gonna find the evidence, Sheila.
I'm gonna nail this Leppenraub bastard.
Ah, baby, if your shit was a rocket ship, you could go to the moon.
Now why you gotta stick your nose in matters... that do not pertain to you, and don't give me some bullshit about love.
The dead boy knew me, Sheila.
He called me "The Voice. "
It's Lulu, isn't it?
You wanna prove yourself to her?
You wanna win her respect? Try soap and hot water. Try getting a job.
That's just what
Stuyvesant wants, isn't it?
Get a shave, get a job, relax.
Well, not this time, Sheila, because Stuyvesant left that valentine outside my door.
He thinks he got to me this time by leaving that particularly nasty, fucking insult.
It pisses me off.
Sir? Sir?
You can't sleep in here.
It's like an oven in here.
What, are you trying to bake us?
- Are you making a pie?
- Sir, you're going to have to leave.
- Will you marry me?
- I'm calling the police.
Call the preacher, my love.
I love you more than life itself.
I'm dialing right now. I know you're dialing the preacher, my love.
I hear your heart beating, like a newborn... butterfly.
Arnold?
Hello?
Who is this?
It's-It's Rom.
Romulus? Romulus Ledbetter?
I do not believe it.
I thought you'd...
My God, I heard you were living in a cave or something.
A little rough, a little rough, but things are good now.
Uh, living in Tahiti.
Tahiti?
W- Well, San Francisco.
- Was in Tahiti.
- Okay.
Rom? Rom?
Rom, are you there?
No, no, no.
- Everything's good.
- Great.
- How you doing, Arnold?
- Same old. BBC's doing an opera of mine.
You're not still... composing, are you?
Um, just-just did a piece for the, uh, the New Pastorale Festival.
- Wow, that's great.
- A sonata, uh, inspired by this guy
David Leppenraub?
- You know his pictures?
- This is incredible.
- David Leppenraub's a friend of mine.
- Oh, my god!
Is he?
Hey, hey. Listen, Romulus. This is...
Well, I mean, it's just a thought, but we're having a fund-raiser up at David's farm.
That piece of yours, do you think you could perform it for us?
This Saturday.
Oh, hey, look, it was just an idea.
- Be glad to.
- Great! Great.
This is gonna be some surprise.
Hey, mister.
You got a suit and tie?
You want a suit and tie?
Got a gig upstate.
Old classmate got it for me.
Old classmate from Julliard?
Right. You remembered.
Let me ask you something.
You say you went to Julliard.
What can you tell me about, say, Scriabin?
Who?
The Russian composer,
Scriabin?
- What can you tell me about him?
- Nothing.
Ah, of course you can't.
- Take care, my friend.
- Scriabin.
I can't see through to the least flicker of that man's divinity.
Poeme Divin's okay.
That Promethean chord of his?
Nothing but a dominant ninth, few hocus-pocus suspensions.
Play the F-sharp it's "G," the
"A" is B-flat. You see what I mean?
You can't impose divinity on a chord.
A chord's divinity has to come from the inside out.
You know?
Betty?
This is Romulus.
Hi, Romulus.
Romulus is a homeless man who needs a suit of clothes.
Uh, not-not homeless.
I live in a cave.
He's the one
I told you about, remember?
- Remember?
- The music man, Bob?
That's it. Right.
Th-That's some view.
You'll grace us?
Nice detail, Bob.
Bosendorfer '36.
Very good.
Everything in here is from the '30s.
Ohh, that's what it is.
Yeah, I'm a bankruptcy lawyer.
The depression was something of a golden era for my kind.
Please, play something, anything.
I- I really couldn't.
- Why not?
- Honey, if he doesn't want to play.
I wanna know if he can play, honey.
Please.
Fight it, baby.
Show Stuyvesant you're not scared of him.
Play the damn thing.
One hand-me-down suit coming up.
That was wonderful. Why does it hurt you to play?
That was another life.
You like?
Oh.
Oh! Oh.
Romulus, what size shoe are you?
- Uh, 12.
- Hmm.
Bob's a nine. Well, maybe just keep 'em hidden.
There you go, Romulus.
We wouldn't want you to freeze to death.
A toast.
Honey?
To the eternal cycles of failure... and reorganization, huh?
So, tell us, who is
Cornelius Gould Studebaker?
Stuyvesant.
Darling? Maybe we better not talk about Mr. Stuyvesant right now.
Make you nervous, Bob? Something you don't want her to know?
We wouldn't want you to freeze to death,
I really love that one, Bob. Wouldn't want to find you propped in a tree.
What is it?
It's a new weapon.
It's something
I've never seen before.
Z- rays.
I'm so sorry.
I- I really must be off.
If I've been impolite or ungenerous in any way, please, please, please, forgive me.
I- I really must be off.
My undying gratitude for the clothes.
Woo, what are my chances of pulling this off?
About zero.
Rubbing bellies with zero, unless you all simmer down!
Look at you!
You are a sight for sore eyes.
Remember Stacy Kensinger?
Flautist, great lips.
Stacy. Stacy?
Uh, maybe she came after you left.
Why'd you leave anyway? I mean, nobody fucking ever leaves Julliard.
Oh, well... got Sheila knocked up.
Really?
That was it?
Christ, you could have found some way.
Well, the last time I saw you was at Lincoln Center.
The snow out here is a different color.
- You couldn't play that day.
- Blue, like skim milk.
You know what I think?
I think you were afraid.
You know how they say some people are afraid of success?
Well, this therapist
I've been seeing... thinks it's because we don't want to surpass our fathers.
Romulus?
Rom!
Great lips, where does it all go?
Just didn't care much for recitals.
Hmm. Yeah.
- Lao-tse, how you doing, girl?
- Lao-tse, get down!
- She looks scary, but she's a sweetheart.
- Hi, dog, hey.
Moira.
What a magnificent day.
Hey, dog. You think
I'm running a con, don't you?
You think I'm the shoes and not the suit.
Lao-tse, stop bothering our guests.
You're right.
No bother.
No bother.
This is your brilliant friend.
Hi, I'm Moira Leppenraub. I'm
David's sister. Mr. Ledbetter?
Romulus. Rom.
Lucinda!
Baby, baby boy!
Arnold tells me you're a genius.
- At what?
- Music.
Oh, is that all?
Why? Is there more?
I can put a match in my mouth... and when the lights are out, I light up like a jack-o'- lantern.
The man does not promote me right.
Tell her about the time you burned a hole in your tongue.
Juvenile bullshit.
Sheila, what are you doing here?
Watching you make a fool of yourself.
What are you doing here?
I have to prove
Leppenraub's guilty.
- Prove to who?
- To the world.
To Lulu.
Lulu needs a father, not some psycho Sherlock Holmes.
You're gonna get yourself in deep shit.
Look at her. Like a cat itching to get scratched.
You better watch your back, baby.
- Shall we go in?
- I-I'll do it.
Oh, thanks.
Um, just this way.
Man on a horse.
I was at this exhibit, and it was basically penises...
...big, small, fat, skinny... all in pastel.
No, thank you.
Don't you watch me!
Joey!
Could you be a little less conspicuous, please?
Sorry. Please excuse him, Mr. Ledbetter.
He's a filmmaker. I can't seem to get rid of him.
Apparently, some people find my life terribly interesting.
I'm David Leppenraub.
I'm honored to have you here.
And-And I to be here.
I was very flattered to hear that my work inspires you.
- Oh, well.
- Why?
- Excuse me?
- Why do you like my work?
- Well...
- This one.
What do you think?
What do I think?
That's what I asked.
It's empty.
Empty?
So empty, it hurts the eyes.
You see, the angel is-is looking heavenward, but he can't see... because Stuyvesant has sucked out his soul and just left a shell.
He's empty.
So empty it hurts.
Now that I like, amigo.
It hurts the eyes.
Watch your head.
Does it hurt,
Mr. Ledbetter?
It's supposed to.
All great art is born of suffering.
Tell me what you feel.
In what dark, damaged place does it infect you?
Deep, ancestral, primordial pain.
Shame, fear... that's what my work is all about.
Fear and transcending fear.
Guts versus fear.
It's really all there is.
I'm told I'm something of an expert on fear.
Let me show you this.
My latest.
What's your verdict?
Guilty.
And your evidence?
Don't have any.
Not yet.
That's a different kid, isn't it?
It's not the same model who's in the other shots, right?
You are perceptive.
Most people can't tell.
That's Joey, the asshole with the video camera.
My regular model had vertigo, and I needed him up in a tree, but heights made him twitchy.
Is that right?
Who was your regular model?
He doesn't work for me anymore.
Joey took his place.
Really?
What happened to him?
What difference does it make?
Right, what difference does it make?
After all, they're just bodies.
I mean, after the body's done, just chuck it, hang it from a tree.
You playing some kind of game with me, amigo?
This stuff could go out of fashion real quick, right?
People find out the real story, they don't want it in their house.
- Who the hell are you?
- Suddenly, it's not worth millions...
What do you want?
You want to blackmail me too?
Stuyvesant wouldn't like that.
- What's this Stuyvesant shit?
- What's this murder shit?
I don't know who the hell you are, but you listen, I loved Scotty Gates.
- Oh, I bet you did.
- Like a son.
- Why'd he run around telling people you tortured him?- Because he went crazy.
- Why?
- How the hell should I know, I wasn't even here.
I had an opening in Cologne.
When I came back, he was gone.
His boyfriend broke up with him, maybe that was it.
Love, it gets in your head.
Not yet! Not yet!
Love... it-it will... it will do that to you.
Look...
I owe you an apology.
I'm-I'm sorry.
I- I heard these rumors.
That's all right.
I suppose it's just part of being who I am.
Wild envy surrounds me... and rumors.
Too many goddamned rumors.
One of them actually had the nerve to call my work...
"victim art. "
Trying to believe these stories of oppression and cruelty.
Does it hurt?
I like you, Romulus. It's too bad you can't be with us longer.
Excuse me?
Well, let me rephrase.
If the price of rapture... is a mountain of suffering, shouldn't the fee be paid?
So long as nobody gets hurt.
"So long as nobody gets hurt. "
I like that.
My brother likes to hear himself talk.
You'll get used to it.
Excuse me.
He died of fright, didn't he?
Mr. Ledbetter, is now a good time?
- For what?
- To shoot you.
I guess now is as good a time as any.
Wow. You're really scared of the camera, aren't you?
Camera?
I'm wanting to do a quick interview, so you can talk about whatever you like.
Where?
I do a lot of taping there in the coach house.
Is that where you made the video of Scotty?
What?
Come on, Joey, you know what I'm talking about.
Look, there's-there's no tape, man. That's just a rumor.
But you know better, right?
Because you made it.
Shh. Please.
- You a cop?
- Mm-mm.
Well, how come you know about the tape?
A friend of Scotty's told me about it.
You were a friend of Scotty's, weren't you?
- Scotty's dead, man.
- But he still needs justice, right, Joey?
Look, I don't want to talk about Scotty now. Please.
You're scared.
You're scared of your boss.
Please! They'll hear us. You don't know.
Well, why you so scared?
Because I've seen what he can do.
You can't imagine.
- Wh-Where's the tape?
- Romulus?
It's safe.
I've been looking everywhere for you. It's time.
- Time for what?
- Piano time.
I haven't started yet.
Just play, baby.
Just get from this side of the piece to the other.
What? What is it?
What am I smelling in this place?
There's some foulness here.
The smell of mendacity and evil.
What is this stench?
Is it the rotting boy delivered outside my cave?
Is that what I'm smelling?
The sweet valentine you delivered?
What is this reek?
Is it the smell of torture?
The brand burning his flesh?
Is that what I smell?
It's all of you, isn't it?
It's the smell of your heartless art and your bone-dry theories, like last week's vomit.
And the heart has vamoosed from this culture long ago.
And anybody gets wind of that...
You tortured him, killed him and you make a videotape of it and call it art.
I won't have this. You hang the body from a tree to teach the Caveman a lesson.
And you burn the Caveman's eyes out with blue skies and green ducks! Green ducks!
Get your hands off me!
I haven't found the clue yet!
You lied to me. You're still in that cave, aren't you?
And you won't get me out of that cave, either. You can't matchbox me!
Stuyvesant! We're going to bring your tower down!
Stuyvesant!
Get out of here.
Lao-tse, what is it?
What is it, you dumb dog?
What? Lao-tse!
Romulus?
Lao-tse, come here.
You scared the shit outta me.
- You here alone?
- Yes.
Why'd you leave the party?
I hate those parties. What the hell happened to you?
Your-Your brother's hit man tried to run me over.
Photographers do not have hit men, Romulus.
Yeah, well you tell that to the no-face with the gun.
You're psychotic, aren't you?
I- I have brain typhoons.
Brain typhoons?
Swarms of moth-seraphs howl in my skull.
Lies vex them.
Then you'll understand if I don't invite you in.
Mm-hmm.
- Your brother tortured Scotty.
- That is a vicious rumor.
And when Scotty started to spread the word around, your brother had him killed.
- David loved Scotty.
- Not what Scotty says.
Scotty had a nervous breakdown.
He was a dope fiend.
Who made him a dope fiend?
Go on, girl, go on out.
Come in here.
Scotty was a junkie when we met him.
David likes damaged souls. He says they make better subjects.
If it were true, if David hurt Scotty in any way, believe me, I would have known all about it.
Scotty and I were friends. I was devoted to him. What are you doing?
Looking for clues.
What kind of clues?
Well, this is the place that they did the shows, right? The torture shows?
Oh, God.
Don't be scared.
It's not real.
It's all fake, Rom.
It's an illusion.
He uses prosthetics, clay, wax, all these props.
None of it's real. David says he wants to "provoke the viewers, set off tremors in the subconscious," I don't fucking know.
- S- See, what's that?
- What?
That-That looks like real blood.
It is.
It's yours.
See, Stuyvesant uses Y-rays to terrify and-and destroy.
See, Y-rays are crude.
Y-rays are tax collectors and police brutality and drug wars... and backed-up toilets.
- But this new weapon...
- Z-rays.
Mm-hmm, Z-rays. Z- rays are green and soft... like moonlight and seductive and... much more vicious.
Z- rays smell like a rich man's bank account.
They smell like success.
Rom, this is a great story.
I love the no-faces and that guy in the tower, but, um, you know it's bullshit, right?
- It's not reality.
- No, of course not.
Okay.
Stuyvesant's much truer than reality.
Stuyvesant invented reality.
You're hopeless, aren't you?
I'm hopeless.
Turn around.
What?
Do you have a match?
Yeah.
Were you scared?
No.
Are you?
Yes.
Some white girls will fuck any kind of black man.
Crazy, homeless.
Leave me alone, Sheila.
So, uh, what do you call yourself doing?
- Digging for evidence?
- I'm getting close.
Something happened here,
I can feel it.
I bet you can.
I got Leppenraub on the run.
He knows I'm going to get him.
I'm going to nail that bastard.
I think you're being misled.
Misled by whom?
By you, as usual.
I think you got it all wrong about these people.
You better open your eyes, take a look around.
Leave me alone, woman.
How'd you get in here, anyway?
I rode in on your dreams.
Well, ride on out.
You better wake up, baby, before you get murdered in your sleep.
You hear me?
You better wake up.
Don't mind a little dark.
Daughter?
Jesus, Rom, what are you doing here?
I didn't... I didn't get you anything for Valentine's Day.
B-But I found these, and they're still in pretty good shape.
Don't worry.
I- I don't wanna come in.
I- I just need a ride home.
So, where you been?
What happened to you?
I guess I cut myself shaving.
You don't wanna tell me, fine.
I haven't seen you shaved since I was a girl.
You look good.
I- I needed a change.
There's a shelter in my precinct.
There's a waiting list, but, um, I could get you in.
See that building over there.
That used to be
Sisters of Mercy Hospital.
Uncle Augustus... that's your great-uncle Augustus... he used to lecture there.
He was a surgeon.
Did I ever tell you about him?
Look, Ward's Island.
D- Do you remember that little playground?
Yeah, you said pirates lived there once, and there was buried treasure.
You used to call me "Captain. "
You used to dig in that sandbox for gold.
- Look it, Daddy.
- Once I found a balloon there.
You-You thought you found a balloon.
- No! No!
- You cried...
Yeah, you cried when I wouldn't blow it up.
You did blow it up for me.
No, no, I-I bought a real balloon. I blew that up for you.
Daddy, thank you for my flowers.
- Little late.
- Still, it's the only valentine I got.
I didn't get you anything.
Oh, you-you still could if you wanted to.
There is something I kind of got my heart set on.
What?
It's something I want more than chocolates or a car or...
What do you want, Daddy?
The autopsy report on Scotty Gates.
I wish I could shake you.
Just shake all that crazy shit out of you.
Goddamn!
Just a second.
Just for a fucking second, it was like we were... talking.
Like I was actually talking to my father.
You break my heart.
Get out.
Get out!
Get the hell out!
Matthew?
Rom.
I changed my mind.
I don't wanna die.
Who did this to you?
A couple of guys with stockings on their heads.
Like those fuckers you're always talking about.
Shut the fuck up.
They wanna scare you, Rom.
They wanna shut you up.
You gotta stay nasty on them, Rom.
Stay nasty on those motherfuckers.
Lao-tse. Come on, girl!
Whoo!
You break my heart.
"The victim is the killer. "
Does it hurt?
Please. It's supposed to.
Your pain moves me.
Tell me what you feel.
- Shame?
- Please.
- Fear?
- You're brilliant, okay?
- You're a brilliant artist.
- You're soft.
- Please!
- Soft as a pillow.
Please!
How long...
Why don't...
Why don't you let me die?
Faker.
You haven't experienced real pain.
...don't you let me die?
How long...
- Why don't you let me die?
- Faker.
You haven't experienced real pain.
...don't you let me die.
You don't wanna watch that.
Joey.
Give you nightmares.
So, you found my hiding place.
But you're not a detective... and you're not a cop, so who are you?
I- I'm the one that found the body.
- The homeless guy?
- Not homeless.
I live in a cave. So what the fuck you doing here?
What if he saw you here?
Scotty asked me to help him before he was killed.
He asked me to help, and-and I didn't.
So what, you feel guilty?
You feel like it's your fault?
Your fault. Jesus Christ.
J- Joey. Joey.
What d-did he do to Scotty?
Listen.
I came here... because I thought
David Leppenraub... was the greatest artist of the human psyche who had ever lived.
That he knew all about suffering.
What attracts us to it, you know?
Why we seem to reach out to it.
I wanted to be one of his disciples.
Carry his cameras, film him, do whatever he wanted.
Whatever he asked, I did.
So did Scotty.
Except once.
Up in that tree.
See, Scotty was scared of heights.
David wanted to tie him to that branch, but no amount of dope would make him do it.
- Give me your hand.
- I can't.
- Let go of the tree. Give me your hand.
It'll be fine. I can't. I can't let go.
- Would you just trust me, please?
- David, please, I'm scared.
I want you to be scared.
Come on, we're losing the light.
- I can't!
- Scotty, if you damage that fucking cage,
I swear I will throw you out of this tree!
- But, David,
- He's terrified.
Get down, you pussy.
Get out of the fucking tree!
Joey, take off your clothes.
You'll pose this one.
- Scotty, get down.
- I'm going, and I'm not coming back either.
Where are you going to go,
Scotty?
You're never going to touch me again. I'm gonna tell everyone what you did to me.
Are you?
So, he came down... and I went up.
And I was the crucified angel.
Greatest moment of my life.
I got to be inside
Leppenraub's vision.
You have no idea what that meant to me.
And-and Scotty?
I never saw him again.
Wanna know what I think?
I think he brought him here.
I think he had Scotty in the freezer.
I think he froze him to death.
- Give me the tape.
- Why?
- So we can fight him.
- We can't fight him.
We can go to the cops.
- There's no evidence.
- The tape!
Against David's lawyers?
They'd rip it to shreds.
You don't understand. You can't fight him. You can't run from him.
You can't just give up.
- Why not?
- Don't you see?
You're next.
You're the next angel.
I know.
Joey?
- Duck! Hide!
- Joey?
Saw you with someone. Who was it?
Who?
You were talking to someone.
Who was it?
Romulus!
What can I do for you?
I need a place to stay.
The cave's not safe.
Uh, I don't think you can stay here, but
I can call a shelter for you.
Come on in.
Come on in.
Have a lime rickey.
Hey, everyone, this is Romulus.
Hi, Romulus.
This is a Bob and Betty festival.
- May I propose a toast?
- Sure.
To the eternal and-and everlasting cycle... of failure and resuscitation.
Hear! Hear!
To the fact the cycle... seems to be stuck.
And-And the Bobs and Bettys are always on top.
Let's drink... to those on top, stay on top.
And let's drink to those poor slobs down below.
'Cause they'll always be "shitslogging. "
Am I right?
They'll believe all of the lies we tell them!
You're losing it, baby.
Don't bother yourself, Betty.
No need to call the cops.
You're safe up here.
Nothing can touch you.
I need you to believe me.
I need you to believe me.
Leppenraub Foundation, can I help you?
I have a message for David Leppenraub.
Tell him this. Tell him the
Caveman made a copy of the tape.
Right? Joey Peasley has the original, but I made a copy.
And if he wants it,
I'll sell it to him.
Tell him that.
My dearest Lulu,
"By the time you read this letter,
"they will have killed me.
"And you'll know that everything
I've been saying is true.
"Get Matthew to tell you the whole story.
"Go to Leppenraub's farm.
Make Joey give you the tape,
"then take all the truth you've gathered...
"and drive Leppenraub through the gates of hell.
"I'll meet him there just inside and deal with him.
"At this very moment, Lulu, in some other court of time,
"I live not in a cave, but in a tree house.
'A tree house by the sea.
Please, don't!
"You and I are down on the sand making a castle.
'And your mother is wading through the shallows,
'gathering enough sand dollars to make us all filthy rich.
I love you. Daddy. "
I said don't fuck with us.
Where is it?
If-If you're gonna kill me, you'd better do it quick. They patrol around here.
- Oh!
- You're gonna talk.
You have to kill me and torture me, but hurry. Get to the killing.
No, no, no, we're not gonna kill you.
We're not gonna torture you. See, that's too easy. That's too cruel.
We're gonna torture your daughter, little Lulu. 135 Cole Street.
We're going there right now,
Caveman. Wanna come?
No! Aah!
Aah!
See, Caveman, you're gonna go with us.
We're gonna party with that girl all night long.
Phone call. Phone call. What?
Hell no.
- I'll get your tape for you.
- Where?
Hey, hey, Captain.
You know the guy that owns that little videotape?
Well, he wants it back, and he wants it back real bad.
No explanations.
Tell her where to make the drop.
I'd really appreciate it if you would bury that treasure for me.
Rom, what are you talking about?
Did I- Did I hear somebody with you?
Yeah, yeah, you heard right, Captain.
Look, I-I know it's late for this pirate thing, but... these guys really need you to do that tonight.
- Do what?
- Look, bury the treasure... at the place we talked about, where you found the balloon,
- and-and then clear out.
- Hang up.
- Rom, who is that?
- Look, Captain.
I won't ever ask you for anything again. I promise.
I know you think I'm crazy, but I always keep my promises.
All right? Bye-bye.
Baby, what are you doing?
If Lulu knew what I was talking about,
I could call to her and warn her.
- He will kill you.
- But she'll get away.
What if she just turned over and went back to sleep?
Then, we'll lose her. But she's gotta be in that playground.
- There's no other choice.
- Come on, asshole. Move!
- Let's go!
- What's your hurry?
Move your ass!
Look it, Daddy.
Is this it? Get in there!
What the fuck is this? You want me to kill you, don't you?
Police, don't move!
Drop the gun!
I got a gun pointed to your father's head, bitch!
- So don't spook me. Put your gun down.
- Do it, Lulu!
Wanna see his brains, bitch?
I said drop the fucking gun!
- Shoot him! He'll kill us both!
- Hell no!
You think I'm gonna kill a cop?
Put the gun down and I'll run.
Moth-seraphs of divinity of vengeance, I need you.
- Put it down, girl!
- Lulu, kill him!
Let him shoot me! Do as
I say, I'm your father!
Do you want me to kill your father? Put it down, girl!
Now.
Don't! Don't!
Don't move!
- You fucker!
- Lulu, over there!
He's over there!
Daddy. Daddy.
Daddy, it's all right.
It's all right. He's gone.
Are you shot? Am I?
- It's all right.
- We're all right?
We're not shot?
You're alive. I'm alive. How can that be?
He wasn't aiming at us.
He was trying to finish off his partner here.
Operator, this is Officer Ledbetter,
New York City Police Department.
I'm at Ward's Island Playground.
I need a bus forth with.
I have a perp shot and the other perp fled over the footbridge.
He's armed with a gun.
Send backup forth with.
Shaker.
- You know him?
- Mm-hmm. Shaker.
It's Matthew's dealer.
We're looking for the one that got away.
We figured they must have overheard you and Matthew on a street, talking about this valuable tape and decided they wanted some of the action.
How's he connected to Leppenraub?
Caveman, come here.
You see that pack of vermin down there?
If Leppenraub's name comes into this, no more quiet investigation, no more slowly building a case, just fuckin' weasels everywhere you step.
Listen, Caveman, this is detective business.
All due respect, maybe it's not for you.
Maybe you need what's called a "rational mind. "
Yeah, m-maybe... maybe you're right.
I should leave the police work to you.
Meanwhile, I'll give my first press conference.
Oh, fuck! Caveman, what do you want from me?
The autopsy report on Scotty Gates.
Your daughter dropped it off this morning.
Knock yourself out.
It says,
"The-The 'periorbital' spaces... are-are free of extravasated blood and edema. "
It says,
"The-The 'sclerae'...
"are an-
'anicteric. "'
What it doesn't say is anything about a brand.
Matthew says Scotty was-was branded.
"Blood-red valentine on his butt. "
Why didn't the autopsy mention that?
It's just gone? Vamoosed?
How'd it do that?
What the hell's
Stuyvesant up to now?
Did you fuck Scotty Gates?
Did you come all the way up here to ask me that?
- Mm-hmm.
- Why?
I have to know.
If you fucked him, then you saw his butt, right?
- Right?
- I guess so.
Then, you could tell me if-if there's a heart brand on his butt.
A heart?
I guess I could.
If I saw his butt.
But...
I didn't see his butt.
'Cause I didn't fuck him,
'cause he's gay among other things.
Do you think that I fuck everybody, Rom?
You-You said you were devoted to him.
A different kind of devotion.
Hello, Romulus.
It's nice to see you again.
Hi, Moira.
You know, it's, um, it's interesting that you mention this heart thing.
I have a little confession to make.
You got what I want?
Got a little atonement for me, master?
Does it hurt?
It's supposed to.
It's not over yet.
'Course not,Joey.
'Cause it's not his money you're after, is it?
What are you doing here?
You want the glory... a little recognition, and he denied you.
- Did you tell him that?
- I did treat you somewhat shabbily.
That time you took Scotty's place up in the tree,
I know I wasn't appreciative enough.
He didn't even acknowledge it was you.
He passed you off as Scotty.
- I scoffed at your ambitions.
- He didn't see your genius.
And that twisted your brain around in its socket, right, Joey?
'Cause you're a great artist.
You're a genius.
The master of suffering.
And yet, he called you a faker.
Soft. Soft as a pillow.
Never experienced real pain.
You don't know what pain is.
Why the fuck did you talk to him?
So, one day, you decided you were going to show Leppenraub... who the real master was.
So, you took Scotty in the big freezer... and you made your own art.
You froze him to death.
Are you saying I killed Scotty Gates?
Masterpiece of suffering.
You're schizo.
Scotty was nuts.
He was homeless, that's why he froze to death. Everybody saw him.
Everybody saw you!
That wasn't Scotty Gates running around the village, that was you.
You're so beautiful.
You figured if Leppenraub could pass you off as Scotty, then-then you could too.
You played the victim, but the victim was the killer.
It's brilliant, Joey. You're radiant. You radiate Z-rays.
- This is bullshit!
- Then you took the tapes you've made, and you-you put Leppenraub's voice on them from your interviews.
All that stuff he's been spouting, you put it all in.
Does it hurt? It's supposed to.
But they were just words strung together.
You twisted them so you could blackmail Leppenraub.
- I told you to keep your mouth shut!
- Meanwhile, you were watching me.
You set me up.
And when you were ready, you-you left your valentine outside my cave.
'Cause you knew I'd go around ranting about the evil David Leppenraub.
The cops?
They wouldn't believe me.
The rumors would scare the hell out of
Leppenraub, so you became my nightmare.
You played me.
You knew all my chords.
You thought the no-faces could control me, but I'm a free man!
You're insane!
You're a lunatic!
And you're a fucking genius!
Tell him. Tell him.
Tell him about the little moths that live inside your head.
They're not moths!
They're moth-seraphs.
The moth-seraphs of divinity and vengeance!
And they're sick and tired of your lies and your deceit!
And they're gonna fly you straight to hell!
Look at him!
He's a lunatic!
Do you really think he was going to help you, you asshole?
If this is what you got, you got nothing!
Scotty?
Scotty!
You set me up, you fuckhead?
You're supposed to be dead.
Scotty, they said you were dead.
Get your hands off me, you stupid faggot!
You're gonna die now, Caveman.
- Joey!
- Drop the gun, police!
Police!
Get down!
Matthew!
Matthew!
You never knew Scotty Gates.
How did you do it?
How the hell did you know?
So, how did you know?
His heart.
Matthew said that Scotty had a heart branded on his butt.
But it wasn't in the angel pictures, and it wasn't in the autopsy report.
So, I asked Moira.
'Cause I thought maybe she had sex with Scotty.
So, I asked her about the heart, and she said of course she remembered.
But not on Scotty, on Joey.
Moira had sex with Joey.
Yep. With me too.
These are good.
Can I have another?
Maybe you should slow down.
Why did you let Joey have so much power over you?
You could have called his bluff.
I mean, the police would have known the tape was a fake.
He wouldn't have taken it to the authorities.
He would have circulated it at parties.
Success is fragile,
Mr. Ledbetter.
Do you know what it is to have a muse?
I think I do.
Joey was nothing like him.
But sometimes, if the light was just right,
I could almost believe.
I guess I'll have to find another one.
Look at you.
Drunk as a skunk.
Oh, but I put a nick in Stuyvesant's armor.
Stuyvesant?
Haven't you figured it out yet, baby?
Don't you know what killed Scotty Gates?
Not Stuyvesant, not
Stuyvesant's no-face slaves, just craziness.
That's what makes all these victims.
None of your fancy demons, just plain ol', run-of-the-mill craziness.
That's the only beast you have to tame.
Rom.
I liked what you played, up at the party.
Little raw, little rusty, but it was good to hear.
You have a beautiful face.
In a strange turn of events, police were aided by a homeless man,
Romulus Ledbetter, who resides in a rocky enclosure in Inwood Park.
Ledbetter, known to locals as "The Caveman, " was instrumental in the capture and arrest of Joseph Peasley, who is suspected of murdering
Scott Gates.
Gates' body was found in the same park on Valentine's Day.
A police spokesperson stated that
"The Caveman" is a local hero.
Daddy.
I wanted to warn you.
You know, you could come home for awhile.
I mean, if you wanted to.
I don't think Mama would mind.
You know, just... just for awhile.
Y- You know, Lulu,
I don't think so.
Maybe some other time.
Thanks just the same.
Daddy, I want you to know...
I am really...
I'm proud.
I'm proud of you.
There is this theory.
Given an infinite universe
And infinite time... all things will happen.
That means that every event is inevitable including those that are impossible. that's as good explanation for all this as anything else.
Now, a lot of stories start in bars, so that's where we are going to stars this one.
Not because that I was there.
I wasn't.
But because it is a damn good introduction to a very unique... fellow.
Legends of every major culture all contain some sort of character whose purpose is to grand wishes. except Americas.
The Arabs have Jinni's...
The Irish have Leprechauns...
The Chinese have dragons and monkeys...
The Europeans have ferries and wood sprits.
Who do we have?
Santa Claus?
Santa Claus just brings presents.
He doesn't grand wishes.
Satan.  He grants wishes.
Zak, Satan predate American culture.
He doesn't grand wishes, he makes deals.
All right, I give up.
- What do we have here?
- No one.
That's my thesis.
Our culture is unique in having no such mythology.
Oh, you're wrong my friend.
Excuse me?
There is a fella in America, who grants wishes.
And only one to a customer.
And who is this fella?
O.W. Grant.
That's his usual name.
He's got many others.
And he's an elusive sun of a bitch.
You'd get easier time finding a Jinni.
So how come, we've never heard of this O.W. Grant?
You haven't heard O.W. Grant,
'cause America, is a much younger place than
Ireland or Arabia.
Not too many people have had the chance to meet up with him.
Let me guess.
You have.
I met him out at Interstate 60.
Accidental. That's his way.
Folks don't find him, he finds them.
He just kinda happens in to them, and they don't know who he is or what he does... until he does it.
And mostly messes with them, plays tricks,
'cause that's his way too, but sometimes... if he takes a shine to you... he'll play it strait.
Now, one story says that his daddy was a Leprechaun... came over here with Irish.
Now, midgets are notorious skirt chasers
This leprechaun goes and knocks up a Cheyenne Indian...
Cheyenne get the land taken away in the end up with the immortal, nomadic half-breed with magical powers.
- Interstate 60, you said?
- Hmmmn
So, what does this O.W. Grant look like?
Red bow tie.
He smokes a pipe, curved in the image of a monkey.
Maybe you'd be better of writing your theses without mentioning O.W.
He'd probable rather not have people knownin' about him.
You got it.
Good night.
Hey Quincy, check this out
There is no Interstate 60.
I 65, 64, 66, and 69.
No I 60.
I guess tonight's everybody's fool-of-shit night.
Guy with a red bow tie and a monkey pipe, who grants wishes...
Right.
No, damn it, look,
I need, that bid in before twelve...
Yeah it's critical, just...
Right, call West...
Holy shit!
Broken jaw.
I'm sorry mister,
I didn't see you.
Are, are you OK come on?
Are you all right?
Jesus.
Don't!
Stop!
Oh man!
My bike!
Look, I'm sorry.
I'll pay
Oh God damn it!
Oh God damn it!
Look at my suit.
Oh shit...
Oh fuck.
I've got a sails meeting at 11 o'clock.
This is a fuckin' disaster.
My phone is my fuckin’ life line.
God damn it!
Oh I say everything happens for a reason.
May I guess,
I just needed a new bike.
I, for one, did not need this shit in my life.
Not today.
Of all fuckin’ days!
Oh God damn it!
I wish, this had never happened!
I wish, it hadn't happened... I wish, it hadn't happened!
Was that your wish?
If you had a wish, you wished, this hadn't happened?
Fuckin’ A right!
Granted!
Mr. Baker.
How did you know my name?
Damn it, I need the bid in before 12... yeah it's critical... look, just call West have him fax the timesheet to the main office...
Get it there by ...
Speak up, I can't hear you.
Some people just don't know what to wish for.
As for my part in this story, well, it began on a Tuesday.
September 18th.
My birthday.
My 22nd birthday to be exact.
Oh, I'm Neal Oliver.
And this mess, is my apartment in St. Louis. Missouri.
Where at this particular moment
I was at MajorDecision.com.
Should I wear a tie to lunch?
Damn.
Happy birthday Neal...
Sweet
Truth.
You are not mad, that I'm bailing on you tonight?
No, no no no.
I mean how cool it you be for you, to bomb your psyche-test because of some stupid concert
No aah. You have got to wait until lunch.
That's your family rules.
But you can open this.
I intercepted your snail mail.
It's the reality check.
I'm game over on the art scholarship.
We should at least open it.
I can tell a rejection by weight.
You are the wrong sex, the wrong colour and your family has too much money. I'm sorry.
Just don't, don't mention anything to my old man, please.
You are so weird.
What?
Well, you actually suppose to cut your grapefruit in half and eat it with a spoon not peel it, and eat it like an orange.
Oh look... it's her.
Again.
Should I be like jealous?
Oh, maybe if she was real.
So, I had another dream about her, last night.
She was in jail... it's got to mean something.
I'll tell you what it means.
You saw her once somewhere and made a subconscious impression, the impression came back to you in a dream, so you drew her which made the impression stronger.
You dream, you draw, you draw, you dream
Now it's a vicious cycle.
So quit drawing her, and it'll end.
Well, thank you Karl Young.
Fact is, I enjoy drawing her.
But, am I...
Am I any good at this Sally?
'cause today is the deadline of the Conrad Competition.
Should I even enter these?
Don't ask me Neal.
I don't want to be judgmental.
But I do know, that just because you enjoy doing something, doesn't necessarily mean that you should make it your career.
Here,
No worries.
As I said it all started on my 22nd birthday.
Specifically here.
At my traditional birthday lunch.
As always, my father had picked the restaurant.
Attending with the usual suspects.
Sally, who my parents actually liked maybe even more than I did.
My dad. Daniel.
Attorney at law.
My mom Marlene.
The attorneys wife.
And my sister and best friend Nancy.
Put on earth by the grace of God, to keep me from going insane.
So what did you wish for?
Please tell me that it was something about us.
I'm guessing...
He wished to go skydiving again.
God forbid.
Oh no, no. Neal you didn't.
Why, if I tell her, it won't come true.
Actually that's no wife's tail.
The truth is, you should always tell your wish.
Kinda Carma thing.
Put it out there, project it.
Then it just might come true.
Never heard that before.
Oh, it's true.
Believe me.
I know.
I'll cut this for you.
OK, so now you have to tell us.
Yeah, come on, tell us Neilo.
I wished for... an answer.
An answer, OK an answer to what?
An answer to my life.
Here it is.
Happy birthday son.
Your admission to the Bradford Law Fellowship.
Just do the interview next month, on October 15th, and you're in.
It's all arranged.
By me.
And you can take that to the bank.
Dad, I told you,
I wasn't sure yet.
Well, I can be sure for the both of us.
Last candle gone.
Take it with you.
That is, if you want your wish granted.
Thanks.
Oh, cool.
That's my colour too. Thank you.
Sable brushes.
Nance.
You are the best Nance.
You are welcome.
As for last.
Happy birthday son.
Isn't it perfect?
Fire engin red.
You have no idea, how hard it was to find a red convertible in this town.
Fule injected. 160 horses.
Csr phone.
Yeah, I even got you special plates.
Oh boy, I would have killed for a car like this, when I was your age.
Aw, you know I thought it was high time for an image change, and what better way to start.
Now, you see, the engine is a 2.5 litre dual overhead cam, inline...
As usual, it was all about him.
His idea of cool.
Red was his colour. Not mine.
It was his pet phrase on the licence plates.
Clearly he was excepting me to become him.
Well? Isn't it the best present, you could ever get?
It's awesome.  Come on Neal, take me for a ride.
Well, son...
Neal!
Oh my God!
Son!.
Somebody call 911.
Neal, Neal, are you all right?
Talk to me son.
Neal.
Get better soon honey,
Love Mom + Dad, XO
St. Louis’s finest thin crust
You're all right Neal?
Yeah, yeah, just... it only hurts when I think.
They want to keep me overnight, to log some tests in the morning make sure, my perception is like worked, yeah.
You're goddess, Nance.
I know.
So, what's your perception of a dad who buys you the gift, he wants for himself?
About the same as toxic wastes.
Your perception is fine.
That is one hell of a way getting out of answering dad about the car.
Mom and dad are going to be here soon, what are you gonna tell them?
Lies.
The truth is just gonna piss him off.
Well maybe that's a good thing.
No, no.
Because then I' gonna get the hole riff, about how I'm letting him down
It's just easy if I role with it.
And maybe someone will steal it.
First a little visual warm up?
I'll hold up a card, you name the suit.
I'm gonna go faster and faster.
So, see if you can keep up.
OK.
Diamond.
Club.
Spade.
Heart.
Diamond.
Spade.
Diamond.
Heart.
Club.

Diamond.
Club.

Heart.
Club.
Spade.
Heart.
Did I pass?
No.
But a few people do.
Black harts, red spades?.
Come on, that's like cheating.
Aah, experience has conditioned you, thinking that all hearts are red, and all spades are black.
Because their shapes are similar.
It's easier for your mind to interpret them... based on that passed experience, than open to an idea that they can be different.
We see what we expect to see.
Not necessarily, what's really there.
Children who have never played cards always pass this test.
Makes you wonder how many other things are right in front of you, sight, sound, smell that you can't experience, because you've been conditioned not to?
The good news is ...
If we'll do the test again you will pass.
Once you are aware, that there can be black hearts and red spades, you'll be able to perceive them.
Your brain is wired, just like the Interstate highways system.
It's easier to go from one well to go from one well travelled place to another but the places in between, off the highway ...
Even though they're there, most people just zip right pass them.
Well, that's cool trick
But there aren't any card games with red spades and black hearts.
Well, how do you know?
Mr. Oliver.  I'm Dr. Craig.
You ready to take some tests?
Yeah.
Well, that was some warmer back to you got there, that guy Ray.
Who?
Ray.  You know, that guy, who was ju ...
He just left.
You know, the tricked cards.
No, there is no one on staff, named Ray.
No, he was just here.
Wacky guy, with the cards... with the light-green lab coat.
The staff wears blue here, not green.
But we can test your colour perception.
Dropped seven of harts.
Come on in son.
So, how's that new car?
- Awesome?
- Yeah dad... it's very awesome.
What is on your mind, son?
I'm not so sure about this Bradford thing, dad.
Seams little too easy, you know.
I spent years working very hard, so it would be easy for you.
What? You want to work nights in that warehouse for the rest of your life?
Come on dad, that just so I don't have to ask you for cash.
Son, let me give you some Daniel Olivier philosophy.
And you can take it to the bank.
When ever someone offers you an advantage, take it.
And this program is an advantage.
It will get you to any law school in the country.
America needs another lawyer.
Another good lawyer.
We can always use one of those.
- That was costs 30 Gs ?
I outbid two major collectors to get it.
It's a lot of money for a drop cloth.
That shows you how much you know.
That is Franklin Samuel original.
He's a name artist.
If you ever sell anything, the operative would been if, maybe... maybe... your opinion will count.
Look dad,
I'm just not sure, OK?
I thought about, maybe taking some time off.
Time off for what?
Sort of take stock, you know, try figure some things out.
Waste your time with your art?
It's a hobby son.
Would you live it that?
Look, I got you into Bradford, because Prat's on the board, and he won't be next year.
So if you don't take advantage of it now, there won't be a next time.
Why not just go thru the program?
If you ultimately decide, law school is not for you, then, I'll... live with it.
But at least you'll be Bradford fellow and that's something you can always take to the bank.
Then you can, you know... figure things out.
So you're going Bradford, ha.
- I thought you weren't sure.
- I'm not.
I think it would be stupid, not to at least give it a shot.
Can't let down the old man.
Bought you off with a fancy car?
He's maximizing his options, Frank.
It's very mature.
We should be supportive, not judgemental.
Look for the good in your fellow man.
The warm wind of romance blows around you.
With good health, prosperity will follow.
October 15th.
That's the day of my Bradford interview.
Let me see that.
OK, you got me.
It's blank.
What the hell?
I would never get on that shit, never.
Just, leave everything behind, not know where are you going.
I can't believe that you would Neal.
Just, leave your friends,  and your family, and for what?
Hey, earth to Neal.
What's the matter?
Sally my fortune.
Didn't it say:
October 15th, are you sure?
Obviously it didn't.
At the restaurant, when I showed it to you, isn't that what it said?
Why do you make such a big deal about this?
Because it is bugging me.  That's why.
You're just projecting your anxiety, about your decision, and that is natural.
It's OK. You'll do great.
Because that's who you are.
Here.. Just take a nice deep breath, relax.
Sally, listen to me.
What are the chances?
That of all cookies in that kitchen, that exact one ended up on a plate, that was taken to our table, and I picked it?
It was blank, Neal.
The fortune was blank.
You projected.
I projected?
Right.
That was the politically correct way to say I was seeing things...
Well, a lovely thought.
I worked graveyard shifts at the grocery warehouse, filling orders for the trucks to take to the various stores in the morning.
I liked it for three reasons.
I'd gotten the job on my own.
It paid enough that I didn't have to ask the old man for cash.
And it annoyed Daniel that his son was even working at such a low-class job.
I hear you are quittin’ to become some big shot lawyer in your new fancy-ass car, hmmm?
Well, lucky do.
Hey, Curby.
Get the kid a brake.
You just remember that no matter how hard shit you think you are,
It's always gonna be more the same.
Just another High School.
- High School?
- Hell yeah.
Everything in life is like high school.
They're just changin’ names.
You take this place.
Instead of principle, we've got boss.
Instead of teachers, supervisors.
Instead of assignments, they give us work orders and if you fuck up them work orders, you get fired.
Instead of expelled.
Oh yeah, names are different, but it is exact same shit.
High school.
Damaged goods.
Well, store can't sell them.
Guess I'll just have to take them off their hands.
Is he right, Otis?
Is everything more the same?
Yeah, if you look at it like that.
I mean, look at me,
I show up here, see the same people, take shipment to the stores, see those same people, eat at the same places, see those same people... but not really.
See.
I like seeing those people.
Well most of them any way.
If I want something different,
I can make it different, go a different way.
Eat at a different place, do an Interstate gig.
See I never went to high school...
Look at them.
In the morning they will get up, and go to the store.
And the paste will be on the shelves where it always is, and not one of them will give a moment's thought as to how it got there.
Holy shit.
That's her.
I must have seen her on the billboard, and that's how she got in my dreams.
You dream about her?
Yeah, yeah, Yes.
Pretty silly, huh.
Maybe it means something.
Like what?
Like the thunderbolt, you know, love at the first sight.
Come on Otis, that's just fairytale stuff.
That's how I met my wife.
Spotted her in a crowd at the river front,
4th of July fireworks.
Couldn't take my eyes of her.
Fireworks were up there, but I was staring at her.
And I just knew.
Well. See, all my girlfriends, are always a reaction to the one I had last.
Janet was so opinionated about my art, it drove me crazy.
So I found Sally, who refuses to be judgemental about it.
Meanwhile she's trying to psychoanalyse me.
So she is not the one either.
Maybe you should go after her?
Girl like that. She's a model, she's probably got guys fallen all over her
Guys with big portfolios.
Yeah, I think it's kinda childish idea.
Chasing a dream.
Hi, your billboard on Delmar & Wicker's, the one on the side of the building?
Yeah, whose ad agency is that?
No, no, no... Next to the Casino Queen billboard.
The girl with the phone, says: "There is another choice."
Blank?! No, no It can't be blank.
I was just there.
I just saw it.
No, I just saw it!
Hey, what is the sign on the right said?
What, are you nuts?
It's blank, man.
Neal Oliver.
Your appointment has been scheduled on tomorrow.
September 25th. 10 AM. 555 Olive Street.
Suite 1300.
No rescheduling.
Neal Oliver, your appointment...
- Who is this?
Hello?
Hello?
10 AM. 555 Olive Street.
Suite 1300, no rescheduling.
Morning, Mr. Oliver.
Wasn't sure that you'd actually show up.
Not everyone does.
Ray?
I've got a job for you.
If you want it.
Drive cross country.
Deliver a package.
Right, what the hell is going on here Ray?
Because I'm seeing things on signs...
In fortune cookies...
I mean, in weird messages...
Black Hearts, or red Spades.
I told you, you can see them now.
What's it all about?
It's all about you, Neal.
It's all about you.
Here's the job.
Misspelled Denver.
Did I now?
OK, so why me?
Why not FedEx?
What's in here, any way?
Can't really say.
You can't really say, because you don't know, or you do know, and don't want me to know?
Either way, the result is the same.
So what's this job pay?
Can't really say.
What's the catch?
Or you can't say that either?
Alwayes wanted the answers, aren't you?
Consider it, an interesting way to break in the new century.
Or simply, a way to break in that new car.
Before the Bradford interview.
How do you know about that?
Open it.
Sit down.
Here'e the deal.
If you walk out of here with that package, you agree to deliver it.
You don't loose it, you don't open it, and you don't try to find out what's inside it.
You'll be compensated on the other end.
Go by way of Interstate 60.
Delivery date is October 2nd.
So you'll have time to visit some towns, meet some people.
See what's out there.
Pick up some travellers' tales.
High way experiences.
Episodes of the Road.
This is too surreal.
I mean, you, this office, the 13th floor of a building that has no 13th floor
My alarm clock's gonna go off any second.
Rise and shine.
You're awake Neal.
Could be you're awake for the first time in your life.
It's our standard form.
And I'll need you to seal it with the drop of your blood.
Blood?
Of course.
I'm the DEVIL.
Just kidding.
Tradicionally, a man means what he says, he'll put his blood where his mouth is.
All right.
Oh, one more thing.
There's a killer out there.
So be careful
Now you tell me?
After I sign?
The journey of life always includes a possibility of death.
This killer, what does he look like?
-Who said it's a man?
- It's a woman?
It's not this Robin Fields, is it?
I know... you can't really say.
I didn't mispell the name of that town.
You'll find it.
Just go west on Interstate 60.
Look, we've been over this.
There is no Intestate 60.
There's US 60.
But there is no Interstate 60.
Look... there's got to be.
Well look at here. Here is 70.
The next major route south is 40.
So if there was an I 60, it would have to be some where between 70 and 40.
But, as you can see, it's not there.
It simply doesn't exist.
Where do you find a highway, that doesn't exist?
Well, I decided to look where it'd be if it did exist.
Ray said that you don't find hidden places, by sticking to the well travelled routs
So, I skipped well travelled Interstate 55, and went south on Boob Dylan's highway 61.
And there she was again.
Telling me, I was right.
I was fast becoming a believer in signs.
It's you I'm delivering this package, isn't it?
You're Robin Fields.
Now it makes all sense.
Cool. Very cool.
Very, very cool.
You are the waiter, from my birthday party
O.W. Grant.
Neal Oliver.
It's a strange coincidence, seeing you here again.
Only if you believe in coincidence.
I prefer inevitability.
Every event is inevitable.
If it wasn't, it wouldn't happen.
Right.
Oh, I forgot to give you, your birthday present.
Remember your wish?
An answer.
- Yeah
- That's great.
Yeah, gets greater.
Go on, go ahead. Try it.
Yes or No questions.
OK, hmmm...
Eight ball, is there an Interstate 60?
I told you, it'd get greater.
Who are you mister?
The O.W stands for One Wish.
That's what I do.
I grant wishes.
One to a customer.
Your was more interesting, then most.
Open ended.
Signifies thought instead of greed.
That's what I get most of the time. gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme this, gimme that...
Usually money, or sex, or easy living.
How I deliver.
Yeah, that depends on what mood i'm in.
Eight Ball, is this guy bull-shitting me?
Come on.
Let's find that road.
Now, one young couple wished to be married.
Live happily ever after.
So I blew up their car.
At the church, on the way to the honeymoon.
Another guy. He wanted great perfect sex every day, with his choice of gorgeous women. No pregnancies.
So...
Everyday there is a FedEx delivery... of a skin magazine... box of tissues.
There's the Stop sign.
Turn right.
There is a sign post, up ahead.
Son of a bitch.
I found it.
It was inevitable.
So, I thought all Interstates were divided highways, with limited access.
No, when highway doesn't officially exist.
The rules don't apply.
OK, so how is it, we're on a highway, that is on any map, going to a towns, that presumably don't exist?
Well, there are unlisted phone numbers, right?
So, why can't there be unlisted highways and towns?
I don't buy it.
There's got to be a better explanation, than that.
Better explanation.
OK. How about it's a... parallel dimension.
Or you're in a dream.
Or it has something to do with your wish.
Or... you're in a coma from when that bucket hit you.
Or maybe... just maybe...
You're dead.
Well?
Well, what do you want kid?
I just gave you not one explanation, but six.
All reasonable.
You want an answer, pick one.
It want change anything.
You, you took a job, and now you got to do it.
Yeah, but it could change something.
So, what if I'm dead?
What if I'm dead, right now.
There is no reason, why shouldn't drive on oncoming traffic, right?
OK, go ahead.
Try it.
But that's way you accelerated in way of the big semi, coming at us, which should be in about 25 seconds, I figure.
Come to this.
Now, if you are dead...
Then, this is the after life, and you made a deal with a guy, sealed in blood, who knew everything about you, even what you are going to say, before you said it.
Now who do you think, that guy might be?
And... do you think it is a good idea to piss him of?
Maybe you got a point.
Maybe I do.
Oh, I love this highway.
Me?
I consider myself an artist, too.
I see life, as.. art appreciation.
You know, some artist can't stand the sight of their work once it's finished.
Me, I'm one of my own biggest fans.
And one of my favourites, will be coming through that door... any moment..
Now.
Yeah, can I take your order?
15 double-cheeseburgers, please.
15 double-cheese to go.
Oh, not to go.
I'll eat them here.
Hold the order.
You're going to eat 15 double-cheeseburgers, all by your self?
Yeah.
Why, they are real big?
You think 15 to many?
Way to many.
All right. Twelve then.
Even dozen.
Look, are you drunk or something, mister?
Well I don't know.
Can you get drunk on six beer?
Hay fella.
I've got a hundred says that you can't eat six double-cheese, as much less twelve.
So, what you're saying is, they're really big cheeseburgers?
My hundred says you can't eat six double-cheese.
Well, I'm kinda hungry. maybe you're right.
Twelve is to many burgers.
I'll tell you what?
Make it two double-cheese, three orders of fried chicken, one BLT, two ham & Swiss on rie, chicken fried steak,
Turkey club, and two bolls chilli extra onions.
And one piece of each of those pies.
One piece of each of these pies?
Anything else?
Three order onion rings.
That's much more sensible lunch, than twelve double-cheeseburgers.
Oh, and hold the pickles.
100 bucks.
If you can finish all that food, in one hour.
Without getting up from that counter, and without losing your lunch.
I'm not much of a betting man.
Two to One odds then...
No, no, I'll give you Three to One.
That's 300 to mine... against 100 to yours.
Well, what the Hell.
It's only money.
Hal...
You better hold onto this money.
Sure.
Yeah, I'll take some of that.
Eight Ball, is this guy gonna really eat all that food?
Can I hmm...
Can I get on this action?
Ask him.
No I like long shots.
You're crazy your knees.
My money just ass good, right.
Hell about me.
Sir, you want to drink anything with that?
There's your order.
All right. It's 13:10.
On your mark... Get set...
Wait.
Ketchup, please.
Thanks.
All right... What's the trick?
Trick?
Where is the food?
Can't all be in your stomach.
Actually, I don't know.
The fact is, I always loved eating.
More than anything.
Go into a restaurant, want to order everything on the menu.
But, I was always frustrated, by the small capacity of my stomach.
Well, 17 years ago,
I made a wish...
And amazingly enough it came true.
Now I have, what you might call, a black hole in my belly.
Onely I have to keep eating like this, six or seven times a day.
Gets expensive.
So, I travel a lot, and take advantage of guys like you to pay for it.
That's a good one.
Excuse me, mister.
I've got to know one thing.
Do you still love eating?
No... now it's a drag.
Listen kid...
Nobody minds money taken by that guy, he gave us good show for our money.
But I draw a line over what you did.
What did I do?
I just bet the right horse, that's all.
You run on it. I know a hustle when I see one.
I played a hunch, I swear to God.
I've never seen that guy before in my life
But your friend, there has.
Haven't you fella?
Oh, I wont deny it.
Now, get back the money you stole, son.
Look sir, I won a couple of bets.
If that's such a crime why don’t we call the police.
I am the police.
Sorry about that.
That's all my money.
Hit the rode, fellas.
OK, so what's your game Mr Grant.
'cause it seems like you know exactly what's gonna happen, just before it happens, and it's just like fucking with me!
Oh, don't take it personal kid.
I fuck with everybody.
That's what I do.
If I tie highly recommend it as an unending source of amusement.
And as far as knowing what's gonna happen.
Well... on this highway, the past, the present, the future, the "What if some maybe's, the roads not taken", could all converge, get jumble up.
I just happen to be tuned into it.
That's all.
So what are you?
Like an Angel or God, or something?
Just, picking up certain people to give him a wish?
No... no, just a guy who likes to mess with peoples heads.
I'm a Joker... in life's deck.
But, why do it?
I enjoy it.
You should always find something to do, that you enjoy.
Although I will admit I have been considering a career change.
Job in a convenience store...
Or maybe becoming... a male prostitute.
You're gay?
- You're fucking with me, aren't you?
- Yeah.
Fact is I'm a virgin.
I always will be.
My penis... was cut off in a very weird accident, when I was nine.
Yeah, right.
You want to see it?
Yeah... show me.
Holy shit.
Oh, God...
Oh, let me tell you, the world is very different pace, when you're not constantly thinking about sex. or responding sexually to everything...
Yeah.
I go to guess that'd would be.
Wait, how would you know?
How would you know, what it's like to not have something, you never had?
Now you're thinking.
You'd be surprised, how many people take that statement on faith.
Sounds right, so they just except it.
As I say.
Messing with peoples heads, can be a lot of fun.
You should try it.
Some nice scenery coming up ahead.
Hello then... you're going my way?
If you're going west.
Then, that's my way.
Hey, why don't you hop in the back, because huggy here is gonna wanna take a good luck at me, and if I'm in the front, he'll have a better view.
And if you're in the back... so will you.
I'm Laura.
Neal.
Oh, and that's Mr. Grant.
So, where you going Laura?
Me?
Oh, I'm going to a... find a perfect fuck.
Wow, that's an interesting destination.
Yeah, ever been there?
- Can't say that I have.
- Me either.
But so far the trip's been pretty exciting.
Only, how will you know, when you've gotten there?
That is the problem.
It's actually become my obsession, but you don't need to here about it.
Sure, sure I do.
The first time, wasn't that great.
I'm thinking:
This is it?
This is what all these songs are written about?
I mean, talk about hype.
Second time was a little bit better.
Third time, now that was a hot time.
Forth time, not as good as the third time.
But once I've done it enough to have all these expiriences to compare, just drove me nuts.
I mean, what if the best one was right around the corner?
You know, how much better, would the perfect one be?
So this became my quest.
No, there is times, when wish I've gone to the convent.
But my obsession, becomes your opportunities.
You little stun muffin.
You want to take advantage of a girl that can't say no?
Any guy turned you down before?
Not unless he was gay.
OK...
What number would I be?
But I have got a very, very good hearing about you, and there's something very, very special.
- I think I'm gonna pass, Laura.
- What do you mean, you will pass?
Guys don't pass.
Oh, I'm clean, there is no disease, if that's what you're worried about.
I've got condoms... all best kinds.
Come on Neal... stick it to me.
I'm not doing it. Period.
So, you just.
You are not man enough?
You meet a real woman and you turn in to a wuss?
Think you want measure up, hmmm?
Well, you'll never know, will you?
Because if I don't do it...
I want be number 2000 and whatever.
I'll be number One.
That one guy.
Guy you will remember for the rest of your life.
You stay up at night, thinking about me, wondering,
Was he the One?
The answer is yes.
I am the perfect fuck.
The one you never had...
Perfect on every way...
Look, stop it, stop it...
This is Zen thing, it's amazing...
I've never been perfect in anything before.
Well, you can fuck me.
A mind fuck, and it was terrible.
It was good for me.
What about you Mr.?
I'll bet, you're a real man.
You're man enough to be in my book?
Oh, Hell yes.
Put me down in there.
But I sometimes got little troubles... getting excited.
Let me take care of that baby.
Now, that's a museum you'd really appreciate.
What is it? A bunch of bogus paintings
Stop in Renburg.  Have a look.
You'll find it very... thought provoking.
450 mile to  Danver.
Quarter tank of gas, and no money.
Well, when Columbus set sail, he didn't know if it had any wind.
Stop!
Help. Stop!
Jesus lady...
Help my, please, my son... took my car and run off.  I think he's in Banton.
Will you take me there?
I've got to find him.
Look I'm sorry, but I'm not going that way.
I'll pay you... $53.
It's all I have just take me to Banton.
Help my find my son, please.
You need money.
She shows up.
Coincidence?
All right lady, hop in. I'll take you.
- Thank you
Well, I'll hop out.
You're gettin' in tune with the highway.
Say, that's important.
Good luck Neal.
Hey, wait a minute. Am I gonna see you again?
Always wanting an answer.
Well, maybe you'll find it in Banton.
I'll pay you the rest, when we'll find Philip.
Oh, I'm Susan Ross.
Neal Oliver.
- So, how old is Philip, Susan?
He's my baby.
He's all I have.
He's run away before, but he's always come back.
God I am so scared...
What if I never find him?
- Well, did you call the Police?
- They say I should look in Banton
It's not like I've been a bad mother. it's just... so hard when you're all alone.
We're gonna find him Susan.
We'll find him.
It is illegal to sell, consume, or transport Euphoria,
beyond the city limits, under penalty of law.
Be warned, it is highly addictive.
Even in small doses.
Withdraw from Euphoria, has known to cause injury and death.
All responsible citizens, are urged to avoid this drug at all costs, and stay in the Euphoria-free zones.
Euphoria is legal in Banton, and is distributed within the Banton city limits.
- However ...
What kind of town is this?
 it is illegal to sell, consume ..
Maybe we should talk to the Police?
Come on.
16-year-old, in town with legal drugs, and a rave.
Sorry, but I don't think he'll be at the library.
The next bus to the rave is leaving in five minutes...
The next bus to the rave is leaving in five minutes.
First timers?
Are you aware, that Euphoria is being distributed inside, that it is dangerous, and addictive substance, and it is strongly advised not to partake of it?
Well, how can we not be?
Go on.
You'll need this.
No, thanks.
Don't be stupid.
This is the answer.
This is to everything.
And you really need it.
Susan!
He's over here.
Philip.
Oh, thank God, we've found you.
Please, let's go home.
Chill ma, I am home.
See this? This is the place.
The happiest place on earth.
You can't stay here.
You have to come home.
But Mom!
Who's this?
New stud boyfriend?
Sure can pick 'em.
- You've got school.
- Fuck school.
I've got Euphoria.
Here, try some mom, the best.
Philip.
You can't stay here.
Yo, I'm in legal age here.
I can do anything I want.
I want... Euphoria.
You stole my car.
It's in the impound yard. Take it.
I don't want it.  Eat it.
No, you take me there.
Go away. Leave me alone
Hey, what's a matter with you?
What's going on her?
Hey, now break it up.
Philip come home.
- That's it.
- Philip! Philip! Please come home.
The fact is ma'am, here your son's legal age.
He wants to stay...
He can't be forced to leave.
And...
He wants to stay.
No, they all do.  They're addicts.
But he's just a boy.
He didn't know what he was doing.
Oh, no no.
He knew.
They all knew, that's why there are all those warnings posted all over town.
Yeah, but if this drug is so addictive, why is it legal?
Son...
This town had serious drug problem.
And all the problems that go along with it.
We tried everything.
Punishment for dealing, punishment for using.
More enforcement, tougher enforcement, jail, hell, public humiliation.
But, it all came down to one thing.
Some folks...  just wanna get high.
So...
We came up with a radical solution...
Euphoria.
Synthetic drug.  Potent, legal, and totally addictive, and we warn everyone, not to use it.
But like I said, some folks just wanna get high.
One hit of this, and you are hooked.
And we own them.
Camp controls the supplies so of course we can set the prize, and we made it very affordable.
Live in our camps, eat our food, and ... you know, just do a couple of off jobs, pick up spome trash, mow the lawn, clean some toilets, and you get your Euphoria.
And at night, man... party till you drop.
The thrall is so intense, that everybody pays the price.
It's an incredible achievement, really.
Drug so powerful that it sublimates the sex drive.
You know, how many rapes we had here last year?
None.
Are you saying Philip's going to be cleaning toilettes for the rest of his life?
With no sex drive?
He'll never marry.
I'll never have grandchildren?
It's ironic, isn't it?
Americans fought a war for freedom... another one to end slavery.
What someone would choose to do with their freedom?
Become slaves.
But they're human beings.
They have rights.
They didn't know what they be given up.
They made a choice.
But look at them.
They seem miserable to you?
They live a simple, happy life.
No decisions... no responsibilities...
No problems...
They found their answer.
You so sure, that your life is better than theirs?
It's like they’re animals.
Oh yeah, we're all animals.
Just that, some of us have different priorities.
That's all.
Whatever your priorities are,
Banton is a really nice place to live.
No, it's a nightmare.
Please, I want my son back.
I'll do anything.
All right than.
It comes down to three choices.
One.
You move here to the Euphoria free zone, and that way, you at least have the chance to see him.
Hell, some parents end up having their children work for them.
Kind of perverse pay back.
Two. You go home.
Try to find something else to make your life worth a while.
Or three...
Join the party.
What should I do?
You're smart... tell me what to do.
I don't know.
I guess, if it was me...
I'd want to see my boy.
But he doesn't want to see me.
Oh, my God...
It's wonderful...
I... feel so... beautiful...
I never knew, I can be so... happy.
Well, how about you son?
You want some?
No thanks.
I'll pass.
It's Ives here.
We've got a rookie in my office, and I've short shifted the cleaning gall again.
Send in the zoo keeper.
- Roger that
Well, guess you'll need a hotel room for the night.
Plus, you get... a 300 dollars finders fee.
Finders fee?
Yeah, for her.
You've just increased our labour-pool.
We pay for that, around here.
What's the matter son?
Somebody offers you an advantage... take it.
I took the room, but not the money.
I couldn't.
And even then I didn't sleep very well.
I never got the rest of the 53 bucks, but, given the dynamics of Interstate 60,
I wasn't concerned.
I knew something would be just down the road.
It was inevitable.
What did concern me, was whether something else was inevitable.
Eight Ball, should I be worried about this.. killer?
Can you be more specific?
Figures.
The inevitable something down the road, was 20 miles ahead, and he was quite the character.
What's the deal there, mister?
Hey, Bob Cody.
I don't drive.
And I don't like to hitch-hike.
When hitch-hike, I'm at the mercy of the driver.
But when I pay for the ride, I'm the employer, and I call the shots.
That's how I like it.
So.. you wonna work for me?
Well, I'm going to Danver.
I wouldn't mind making some money.
Good. I'm going to Renburg.
It's on your way.
Here's mine proposition.
You pay for gas, pay for your meals.
No alcohol while you're on payroll.
I pick radio stations.  I initiate all conversations.
I'll pay you ten dollars cash every hour.
And the mileage money, when we get to Renburg.
In all other matters...
You play straight with me, I'll play straight with you.
So, we have a contract?
We have a contract.
So, who is my new employee?
Neal Oliver.
Mr. Oliver, you may call me Mr. Cody.
Or Sir.
You got it, Sir.
He was going to Renburg.
The museum of art fraud was in Renburg.
Coincidence?
I knew then that I'd had to check out that museum.
It was inevitable.
Mr. Cody had rather unique tastes in audio stimulation.
The choice is clear. The Orient 620.
The American made car, for American made drivers...
See, that's a lie.
Orient engines are made in Japan.
Guilt Signal.
The movie everyone's talking about...
That's another lie.
We're not talking about it.
We're the United State's Post Office.
We care...
Oh, that's the biggest whopper of all.
You know, sometimes only that chairman will do.
I get no kick from champagne...
(Frank Sinatra's - Kick out of you)
There's an advert I can't figure.
What's warmer, the weather, the water... girl?
She's pretty, though.
She's Robin Fields.
She's gorgeous.
Sir.
Well, you know her?
Not yet.
I'm meeting her in Danver.
You're a lucky man.
Yeah, to be honest, I'm a little nervous about it...
Cos', you know, what am I gonna say?
How do you start a conversation with the girl of your dreams, without coming off like a total dork?
Don't say anything.
Let her start.
That's, a good idea.
Sit back.
Listen to sweet musical tones of her voice.
Son, you got a bag.
Yes sir, I do.
 I get a kick out of youuuuuuuuuu....

Now there's a sign that's telling the truth, for a change.
Yeah, looks like a motel to me.
No, Frontier... ever hear of
Frederick Turner Mr Oliver?
No sir.
Well, he was an historian.
About a hundred years ago, he came up with the theory about the Frontier.
Said, the Frontier was a... safety valve for civilization.
Place for people to go, to keep them from going mad.
So... wherever were folks, who couldn't fit in with ways things were...
Nuts, malcontents, extremists...
They'd packed up and head for the frontier.
So America got started.
All the crackpots and trouble makers in Europe, packed up, and went to a frontier, which became, The Thirteen Colonies...
When some people couldn't fit in with that, they moved further west.
Which is why all the nuts eventually ended up in California.
Turner died in 1932, so ...
He was around long enough to see what would happen to the World, when we ran out of frontier.
Some people say, we had a frontier in the mind.
And they go off and explore the wonderful world of alcohol, and drugs, but, that's no frontier.
It's just another way for us to fool ourselves...
And we've created this phoney frontier with computers.
Which allows people to think they’ve escaped...
Frontier with access fees...
What about Space?
The final frontier?
Ah, Star Trek isn't Space.
That's television.
Find fuckin' frontier, that is.
Besides, how many folks can just pack up, and go to space?
Naah, the frontier is right here.
Interstate 60.
That's why it was put here.
Give people, who wanted a little different, place to go.
Is that really true Mr Cody?
If it isn't... it should be.
Excuse me... Excuse me...
Excuse my...
Can you help me out mister?
Will work for food, eh?
OK...
Here's an apple, food.
Now, I'd like you washed that man's windshield.
Work.
Hey man.  I ain't gonna wash his windshield for no apple.
Oh, excuse me.
It doesn't say "might work for food",
It doesn't say "restricted menus", it says
"will work for food".  This is food,
That's work.
What's the problem?
I ain't doin' it, that's all.
Now, let's be honest.
You don't want to work.
You just want a hand out, so you can buy booze.
And nothing wrong with that.  Drinking... that's a great human tradition.
And if you'd been straight about it,
I'd bought you some Chevas.
But by holding up that sign.
You made an employment agreement.
Which I intend to hold you to.
Now...
There's the apple, you wash that car.
Fuck you man.
I don't want your fuckin’ apple, so I don't gotta wash that fuckin’ car.
Here's what I think of your fuckin’ apple.
Well, now since you've took my food.
You gotta wash that car.
Wash it.
- Mr. Cody, this is really unimportant.
-Yes it is.
This jerk out here lying in writing?!
I don't tolerate lying from any one!
Especially not in writing.
You!
Watch the damn car.
You, shot the fuck up!
Or I'm gonna cut you.
You all get out of here, now!
I'm gonna call the sheriff.
Yeah, I wouldn't do that.
You see, I've got lung cancer.
I'm terminal, six months to live.
Only...
I'm not going out in a hospital.
It's dynamite.
Enough to take out everything in radius of 150 yards.
I don't take two farts in a martini, if I go now or later.
But if you do, you'd better wash that car.
OK, OK mister... I'll clean it for you.
No!
He's got to do it.
What are you nuts?
Wash the windshield.
Clean it!
Wash the car.
OK, OK! I'll wash it, all right!
Turn it of.
You'd rather call the sheriff, and have that guy shot through the head. He's crazy.
I've got much simpler solution.
Grab your cote, and snatch your hat.
Leave your worries on the door step.
Just direct your feet, to the sunny side of the street.
Say what you mean, mean what you say.
You know, if everybody followed that rule, there would be a lot less trouble.
Now, we still have a contract Mr. Oliver.
Sure hope, you're not thinking of breaking that contract.
Thinking about it?
Yes.
Doing it?
No, sir.
That's a very honest response.
That's a breath of fresh air.
Cigarette?
No, Thank you sir. I don't smoke.
I like cigarettes.
Package says they cause cancer, and they do.
Say what you mean, mean what you say.
Nor, for one, for cigarettes,
I don't know where I'd be today.
I used to be in advertising.
I got paid for lying.
And one day, a little boy died because of one of those lies.
Well, that fried me.
So, when I got my nicotine death sentence,
I decided to make the rest of my time count.
Put and end on some of those lies.
Now, for the first time on my life,
I'm fulfilled, I'm content.
Lung cancer.
Is now without its benefits.
I couldn't decide if he was for real, or bluffing.
Totally sane or completely nuts.
Maybe the dynamite was fake, or the detonator was.
Or... maybe not.
As Grant would say, lots of answers, all of them reasonable.
I did know that I liked it.
That was for sure.
Sunny side of the streeeeeeeeeeeeeeet......

Mister Oliver.
You're one of the best employees I've ever had.
I'm giving you a tip.
And my card.
You ever want to work for me again.
You call that number.
It's mine direct line.
- Good luck with that girl.
- Thank you sir.
The Museum of Art Fraud was only three blocks away.
That Interstate 60 dynamic was clearly at work again.
And my own curiosity was definitely piqued.
Oh, you must be Douglas.
Oh, thank goodness,
I'm so glad to see you.
I didn't think you were coming.
I mean, the agency called to cancel.
I'm Mrs. James. The owner.
Hi Mrs. James...
And today we're viewing the originals, and right now...
I know you're confused...
But if you do as I say,
I'll give you a hundred dollars.
Late Mr. James was most proud of five original masterpieces in this room.
Rarely seen, and per his wishes never photographed.
Monet...Cezanne...
Van Gogh... Renoir...
Degas...
Each is valued in the millions.
No less then Bill Gates and
Warren Buffet have attempted to buy them.
Of course they're not for sale.
Now if we can proceed this way...
Now, take the paintings down very carefully, remove them from the frames.
And then, after that... put them on the easels out here.
Today you're going to be my nephew Edward.
Now, just follow my lead, and go with the flow.
This way please.
Welcome ladies and gentlemen...
Welcome to our gallery of affordable reproductions...
It was my late husband's request,
That none of his five original masterpieces, ever be photographed or reproduced in any book or catalogue.
So, we offer these copies...
Rendered by my nephew Edward.
At the modest cost of $350 a piece.
And if you have any questions, please, don't hesitate... to ask either one of us.
How long did it take you to do them?
How long?
I knocked them out all in a week.
I can tell.
Some of your brush work is rather uneven...
Well, you get what you pay for.
It's decent craftsmanship, perhaps a little slick.
Lacks the artist's sole.
Yeah, but I'm just an amateur.
It's shameful.
Cezanne would roll over in his grave, to see such a mockery of his work.
Well, let's be glad for both our sakes, that he won't see it.
Well, you've heard it from the experts.
You have no talent whatsoever.
Well, I've never been more flattered.
My late husband’s desire.
Was that his masterpieces be owned by people who will enjoy them.
Not trophy collectors.
Thus our charade.
But do you know, in eight years
I have yet to sell a painting.
Why don't you donate them to an art museum?
Oh, upon my death, clones of them will be donated.
Clones?
Oscar was an art collector, dealer.
Technical genius... and a practical joker, and wealthy enough to indulge in his most outrageous whims.
He developed a process where by, he could duplicate a painting almost on a molecular level.
He would borrow a grate master from a museum, and duplicate it, and often send back the copy.
And he was never found out.
A Stary Night... the original.
The one in New York is a clone.
This Monet... the art world thinks that the original is in Paris.
Unbelievable.
So there're all originals?
So what one do, with a collection like this?
You tell everyone they're fakes.
And so, just before he died, Oscar created this.
The Museum of Art Fraud.
The worlds grates art museum.
Masquerading as a cheap tourist attraction.
Oh, my God... that's...
My husband... Oscar Warren James.
Of course.
I must say, I was feeling pretty damn good.
Hell I was feeling inspired.
I wanted to deliver the package, and then I wanted to go out and paint.
And I wished I could go back in time, and enter a piece in Conrad Competition.
But... I'd had my one wish.
And I couldn't look back.
Hot and Cool.
I'm getting warmer, I'm getting colder.
Of course.
Eight Ball, that girl is not in Danver and her name is not Robin, isn't it?
Is she in Morlaw?
So, if I go there, will I find her?
So there it was...
The proverbial fork in the road.
My job. The word I'd given.
The contract I'd signed.
Versus the lovely Lynn.
The girl of my dreams.
Her musical voice in my head, leading me ...
Where?
So what did I do?
I did what any self respecting hopeless romantic would do.
I rationalized.
Five days to go 158 miles.
I got time to chase a dream, right Eight Ball?
Good answer.
Drivers Licence.
What did I do, officer?
Nothing.
You're served.
You're being sued by Mr. J.J. Madison, for your responsibility ... in a hit and run kill of his pat cat Snickers, three weeks ago in front of the Courthouse.
But I've never been here before.
I was in St. Louis three weeks ago.
Tell it to the judge.
I'm just process serving.
Meanwhile I suggest you head to the town and hire yourself a lawyer...
You're gonna need one.
But first... park your car in that lane over there, by the lake, you can get sued for polluting the air.
Hey Mr., I'm really good, check it out
Stanford, class of 88.
Suma cum laude, but more important I know the angles.
You don't need a lawyer.
You need a good lawyer, and that's me.
Parkinson, and that's the only name you need to remember.
These other guys...
- I'm uninterested.
- Valerie McCabe. Year of 91.
I've got special rates for visitors.
And I know I can win your case.
You don't even know my case.
The Madison case?
Happens to visitors all the time.
Fact is, J.J Madison doesn't even have a cat.
He's allergic.
I can have it thrown out in no time.
Wait. He never had a cat?
So why he's gonna sue somebody for it?
Because he can.
What?
Every adult citizen of Morlaw, is a lawyer.
So everybody sues everybody else.
It doesn't matter if there is a cause.
It's how we make sure that everybody makes a living off the profession.
Yeah, but that's insane.
I can sue you for that.
You just made a defamatory remark about this town.
Hey, are you looking at my legs.
I can sue you for that too.
Sexual harassment.
Is there anything you can't sue me for?
Hire me. That way everything between us is subject to attorney-client privilege.
I'm $75 an hour. First hour is free.
Well, at least you know my case.
All right. You're hired.
I’m suing you Valerie...
For the sexual enticement or the appearance thereof of the potential client on the public thoroughfare.
He only hired you, because he found you sexually attractive.
Hurry. My office.
We can get lots a dozen more law suits, just walking down the street.
This will be essential.
Shouldn't make more then a couple of weeks.
Weeks?
No, no, no.
I have to be in Danver on October 2nd.
It can't take that long.
That's not long.
Long is our City limit sign.
We've been trying to get knew one put up for five years now.
But we forgot a file an environmental impact report, and as metal in signpost ... is a potentially hazardous substance.
We're in court over that.
And another lawyer is challenging the census figure on the sign.
And another lawyer said we had to do another land survey to determine the exact city limits, so we know precisely where to put the sign.
So we brought an Surveyor.
But he got sued for smoking, and wasn't enjoined from finishing the survey.
I say we're at least two years, from a new sign.
And you chose to live here?
I wouldn't live anywhere else.
Every day is a new challenge.
A new precedent.
A new interpreting of the law.
It's an intellectual feast.
So if everyone who lives here is a lawyer,
How do you live?
I mean, who runs the grocery store...
Who does your dry cleaning...
Who fixes the shitter, when it breaks?
Well, we all moonlight on a law related jobs.
Police, bailiffs, court reporters...
But those other trivial things, you mentioned?
They're done by people like you.
Awaiting trial.
It's the only way they can afford their legal fees.
Now, I can get you a hearing on Monday October 1st.
Meanwhile...
We'll have to call witnesses, to testify as your character.
You know, Family.
Friends.
So, that you can qualify for your employment program.  It'll help keep cost down.
So tomorrow morning, why don't you get me their names and numbers,and I'll subpena them.
Well, even if they could get here...
Wouldn't they get sued too?
Of course.
But you'll identify them, and their problems will fall on your shoulders, which means more work for me.
I have those phone numbers
They're in my car.
I'm gonna go get them.
And I'm gonna make few calls, and be right back.
No you won’t.
Fred... Mr. Oliver is a potential fugitive.
- Lock him up.
- Lock me up?
Of course.
We lawyers have to protect out livelihood.
Hey, you can't do this to me.
I have rights.
I know you do, sweetie.
I'm here to protect them.
I couldn't even blame the Eight Ball.
It said a meeting was possible.
Yeah, right...
A meteor wiping out Morlaw was possible too.
Probably more possible than ever meeting Lynn.
Lynn!
Over here!
I'm gonna get you out!
I'm gonna get you out!
In order to get her out,
I had to get me out.
But jailbreak, was clearly not happening.
Ditto for a tunnel job.
I needed an answer, and my Eight ball was in the car.
Damn it.
There had to be a way, to blow this thing wide open.
And then I knew.
My lawyer needed a character witness.
I needed a witness who was a character.
Please, state your name and occupation.
Robert Wilson Cody.
I'm... what you might call it an axe grinder.
Mr. Cody... please, tell the court how you know the defendant.
He was my employee.
And how would you characterize him?
Honest. Trustworthy. Intelligent.
Ask him if he's aware that the charge against me is a lie, and that everyone here knows it.
It's immaterial.
He can only testify as the character.
Just ask him.
The judge will pull it immaterial.
You ask him... or I'll fire you.
Mr. Cody...
Are you aware that the charge against Mr. Oliver is not only a complete lie, but that the judge, the plaintiff and every citizen here know it?
Objection! Immaterial.  It has nothing to do with the character of the accused.
Sustained.
Wait a minute miss...  You'rer saying that this is a trumped-up charge...
And you're all in on it?
Immaterial.
The witness is ordered to ignore the question.
Well, I'm not going to ignore it, your honour.
If, what she says is true, that's a very serious matter.
Well, serious or not, it's immaterial to this hearing.
Next question.
Oh, judge, I asked her a question... and I want an answer.
You don't ask here questions Mr. Cody.
You answer them.
And if you wont do what I told you to do,
I will hold you in contempt.
Hey, I'm not answering any more questions, until somebody answers mine.
Why don't you tell me judge... are you in on a lie here?
I fine you 500 dollars for contempt.
Answer my God dam question, judge.
1000 dollars and 90 days in jail.
Bailiff, sergeant,
Put Mr. Cody in a cell.
Hold the go, boys.
This is dynamite.
We'll all go with a bang, if anyone takes another step towards me...
Gentlemen, just drop your guns.
Everyone else, stay seeted.
Judge... stick your finger up your nose.
I'm not kidding.
I'm terminally ill and I'll gladly take you all with me to hell right now.
Judge! I said, stick your finger up your nose.
You'd better do it judge.
I know this buy...
He says what he means; he means that he says.
I'm glad we understand, who's in charge now.
So judge..
This whole deal was a lie.
Is that right?
Keep that finger in your nose.
Yes.
Yes, sir.
Yes... sir.
All right.
Show our hands...
How many here knew that it was a railroad job against Mr. Oliver?
Liers... Lawyers.
Mr. Oliver...
How do we teach these... liars a lesson?
Now, read it judge.
By this order, all legal actions, charges, fines and fees, against any non citizen of Morlaw, in any matter pending before any Morlaw court,
I here by dismissed, and I declare an unconditional amnesty.
Thank you.
Bailiff.
Make a few hundred copies of that, and post it all over town.
You know this is an interesting town...
I think I might just stay here.
Any problem with that judge?
No... no problem.
Sir.
Lynn?
Hi... I'm Neal.
I'm the guy who got you out.
Yo, please to fuckin’ meet you, Neal.
Man, I've been so fucked up in here, for so long,
I thought,
I was never getting the fuck out.
Yo bitch!  I want back my fuckin’ cloths, you cocksucker's confiscated.
I shouldn’t be fuckin’ wearin’ this,
I'm on leash no more.
Hey, handsome...
What you looking at me like that for?
I just didn't expect you to talk that way.
What, something wrong with the way I fuckin’ talk?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I mean, YES.
Yes.
You make Mike Tyson sound like an Oxford graduate.
What do you like fuckin’ dissin' me?
You like saying that I never went to fuckin’ school, something?
Yes... that's exactly what I'm saying...
Don't worry.
It's just an act.
Well, it sort of a test, see.
Guys are always so eager to score points on me they would be like: Oh, no...
Lynn, no, the way you talk is charming.
Unique, refreshing, a breath of fresh air, yeah.
Air from the sewer, is more like it.
Me, I would... never go out with somebody who talked like that.
I'm glad you wouldn't either.
I hope you have a car.
I had to sell mine to pay my legal fees.
I have a car.
So, how many guys did told you that you sound cheap?
You're the first.
You know, you're better looking than I've expected.
Ditto.
Wait a minute... you've been expecting me?
Of course...
That's how the stories always go... the handsome prince rescues princess from the dungeon.
That was the point of the messages.
The messages?
Billboards.
My last name is Linden, by the way.
See, I knew somebody would figure out eventually.
At least that's what he told me.
Who?
O.W. Grant.
See, I made a wish to meet the right guy.
Although if I'd have known that I'd spend a year in jail waiting. Maybe I wouldn't have.
The prince has to undergo tests and challenges, so that the princes will be convinced that he's worthy.
And you passed mine.
So what's yours?
What? My test?
Come on. Everybody has the sympatica test.
Do you cut your grapefruit in half or peal it?
My? I peal it.
Favourite cartoon character?
Spider-man.
Thin or thick cross pizza?
I go for thin every time.
We're three to three.
I can't bel...
OK, Close encounters?
I would get on ship, no question.
What's wrong?
This is just... it's all to perfect.
I mean, you know...
You are.
You know, when something seems too good to be true?
Hold that thought.
You see?
I'm not that perfect.
Right. Right.
I feel much better now.
Ditto.
So, you actually wished for mister-right?
What can I say? I'm human.
Humans have certain needs.
Like companionship.
And you.
Did you wish for me?
Well, actually I wished for this.
Gives my answers.
But are they the right answers?
So far.
This were your billboards.
Obviously, I don't need them any more.
Maybe it's time for the... you know...
Happily ever after part.
Not quite.
I still have a job to finish.
Tomorrow October 2nd Danver.
Danver.
What's wrong?
Grant gave me an envelope.
He said if anyone was ever went to Danver I should open it.
I don't know if these message if for me or you.
Neal... don't go.
I gave my word, to this guy that I deliver this package. I have to.
Eight Ball, should I go to Danver?
Are you serious?
I'm serious.
You mean, you didn't sleep at all?
No, I couldn't.
I was possessed, by the views.
I love it.
- You're not just saying that?
- No.
It's got soul... passion...
Take me with you.
- What about the letter?
- Screw it. I want to go with you.
Eight Ball, should I take Lynn with me to Danver?
Bad idea.
Is that, because it's dangerous?
The killer, does it have to do with the killer?
I don't care if it's dangerous, or what this thing says.
I still want to go with you.
No, Lynn.
It would get me crazy...
I'm not  gonna risk losing you, not after I just found you.
What if I lose you?
Lynn you can't go.
The Ball is never wrong.
I'll come back, I promise.
Eight Ball, I will come back for her, won't I?
Yes.
You will come back for me.
Am I nuts?
The girl of my dreams, and I leave her behind, because of this stupid toy.
- What's up, officer?
- Just got word, there's a killer in the area.
Orders are to close the road.
What's this killer look like?
It's coming over the radio now.
The murder suspect is white, male, last seen driving a red BMW convertible,
along Interstate 60.
This vehicle has a white pains, splattered on the trunk lid.
You best turn around son.
It's not safe for you here.
It was ten miles before my heart rate was back in a double digits, and I can think straight.
Then I realised...
Eigtht Ball, is Lynn in danger from this killer?
Cellular service, is not available in this area.
Beamers suck. Jeep rule!
Oh, shit...
Oh shit...
Damn punks, and their paint again!
Calling the sheriff.
Here watch where they go.
- No, no, no. Please don't call the sheriff
- The hell I wont.
I'm sick of those punks making trouble around here.
Hey, come back with my binoculars!
Eight Ball, am I the killer?
Latest reports, indicate the suspect is carrying a murder weapon in a square box, wrapped in brown paper.
Once again, suspect is carrying a murder weapon in a square package in a ...
Oh no.
Shit!
Eight Ball, is the murder weapon in this box?
Should I open it?
Shit.
If it is a murder weapon,
I'm gonna get my finger prints all over it.
Eight Ball, I really need an answer right now.
What should I do?
Damn you!
Yes or No questions.
Come on Neal. Think. Be logical...
He called the cops...
So, which ever way they're going,
I've got to go the opposite way.
Well, it's got to be one way or the other.
Right Eight Ball? I mean, I got two choices here, so it's got to be one or the other. Right?
Take it to the Bank.
Sorry dad.
No, there is another choice.
Sheriffs and police in two counties have closed up Interstate 60 in both directions
 with the attend of boxing in the suspect, who was last seen driving red BMW convertible,
with white paint splattered on the trunks lid.
I knew this wasn't my kind of car.
What were the chances?
What were the chances, that the killer would be in a car, just like mine, and I get white paint on mine, just like his?
Now Grant would say, it was inevitable.
That at least once in a infinite universe, events would happen that way, and this was that time.
But Grant also said, on this highway, the past and the future, and what ifs and maybes can all get jumbled up.
So, I had to see for myself.
Hey! Get away from there!
Who was he?
They say he was some law student from St. Louis.
Went nuts, and killed his old man.
I love this highway.
Eight Ball, I've got a lot of questions.
Was that guy in the car...
What the hell I'm asking you for?
Robin Fields?
Is anybody here?
I'm here.
Ray?
- Delivery is for you.
- No, no, no.
I wouldn't hire you, to deliver package to myself.
It's for my cousin.
Here he is now.
Robin Fields.
One of my many synonyms.
Cousins?
You set in my car, with your own package.
- Why didn't you take it?
- Well, you made a deal.
What kind of guy would I be if I caused you to... violate your blood oath?
And, besides, it's the fact that you lost all your money... and you went to jail... you left to girl... ditched your car...
All, to bring this to me?
Makes it far more valuable.
Now it has... stories to go with it.
Well ...
Don't you want to know what's inside?
I did before, but... doesn't really matter now... 'cause, whatever it is... won't be as good as the stories.
Well seing as you understand that.
I'll open it.
You're not gonna light it?
I don't need to.
So, how's that new car?
Awesome?
Dad...
What's my favourite color?
Blue.
Why would you buy me a red Beamer?
Red's a great colour.
Specially for a convertible.
You know, my BMW's suppose been a great source of joy to me, so I just thought...
Happy birthday dad.
In the future, if you want to buy me a gift...
Buy me something I want.
Not something you want.
Son... it's a gift...
And if you don't accept it...
I will take it as a personal insult.
Well, in that case we're even.
Because I consider the gift itself, to me and to who I am.
How would you like it, if I bought you an easel and a paint box for your birthday?
I never thought of it that way.
Perhaps I could've given it a little more thought.
Thank you dad.
Apology accepted.
Now the Bradford thing.
I'm not going there.
- 'Cause I'm not going to law school...
- But son?
No buts, Dad.
This is your life, you made it, it works for you.
I've got to find something that works for me.
I'm sorry if you don't approve, but you can take that to the bank.
Well, I don't approve.
And it's time you face the truth about your art.
It's mediocre, look...
Neal... great news.
That piece, you entered in the Conrad Competition...
There's a very interested buyer, who wants to talk to you about it right now.
Come on. I'll take you.
No dad... that thing...
It's crap.
You got ripped off.
And it's upside down.
I must be feeling Alzheimer’s.  I don't remember entering anything into Conrad Competition.
You left it in motel.
I took the liberty of entering it for you.
Thank you, Mr...
Conrad...
Oh, you're welcome mister Oliver...
You're Neal Oliver...
I just love your painting.
Excuse my, I'm sorry...
I've just got this...
Major déjà vu about you.
No, no, no.
It's OK, I did too.
Big time.
I just love this...
It's got soul... passion...
- I'm...
- Lynn Linden.
Yeah, I know.
I'm with Danver publishing, we do.. prints, posters, and art books.
Well, it's maybe a little presumptuous of me, but would you consider doing a serious of motels, cafes, gas stations... all in this style?
It's exactly what I was thinking.
- My brother is really talented.
- Oh, he's gonna be fine.
Just fine.
He's got a great future ahead of him.
They both do.
Say... you have a birthday coming up, don't you?
Well, how do you know that?
Don't forget to make the wish.

My name is Tom Van Allen...
...or Danny Parker.
I honestly don't know anymore.
You can decide.
Yeah, maybe you can help me, friend.
As you can see, I don't have a hell of a lot of time left.
You can decide who I am.
Avenging angel.
Judas Iscariot.
Loving husband.
Prodigal son.
Prince of Denmark.
All of these? None of these?
You decide.
Trumpet player.
Speed freak.
Speed.
That's as good a place to start as any.
But first, a little background on the mad world of the tweeker.
Methedrine was first distilled by a
Japanese scientist before WWII.
Hand it to the Japanese, they knew a good thing when they saw it.
This guy is so tweeked he thinks he can survive this without a scratch.
Maybe not.
By some estimates, 2%of the Japanese had a meth problem after the war.
Factory workers, soldiers, pilots.
That's why it took two bombs to get them to surrender.
A nuclear blast is just a minor nuisance to a determined tweeker.
In the '50s, the housewives got ahold of it.
Dexedrine, Benzedrine, Methedrine.
Now, that's a classic speed freak for you.
Skinny and cleaning house.
Her husband never knew what hit him in the sack.
It's rumored that one of our presidents dabbled with energy shots.
Imagine that, a slammer in the White House.
If it's true, I bet Khrushchev never got a word in edgewise.
By the late '60s, the government cracked down and sent it underground.
Bikers controlled the market for a while.
Now anyone with a chemistry kit and the ingredients can cook it at home.
Ever see a long-haired, tattooed freak...
...buying up all the cold medicine at 3 in the morning?
Take it from me, he doesn't have a cold.
He's a cook.
In his kitchen, you'll find a grocery list of unsavory ingredients.
Drain cleaner, hydrochloric acid, match heads for red phosphorus...
...ether and of course, the cold medicine.
That's for the ephedrine soon to become Methedrine.
This guy is a regular Julia Child.
Problem is, even Julia screws up the bouillabaisse from time to time.
- It's not right.
- You think?
Something's off.
We can do better.
This dude in my CMA meeting...
...he fucked my sister.
- Funny!
- That's fucked.
He's a quantum physicist.
He's telling me about uncertainty.
You never know what a molecule is doing.
When you look at it, it changes, it reacts. Like people.
You wouldn't know what I was doing unless you were looking.
You're so locked in,
I could choke you!
So here's the deal.
We'll do an experiment. Look at me.
Look away. Look back at me.
So that's where I found myself.
No, I should choose my words more wisely.
This is the world I sought out.
The land of the perpetual night party.
Day swallowing night and night swallowing day.
The crank compressing time like some divine piston...
...on its awesome downstroke.
We've been at this for three days.
Or is it four?
Tweekers, lokers, slammers, coming and going...
...swearing eternal allegiance for one another...
...only to wake up realizing you wouldn't cross the street...
...to piss on them if their head was on fire.
Three days.
Or is it four?
I know what you're thinking but don't give up on me yet.
Just wait till I've told my whole story.
And keep your eyes open.
Nothing is as it seems.
- We're out of gak!
- What time is it?
- It's like 12.
- Midnight?
- You okay?
- Yeah.
I would not be into this without you.
How did we get this gig?
- I don't know. Got a dealer in mind?
- Bobby.
- Who's Bobby?
- He'll have some good stuff.
Jimmy the Finn, let's score some gak.
Bobby?
They're coming.
What?
The spiders, man.
But I'm ready for you this time!
Ready for you!
You thought you could fuck with Bobby!
You thought you could fuck with Bobby!
With Bobby you thought you could fuck!
Got that ass, boy! Yeah!
- Who the fuck are you?
- It's me, man. It's Jimmy.
- What can I do for you?
- Couple eight balls ought to do us.
Six. Six.
- I can't breathe!
- You know what? Don't mind her.
Don't mind her, man!
Shut the hell up, goddamn it!
You know what?
I got no vocational skills.
- What the fuck do you want from me?
- Hey, man, take it easy.
- I got no vocational skills!
- Take it easy!
- What?
- Lay off the girl!
What?
What?
Did you bring the plastic men?
Did you bring the plastic men?
Did you bring the plastic men?
No, man.
That's your good crank talking there, brother.
Fucking come on, Bobby!
Come on!
Bobby? Bobby?
That rhymes with....
That rhymes with....
Hobby.
Hobby.
- Hobby.
- Hobby.
- I like that.
- Funny.
Bobby, hobby.
Couple of eight balls, huh?
Six.
I like that. Six.
Excuse me.
I don't mean to impose but I am the Ocean.
Thanks.
What? He's just juiced.
He wouldn't do nothing.
- It was like our own private soiree.
- So far in, we were out!
How do you know you're doing the right thing?
I don't know, like people around you are happy.
They say thank you and stuff.
Just go with the flow.
Come on, brother, power chord!
For the people that don't do drugs or just do them occasionally...
...it's something that becomes your life and you belong.
You finally hit bottom and you know who you are...
...because you can't go any lower.
When you find...
...a friendship...
...that you wouldn't have found anywhere else.
Still and all...
...there's a kind of intimacy with those that can go the distance.
Sometimes you see the world so clearly...
...and you know just what to do...
...and just when to do it.
Just what you should have done and when you should have done it.
L.A. Sheriff's Department.
May I direct your call?
C.I. number DJ6T5KF55.
- Who's your contact?
- Morgan and Garcetti.
- Hey.
- Yo. Got a hot one.
You go, my little tweeker friend.
I don't wanna have this conversation in Crankville.
This the guy?
It speaks, yeah.
- Bobby, hobby, lobby.
- What?
Bobby Ocean.
Cut to the chase.
What's he holding?
He's a tweeker. Definitely gets high on his own supply.
What the fuck is he holding?
Definitely a dealer.
- I am the Ocean.
- Couple pounds, maybe more.
Mossberg pump on the floor.
Cheap-ass MAC-12, fully loaded, safety off. And some knives.
- Any company?
- Yeah, there's a Mrs. Ocean.
Probably won't give you trouble, but could be a black belt.
She was occupied at the time.
Nice job, dog.
Let's take him down.
All right.
- And there was a kid.
- A kid?
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
Goddamn, you are one observant tweeker.
Thank you.
Learned from the best.
And he likes to use the spear gun too, so do be careful.
- I'm touched.
- Fuck you, I'm worried about the kid.
Why didn't you do something?
Want me to do your paperwork?
Know why you didn't do anything?
Because you're a cocksucking, lowlife tweeker. Shithead!
I never noticed your eyes were hazel.
This dude will do anything to touch me.
Take him to Chippendales or something.
Oh, my God. Bobby!
Why are you leaving me?
Bobby? Why?
You need some help?
I was living next to Miss Congeniality and didn't even know it.
Hey.
You left some Chinese-Iooking shit out here.
Thank you.
Sorry I was rude.
I'm just new around here.
Yeah. It's a dangerous neighborhood.
I live across the hall.
My name is Danny Parker.
Colette Vaughn. Thank you.
Danny. Okay.
My name is Tom Van Allen.
I'm a trumpet player.
My name is Tom Van Allen.
I play the trumpet.
My name is Tom Van Allen.
I'm a trumpet player.
That hurts my heart.
What a beautiful composition.
And the performance?
Tom Van Allen is nothing short of dazzling...
...in his interpretation of Miles
Davis' haunting, moody piece.
- Thank you.
- And he has a hot ass...
...with hardly any hair on it.
- Again, I thank you.
- No, I was talking about Miles.
Don't!
What do you think of when you play?
I just think about what life would be like without you.
Let's spend the night here.
- There are no motels here.
- No, no!
Right here on the beach.
Come on, let's do it.
I got us lost.
We should get going.
Okay, we'll stay.
We'll stay.
Trust the system.
I gave you this Bobby thing.
I've done a lot of busts for you.
Put your cigarette out.
We're in church.
Put your cigarette out.
It's disrespectful, smoking in front of the Virgin Mary.
Whatever.
So I work hard. I hate what I do but I'm good at it, you know?
- I'm industrious.
- Yes, you are.
So why does Garcetti hate me?
Come on, man. You can't take Garcetti seriously.
He hates everyone.
He doesn't even like dolphins.
You know that?
I'm not kidding you. He does.
Seriously, the man hates dolphins.
Have you ever heard of anyone who doesn't like a dolphin?
Garcetti is a dolphin-hater.
- Hey, bro.
- What's up?
How are you doing?
You tell him yet?
No, I was getting to it.
What?
Danny, it pains me to have to tell you this, but remember Domingo?
The wetback you helped us put away for trafficking months back?
It turns out that he's connected to the Mexicali boys.
Now his homeys are making a lot of noise...
...about hanging a Colombian necktie on the rat.
You know what that is?
They cut a hole in your throat.
Pull your tongue out through it.
- Fuck you!
- Interesting, isn't it?
You have to take a hike.
Disappear. Protect yourself.
You're not gonna protect me?
I do bust after bust for you guys.
For a solid year.
You're nothing without me.
Over and over, and you'd cut me loose?
Your felony is dropped to a misdemeanor.
Your snitch card is full.
I'll clear it with the D.A.
And you, my friend, are getting lost before Domingo finds you.
Now go. Get lost.
I only deal in high-end weapons.
All stolen, traceable only to original owners.
Glock, semiautomatic, 9 mm.
Tenifer matte finish, polymer grip,
4.5-inch barrel, 22 oz...
...and a 10-round magazine.
I could hook you up with this gun for $350, well below market value.
Maybe you're looking for something with a chrome finish.
A Llama Mini Max .38
Super Auto, semiautomatic.
Satin chrome, rubber grip,
3-dot fixed sights...
...3.5-inch barrel, skeletonized handle, slide release.
Eight-capacity magazine.
I won't lie. This gun is not the bomb.
It will do the job.
That's why you can walk out with this gun for $150.
Looking for power? This gun's got mad power, kick and reputation.
It's the Smith .357
Magnum revolver.
Rubber combat-style grips, fixed rear, ramp front sights, two-inch barrel.
Weighs a feather 21 oz.,
8-shot capacity, double action.
For impact, the Magnum will satisfy all your needs.
These are my guns. All sales are final. All prices are negotiable.
Fuck! Where do you find these people?
The Del Amo Fashion Mall.
Mostly.
Mostly.
What are you gonna do tonight?
What am I gonna do? What are we gonna do? What do you wanna do?
Why do you need a gun anyway?
It's a dangerous world.
Open the door!
- I'm not dressed!
- Yo, Mina!
- Use your key!
- You mad-dogging me, bitch?
No. I was just admiring your boots.
Did you purchase them locally?
Come on! I ain't got all fucking day!
Okay, nice talking to you.
- Yeah, fuck you. Let's go!
- Just a minute!
Come on!
How many fucking times I got to knock on this door, you fucking bitch?
- Did you go through my shit?
- I didn't.
How did you know it was there?
Fucking bitch! What were you doing?
What the fuck were you doing?
Where's my shit?
I put it there? What were you doing?
- Get off me!
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Come here!
- Get the fuck out of here.
- What the fuck?
- Get off me!
Bubba.
Ride them, cowboy.
It's a classy truck.
You like that?
You consider my proposition?
Get in, hoss. We'll talk it over.
Jimmy, listen to me.
I am in dire need of some cash.
You see that?
That is what I am talking about.
What?
You're smooth. You use words like "dire" and shit.
You got language skills, son.
- Jimmy.
- "I'm in dire need of some cash."
Listen.
I want to do a big score with Pooh-Bear.
And you know one of his dealers.
That guy you were talking to,
Big Bill.
- You can get ahold of him.
- Yeah.
Hook me up with him. Tell him
I wanna make a deal with Pooh-Bear.
Listen to me.
Really listen to me, your friend.
This guy is-- Okay.
You are a circle of something that is totally pure and full of light...
...and that is totally smooth and totally wonderful.
And he can't even understand himself.
No one can understand it.
It's just something that has overtaken him.
It's not him.
It's something that is on him.
There's no him in there. And he has this whole thing with his nose....
But he's got the gak.
Yeah.
- So you in?
- Yeah!
Finn's in!
What's the plan?
I got a connection who wants to buy a quarter's worth.
No. Okay. A quarter is not even anything he's in. That's nothing.
A quarter of a million.
Fuck!
Fuck!
What's in it for us?
A 10%finder's fee.
What is that?
That's like--
Twenty-five grand.
You get five just for the ride.
Come on, man!
Roll with the Cougar! Cougar!
Finn.
Might as well put a sign on the car begging the cops to pull you over.
You mean, to throw them off?
Yeah, that's what I mean.
- Where the hell does this guy live?
- Palmdale.
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
On account of his nose.
- You have to explain that one.
- He doesn't have one.
I'm sure it's me.
I'm not making the connection.
The way Winnie the Pooh always got his nose caught in the honey jar?
Pooh-Bear did so much gak they had to cut his nose off.
Now he just has a plastic one. They say he hasn't slept in over a year.
- Bullshit.
- I've never seen him sleep. Seriously.
Have you ever seen
Queen Elizabeth sleep?
No. What, is she a tweeker?
Yes, that's my point.
Get ready, gentlemen!
- Zapruder?
- Ready.
And rolling.
Oswald!
Ready!
- Grassy Knoll?
- Ready.
- And the undeniable Third Shooter?
- Good to go.
Okay, gentlemen, here we go.
Jesus, look, here comes the president now!
That's the president of the United
States, ladies and gentlemen.
Here he comes, waving to the crowd.
Look at the first lady.
She's looking radiant as ever. Lovely.
As they turn the corner into Dealey Plaza.
Here we go, gentlemen.
Get ready.
Get ready!
Steady.
Steady!
Fire! Fire!
That's shooting.
Got a feeling there's a proposition looming here, Danny-boy!
I got a guy, reliable, wants to buy a quarter's worth.
Crank, huh?
- No, glass. The good stuff.
- Glass.
Can you handle that?
Can we talk price?
Make me an offer.
Have a taste of this.
- No, I'm good.
- It's delicious. Have a taste.
I'm telling you, it's good.
Have a taste. Come on.
- Fantastic.
- Secret recipe.
How about 14,000 a kilo?
I only deal in U.S. pounds.
None of that faggot metric crap.
That's around 40 pounds for...
...6000 a pound.
Okay.
We got a deal.
Anything for a dear friend.
40 pounds at 6000 a pound.
If you say so.
I don't mean to be rude but I don't think you're taking me seriously.
It's you who's not taking me serious.
I'm just here to do a deal.
I welcomed you here with open arms. I did.
You're sitting here like some used car salesman trying to lowball me.
I'm not.
I'll tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up.
- I'm not.
- I love this goddamn story.
This dude shorted me $11. Thought I wouldn't count it before I went home.
He was wrong.
You know what I did?
I put his head in a vise.
He's screaming.
You should have heard it.
I cut this guy's skull open with a hacksaw.
I was staring at this boy's brain.
I was thinking, he doesn't need this thing.
Anyone stupid enough to try to jam me up...
...must not have much use for his brain.
So I took it.
I did. I keep it in the freezer.
Every once in a while,
I cut off a slice...
...and mix it up with my dinner.
Or my breakfast.
Ten thousand a pound.
Thanks for your hospitality.
Hang on. Nine thousand, take it or leave it.
I'll leave it.
Eight's as high as I can go.
All right. Eight's good.
Eight sounds good, Danny-boy.
It's where I was going. It's my lucky number. Looks like we got a deal.
You know, you got a lot of nerve.
You got a lot of nerve.
Pooh-Bear likes that in a young man.
Hey, hang on a second!
Wanna stay for lunch?
I got your ass! I'm a dog!
Look at this:
I'm a fucking dog!
Shit!
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.
What does J.F.K. stand for?
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
And he was the president of the United States?
And he was killed?
They assassinated him.
Hey, Danny.
Thanks for not laughing at me.
My wife's pimp knows a guy at Cedars-Sinai medical lab.
He's making a delivery a week from Friday.
Is it drugs?
Better than drugs. It's Bob Hope's stool specimen. We're gonna boost it.
Why in the world would you want to do that?
So we can sell it.
- To who?
- EBay.
A collector. It's Bob Hope.
He's a fucking national treasure.
I mean, exactly. So here's the deal.
This here is the lab.
What is that?
- The lab.
- I mean, what kind of drink?
- A Cuba Libre.
- What is that? Rum and Coke?
- It's irrelevant.
- I gotta be clear on the details.
- Can I taste this?
- No.
Put the lab down and shut the fuck up.
Guys, focus.
Danny, if I let you in on this, the least you can do is pay atten--
It gets frustrating. Focus.
Here we go. This here is the courier.
This dude makes the deliveries on the nose every Friday at 4 p.m.
Alpha team will be in the elevator.
That's Danny and Creeper.
We'll have night-vision goggles, police scanner and two-way radios.
It'll be badass!
Number Two team will be by the stairs.
- That's me and Jimmy.
- Wait a second!
- What about me?
- No chicks.
- What?
- No chicks.
No chicks?
- Got a driver's license?
- Yeah.
- Anyone else have one?
- No.
So you can be the getaway chick.
Or you can be my fluffer.
The Alpha team will follow the courier out from the elevator.
Kujo moving.
Number Two team will cut the courier off before he even gets to the lab.
Facing superior numbers and high-tech weapons...
...the courier will have to comply with our demands.
- Get off it!
- Let go of the sample!
You Outbreak-Iooking motherfucker!
Come on, drop it! Get up!
Here's the beautiful part: the getaway.
Both teams will rappel down the center of the staircase.
Change clothes. Walk out the door like nothing happened.
I'm okay!
Oh, fuck.
Nice.
- Danny, you in?
- I have to pass on this one.
You'll what?
He'll pass! Jimmy, you in?
No, I'm good.
Are you in or you out?
What are you doing out here?
Quincy. Oh, fuck.
My boyfriend kicked me out.
Whatever.
- You okay?
- Yeah, thank you. Good night.
Okay, good night.
- I'd invite you in, you know.
- No.
Why don't you leave this guy?
Not that easy.
Yes, it is.
What's this?
You were married, huh?
Was she everything to you?
Yeah.
That's nice.
You have anyone like that?
Yeah, I've got a kid.
She's staying with my grandma while I get another job.
Well, look for another job.
So where does Quincy fit in?
I had a few medical bills.
You'll have more unless you get rid of him.
Yeah, well, I will.
One way or another, I will.
Bubba, we're good. Pooh-Bear is in.
And you got the 250,000, right?
So let's do it.
Nope.
What nope?
I wanna do a small buy first.
Ten thousand. Cash on the barrelhead.
We'll see how it goes.
No! You said the whole whack now.
This guy is ready. I said you were.
He'll think I'm a liar. It's gotta be now. What's the difference?
I don't know him.
And I don't really know you, partner.
- That's downright insulting.
- You'll have to live with that.
My money, my risk, my rules.
You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.
He won't like this. I'll take it....
You believe this prick, trying to pull this off without us?
Motherfucker.
- Fuck!
- Hey, dog.
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- Hey. Jesus!
You fucking scared me! I thought
I was in trouble for a second.
Quit lying to me.
Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off by yourself?
- I don't know.
- Did you?
I didn't want to do anything without--
You told me to get lost.
I was just trying to do a good score so I could get lost.
I'm supposed to sit around till Domingo kills me?
Who's on the other end?
Pooh-Bear is his nickname.
I don't know his name.
He's a cook and a dealer in Palmdale.
I'll just do whatever you want. I'll call the dude, tell him it's over.
Wrong, pal.
You're gonna roll over on these guys.
- What?
- You don't have a choice.
We can go fed on your ass right now.
Ongoing criminal conspiracy.
Intent to buy and distribute
250 G's worth of crank.
- What's the mandatory on that?
- Ten years minimum.
Yeah.
And believe me, word will go out that you rolled over and snitched.
And that's not good in prison, dog.
That's not good at all.
Holland Dale Monty, a.k.a. Pooh-Bear.
Served five years for beating a pimp to death with a wheelchair.
- That sounds right.
- Here's the scoop.
Pooh-Bear scores dope by ripping off other slingers.
See how lucky you are?
What's to stop him from doing me as soon as I get in the room?
- We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.
- That makes me feel good.
No need to worry.
Do everything by the book.
Pooh-Bear goes down, nobody gets hurt.
What about the other thing?
- Yeah, the menacing silver car.
- Did you check the license plate?
- Brace yourself.
- The Domingo boys?
- It's much worse.
- Don't fuck with me! What is it?
It's a teacher.
The car is registered to a Mrs. Nancy Plummer.
She's 57 years old!
She's been a third-grade school teacher for the last 33 years!
Have you been tweeking with the higher education?
You're getting paranoid.
You better lay off the gak.
Cliff saw you downtown a few weeks ago.
That's how we tracked you down.
He said you looked so bad he barely recognized you.
Billy's a narcotics officer now, you know.
We want to help you.
Look, I know that everybody deals with grief in their own way.
I know how hard it is to find closure.
For myself, I feel I have finally found it in my heart...
...to forgive those people that killed my daughter.
I gave my grief to Jesus Christ and it helps.
I'm really happy that you found some peace. That's good.
I want you to leave me alone.
Do you understand?
Listen.
Nancy has been coming downtown.
I've seen her and it's dangerous.
Just make her stay away, okay?
Turn around.
My guy changed the deal.
I want to talk to Pooh-Bear.
- I'll tell him for you.
- That's his.
Don't say a fucking word.
- Pooh-Bear, what's up?
- He's blue.
We're coming down from a ten-day ride, man.
Pull your pants down.
- You heard him.
- Pull your motherfucking pants down!
- What the fuck you talking about?
- Little Bill.
Put your fucking hands up.
Put your fucking hands up. Come on!
I told you he's a good-Iooking young man. Shit!
You know...
...sometimes a man will do...
...almost anything...
...to get what he wants.
I've done some things.
Introduce him to Captain Steubing.
Hey, now, listen.
We don't have a deal, fine.
I'll just go.
What do you want me to say?
Captain hasn't eaten in over a week.
That and the rabies don't make for a happy badger.
Now, he thinks that you might work for the police.
That's crazy!
Don't impress me. I'm not the one making the accusations.
Address Captain Steubing.
- Go ahead.
- Captain, this is crazy.
I don't know what you heard, who you heard it from...
...but I'm not a cop.
I don't know if you've checked me out.
I don't think he believes you.
Drop your package in the cage.
There's an idea. Maybe put your pee-pee in the hole there.
I'm not gonna do that. Listen.
Come on. Come on, boy.
You better start talking because he's going to get you!
All right! Okay, okay.
If you're gonna say something, you gotta say it now!
Jesus! Jesus!
It's Little Bill!
He was talking shit about you.
He's cutting you out. That's why you guys had trouble lately.
I saw him. He took the money
I brought you. $10,000.
He talked about how you'd lost it.
He's carrying it.
- Shut the fuck up. He's lying.
- He's got your money!
People say things when they're sporting badger food for a pecker.
Right!
Then again, people do a lot of things when they're around money.
- It ain't bad to check it out.
- Come on!
- Just checking.
- What kind of shit is this?
- How do we know if we don't check?
- This is bullshit!
- What is this?
- Little Bill?
It's not what you think, Pooh.
Tell them, man! It's not--
What the fuck was that?
I mean, what was that?!
This was supposed to be a test.
Ten grand.
10,000 worth of good glass and then 250. Fuck.
- You got to take it easy.
- Can I have a glass of water?
I'll get you some water.
Oh, God! Pooh, please!
Dear Mother of God, Bill!
Bill, please!
Thank you. That shit wasn't right.
Can you shut him up over there, please? Shut up!
I've got my sample here.
- I sense a little apprehension.
- No, no. I just....
You're making me nervous.
You're not gonna back out on this thing, are you?
Please don't do that.
That would sincerely hurt my feelings.
Danny.
Danny, are you there?
Oh, Jesus.
If I could just stand here for a moment, I'll be fine.
Sure.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Look at us. What a pair, huh?
Can I try that again?
I can't.
Shit.
You should go.
What's going on?
There's someone else.
Yes.
It's okay. But I still owe you for a cup of coffee, whenever--
No, wait.
Don't go.
I want to talk.
Tired of lying.
What you want to do is you wanna go back the way you came.
Make a left at the bottom.
It'll take you back to the highway.
That's it?
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
Sure. Go past the TV, turn right, it's the first door on your left.
- Do you mind?
- Make it fast.
Let's go.
I could have done something.
They would have killed you too.
I could have fought.
I could have died.
I'm dying now.
You're not dying. You're right here.
Listen.
I want to do something good.
I want to help you with Quincy.
You can't help me with Quincy.
Yes, there's something I can do.
Come on.
Here, take this.
I can't take that.
No, it's not what you think.
This is my pager number. Take this bag and hide it where he can't find it.
When you know he'll be there a while, page me, then leave.
Why?
Some guys will take care of him.
You won't see him again.
- I don't want to do this.
- They're cops.
I work with them. I messed up.
You can fix this.
Do it for your daughter.
Yo, man, I ain't got nothing!
Get these cuffs off me!
- Bubba.
- Yes?
- You got the money?
- Yep.
Okay.
Make sure you come alone because
Pooh-Bear doesn't like surprises.
I ain't an idiot, asshole.
See you tonight.
A man of few words.
What's up? You nervous?
Are you clowns watching my back?
Make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
We don't want to accidentally shoot you.
- How did it go?
- You tell me.
You ready to go meet the team?
Well, get in, hoss.
For those of you who don't know, this is Tom Van Allen, a.k.a. Danny Parker.
A year ago, Mr. Van Allen's wife was murdered...
...in a meth lab out near the Salton Sea.
No one was ever apprehended.
Local authorities assumed it was a home intrusion by rival drug dealers.
Until Tom took it upon himself to conduct a one-man operation...
...at great risk to his own personal safety.
- He's a civilian?
- Yeah, he's a civilian.
How did you pull this off?
- You saw one of the perpetrators?
- No. I was in the bathroom.
In the house? What about the house?
In the house.
Did you see a hair color?
They had masks on. I didn't see....
Forensics found this red hair on your wife's body.
That's how it started.
We'd stopped for gas at the Salton Sea.
I had seen a man with red hair.
It was the ring that drew my attention.
I knew the ring.
- What is it?
- Nothing.
- Why didn't you tell him?
- I wanted to find him myself.
- I wanted to kill him.
- What about the ring?
It was a college ring.
Central Valley.
Where my father once taught music.
I tracked him to the
L.A. Sheriff's Department.
I would have killed him right there but I had to be positive.
Even if Morgan was involved,
I had to be sure about Garcetti.
So I became Danny Parker.
Oh, shit!
Son of a bitch!
What the fuck?
I dropped myself right in their laps.
Morgan.
Well, well, well.
I was a perfect rat.
I did whatever they wanted, gave up whoever they asked for.
But I knew I had to go further.
I had to get closer.
I needed a big buyer.
It had to be a perfect setup.
One that I knew they would hit even if they didn't include me.
- But it never happened.
- That's when he called me.
We had a C.I. call Morgan and Garcetti with an anonymous tip about it.
You believe this prick, trying to pull this off without us?
Motherfucker.
I dumped a dummy file into the system.
We got the 411 on your boy. Appears to be a major trafficker in Texas.
Jumped bail on a murder charge last April.
Murder? Beautiful.
Pumped 57 slugs into a police informant.
They took the bait and we were off.
This is bullshit.
This guy's a fucking rat.
How do you know you're not jamming two good cops?
All you have is one red hair.
It's still your only evidence.
Not anymore. We tapped their phones and computers at the sheriff's office.
Morgan and Garcetti have not filed one report on this deal.
They haven't coordinated with Palmdale
P.D. They're keeping it off the books.
It looks like we got the right guys.
We'll find out for sure tonight.
They called me a fucking rat.
They don't believe me.
Get Pooh-Bear to meet at the Tropic
Motel. Everything will work out fine.
Oh, come on now.
You are doing the right thing.
I don't see you have any choice.
You wouldn't have stood a chance with those boys.
I need you to do your part. And I give you my word that I'll do mine.
I'm counting on you.
Catch.
It's $10,000.
What I want you to do is worth more but it's all I could get.
You only owe me five. That's not till after we close the deal tonight.
I don't want you to come with me.
I want you to do me a solid instead.
- Okay.
- Let me tell you what it is first.
It doesn't matter. I'll do it.
And you don't have to pay me.
- Why?
- Like, you're my best friend.
I'd do anything for you.
- Wait.
- Listen.
Are you ready? Come on, be ready.
- Listen--
- Check that out.
- What is that?
- It's you.
Check it out.
I didn't have a picture so I described you. Good job, right?
You like it?
- It rocks.
- Seriously?
- I know it's a little weird. It's not?
- You're insane.
My God, it will be so fucking A-plus after tonight. Seriously.
We'll lay out a mile of crank.
You start at that end and I start at this end.
- Quit that shit.
- What?
I quit, Jimmy.
I came over here to tell you
I'm going straight and to say goodbye.
What?
Will you sit down?
Look, I'm not a dealer, okay?
Hey, just chill.
Seriously, it's okay, Danny.
I'm not Danny!
I'm sorry. I'm not Danny, okay?
Are you listening?
I'm not Danny Parker.
I became Danny Parker. He's a rat.
He.... I'm not a dealer.
Everything I've ever said to you is a lie.
I'm a rat.
But I became a rat for a good reason.
- What's the reason?
- I can't tell you.
Why not?
Why not?
Because you don't trust me.
- No, Jimmy, no.
- You don't trust me.
Everything, like, everything that you said is a lie. Right?
And you're not who you say you are.
And you're like-- What the fuck is that? You don't like me!
No, that's not it.
That's not it.
That's not what I'm saying at all.
You're my friend, okay?
You're my only friend.
I wasn't lying about that.
But all of what I've done is for this plan, okay?
It didn't work.
I'm just trying to make it right.
I really need your help.
But I understand.
What do you want me to do?
I'm on my last smoke.
I gotta pull over and get more.
A pack of GCPs.
This is the Red Team.
We're in position.
All right, people, heads up.
- How are you doing, Joe?
- Copy. I have a visual.
Okay, it's all yours.
Keep it safe, please.
- It's about a half-hour till kickoff.
- Pooh-Bear needs a little landscaping.
Any word from Pooh-Bear?
You okay, hoss?
What in the hell?
Danny told me to tell you he was sorry...
...and that he was gonna take care of things himself.
Goddamn it.
Our boy's a 97.
Where is Bubba?
Maybe he's not coming.
Shit.
Danny, what the fuck are you doing?
Where's the money?
Tell me he's got the money.
Yeah, our friendly is definitely handling the cash.
Ready?
Let's do it.
I can't get little piglets out of my mind.
I think of one in particular with cutout crotch panties.
What's happening?
- He's clean.
- It's high card, boys.
We gonna do a deal?
High card wins, gentlemen.
On three, boys.
- Three. I got a queen of diamonds.
- Shit.
Suicide king of hearts.
- You're the man.
- Yes, I am.
- I'll take a piss.
- All right.
- What are you playing?
- Hole in the head.
Don't you want to play for real money?
- Fucking asshole!
- Skipper, goddamn it! Calm down.
- Get yourself a beer, boy!
- You stupid motherfucker.
He's a little upset there.
Here we go. Look at this.
Look at this here. Good job, Danny.
That's a lot of money there.
Jesus. It's enough to make you weep.
Bill!
Bill, you ought to come in here and see this!
Bill! It's a hell of a lot of money!
That's just really beautiful.
Hot damn!
Damn it! Shit!
Hell!
When are you gonna go away?
That's okay.
That's how it's gonna be.
That's how I'm going. I'm going.
I could be....
I could be a cowboy if I only had a half a chance.
I'm just a little boy on a goddamn rocking horse, that's all!
That's all right, that's all right.
That's okay.
I know, I'm just a little boy.
That's all.
That's okay.
I'm fine!
Just a little boy on a rocking horse.
Ain't no big thing.
No big thing at all.
I'm gonna be all right.
Jesus.
That's all.
That's all you get, cowboy.
Goddamn!
All clear!
Did we all end at the same time?
It's okay.
It's okay.
Fuck.
Danny.
- My name is Tom.
- God!
- Tom Van Allen.
- Jesus!
Jesus! Okay, okay.
Whatever you say. Whatever you say.
What are you doing? Come on.
Look at me and talk to me.
You're lost. The Salton Sea.
You're in a bathroom.
You're shot in the shoulder.
Your wife is about to be murdered by two thieves with ski masks on.
Jesus.
Do you crawl out and die with her?
Do you stay? What do you do?
I don't know.
- Answer the question.
- Oh, God!
- Answer the question.
- I don't know!
- What do you do?
- Jesus.
Do you die?
Or do you fight?
I couldn't have known.
I couldn't have known.
God. I don't know what you want me to say. I just couldn't have known.
Tell me.
I would....
Please don't do this.
- I'm sorry.
- She was so precious.
- You shouldn't have killed her.
- I'm sorry.
- You shouldn't have done that.
- I didn't know.
You shouldn't have done that.
What do you do?
Does that answer your question?
I fight.
I fight. And I die like a man.
You. You've lived your life like a punk.
You're a coward.
And now you're going to die like one, huh?
- Smith .357.
- Rubber combat-style grips.
Fixed rear, ramp front sights, two-inch barrel.
Weighs a feather 21 oz.
Eight-round capacity.
Or did I say nine?
Which one is it, mister?
Eight or nine?
It's a pretty big fucking difference if you ask me.
It doesn't matter.
- What?
- It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter. It's too late.
Eight.
My name is Tom Van Allen.
I'm a trumpet player.
No. Your name is Danny Parker.
You're a motherfucking rat.
No!
- What's happening?
- I'll tell you what's happening.
The fucking cops came.
They didn't find shit.
Their fucking rat gave them the wrong information.
Fuck with the Mexicali boys, that's what you get.
Domingo figured you were the one that ratted on him. Guess what?
I brought a fucking rat of my own.
You set me up?
Man, that fucking bitch played you like a squeezebox, Romeo.
- They've got my daughter.
- She had no fucking choice, man.
She took a good beating for you. I've seen men crack after half of that.
- I'm so sorry.
- One tough bitch you got there, huh?
- It's okay.
- I'm so sorry.
It's okay. It's okay.
Let's go.
- I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
- Now!
Let him burn, bitch.
So who am I?
Who am I after all is said and done?
Tom Van Allen or Danny Parker?
Avenging angel or plain old Judas?
I don't know.
You decide.
I'm too tired.
You decide.
Oh, shit, what is this?
Am I dead?
Linoleum?
This must be hell.
Oh, no, what a clich?
I've had some time to think about it and it's pretty simple after all.
I think it's like the man said,
"Man is the measure of all things."
I should know. I ran the gamut.
Tom Van Allen got his revenge.
Good for Tom.
And Danny Parker? He got gut-shot for being a lowlife rat.
That sucks for him.
As far as I'm concerned, they're both dead.
So who is this guy?
Tell you the truth,
I still don't know.
But I like his chances.
I really like his chances.
Jesus!
Are you still there?
No, I'm back.
I'm not sure I got the spelling.
It is a "Y" Okay, great.
Yes, thank you. Bye.
Honey, you there?
Pick up, pick up.
You're not there. Okay.
Look, it's a little after 6:00.
I'll catch a ride and see you out there. Bye.
- Jack.
- Yeah?
The Balkans peace council is "comprised" or "composed" of ten members?
Twelve members.
Oh, right. Thanks.
Composed.
What?
A three-block area has been evacuated.
You might wanna avoid that route coming home from work.
- What do you think, Cy?
- This'll make them sweat. It's good.
- I'll lead with it.
- Great. I'll see you Monday.
What?
- I gotta go.
- Come on, John.
It'll look bad, my star reporter not showing up at the Christmas party.
I can't.
Mary's waiting for me.
It's a big house, isn't it?
It's a steal at this price.
That's if you want it.
But we're gonna have to make an offer today.
The owner's highly motivated.
Think it over.
I'll make some calls.
Take a look around.
Okay.
Thank you, Brian.
Thank you very much.
It's okay.
We're just gonna look.
My God.
Here you are.
We were just making sure there was adequate closet space.
Good. Good.
Well, this house is yours if you want it... but you have to decide right now.
We'll take it.
Really? Oh, my God!
You know what I kept thinking when we were looking at that house?
That we should get a mattress for that closet.
I kept thinking that it felt like a dream come true.
Come here.
- How fast can you drive this thing?
- Really fast.
Let's see.
Okay.
- We bought a really, really...
- Excuse me. We bought a house.
We bought a big house.
Mary.
Mary, are you all right?
Mary, talk to me.
Are you okay?
Can you hear me?
Jesus Christ!
Hold on, darling.
911, there's been an accident.
Yes.
Nothing.
You okay?
Yeah.
All right.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's just me.
You didn't see it, did you?
See what?
What did you see?
I didn't see anything.
There's something wrong with me.
It's called a glioblastoma.
It's a temporal lobe tumor.
According to the doctor, it's extremely rare.
One in...
600,000 gets this thing.
Did they say it was a result of the accident?
No, it turns out... that it's been there a while.
There's nothing else they can do?
They did the surgery, and they couldn't get it all out, so they'll... keep her on the chemo... as long as her strength holds out.
That's working.
I think she's looking better now.
Good.
That's good.
Two weeks ago... we were house hunting.
One day you're just driving along in your car... and the universe... just points at you and says...
"Ah, there you are, a happy couple.
I've been looking for you.
I've been looking for you".
I'm sorry.
For what?
For all of this.
I feel like
I ruined everything.
You didn't ruin anything.
Not a damn thing.
I want you to be happy.
You didn't see it, did you?
Yes.
Yeah?
She knew.
What?
She was drawing angels.
It was the meanness of the campaigns... the almost complete lack of candor and honesty... that turned the voters off..
I think that these parties are demonizing each other.
They're projecting our own personal fears and anxieties... onto the national stage.
People don't like it. People are very, very unsatisfied at the moment.
It makes them complacent because they don't see any possibility of change.
2004... Is there a dark horse candidate out there for the Democrats?
Well, I'm hearing a lot about Russ McCallum.
- Governor of Virginia.
- Yeah, he might do what Carter...
Hey, I told her to watch.
Who?
Peter's friend Gwen.
She'll be there tonight.
Oh, God. Look, I don't think I'm gonna be able to make that one tonight.
Come on, you can't keep blowing this thing off.
I'm not. I've got an interview with the governor.
I gotta be in Richmond at 8:00 in the morning.
I almost forgot.
McCallum's office called.
They bumped the meeting till tomorrow night.
Eddie, look, I...
Look... she's not Mary.
Not by a mile.
But you know what?
No one ever will be.
Hey, Ed.
I'm sorry about today.
I'm sure Gwen is very nice.
Maybe some other time.
It's about 1:00 in the morning.
I'm a little wired, so I'm driving down to Richmond tonight.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Bye.
Al I right, come on.
Hi. I'm sorry. I know it's really late, but my car broke down just up the road.
I wondered if I could use the phone.
Hello.
It's him.
I been waitin' for you.
You son of a bitch.
What are you doin'?
Get the door! Get the door!
Just stay right there.
Mister, I don't know who you...
Shut up!
Shut up.
Honey, Connie's here.
Well, hey, Gordon.
How you doin'?
Okay, why don't you just... put down the gun and tell me what's going on here.
Yeah.
He's come around three nights in a row.
This son of a bitch is stalking us.
- I'm John Klein. My car broke down...
- Let's let Gordon finish, Mr. Klein.
Two nights ago... at 2:30 in the a.m., there's a bang on the door.
I open it up, and here's this guy.
He says he wants to use the phone.
But there's something creepy about him... so I tell him to get lost.
Last night at 2:30 on the dot, guess who's back.
You're sure it was Mr. Klein here?
I am absolutely positive it's Mr. Klein.
- Crazy. This is...
- I am not crazy.
- I didn't say that you...
- So then what happened?
I warned him off my property.
I used the word "trespass", and he still came back.
You're lucky I'm a Christian, because I had the right to shoot you on my porch.
He'd have to been inside the house, Gordon.
What?
Fine.
So tonight I figured the dumb fuck might come back, and sure enough, there he is.
It wasn't me.
I don't know what's happening here.
Something's very wrong here.
I don't know these people.
I have never been here before.
I'm from DC. Look.
It's a wallet, okay? Wallet?
I'm from DC.
My name is John Klein.
Washington Post.
Yes.
Can I get out of this shower now?
You can wait for me outside,
Mr. Klein.
We'll run a check on him.
Anyone else comes by, forget the gun.
Just call me.
Just find out what he wants.
So, you didn't actually see the guy before tonight?
No.
But I heard the knocking.
Three nights in a row.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
I'm gonna give you a ride into town, unless you wanna sleep in your car.
I can call for a tow in the morning.
You're a long way from DC.
What are you doing here?
Driving through.
We're not on the way to anyplace, Mr. Klein.
I recognize you.
DC Review.
- You watch that?
- We're not all bumpkins.
So I'm not under arrest?
You didn't steal anything.
You didn't hurt anybody.
No breaking and entering.
You've had trouble with him before?
Gordy and Denise? No.
They're good people.
Things have just been a little strange around here lately.
You still haven't told me what you're doing here in the middle of the night.
I don't know.
Where am I?
Think you could show me where we are on the map here?
We're right on the state line.
With Ohio.
- What time did you leave DC?
- 1:00 in the morning.
If I was doing 80 the whole way, it would've taken me six hours to get here.
- There's gotta be a logical explanation.
- I don't know.
By the way, don't worry about your pal the governor. I'll take care of it.
Yeah. Okay.
Thanks, Eddie.
- So?
- It's running fine, Mr. Klein.
- Can't find a thing wrong with her.
- Really?
Strange.
- All right, what do I owe you?
- Nothin'.
I said I can't find anything wrong with her.
Mr. Smallwood.
Mr. Smallwood...
I just wanted to apologize for that misunderstanding we had last night.
Are you sure it was me that came by the last couple of nights?
Listen, mister.
Connie called me.
She told me that you check out, and that's good enough for me.
I'm perfectly willing to let it go.
But I don't drink anymore... and I don't lie.
And as far as I know,
I'm not crazy.
So if you're accusing me...
Look, here's the thing.
I don't know how
I ended up here last night.
I didn't even know
I was in West Virginia.
Some how, between 1:00 and 2:30...
I traveled 400 miles and ended up on that road by your house... and I've got no memory of it.
And you call me crazy?
I was afraid I'd see you here.
Okay.
You didn't show up.
Too bad. I really wanted to know what I look like.
Sergeant, I'm curious.
Last night you said... things had been strange... around here lately.
- What kind of things?
- You really don't want to know.
Now I really need to know.
Just your odd reports.
People seeing things they can't explain, so they all come to me.
'Cause you're the cop.
Because they know me.
You know, if there are other people in this town... who are feeling as... confused as I am right now...
I'd sure like to hear it.
The past few months, people have been coming up to me... and reporting that they've been seeing strange things.
I don't mean the town speed freak.
I mean good, honest, church going people.
I've known these folks my entire life... and they seem down right embarrassed to be bringing it up.
Bringing what up?
It's hard to explain.
Weird lights, strange phone calls, you.
Seeing a UFO is one thing.
What do you do when someone tells you they saw this in their backyard?
What is it?
My wife died two years ago.
She saw something.
Drew pictures.
Who showed you this?
It was right here.
There was only a foot or so between its head and that branch.
That makes it about... eight feet tall.
Yeah.
I was getting ready for bed and just happened to glance out the window.
At first all I could see... were these two red eyes.
I kept looking at it.
I couldn't stop.
I've never had that feeling before, like I couldn't move.
And then I guess it just... took off..
That may not make much sense, but it's... the only way I can put it into words.
You didn't see it, did you?
It started about two months ago.
Every time I answered the phone
I'd hear it.
The first one was just a loud beeping noise.
Now they're mostly these creaking, howling sounds.
They all like this?
Well, once it was a man talking really fast.
- What'd he say?
- I couldn't make it out.
- Some foreign language.
- Have you had the line checked?
I even had our number changed.
But before I got a chance to give it out to anyone... the calls started again.
It's not a question of believing them.
Like I said, they're honest people.
- How long you lived here?
- My whole life.
- I grew up right over that hill.
- On a farm?
Shucks, no.
A real live house.
Indoor plumbing and everything.
Sorry.
We even had shoes for church and schoolin' and stuff.
All right, all right.
Where the hell are you?
I'm still here.
- West Virginia?
- Yeah.
Something's come up.
You're kidding. Something of national interest in West Virginia?
No, scientific.
I'll tell you about it later.
Cy's beginning to look rabid.
Keep him at bay, okay?
Are you okay?
You sound a little stressed.
No, I'm fine.
I'll talk to you later.
We were parked up here... and sort a making out in the back seat.
And what happened next... is sort of hard to explain.
Next day...
I woke up and... both my... my eyes were swelled up.
What did the doctors say?
He couldn't explain it.
See this one here?
It ain't never healed.
We're getting engaged.
That's good.
- I gotta talk to you.
- Okay.
Last night I woke up... with the worst headache
I've ever had in my life.
I went into the bathroom to get some aspirin... and I happened to look in the mirror... and...
I swear to God...
I see something...
I can't describe.
But it sure as hell... is not my reflection.
And then...
I hear... this weird... howl... coming out of the sink.
And there's a voice.
It's a voice... and it's saying...
"Do not be afraid.
Ninety-nine will die.
Denver Nine".
I even wrote it down.
He just keeps saying the same thing over and over for an hour... and then it stops.
And when I wake up this morning
I look at this piece of paper... where I wrote down the words... and this thing is on it.
I did not draw that.
- Gordon?
- What?
Gordon, you... your ear's bleeding.
What?
This CAT scan is clean, Gordon.
No sign of any physical problem.
Are you sure?
Because this man's wife had a tumor.
What you had, Gordon, was a first-class migraine.
- I can write you a prescription.
- That'd be good.
- Thank you, Doctor.
- There were other symptoms, Doc.
He had hallucinations, heard voices.
Aren't they both associated with glioblastoma?
I see nothing here to suggest... something as exotic as glioblastoma, Mr. Klein... but if you'd like I can refer
Mr. Smallwood to another neurologist... for a second opinion.
- He's wrong.
- No, that'd be fine.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Wait. Wait.
He's not wrong.
Nothing's wrong.
Nothing's wrong.
He's not wrong
'cause there's nothing wrong.
There's nothing wrong.
You go to a doctor with a bleeding ear and he tells you you got a headache...
Yes, well, you're not sick, so that is good news.
I wish I was sick. Then I would know why this is happening.
You shouldn't say things like that.
What should I say, Denise?
I'm hallucinating.
I'm hearing voices.
Was your wife hearing voices before she had her tumor?
No.
13 News is headed to the scene, and we'll have a live report in minutes.
Again our top story, Domain Air flight 9 out of Denver has crashed.
An airline representative is expected to make a statement shortly.
There is no confirmation... but all 99 passengers and crew members are believed dead.
Wow, man.
Could I speak to
Alexander Leek, please?
- This is Leek.
- Mr. Leek, this is John Klein.
I'm working on a pretty strange story.
I was hoping you might be able to help me out.
I'm particularly interested in your theories on precognition and prophecies.
Anything you want to know is in the book.
Yeah, but the chapter that you have on the entities you call...
Were you contacted... or are you pretending to have a professional interest?
Yeah... No.
I'm a reporter for The Washington Post.
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Klein.
I don't work in those areas anymore.
I don't understand.
To hear a voice is one thing... but this isn't just a message, it's a prediction.
It came true.
These things Gordon's having, are they dreams or hallucinations?
The way he describes them, they sound like dreams.
I don't know.
He believes they're real.
I had a dream like that.
Yeah?
It was nighttime... and I was in the middle of the ocean.
I was trying to swim, but I was too cold.
I kept looking...
I kept looking for something... to hang on to.
And there were presents... floating all around me.
They were wrapped up.
They were tied with bows.
I tried to grab on to them, but they kept popping away.
And then I started to sink... like a stone.
There was nothing I could do.
I was falling.
But it felt good.
I was letting go.
I was letting myself go... and... all I could see... was black... and all I could feel was the darkness above me... and the lights... coming from below.
I knew I was dying.
And then I heard this voice, like somebody whispering in my ear.
"Wake up, number 37".
And then I woke up.
What do you think that means?
Number 37?
I have absolutely no idea.
I met him.
The guy who told me about the plane crash.
You met him?
Yeah.
I met him.
Last night, coming home from work about midnight.
I'm driving past the cement plant... out by the chemical factory.
Right.
Something happened.
Bright... flash.
Lightning.
Something... encircles me.
Everything's kind of hot.
I feel like I can't catch... catch my breath.
He looked human.
But there was just something... wrong about him.
That's when I heard the voice.
The same voice that I heard two nights ago.
He said...
"Do not be afraid.
My name... is Indrid Cold".
And he said to me...
"In a place this size.
Equator.
Three hundred.
Three hundred will die.
Wait for me.
I will return.
I will see you in time".
And that was it.
It's a little...
Have a look.
She knew.
I didn't see anything.
You want to hear the chief's latest phone call?
Yes?
- Thank God you're there.
- Gordon?
I know I sounded crazy the other day, but things are getting weird out here.
Slow down, Gordon.
- He's here.
- Who's here?
Indrid Cold.
He's standing right next to me.
Get over to Gordon's right away.
He says Indrid Cold is there.
Gordon, let me talk to him.
Sure. Hang on.
Hello, John Klein.
Who is this?
My name is Indrid Cold.
Unless, of course, you're Gordon Smallwood.
Your father was born in Racine, Wisconsin.
He lived in a green house on Monroe Street.
You don't remember how your mother looked.
Okay, you got my attention.
- Where's my watch?
- In your shoe.
Under the bed.
Very good, John.
Thank you.
What's in my hand?
Chap Stick.
You're reading my mind, aren't you?
Did you read my mind?
I have no need to, do I?
What's the third line of page 51?
"A broken smile beneath her whispered wings".
Still more proof, John Klein?
What do you look like?
It depends on who's looking.
I want to meet you.
You already have, John.
I have seen you afraid.
You're afraid right now, aren't you?
Can I ask you something?
Why ask me what you already know, John?
What happened to my wife?
You were there.
Mary Klein cannot be found by looking.
You will see her in time.
What's up, Connie?
Everything okay?
Did you just call John?
I've been asleep since 9:00.
Unless, of course, you're Gordon Smallwood.
See? It's sticking up here around 1,950 cycles per second.
But it never gets any lower than maybe 1,930 or so.
But yours is way down here in the normal vocal range... anywhere between 1,000 and 1,200 cycles per second.
Okay, so this guy's vocal range is much higher than mine.
What makes you think it's a man?
Still more proof, John Klein?
What is it?
Near as I can tell, it's... an electrical impulse.
But whatever it is, it's not coming from human vocal cords.
Why ask me what you already know, John?
What happened to my wife?
You were there.
Mary Klein cannot be found by looking.
You will see her in time.
This isn't like you. We used to rip on this stuff. when it came over the wire.
Yeah, I know.
- It's different when it happens to you.
- Do me a favor.
Talk to Cyrus today.
Tell him you got the flu. Any excuse.
I'll back you up.
I just wanna make sure you still got a job... when you're done doing whatever it is you're doing down there.
Okay, I'll call you from Chicago.
What time is your flight?
8:00 a.m.
Am I crazy?
No.
I am crazy.
Alexander Leek.
- Who the hell are you?
-John Klein. I called you last week.
Do you know what that is?
Stay away.
I need to know what this is.
Tell me.
Where are they seeing it?
Point Pleasant, West Virginia.
You can help me.
Follow me.
The nocturnal butterfly.
In ancient cultures, the moth represents a form of the psyche... or the soul immortally trapped... in the hellish death realms.
Mothman.
That's what the Ukranians called him.
Rough translation, of course.
There were 100 sightings in Chernobyl the year the nuclear plant went down.
Galveston, 1969, just before the hurricane.
They saw it.
But seeing isn't always believing.
Look, there's never been a single shred of evidence... to show that these things exist materially.
So you're telling me these things do not exist?
Oh, they exist. All kinds of things exist around us that we never see.
Electricity, microwaves, infrared waves.
You know, these things have been around forever.
They show up in cave paintings.
They're a normal condition of the planet.
They're just not part of our consensus of what constitutes... physical reality.
What are they part of, then?
You're asking for an explanation... for something... that can't be explained rationally.
You know the buildup of energy before something happens?
The way your hair stands up before lightning strikes?
"Before something happens".
Do you mean they cause disasters?
Why would they need to?
All right, then... are they trying to warn me?
Their motivations... aren't human.
All right, then what do they want?
I have no idea.
What you really want is to know... why you?
Yes.
You noticed them, and they noticed that you noticed them.
Most people aren't sensitive enough to see them... without some kind of... trauma.
What happened to you, Mr. Klein?
Last week my friend got a strange phone call... from an entity... a spirit, whatever.
It seemed to know everything.
Like God?
- It made predictions that came true?
- Yes.
His name was Indrid Cold.
It's perception, John.
They appear differently to everyone.
A voice, a light, a man, a monster.
If your friend thinks it's God he spoke to, he's off by more than a few degrees.
Then how do you explain that it knows everything?
Look at that.
If there was a car crash 10 blocks away, that window washer could likely see it.
That doesn't mean he's God... or even smarter than we are.
But from where he's sitting... he can see a little further down the road.
I think we can assume that... these entities are more advanced than us.
Why don't they just come right out and tell us what's on their minds?
You're more advanced than a cockroach.
Have you ever tried explaining yourself to one of them?
How many people have seen it?
Ten. Twenty, maybe.
Listen to me. Something terrible is going to happen in Point Pleasant.
Don't go back.
Stay away.
I can't talk about this anymore.
There is a reason... that I ended up in Point Pleasant.
Something brought me there.
Whatever brought you there... brought you there to die.
You're just in time. They're just about to light this Christmas tree.
They have been for the last two hours.
Isn't that Denise?
Is she okay?
She left Gordon.
He got fired from the chemical plant.
Just stopped coming to work one day.
Shit.
- Where is he?
- Who knows?
Be back in a second.
Connie.
What's wrong?
Fifteen more people reported seeing that thing today.
Fifteen.
Three of them were cops.
I hate this, John.
I absolutely goddamn hate this.
How was Chicago?
What did he say?
He wouldn't see me.
Shit.
You all right?
It's cold.
Get in the car, warm up.
I can't.
I'm waiting for him.
Everybody in this town is looking at me like I'm insane. You know why?
Denise and all the others, they don't know, John.
I do.
I don't think you're crazy.
Okay?
You talked to him too, John.
You know...
I've been lying awake at night.
I feel... like I'm sleeping... but I'm awake.
That's when I hear him.
And lately, when I hear him... all at once...
I understand.
Everything.
John, do you remember the last time you were happy?
It's real.
These things are real.
I want you to be happy.
Yeah?
What?
This is your wake-up call,
Mr. Klein.
I didn't ask for a wake-up call.
What happened to you, Mr. Klein?
I can't believe I got through.
Gordon, where are you, man?
Speak up.
Listen, John, he was right.
Mr. Cold was right about everything.
Right? Right about what?
I can't hear you.
He was right about understanding.
It's real, John.
I want you to know.
- It's real.
- What is... What are you talking about?
You've got nothing to worry about.
I'll see you in time.
Gordon?
Can they tell how long he was out there?
Looks like he's been dead about eight hours.
He died of exposure.
What made you come out here?
- He called me.
- When?
I didn't like the way he sounded.
When did he call you, John?
About an hour ago.
I can't stand this.
It didn't seem right to bring this up at the funeral... but as far as I know there's never been any accidents at the chemical plant.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I got your message the other day.
I meant to call you back, but I forgot.
Don't you remember leaving me that message?
Chief, this is John Klein.
I didn't call him.
No, it's not me.
I analyzed both tapes with the voice print.
I don't care.
It may be my voice. It's not me.
- It is not me.
- Listen to me.
I would swear in a court of law that that's your voice.
Yeah, great. Thanks.
Shit!
Regular coffee to go, please.
Seventy-five cents.
Have a great day.
Do you know that woman?
- What woman?
- She just left. You didn't see her?
- No.
- That's strange.
She had long red hair, green eyes, real pretty, and she was asking about you.
- Did you see which way she went?
- No.
- What did she say?
- She asked a lot of strange questions.
What are you doing here?
And she asked if you were happy.
- What did you say?
- I asked her for some ID.
- Did she give you any?
- No.
She just said "Tell John I'm sorry for ruining everything", and then she left.
What's wrong?
Was it her?
Was it her?
That's your wife?
It was her.
- I'm not sure.
- What?
I mean, the hair is different.
- Oh, come on!
- What?
- This is the woman you saw.
- No, it isn't, John.
Now, I agree there is a similarity...
Bullshit!
John, it's all right.
I'm not all right.
This is the woman you saw.
She was here. This woman.
Don't you do this to me.
I'm sorry, John.
I feel like
I've ruined everything.
I feel like
I've ruined everything.
I'm so sorry.
I need to know what happened to you.
Please.
Come in.
I was a physics professor at Cornell.
Tenured.
You can look me up.
One day
I started hearing voices.
The voices became messages.
Before long, I was fully convinced that I was receiving... predictions of disaster from outside intelligences.
But you were, weren't you?
John, I had tapes of their voices.
I knew a building was going to blow up, and I tried to prevent it... but no one listened.
What happened?
People died.
Many people died.
I was investigated, almost arrested.
My wife divorced me.
My kids... stopped speaking to me.
Do you know what four years in a psychiatric hospital can do to you?
Everything... gone.
Oh, you'll never understand their messages.
You'll misinterpret them.
I did.
It almost destroyed me.
In the end, it all came down to just... one simple question.
Which was more important... having proof... or being alive?
Trust me.
I turned away years ago... and I've never looked back.
Didn't you need to know?
We're not allowed to know.
It's me, Cyrus.
John, is that you?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's me.
Whatever you are doing, you drop it.
Governor McCallum is going to Charleston.
Then he's touring that chemical plant in Point Pleasant today.
Now, I want you to go down there... and meet him at the airport.
You listening?
Yeah, McCal I um... at the chemical plant. Got it.
I need to know that you're gonna be there.
John, are you there?
Ohio.
Great tragedy on the River Ohio.
Great tragedy on the River Ohio.
I can't call in sick just because you have a bad feeling about today.
Just think about this.
Gordon saw weird lights in the sky.
They show up over the chemical plant.
Josh gets a call from me, but it's not really me.
I'm talking about something bad happening at the chemical plant.
Then I get this message from this Indrid Cold... who's talking about a great tragedy on the Ohio River.
Guess what's on the Ohio River.
The chemical plant.
Today Governor McCallum is gonna be there.
I was on my way to interview him.
That's how I ended...
That's how I ended up here.
My God.
That's why I'm here.
He was right.
Who was right?
You saw Leek.
- He was part of the warning.
- What?
He was part of the warning.
Stop, stop, stop.
I didn't want to scare you.
He said...
He said the messages are real.
Something terrible is gonna happen.
Connie, please.
We have to leave here now.
I will not live my life like that.
I will not make decisions based on messages from Indrid Cold.
He may be real to you.
He's not real to me.
Okay, I'm going to Charleston.
I'll be at the Marriott.
Get yourself reassigned.
I don't want you anywhere near the plant today.
What if nothing happens?
What if there's no great tragedy?
What'll you do then?
- That's not the point.
- Well, I think it is the point.
- Gordon believed what he heard too.
- I am not Gordon!
I know what's gonna happen.
You have to leave now.
I have to report to work.
We can talk about this later.
- Governor?
- Good to see you, John.
I need to speak with you.
It's urgent.
- What's this about, John?
- It's the tour.
You can't do it. You can't go.
Listen to me.
Cancel it. Cancel the tour.
Cancel it. Make them shut down the plant now.
The plant's gonna blow up while you're there.
Where are the cops?
What are they doing?
- This is McCallum's chief aide.
- They don't know yet.
Have you received a bomb threat?
I didn't say anything about a bomb.
There's a source.
- I know this sounds...
- You're messing up here, John.
Get me Cyrus Bills at the Post.
Our top story takes us tonight to Point Pleasant...
- where Virginia Governor McCallum...
- Turn it up! toured the Edgewater
Petrochemical plant.
In what he's called a successful review...
Governor McCallum has given high marks to this petrochemical plant.
He is expected to call for similar renovations... at several Virginia plants.
WOWK-TV 13... has an exclusive look inside at what the governor saw.
Son of a bitch.
I congratulate my friends at Edgewater Petrochemical... on a job well done.
- Success here at Point Pleasant...
- Excuse me, Mr. Klein.
You have a message.
Come in.
- Back to Washington?
- Yeah.
- Do you have to go?
- I have to go.
- If this is about today...
- No, it's not.
I got a message.
I have to go home.
I have to be there noon on Friday.
John, do you realize what's happening to you?
I have to go.
Hey, it's me.
- Connie?
- Yeah.
I thought we could chat for, say, 10 or 15 minutes.
- I'm sorry. Can I call you back?
- No,you can't.
- I booked you a flight.
- What?
It leaves Dulles for Columbus, Ohio at 1:45.
I tried to get you on the one to
Charleston, but they're all booked up.
So if you leave now, you'll just make it.
I can't.
It's Christmas Eve, John.
You shouldn't be alone.
I can't.
Yeah, you can.
You know... when Mary got sick...
I couldn't help thinking... this isn't real.
I can stop this.
I know I can.
I can stop this.
No one can stop it, John.
Listen to me.
Planes are going to crash.
Earthquakes are going to happen.
People you know and love are going to die... and no matter what that voice tells you... there's nothing you can do about it.
It's two years to the day.
He told me that she's going to call.
He said that Mary's going to call.
He's lying.
Whoever calls may sound like her... but it's not gonna be her.
I don't know what happens to us after we die... but I'll bet you wherever Mary is now... she's nowhere near Indrid Cold.
What if it is her?
She's dead, John.
The only important question now is how do you want to remember her?
I miss her so much.
I know you do.
Of course you do.
But, John, listen... you can miss her here just as easily as there.
Even more easily because there, you're all alone.
And that's just no way to be.
You do whatever you need to do... and I'll understand.
But here, we have dinner at 6:00... and we open presents at 8:00.
And we hope we see you.
Okay?
Bye, John.
WJMP time is 5:51 on this chilly Christmas Eve.
Come on.
- You know what's going on down there?
- Some problem with the traffic lights.
Shit.
Great tragedy on the River Ohio.
My God...
Get off the bridge!
Everyone's gotta get off the bridge!
Get off! Everyone get out of your cars and get off!
C.J., come on!
You've gotta get off.
Turn the damn thing down.
- What?
- You gotta get off the bridge now!
- Get out! Get out!
- Let's go!
Get off!
Get off the bridge!
Oh, God!
Go!
Get out of the car!
Get off the bridge!
Quick!
Let's get out!
Get out!
Get out!
Come on. Get out.
All units, this is unit 64.
Get out!
Signal 33 on the Silver Bridge.
Rose, do you copy?
Signal 33 on the Silver Bridge...
Wake up. Wake up.
Here we go.
You are here.
I didn't know if I was dreaming or...
I left DC right after you called.
You did call me, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, I called.
- How bad is it?
- It's bad.
But I supposed it could've been a lot worse.
Are they done with the search?
Thirty-six.
Looks like about 36 people.
Jesus.
Thirty-six?
Thirty-six?
Wake up, number 37.
Abre los ojos.
'Open your eyes.
'Open your eyes.
'Open your eyes.
'Open your eyes.
'Open your... '
'Open your eyes.
'Open your eyes.
'David, open your... '
'I suppose the empty street meant loneliness. '
'You're a shrink. You've got to do better than that. '
'I'm a doctor. Let's not stereotype each other.
'Not all rich kids are soulless,
'and not all psychologists care about dreams.
'The question is how you got here and why you've been charged. '
'What do you want to know?
I was about to turn 33.
'I ran three magazines in a worldwide publishing house.
'Most days I fooled myself into believing it would last forever.
'Lsn't that what being young is about? '
'Believing secretly that you would be the one person in the history of man
'who would live forever? '
Where are you going so early?
Don't record any more messages on my alarm clock.
Why not?
I'll start to think we're married or something.
Don't ever say that word.
I'll never bring you chicken soup and fuck your brains out again.
- How's your cold?
- Still there. How about yours?
- You definitely took my mind off it.
- Really?
Yes!
Juliana here.
Hi, Rayna. I missed my audition, I lost my head!
Listen, I have to go.
I'm with David.
Help yourself to whatever you want.
Set the alarm before you go. And...
You are the greatest.
- Bye, honey!
- Bye, honey. I'll call you later.
When?
- When?
- Soon!
Did you reserve the court?
Easy. I can't handle heavy conversation at this ungodly hour.
Sorry to do this early.
I've got to be done by 10:00.
'You're not going to make the 8:45, are you?
How did you find me?
'You have to check the colours for the new issue. '
- What are the colours?
- 'Yellow and red, or the traditional white. '
- Got to think about it.
- 'David, please. '
'Don't be late for the 10 o' clock with the board. '
Don't tell anybody where I am. I don't care if God calls. I'm very busy.
- Can't you get rid of that board?
- The Seven Dwarfs?
They drive you nuts.
That was the desire of my father who hired them.
You fucked Julie Gianni again, didn't you?
I know someone was there when
I called. You had that tone.
"Oh, no, man. I've got a cold. I'm hanging in today."
I had a cold.
- I was alone.
- Fine.
You can do what you want with your life, but one day you'll know what love truly is.
It's the sour and the sweet.
I know sour, which allows me to appreciate the sweet.
Julie Gianni is a friend.
Sometimes we sleep together.
What? What?
My dream girl, Julie Gianni, is your fuck buddy!
- What do you want to listen to?
- Slow down.
What have we got here? Barcelona...
Radiohead?
Look out!
Fuck!
Fuck!
We almost died.
I know. My own death was right there in front of me.
You know what happened? Your life flashed before my eyes.
- How was it?
- Almost worth dying for.
We're at the front door.
We're coming up now.
- Morning, sir. Sleep well?
- Yes, I did.
- Eaten anything yet?
- No.
David, you were playing racquetball.
I've been covering you for an hour and you're playing racquetball.
We are exiting the elevator.
The board is not happy.
Hello, David.
You're in "The Post". Courtney Love called to see if you got her e-mail and Graydon Carter called to see if you're still on for dinner.
The art department still need the decision on the colours for the bikini issue.
Did I mention the board is pissed? You're late.
David, hold up! Choose one!
Wait! This one? David!
They're all waiting for you.
- You changed your hair.
- Yes, and David...
...opinions are expected.
David.
Do you dream about the board, the Seven Dwarfs as you call them?
Sneezy, Bashful, Sleepy,
Happy, Doc, Dopey and, of course, Grumpy.
- How was Aspen?
- Good.
Now, I want answers and I want them now.
How's it going?
'They still look at me as if I was 11 years old. '
He's going to inherit everything. He gets it all.
- Are you scared of your dreams?
- It's a nightmare either way.
Is that how you explain what's happened to you?
What happened to your face?
- I'm not talking to you any more.
- You don't want to show me your face?
No!
- Do you know why you're here?
- The conversation, the coffee...
David, the part where we parry and joust and get to know each other bit by bit... No can do.
We'll have to skip that because you've been charged with murder.
In four weeks, a judge will determine your fate based on what I write.
- So you will talk to me.
- There is no murder.
There is no murder!
It never happened.
I don't have to talk to anybody!
- Want me to help?
- Get away from me.
Easy, Face! Your whole story's full of holes!
Stop. Stop! Please leave right now. I'll take responsibility.
Please leave right now. He's got control.
I'm going to get you, daddy's boy, little freak!
- My parents are dead, you fuck!
- Enough!
- Is that true?
- Good cop, bad cop.
That you're a daddy's boy?
Primer on David Aames, Senior.
'My father wasn't built for the 21st century. '
He never went to McDonalds.
He never watched television, yet his biggest magazine is still the "TV Digest".
'He and my mother threw the grandest parties of the literary world.
'Ballooned, jumped out of aeroplanes. He sought adventure. '
His autobiography is the manual for every cut-throat publisher in New York.
It's called "Defending The Kingdom".
Terminar com essa gentileza do Paul
McCartney. I've read it. Page 127:
"David Junior was a delight as a child."
Did I miss something here? Is that all he wrote about you?
I don't think he ever got over the fact that I'm absolutely terrified of heights.
The irony continues.
When he and my mother were run over by a drunken teenager on New Year's Eve, ten years ago, he left the keys to the kingdom...
...to me.
Who all thought they were first in line.
And you believe the board, the Seven Dwarfs, put you here to take control of your company?
- What do you care?
- We're just talking.
Tonight's Wednesday night.
I go out for dinner with my two daughters on Wednesday, so I'll have to leave soon.
You understand that our time is limited, don't you?
If I talk... you'll just think I'm crazy.
With all the possible respect I can offer a man wearing a latex mask and spouting conspiracy theories, David...
...believe me. You've crossed that bridge.
Enjoy your dinner.
There are five basic emotions in life, David.
Tell me, what emotion gripped him before he entered that cell?
Was it guilt? Hate?
Shame?
Revenge?
Love?
I'm completely on the wrong track, aren't I?
Who needs ice?
- Hey, Emma!
- David, happy birthday.
You have got the greatest taste in shoes bar none.
Emma, have you met Lynette?
No, but I shudder to think what we might have in common.
Did you invite the entire snowboarding team?
It is my birthday.
- Say happy birthday to David.
- Happy birthday.
Welcome to Graceland.
Happy birthday, you sonofabitch!
Happy birthday!
Friends of me!
Let the fun ensue.
...the great John Coltrane.
They would love an article on it.
It's an amazing, amazing product.
No, that's OK. I've got it.
- Literary god, Brian Shelby.
- Happy birthday!
- And all the usual shit. How you doing?
- Living the dream, baby.
David Aames.
- To what do I owe this pleasure?
- The pleasure of Sofia Serrano.
We met today at the library.
- My coat's too big for your closet.
- We were pretending to be intellectuals.
- It's amazing. I love your coat.
- I overdressed. I mean, I underdressed.
I'll continue like you're both listening to me.
- Do you have another room to put it in?
- I have ceased to exist.
Madison Square Garden is nearby. It might fit there.
- Happy birthday.
- We picked it out together.
- Thank you.
- We picked it out together. We.
You're welcome.
Stop flirting and open it.
- Let's get a drink!
- Yes.
I'll leave this upstairs.
- Listen...
- Hey, Tommy.
Don't blow me off.
I'm all packed, I'm going back to London and I understand.
You put me up for that attorney's job so you didn't have to fire me.
A classy move. Your father would have done the same.
- It's OK, Tommy.
- I became incompetent.
Is there anything more unbecoming than an ageing mascot?
I cared for your father. I lived and breathed for him.
These guys, the Seven Dwarfs, they think you're stupid.
A corporate hazard, a rogue.
They'll find a way to catch you out, David.
They're lined up for your office, your life, your position.
And they're going to sell this tradition of words so they can eat in a better cafeteria.
What they don't know is this. People will read again!
Yeah.
I got it.
They've even got a nickname for you behind your back.
Citizen... Dildo.
You've got great instincts, but
I say this with complete love.
Claim your life. Learn to be an asshole...
- Two's enough.
- Forgive me.
I still believe in this family,
David, even if it's only you.
Drive Tipp home.
Give him that big office across from the Seven Dwarfs.
Set up a meeting with the other attorneys. I'll be in early tomorrow.
Earlier than usual.
Hello, handsome.
- I've come to wish you happy birthday.
- Oh, man!
- I didn't invite you, Julie.
- That was a little weird.
That's how it works with parties. You have to be invited.
Oh.
I'm mad at you, you dick.
We made love four times the other night.
- Was that good?
- Two's good.
Three... is very good.
- But four...
- Four's pretty good?
Four is...
Four is what?
Hold me, I'll leave and you can go back and talk to that cute brunette.
Four is what?
I don't want to meet your fancy friends.
I knew them when I was fancy too.
Four is what?
She looks like a moth, David.
- A moth?
- Sometimes I worry about you.
Some clever girl in a silly coat will come along and play you just the right way.
I'll lose my friend and there won't be chicken soup parties for me and you.
OK.
When will you call me? Don't say "soon".
I hate it when you say soon.
So this is what's become of rock and roll?
A smashed guitar behind a glass case displayed on some rich guy's wall.
It was a gift, actually.
- I like it.
- Whoa! Whoa!
So how did you get all this stuff? This apartment, this life?
I see.
How about if you help me?
Unless I'm horning in here.
- You are, but the food's good.
- I've got a stalker.
- It doesn't sound life-threatening.
- I need you to pretend we're having a scintillating conversation and you are wildly entertained.
- I know it's tough.
- I'll improvise.
She's right across the room, burning a hole in my back.
- Red dress, strappy shoes?
- Yes.
She's really staring at you.
I'm having a drink.
- Shit.
- She seems to be crying. Less happy.
I think she's the saddest girl to ever hold a Martini.
- Brian Shelby.
- Jennifer Kelly.
- You have another apartment?
- Sort of a day office.
- I am not going in there.
- I am. Goodnight.
- I hear her coming!
- Really?
No.
Brian. How are you?
We're safe, but I've got nothing to drink.
Who did these paintings?
This is Joni Mitchell, this one is Monet...
...and this one was done by me. It is a snowboard.
Well, two of them are geniuses.
That is the real thing. His paintbrush painted the vanilla sky.
Canvas. My mother's.
I'm surprised you're surprised.
- I can't keep this going.
- Me neither.
- I caught you.
- Brian, come in here.
- What's going on?
- I'm drunk.
- Julie Gianni is stalking me.
- She looked dangerous.
Nobody stalks me so I drink.
- We're out of drinks up here.
- Finish my Jack and Coke.
- Stupid glass.
- I've got it.
- It's the stupid guy holding it.
- Don't worry, no big deal.
- I'll get us all something.
- I'd better hit it. I drank too much.
- The party's just starting.
- For you it is.
- You are my guest of honour.
- Fuck you, David.
You're paying me to write my novel, so you own me.
I don't own you. You are brilliant, you are handsome.
But why do you have to hit on Sofia?
I wasn't hitting on Sofia.
Fine, whatever you say.
I'm crazy, I'm blind.
You're drinking Jack Daniels. When you drink, you start with that...
...Frank Sinatra, "she shot me down, give me a cigarette" thing.
- That I do. Give me a cigarette.
- I'll find one.
You're rich and women love you.
I'm from Ohio and I'm drunk.
- Can I tell you the truth?
- Everybody does.
I dig her. I've never said this to you before about any girl.
But she could be...
Could be, could be, could be the girl of my dreams.
- You're not from Ohio.
- I know.
But if she fucks up our friendship, she can go to hell.
I won't allow it. We are brothers.
- I feel the same way.
- Sure you do.
Hey!
- How you doing? Gracias.
- De nada.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Where are you going?
- I am Frank... and Frank must go.
- What?
- I good you bid evening.
Wait, I'll go with you.
- Stay, baby.
- I'll give you a ride home later.
No, I have to work tomorrow.
You... are in great hands.
I'm just humouring myself that my opinion matters.
You will never know the exquisite pain of the guy who goes home alone.
Because without the bitter, baby, the sweet ain't as sweet.
Have a good time.
Sweet and sour speech again.
A lot of people are scared of heights.
It's not the heights that bother me, it's the impact that terrifies me.
- I won't stay long.
- Hey, Paulo!
Hello. I have to take you for a walk.
I need protection.
This is a lethal canine.
I love living here and
I refuse to clean up.
No problem.
I have to work around the clock to keep this place.
- You really are a dancer.
- For 14 years.
But I don't dance like you dance.
- Do you want something to drink?
- Sure.
Hey, Paulo. Beautiful, beautiful boy.
What do you want for dinner tonight? You want fried chicken?
Paulo!
- I like your life.
- It's mine and you can't have it.
I don't want to know the story behind this photo. Who's Sergio?
- It's a nickname.
- Your nickname is Sergio?
It's a long story, and we don't know each other.
- So many secrets.
- I'm really an arms dealer.
- I've never known an arms dealer.
- You do now.
What about you? What's your nickname?
Citizen Dildo.
You are not staying over.
Never run a company. Stay an artist. Stay an arms dealer.
Please. Somehow I can't play the violin for you.
Although it must be difficult controlling all those people's lives.
Everyone at that party is connected to you for survival.
It seems.
Ever been married?
No. Did you ever accept any of your 12,000 proposals?
12,008. No.
You moved to New York to dance, paint, act and deal arms?
Right. Do you want to hear
Jeff Buckley or Vicki Carr?
Jeff Buckley or Vicki
Carr? Both. Simultaneously.
Everyone said: "Don't go to New York.
" But I think good things will happen if you're a good person with a good attitude. Don't you think?
- You think I'm naive.
- No, I really don't.
'I dug her completely.
'Somehow, I'd found the last semi-guileless girl in New York City. '
I have to get to sleep.
Truthfully, I'm also working mornings as a dental assistant.
Boy, am I going to the wrong dentist.
'You didn't immediately want to sleep with her? '
'Well, you know, I'm a pleasure delayer. '
- How does that work?
- Pleasure delay? You don't know?
You keep a relationship casual until the absolute breaking point.
Then one evening, or afternoon, or morning...
It could be months from now.
- You know how it works.
- No, actually I don't.
- I've been married for 22 years.
- You've got dinner with your daughters.
That's right, I do.
Back then I had intricate systems with women you wouldn't believe.
Like... what?
Hey, Doc. Don't get all melancholy over the 30 seconds you were single a long time ago.
- That's what you think I'm doing?
- Yes.
You might be right.
Let's continue. Time is not our friend.
Just our shortcomings. That's all we're allowed to draw.
I've never drawn such a true likeness before.
- Mine's finished.
- Already?
Done.
- That's how you see me?
- Maybe I didn't add enough money.
It's something you'd see on a wall in a steak house in hell.
It's wonderful. Sign it.
- Let's see yours.
- No.
Give me that.
I feel bad. You said to draw a caricature.
I know. I couldn't. I saw you like that.
It's very good.
- I'll sell it to you.
- You monster.
How much for?
One kiss.
That smile's going to be the end of me.
What happens when your friend calls you tomorrow?
He just met you a few hours before me. He'd do the same.
- I see that friendship is important to you.
- It is.
And as his best friend,
I know he's finishing a novel about inadequacy and rejection, so the longer I stay, the better it is for his career.
Your career is the one I'd worry about.
Sorry.
You're more right than you even know.
I used to be one of those guys that just...
...was snowboarding through his life, with no focus whatsoever.
- When did you change?
- About five minutes ago.
Every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around.
'And to those who think that you're a charlatan? '
'I understand. A frozen head waiting for reanimation sounds like science fiction. '
What are you watching?
It's the greatest show.
It's called "Sofia".
'Lt's a new science: Life Extension. '
'How do you accomplish such a thing? '
I've seen this 30 times.
'Life is full of surprises, but the greatest surprise of all
'is that this doesn't have to end... ever. '
We did a story on this guy.
He owns half of Arizona.
- Is he a fraud?
- How would you ever know?
Good point.
'Can you unfreeze a human life? '
'Take the case of Benny the dog.
'He was frozen for three months and thawed out to live a normal life. '
That's comforting. It's safe for Benny.
I'm in.
'Boy will still meet girl, they will still fall in love.
'Families will flourish, but man will meet his mind. '
We'd better watch out.
'Raymond Tooley, creator of Life Extension.
'The book is "Life, The Sequel".'
OK.
- Where are you going?
- I left my number on your fridge.
Come here. I want to tell you a secret.
I meant that to be your forehead.
Thank you for the inspiration.
I will now attempt to run my company showing compassion for the seething throng of my partners, who root quietly for me to fail.
And for things you don't even know. Thank you.
I'm going to work. I have a company to run.
Pleasure delayer.
David Aames.
- Julie Gianni.
- Hey, handsome.
- You're following me.
- Just a little bit.
I wanted to finish what we were talking about.
And?
How did it go with our moth girl?
Did she turn into a butterfly for you?
Yes, she did.
She did.
I could tell by the way you were walking you didn't sleep with her.
Let me guess. You haven't slept with her because it's more fun when you draw it out. Sex just isn't as good if a woman hasn't told her friends she'd never sleep with you.
You're right on the money, Julie.
She must be exhausted from trying to be witty for you all night long.
- Sorry.
- It's OK.
You're never there for your friends until they've given up on you.
I'm not blowing you off. I just...
I want to be alone for a little bit. Trust me.
I have a lot of things to take care of.
If we're friends, which we are, then you'll understand that.
I'm sorry. I got weird.
I missed an audition and it made me feel bad you didn't invite me to your party.
You want to make it up to me? I won't tell a soul.
Would you do a story on me if I made a CD?
Do you like my music?
It's vivid.
If I weren't me, I would buy a CD by me.
You know, if you can reach one person...
Wow.
What's happiness to you, David?
What's happiness to me?
- What is happiness?
- For me...
...this is happiness.
It's being with you.
There's one thing that bothers me.
Why did you tell Brian that
I was your... fuck buddy?
I didn't tell him that. I didn't say that.
- When did you stop caring, David?
- Caring about what?
About the consequences of the promises that you've made.
- Promises?
- Yes, the promises.
I thought...
What are you talking about?
Do you understand how hard it is to pretend to be your buddy?
David, I love you. I fucking love you.
I fucking love you! Fuck!
Don't do this, don't do this.
You fucked me four times the other night, David.
You've been inside me,
I've swallowed your cum.
That means something.
Slow down.
Four times. It means something, David.
- Four times.
- Stop the car.
24 hours a day, I live with this aching possibility that you might call me to do something.
Let's go to your house and we'll talk this out.
Let's just slow down. Will you stop the car, Julie!
When you sleep with someone, your body makes a promise, whether you do or not.
Tell me something, David.
Do you believe in God?
What are you doing?
I love you. I love you.
Hello.
- You're amazing. Hola.
- Hola.
Did you get to work all right?
Yeah.
No, actually...
I had a horrible dream.
You dreamed you'd never see me again.
I left your apartment, I went downstairs to the car and my friend, the stalker, had followed me there.
- Julie?
- Yes.
She wanted to talk to me.
I remember I had this buzz, that buzz from you and me.
I think my mind was still on that terrible drawing of me.
But she was upset.
I don't know. I got in the car...
...and she drove off a bridge and committed suicide with me in the car.
I thought you were going straight to work.
But I survive... with my arm... and my face reconstructed.
And what's worse...
I can't wake up.
How was your house after the party?
Party?
- What party?
- The party.
Remember?
Red dress, strappy shoes.
I spilled something on your shirt.
Sweet and sour, and the saddest girl to ever hold a Martini.
'My dreams are a cruel joke.
'They taunt me.
'Even in my dreams,
'I'm an idiot who knows he's about to wake up to reality.
'Lf I could only avoid sleep...
'... but I can't.
'I try to tell myself what to dream.
I try to dream that I'm flying.
'Something free.
'Lt never works. '
Is that the only thing you dream?
I don't remember.
Do you dream about the car accident?
Here's what you remember from a coma
- nothing.
- What happened next?
- What really happened?
Didn't you read the file? I was out for three and a half weeks.
My face and arm shattered, my jaw broken in four places.
No surgery could be performed because of the coma.
You can't feel the darkness or numbness.
You can't even feel.
And then, I came back to life.
Just like that dog,
Benny. Benny the dog.
Benny. Benny the dog.
Only my life was no longer enjoyable.
There are blinding migraines now. Nerve damage. Why?
This is how big business operates.
Random accidents, a lifestyle mishap.
They are not coincidences.
How do you think airtight contracts are broken?
These are power upheavals.
I'm from Ohio. We don't have power upheavals.
They're in the news every day, right between the lines.
Someone did this to me.
My father wrote about this in his book.
Chapter one, page one, paragraph one.
"What is the answer to
99 out of 100 questions?
"Money."
'David, I don't want to worry you.
'I'm holding them off, but we've got a situation here. '
Only if you're mentally acute.
'I'm sorry that poor girl died,
'but you've handed the board a gift with your mishap.
'They'd like to declare you incapacitated.
'But you're back.
'You sound good to me, so let's fight the fuckers
'and have a full recovery. Maybe you should let people see you. '
The last time we were together, you were in a coma and you were very fucking rude to me. You didn't say a word.
The rumours of my death have been mildly exaggerated.
'Who could I trust? The ants were taking over the ant hill.
'Who could I trust? '
'The cranial structure was based on 30 pins,
'and fastened by micro panels and bone from the mandible.
'The grafts have maintained your cheek structure.
Unfortunately, as you were in a coma...
'Doctors. Their power is in jargon, so you study up.
Is that the procedure for all bilateral haematomas in a LeFort llI fracture of a comatose patient?
'You do your best. '
The potential for intra-cranial brain damage was too great.
Beyond the cheek grafts, are the pins fastened with any kind of aluminium which could cause the pressure in my head?
We're working on prostheses, but you're not at the stage where we can experiment.
Experiment. Use me.
- The headaches will go away.
- These are more than headaches.
These are like steel plates slicing through my every thought.
We're not cowboys.
We can't just wing it.
I can't think straight most of the time.
- We can increase your medication.
- Yes. Medication.
We'll continue to investigate.
However, there are so many others who have not had the aesthetic benefit of plastic surgery as you have.
This isn't about vanity, Dr Pomerantz.
This isn't about vanity. This is about functioning in the world.
It's my job to be out there functioning.
I've got the money. I'll pay any amount.
Just invent something! Just play jazz.
You say you're the best face man in New York? Prove it!
- We could do something about your arm.
- Fuck my arm!
Nobody here takes your feelings for granted.
We prepared something based on the preliminary examination.
Bring it on!
It's sometimes useful in the early stages of rejection.
It's a facial prosthetic. It was two weeks in the making.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, doctor.
- A facial prosthetic?
- The aesthetic replacement does work.
Emotionally and actually.
The plastic in the shield blocks out abusive rays and assists in the regeneration of cells.
- It's an aesthetic regenerative shield?
- That's correct.
The ergonomics of the plate barrier allows it to interact
- with the movements of your face.
- I see.
- It's a helpful unit.
- Good.
For a minute there, I thought we were talking about a fucking mask!
It's only a mask if you treat it that way.
No, it's great. This completely takes care of Halloween.
But what about the other
364 days of the year?
'A new form of me began to take shape.
'I planned my re-emergence like the Normandy invasion. '
Sofia. Sofia.
So-fi-a...
Serrano.
'I'll just say it.
'I did my homework. I read every memo.
'Thomas Tipp was right
- people will read again.
'I attended the monthly meeting of the Seven Dwarfs by video. '
People aren't buying books! Let's invest.
'Oh, baby. This was war.
'I grew stronger in ways I'd never known
'and on December 5th, my planes filled the sky.
'The return of David
Aames, Jr. Citizen Dildo. '
Did you see his face?
You won't believe this...
...but this is me smiling.
It's been a long time.
I tried to see you, but your people wouldn't let me.
I didn't want to see me, OK?
But then I woke up today, and finally...
...a good hair day.
You want to get together?
Sure.
- What?
- Let's go out and do something.
This weekend. I'll cancel an operation or two.
We'll have fun.
Because I am all about fun.
'Our first guest tonight is an amazing survival story.
'Please welcome Benny the dog!
'Welcome to the show, Gary.
'I have so many questions.
'Tell us what has happened to
Benny? What's Benny been through? '
'Benny fell into the water near our home
- 'and was frozen in the Skykomish river. '
- 'Ln Washington. '
'I went fishing, thinking he'd been gone for three months,
'and I see him in a block of ice. '
'He is thawed out now, is that correct?
'He's not moving a lot. I'm worried.
'I'm worried about the dog. '
'He's fine. He's just lost a little of his friskiness. '
Sofia? It's David.
I'm back in your life.
I saw you earlier today.
I was just watching our old friend Benny the dog on "Conan" and I thought of you.
Whatever. I...
...I loved seeing you today.
So I will see you soon.
You're a great dancer.
- What are you drinking?
- Nothing.
I'm in the mood for a cheap, overpriced rum and Coke.
- Do you want one?
- Is there any other kind?
- I'll get us some.
- Where is the bathroom?
It's behind...
Over there, by the girl who looks like Björk.
- I'll be right back.
- Maybe I should...
You look good. How's your book?
- Take it off.
- This is a facial shield.
It's kind of like a prosthesis.
Take off the mask. It's freaking me out.
I can't.
It's my face. This is my face.
Trust me, it's a little different.
If you're embarrassed, just go.
Nobody asked you to chaperone.
Sofia asked me.
She didn't want to be alone with me? That's bullshit!
I'm being pretty cool about this whole thing.
Talk to a shrink. Or are you going to call me sometime instead of hiding in your apartment?
Don't take it out on a girl you only met once.
Did she say that? Once?
She said I met her once?
Just cut it out. I miss the old you.
We all miss the old you.
Because the new guy is shit.
That came out wrong. I love you. Period.
- How's your arm, man?
- Fuck you, Brian.
How about no sympathy? How about that's the deal we make?
Give me a Budweiser and a shot of tequila.
What kind of tequila?
- What did you say to me?
- I said, "What kind of tequila?"
Why don't you ask me to my face, bitch?
Patron, if you have it.
- Another shot, another Bud.
- This is on the house.
- Why?
- It just is... bitch.
Patron!
Fix your fucking face!
- Hello again.
- Hello again.
Idea
- let's start over.
How about if you help me?
Unless I'm horning in here.
"You are, but the food is good."
I've got this little problem. I've got a stalker.
"It doesn't sound life-threatening."
I need you to pretend we're having a scintillating conversation and you are wildly entertained. I know it's tough.
- "I'll improvise."
- I don't talk like that.
She's right across the room, burning a hole in my back.
Red dress, strappy shoes.
That's right.
I think she is the saddest girl to ever hold a Martini.
- Are you OK?
- No.
What's wrong? Is it me?
- Is it me?
- I'll tell you later.
Tell me now. If something's wrong, please tell me now.
- Just talk about everything.
- I'll tell you later!
Let's get it all out.
Say everything now.
Just say everything. Say everything now, now, now.
I'll tell you in another life when we are both cats.
I can't believe you just said that.
That's the greatest thing I've ever heard.
That's hilarious. That you said that.
That's... You said that. You said that.
That is what I love about you.
That's hilarious.
I'll tell you in another life when we are both cats.
Cats! Cats!
- This is where I leave you.
- I'll walk you to your door.
- I live just around the corner.
- I've got my bike.
- I'd rather walk.
- Don't be a drag.
Can't you see she wants to go on her own?
Shut up, you're drunk.
I may be an idiot, but I'm not drunk.
Seriously, I don't need you to walk me home. Thank you.
OK, then, so...
...we'll call you.
We'll go catch a movie or something.
So we'll meet up soon.
We'll meet up soon.
We'll call you again to go out with me.
We'll call you.
It's been a real blast,
David. I bid you good evening.
Wait, where are you going?
My bike is back over there. We'll hang soon.
Bring your mask if you want. I'm getting used to it.
- Wait a minute.
- What?
I don't know.
You drank too much. Call me tomorrow.
Tomorrow I'll wish I was dead.
No, you won't. You just need to sleep.
- Hey. Hey!
- What?
What did you say to Julie
Gianni the night of the accident?
- What?
- You told her she was a fuck buddy.
Never.
She was a little more than pissed about it.
Have you been harbouring this shit all along?
I never talked to her.
Whatever.
Anyway, who am I if I can't be the one to tell you you're not ugly?
Come on! Give me a courtesy laugh!
Brian, I'm so fucked up. I'm just so fucked up
We're best friends! We're bro's!
Come on, man. We're bro's.
Open your eyes.
Boo!
- This is a cheap ploy for sympathy.
- I'm OK. I'm OK.
And it worked. Get up.
I agree.
This is a joke.
David, I'm not going to lie to you.
I liked the way you looked. But...
...you have to pull it the fuck together.
If not, I'll forget the other guy.
You know that other guy? You?
I'm still that guy.
I don't have a mother saviour bone in my body. It's not about that.
You are coming inside, but if this turns out to be a big mistake...
...I do have the ability to fall out of love with you like that.
'We created our own world together.
'Us versus them. '
- Where's Brian?
- Brian? He went with you, didn't he?
I thought you guys hooked up.
I wish you hadn't got in the car with that girl.
Sofia, I...
Your eyes apologise better.
Come on.
Holy God! This is going to change my life in a zillion different ways.
I must be nuts!
'We were quite a pair.
'Her believing in me, me believing that I actually deserved it. '
Ah, Sofia.
I see you haven't been wasting your time.
- Do you ever draw anything else?
- No.
Did you sleep last night?
I love you.
No, I did not sleep.
Got to leave early today, David, so you'll have to be brief.
What can you tell me about the name Ellie?
Ellie.
Was that a girl you were in love with?
I've only been in love once.
Apparently you kept repeating it last night.
You did sleep, David. Your advisor said you cried out.
- You had a nightmare.
- Everything's a nightmare.
You cried out for Ellie, David.
Do you remember what happened?
I... I don't...
Dig deep, David. Dig deep.
You cried out for Ellie. What do you remember about Ellie?
Show me your face, David.
Help me open the door.
It's true you had an accident, it's true you were disfigured.
But not any more.
Do you remember?
They did fix your face.
Take off that mask, David. You'll see your face is perfect under there.
I never trusted the doctors.
What happened next was surreal.
That same arrogant bastard,
Dr Pomerantz, called me and suddenly he was my new best friend.
David! My brother! I felt really bad about our last conversation.
'He'd discovered a new form of reconstructive surgery
'with the help of a doctor from Berlin. '
Hello.
'Next thing I knew, they shot me full of drugs I'd never heard of
'and away we went. '
He's got a good voice.
And facial tissue could be regenerated.
...the concept of endoscopic, periorbital fibre optics.
- Where are we eating later?
- I can't even tell you what they did.
It seemed like science fiction.
Madonna had that song "Borderline".
That was a hell of a song.
This is going to be one good-looking guy when I'm done.
'Obviously I was suspicious. '
- Wouldn't you be?
- Suspicious of whom? Of what?
Doc, once you've been driven off a bridge at 80 miles an hour, somehow you don't invite happiness in without a full body search.
At the risk of boring you, I can present the alternate argument.
I once knew a guy who was a real loner.
One day he woke up at 40 with two daughters that lit up his life with purpose.
He suddenly goes to endless school plays, he gets home at 9:20 for the evening discussion and he has the time of his life.
His favourite Beatle was once John and now it's Paul.
I always liked George.
It all depends on the individual, doesn't it?
- Tell me, what's happiness for you?
- What's happiness to you, David?
- How about another question?
- You won't show me your face, will you?
So, back to the timeline.
Hurry, let's move through this.
David!
- David?
- What?
- You've got to take the plates off.
- I don't want to know what's under here.
It'll be fine, you'll see.
I called Pomerantz and switched it to Wednesday.
What?
I hope that women at the front desk gave you shit about it.
Another day won't matter, and the Mustang will be fixed.
The plan was going in the
Mustang. It's not ready.
So we'll go tomorrow in the
Mustang, when it's fixed.
I know that the problem wouldn't be you delaying something you were dreading.
- Couldn't be that.
- No, couldn't be that.
I mean...
I mean... I agree.
I think it's very important to have...
...the right car...
...to take you...
...where you want to go...
...24 hours a day.
How bad is it?
Well, your ears are in the right place.
And the rest of it...
...is not too bad at all.
It's perfect.
Do you love me? I mean really love me?
Because if you don't,
I'll just have to kill you.
In my next life...
In my next life, I'm going to come back as this mole right here.
Seriously, this mole.
You'll have to wear bikini tops to work so that I can breathe.
I love you. Love you.
I love you.
I can live right there.
Is this a dream?
Absolutely.
'We talked about the big things, the little things...
'... and the big things.
'But, in truth, with Sofia it was the in-between times. '
Je t'aime.
- What did she say?
- I have no idea.
- How's things, Brian?
- Fine.
Brian, how's things?
Don't flatter yourself. I'm fine.
Besides, Sofia is great, but by no means one of a kind.
She was a proximity infatuation.
Don't use that, it's mine.
Where did you get this camera?
I'm into things you have no idea, my friend.
- Just so long as you're OK.
- Anyway, we're friends, aren't we?
- Always.
- That's right.
What's up with your face?
Fuck!
There's a seam opening or something!
- David Aames.
- You fucking asshole.
I know.
Was I snoring?
No. I think it was me. I was thirsty, that's all.
I'm dreaming about you. Mmm.
I could listen to you say
"mmm" for the rest of my life.
Baby, what's wrong?
- Where is she?
- Who?
Who?
I'm Sofia.
I'm going to make sure that I tie it four times. You know why, Julie?
Because four times really means something.
Please don't hurt me.
I'm freaked out, it worked.
You won't get away with this, so just tell me where Sofia is.
- I am Sofia.
- Where's Sofia?
- I am Sofia!
- Where is she?
I'm calling the police. Tell it to them.
You survived the accident.
Whose body was it?
It was the board, the
Seven Dwarfs, wasn't it?
You're trying to steal my life!
You weren't in an accident.
Now it's attempted murder!
I am Sofia, please!
Tell it to them.
This is David Aames. I need help.
I've captured an intruder who's entered my home.
Oh, God!
Wake up man. Are you for real?
They've kept me here for three hours.
They think that I had something to do with this.
Can you give us a minute here?
Thanks very much.
They think I had something to do with this.
We're going to handle this the way your father would.
- I've got it solved.
- You've got it solved?
Where is she?
She's going to be fine. This whole file is going to...
Thank God you're here.
It's OK.
I love her.
Look at these photos, then
I'm going to destroy them.
Sofia's testimony is also in here. It won't exist.
She's not going to press charges.
- Press charges against me?
- David, wake up.
As a friend...
...I think you should see what you did to Sofia.
The press won't get hold of this if you get away quickly.
This is Julie Gianni, this is not Sofia.
This is Julie Gianni.
I didn't do this to her.
Someone's setting me up.
David, the board and I have taken care of everything.
They've been really great, actually.
All this is going to disappear.
We're all behind you, even the board.
Get out of here.
This is a revolution of the mind.
You're insane!
Don't ever hit a girl!
Hit me, but don't ever hit a girl!
It wasn't Sofia. It was Julie.
- It was Julie.
- It was Julie Gianni.
So Sofia was abducted by Julie and now Julie is posing as Sofia.
You're in OJ land, man.
Julie Gianni is dead!
I don't care what they told you. I can assure you Julie Gianni is alive.
- I didn't talk to them, I talked to Sofia.
- Where is she?
I just dropped Sofia off. I saw everything you did to her.
I did not do that to her.
Look me in the eye and tell me that's the girl you brought to the party.
Tell me that's your dream girl, your proximity infatuation.
Yes! And you stole her from me.
The one girl I really wanted and you took her from me.
You're insane. You're losing it, man!
- You have revealed yourself.
- Oh, yeah.
I'm with them.
Where did you get the coat, Brian?
Where did you get the camera?
How much did they pay you?
Listen to me, because this is the last time we're ever going to speak.
- I was your only friend.
- You have revealed yourself to me.
Problems?
I'm in no mood to be fucked with, so...
There's an explanation for all this, David.
You and I know each other.
You found me on the Internet.
I'm here to help you, David.
Who the fuck are you?
Why are you following me?
First of all, it's very important that you calm down.
Calm down? Calm down!
You must overcome your fears and regain control.
Take hold of your life again, David.
It's as easy as holding that glass.
What if I were to tell you that you can take control of all of this?
Even me.
I'm straight, OK?
David, look at all these people.
Seems as though they're all just chatting away, doesn't it?
- Nothing to do with you?
- No.
And yet maybe they're only here because you wanted them to be here.
You are their god.
You can make them obey you or even destroy you.
What I'd love for them to do is shut the fuck up, especially you.
You see?
You and I signed a contract, David.
'Who is the man in the restaurant? ' Who is it?
Can you tell the difference between dreams and reality?
- Of course. Can you?
- Think about it.
Think with your head. You signed a contract, did you not?
- I signed something.
- Was the man in the restaurant there?
- Fuck!
- Accept your body's resistance.
Let your head answer.
- Yes.
- That's right. Who is Ellie?
- I don't know what's real.
- What happened that night?
- Somebody died.
- I don't want to remember.
You understand you hold the keys to this prison?
- It wasn't Sofia.
- Who was it?
- No.
- Who was it?
You want to let it out, don't you, David?
You're about to tell me.
Tell me what your heart and soul will not allow you to forget.
Did you kill Sofia?
I thought you were a vandal.
Who are you?
I'm Sofia.
You are not Sofia!
You are not Sofia.
I'm Sofia. We're going to be together again.
You're going to forget about Juliana and we're going to be together.
I'm not going to be afraid of you any more.
I'll get you a cold towel. I'll be right back.
I love you.
'Pleasure delayer. '
Sofia?
I am Sofia.
I love you. I missed you so much.
Where were you?
Forget it. I don't need to know. It doesn't matter.
Just tell me that you love me.
I love you.
What is happiness to you, David?
For me, it's being here with you.
What the fuck is happening?
What the fuck is happening?
David was a real delight as a child.
I'm so afraid of how powerful this is.
Oh, David.
Red dress, strappy shoes...
That is the greatest thing I have ever heard.
I'll tell you in another life when we are both cats.
What's happening?
I did it, didn't I?
But I don't feel like I killed someone.
- I feel like I'm in a dream.
- Who was the man at the restaurant?
Sometimes the mind behaves as if it were a dream.
Faces change, people become other people.
The subconscious is a powerful thing.
You treated Julie carelessly, didn't you?
Your feelings of responsibility or guilt over Julie might have turned Sofia into Julie.
- Do you know what derangement is?
- I need your help.
All I know is you killed your girlfriend and I don't know what's in your mind.
I need your help.
I would work on this case forever if
I could, but we've run out of time.
What will you plead?
Temporary derangement.
That's your best chance.
I don't think they'll believe me.
Who do you believe?
Believe it or not, I care about you.
You've become like family to me.
I don't want to give up on you, David.
But I needed more. I needed an answer.
I even thought there was a chance somebody was playing a trick on you.
Maybe it was the board. But
I can't exceed my duties.
I'm just a psychologist...
...and I have to go now.
Will I see you at the trial?
No, I'm just the opening act.
'Reassurance is our speciality.
That's the Life Extension creed.
'Benny the dog was frozen for three months
'and thawed out to live a normal life.
'Life Extension can translate to the human form, too.
'How do you accomplish such a thing?
72 cryonised patients are currently held at our facility in New Brunswick.
We feature the finest scientific technicians on the planet.
- The book is "Life, The Sequel".
- McCabe!
McCabe!
Come back!
Life Extension Corporation, please. LE. We hold a court order.
I think I've been here before.
- Her name is Libby.
- Good morning, Mr McCabe.
I'm Libby. I'm here to assist you.
He's my son. He's very shy.
You're not with the media or part of any legal consortium?
Welcome to Life Extension.
Take a look at our proposal. Please follow me.
You can wait out here.
You'll be meeting Rebecca
Dearborn, my personal role model.
'I didn't need the pain any more. '
'Life Extension wants you to live. '
'I don't think that God disapproves of this. '
Cryonisation, a journey of reawakening after the preservation of the human body at extremely low temperatures.
- They laughed at Jules Verne, too.
- David, you are not...
Mr McCabe, how are you?
I'm Rebecca Dearborn.
Life Extension, or LE as we like to refer to it, is a glimpse of the future. A ticket, not in the juvenile sense but in the deeply meaningful sense that can only be borne in the human heart.
The DNA codes of the human body have been broken.
Soon heart ailments, cancer, so much more will be a thing of the past.
Very simply, your anguish, your discontent, even your death is no longer necessary in a traditional sense.
Whatever malady hides behind that mask, it's temporary.
Within an hour of your passing, LE will transfer your body to a vessel where you will be sealed and frozen at 196 degrees below zero.
Power outages, earthquakes, nothing will affect your suspension hibernation.
Have you signed a contract with these people, David?
- What's the Lucid Dream option?
- Good choice.
The Lucid Dream is Life
Extension's newest option.
For a little extra, we offer the cryonic union of science and entertainment.
Cryotainment.
Some find this presentation helpful.
'Portrait of a modern human life.
'American, male, birth and death.
'Lmagine that you are suffering from a terminal illness.
'You'd like to be cryonised but you'd rather be resurrected
'to continue your own life as you know it now.
'LE offers you the answer.
'Upon resurrection, you will continue in an ageless state, preserved,
'but living in the present with a future of your choosing.
'Your death will be wiped from your memory.
'Your life will continue
'as a realistic work of art,
'painted by you minute to minute.
'You'll live it with the romantic abandon
'of a summer day,
'with the feeling of a great movie
'or pop song you always loved.
'With no memory of how it occurred, save for the knowledge
'that everything simply improved.
'Ln any instance of discontent, you'll be visited by technical support.
'Lt's just around the corner.
'The day after tomorrow, another chapter begins seamlessly.
'A living dream, Life
Extension's promise to you.
'Life part two. '
A living dream.
Your death will be wiped from your memory.
I guess I missed that one in "USA Today".
A dream. What if there was a mistake?
What if the dream became a nightmare?
Your subconscious can always play tricks on you.
The subconscious is a very powerful thing.
Did you sign a contract with these people, David?
But this is a serious business.
The Lucid Dream is worth the risk.
And what is any life if not the pursuit of a dream?
The dream of peace, the dream of achievement, the dream of hearing someone say these words...
...when they truly mean them:
I love you, David.
- Te quiero.
- I love you.
Roam free, David. Most of us live our whole lives without any real adventure to call our own.
It's hard to comprehend, but they laughed at Jules Verne, too.
This is a revolution of the mind.
I want to wake up! Tech support!
It's a nightmare!
Tech support!
Tech support!
David Aames. I think it's time we had a proper introduction.
I'm Edmund Ventura from the Oasis project, formerly Life Extension, LE.
- Tech support?
- Yes, I'm your tech support.
We first met 150 years ago.
Shit. You sold me the Lucid Dream.
- What the hell happened?
- I tried to warn you in the bar, David.
I told you that it all depended on your mind.
All of this, everything is your creation.
Now we're heading towards your true moment of choice.
- True moment of choice?
- Yes.
When did the Lucid Dream begin?
- Do you remember the night club?
- We'll meet up soon.
That night, after Sofia left you and you fell asleep on the pavement, that was the moment that you chose for the splice.
- Splice?
- Splice.
The end of your real life and the beginning of LE's Lucid Dream.
A splice of many years which passed while you were frozen and dreaming.
From the moment you woke up,
- nothing was real in the traditional sense.
- Open your eyes.
Your Lucid Dream is monitored by Life Extension and a panel of experts following your every thought, even at this moment.
Forgive me, I'm blowing your mind.
I'm not a big fan of heights.
I know.
We erased what really happened from your memory.
- Erased?
- Replaced...
...by a better life, under these beautiful, Monet-like skies.
- My mother's favourite.
- A better life because you had Sofia.
You sculpted your Lucid Dream out of the iconography of your youth.
- An album cover that once moved you.
- An album cover?
'There are some things that you're not old enough to understand just yet. '
A movie you saw once that showed you what a father could be like.
Or what love could be like.
This was a kind woman, an individual. More than your equal.
You barely knew her in your real life, but in your Lucid Dream she was your saviour.
What happened in my real life? Something happened.
- What did you erase?
- Do you really want to know?
Tell me everything.
The morning after the night club, you woke up on the street, hungover and alone.
You got up and you walked away. You never saw Sofia again.
I didn't kill Sofia.
No.
You battled your board, the Seven
Dwarfs, for control of the company.
In the end it was Thomas
Tipp, your father's friend, who wrenched the company back into your control.
Tommy.
But then...
...somebody died.
You longed for Sofia.
You shut yourself away for months. You were alone.
You couldn't stand the pain any more, the headaches.
- You could barely function.
- I found you on the Internet.
I signed a contract with you and then...
I remember.
Somebody died.
It was me.
'And on a day in late December...
'... you gave yourself to us.
'You're now in a suspended state.
'Your friend Brian Shelby threw a three-day memorial in your old home.
'He was a true friend.
'You were missed, David.
'Lt was Sofia who never fully recovered.
'Lt was she who somehow knew you best.
'Like you, she never forgot that one night
'where true love seemed possible.
'Consequences, David.
'Lt's the little things. '
The little things.
There's nothing bigger, is there?
Your subconscious did create problems.
Your dream turned into a nightmare.
The glitch has been corrected.
So all I have to do is imagine something?
Like if I wanted McCabe to come back right now.
Listen to me. These people are dangerous.
We're in trouble. We need to get off this roof now.
We're now on pause, and you're about to return to your Lucid Dream.
Pause?
You won't remember any of this, nor will you be charged for technical support.
It's now your moment of choice.
You can return to your Lucid Dream and live a beautiful life with Sofia or whomever you wish.
Or you can choose the world out there.
The world out there?
And you can bring me back?
Just like Benny the dog?
Yes, just like Benny the dog.
Your face and body can be fixed now, but things are very different now.
And your finances won't last long.
Your panel of observers are waiting for you to choose.
There are no guarantees. But remember, even in the future, the sweet is never as sweet without the sour.
- How do I wake up?
- The decision is yours.
I chose this scenario, didn't I?
Yes, to face your last remaining fear of heights.
David, don't listen to him.
This is the Seven
Dwarfs. It's a set-up!
You can't trust him.
Don't feel bad for him, David.
This winning man is your creation.
It's in his nature to fight for his existence,
- but he's not real.
- I'm real.
I'm real. I have two daughters.
You know that.
What are their names?
I'm real.
I'm...
Mortality as home entertainment?
This cannot be the future!
Can it?
Can it?
Goodbye.
It's been a journey of self-awakening.
Now you've got to ask yourself this.
What is happiness to you, David?
I want to live a real life.
I don't want to dream any longer.
Any last wishes?
Let them out there read my mind.
I wish you well, David.
Look at us. I'm frozen and you're dead.
And I love you.
It's a problem.
I lost you when I got in that car. I'm sorry.
Do you remember what you told me once?
Every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around.
I'll find you again.
I'll see you in another life...
...when we are both cats.
'Relax, David. Open your eyes. '
Yes, I'll hold.
Uncle Neil?
Hi, it's Jessica.
How are you?
Really?
Yeah, I'm in Hollywood.
So what have you been doing for the past five years?
Yeah?
I miss you.
A lot.
When can I come and visit you?
Can you come and visit me?
I'd love it if you came and visited me.
I don't care about that.
It doesn't matter anymore.
I just want to see you.
Okay, I'll try.
Are you ready?
Yes... okay.
Bye.
Heather, can I get a beer?
- You got money?
- I do.
- How are you doing?
- Haven't seen you in a while.
I haven't been around in a while.
I've been keeping an eye on the cover of Rolling Stone
- and haven't seen you there either.
- Keep watching.
- Excuse me.
Mr. Black Cloud.
How are you doing?
Okay.
How are you?
- I want to talk to you.
- I want to talk to you too.
- Hey Bobby,
- Yeah?
Look at this one that Paulina showed me.
I don't know how to get into it very gracefully.
Bobby:
That's real sexy.
I like that.
- You do?
- Yeah.
Make sure this guy pays you before you show him any tit.
- Are we open?
- Yes, ma'am, we are.
- We are?
- Yes.
Fuck,
I have to get dressed!
Look at the difference between that eye and that eye.
That's a half centimeter more.
And you can't put that out.
- Has anybody seen Jo?
- No, but her shit's here.
She went outside.
Probably sucking some guy's cock.
Tell her to come in the office.
Tell her yourself.
Probably sucking some guy's cock.
Woman:
Simone's going up for me.
Whatever happens outside this club is none of my business.
But what happens in here, is.
If he gives you any shit, let me know.
- I'm in control.
- You're in control.
- I'm just trying to get unstoned.
- Hurry up.
Bobby:
Get dressed, please.
Oh, fuck!
I'm getting signed right now, so-
- Congratulations.
- Finally turning around.
That's so good, because I need money.
I need to be able to get things for the little boy,
- or the little girl-
- Listen.
I really want to party.
You know?
Okay, can we not party for a couple of days?
Because if we meet with this lady and you're not high, then she'll think we're both stable and you can tell her you're going to get a deal
- and make a lot of money-
- Am I going to sign something?
Uh... no. Well, you might have to sign something, but you can use a fake name if you
- know the social security number-
- Wait, so I sign something, and you'll get a full-grown child?
No, he would be a six or seven-year-old, probably.
Okay.
- I'll do it.
- Really?
Oh, thank you,
Charlie.
Check this out, Bobby.
Nico.
Yeah,
Carrie Crawford?
Eddie Hazel, from the Blue Iguana.
Right, down in LA.
We'd like to get Nico in for a party we're having next week.
She'd be a great addition to our program as a feature dancer.
She has time in her schedule?
Yeah, we're real happy.
Give me a call back.
My number's 937-4444.
Eddie Hazel.
Blue Iguana.
Okay,
I'll talk to you then.
This ain't going to be cheap.
I ain't worried about cheap, baby.
We'll fill this club, she's getting 300 to 400 guys a night.
There's a reason why.
My, oh my, we got us a full house.
- Good day.
- How are you doing?
- Thank you.
- Be sure to make money.
I don't want you getting used to this.
Come by later,
I've got to talk to you.
- This is for you.
- Thanks for your help.
Where's Jo?
I think she went outside.
- Hey, Eddie.
- Where the fuck have you been?
What do you mean, where the fuck have I been? I'm here!
- My shit is here.
- Put that out.
Woman #2:
Thank you for the flower.
Jo:
Where's my flower?
- Thank you, sweetheart!
- Don't think it's gonna be that easy.
You come in here late,
- acting up, smoking.
- Fuck you, fuck you.
- Fuck you.
- Yeah, okay.
You'll get it later, if you're good.
I was sick, Eddie.
I was sick.
Shut up, you fucking hyena!
I would appreciate if you didn't get all over that black guy.
- He's one of my regulars.
- The one with the Jheri-Curl?
- That's one of your regulars?
- Yes, it is.
He's such a fucking freak.
I would appreciate if you took that guy back,
'cause he's just an asshole.
Let me give you a suggestion.
You should get a titjob.
Eddie:
Get off. Come here!
- Jo:... take that money-
- Shut the fuck up!
I will suspend both of you.
And don't call my bluff!
Thank you. It's jealousy.
Can you believe that?
I got my own.
I'll show you how it's done, all right, boy?
Yeah?
Oh, fuck!
What time is it?
No, I forgot. Okay? I forgot.
No, I have it.
No, I'll be there in 10 minutes.
All right.
- Hey, Johnny.
- How are you doing?
- Do you have the money?
- Yeah. Here you go.
What the fuck is this?
I told you 40.
- No, you didn't tell me 40.
- I told you 40.
Are you all right?
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Where's the rest of my money?
- I'll give it to you next week.
- See you later.
- Fuck it!
Two.
You got them from in there?
$2.00 each.
I know you.
You dance at the Blue Iguana.
Right? I just saw you there.
- Yeah.
- What's your name? Jasmine?
- Mm-hm.
- Jorge.
- Hi, Jorge. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- I remember your name.
- Will you come by again?
- Yeah, I should be there soon.
- Can I have my books?
Thanks.
Bye, handsome. Say hi.
I will.
I know that girl.
I didn't know you went to strip clubs?
- What are you talking about?
- She's a stripper.
- She comes to my poetry readings.
- No, she dances at the Blue Iguana.
She's a stripper.
Why don't you go in the back and stack?
All right.
- She said I was handsome.
- Hey, big day!
This is Eddie Hazel, from the Blue Iguana.
I wanted to invite you to a party here this Saturday night...
- Hi, Jessie, I'm Bobby.
- I'm here for the audition.
- You're late.
- I'm sorry. I like your hair.
It's very snazzy.
- Okay, thanks.
- Hello, Mr. Hazel.
- How are you?
- My name's Jessie.
- I'm here for the audition.
- All right. Nice.
- I like your glasses.
- Thank you.
- Have you danced before?
- I danced at Cheetahs for six months.
Do you have a pen?
Do you have an ID?
I don't have it on me.
It's at the apartment.
Eddie:
We'll need to see some ID.
We've got all kinds of vice people, ABC coming in.
Are you planning on stabbing someone tonight?
- No.
- It's a joke.
- This is soft.
- So...
Where did you get this?
Bobby:
Jimmy, put it on.
Hi.
I'm okay. And you?
Good.
Yeah.
We open up at 7:00.
We'll put you in the line-up.
Don't forget your ID.
Thank you, Eddie.
I'll see you tonight.
We run a tightjoint here.
No drugs, no hand jobs, no blowjobs and no fucking.
You are so handsome.
- Did anyone ever tell you that?
- Thank you.
Yeah, I get it all the time.
Brad Pitt's got nothing on me.
- I think you're a doll.
- That's fine.
The word angle is spelled,
A- N-G-L-E, whilst the word angel is spelled,
- A-N-G-E-L.
- Angle.
- Angle.
- Angle.
- Angel.
- Angel.
How many nights?
One.
It's 30 plus tax, that is $34.20.
Hello!
LA paper.
Complimentary.
Tape:
Listen and check your answers.
Practice saying them.
He wears a uniform.
- He wears a uniform.
She's a pilot.
She flies all over the world.
- She's a pilot-
- Angel!
In winter, Alice goes skiing, and in summer, she plays golf...
Ladies and gentlemen, she fell from the sky.
The celestial Angel.
Whoo!
You know? Excuse me? Hi.
You're sitting in someone's seat.
It's Angel's seat.
Why don't you sit- yeah, sit in Jo's seat.
- I'm Jessie, by the way.
- Hi Jessie, I'm Jasmine.
You have beautiful lips.
Do you use collagen?
No, they're natural.
There's some freak hanging outside in a green Cadillac.
- I saw him.
- Did you see him?
That's fucking freaky.
We ought to tell Bobby, to get him-
- I saw him twice last week.
- Stormy, did you see him?
No.
- Is he there now?
- Yeah.
Remember that guy who followed me home?
- Don't go out there.
- I'll be right back.
- Don't go outside.
- I want to see who it is.
If you talk to him, tell him to fuck off.
I don't fucking believe this.
Excuse me? Honey?
New girl? Barbie?
You're sitting in my seat.
This is my seat.
You might notice there's stuff in front of it?
There's a jacket on the back of it.
Jasmine, how could you let her sit in my seat?
- Don't talk to me.
- Find your own space.
Find your own space, and we'll all get along.
You know that guy who looks like Colonel Sanders?
- He gave me some bud and I-
- Hey, bitch, you're up!
- I just came off stage!
- Not you, cornflake,
I'm talking to Jasmine.
Jasmine, it's your turn.
I'm not going up.
I'm not ready.
I have to let my rubber breathe.
- Jasmine:... they're saying Jo.
- They're not.
- I can't go. I'm not ready.
- I'll go.
You'll go for me?
You'll do that for me?
You're a really sweet girl.
You know that?
She's Jessie.
She's our new addition.
She gets along with everybody.
We love little Jessie here.
Go on up.
You're gonna miss your-
And now, making her stage debut... she's young, she's beautiful, she's perfection.
Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for Jessie!
Just wondering.
Did you ever get her ID?
Yes, I know who she is.
I talked to Billy.
Did that call from Nico come yet?
It's on the machine.
Come on, Bobby, you said you were going to tell me.
Mm-hm.
I'm telling you.
Hi, Eddie Hazel, this is Nico.
So it looks like we're on, baby.
I'll be there.
You have my numbers. Bye.
Are you okay?
You doing okay, kid?
My glasses, my glasses.
Why don't you take them off?
We'll put them right here.
Are you okay with that?
All right, sweetie.
Okay, how's that?
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.
Want to see the bad side?
- All right. Here we go.
- Oh God.
Hi.
Jessie.
- Want to dance tonight?
- Mmm.
Let's go.
I don't have any money for this.
I'll make an exception.
Listen to this.
That's not the message I saved.
Woman:
I realize our ancestral humor goes through common longing and resistance.
I know the effort you will not make until you are ready to accept I am not a war.
That was great!
Greatjob.
Thank you, Fiona.
I forgot to mention earlier, we put some fliers on the chairs referring to the upcoming poetry slam in San Francisco.
As you know, it is the most important poetry event on the West Coast so be sure to check it out.
Now, without further ado,
I'd like to bring up Sophie Delvaux, whose latest collection,
"Autumn Sopranos," will soon be published by the Hubcap Poets Library.
Sophie.
"Dreamboat.
Sleep is a boat moored in this room at night
And again at dawn.
In between, itjourneys over the world,
Travels inside the scheme of things,
Moves out over the stars,
Comes, sailing into port, its cargo... "
You never read.
No.
So what's that on your paper?
- Your laundry list?
- Mm-hmm.
Maybe you should come and read your laundry list.
Maybe not.
- Hey.
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, Stormy?
- Yeah.
You don't know a Marie Hughes, do you?
Marie Hughes, ring a bell?
- What is that?
- I don't know.
Some attorney type dropped it off for her about 10 minutes ago.
I'll give it to her.
No, I'll give it to her.
Do you know who it is?
- Yeah, it's me.
- You?
Fan mail?
Use your stage name, not your real name.
You hear me?
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
- I think I'm pregnant.
- No, you're not.
Yeah, look at this.
- What the fuck is that?
- It's at the plus.
- That means you're pregnant.
- Where did you get this?
In the bathroom.
I was peeing and I found it beneath the toilet.
Did you piss on it?
Well, I was standing-
I was hovering because the toilet is gross.
So I was peeing and I looked down and I saw this right beneath the toilet.
And I think
I might have dribbled on it.
Did you piss on the thing?
- There's piss on it...
- That's gross. and I might have dribbled on it...
- You're not fucking anyone.
- Nobody right now, but I heard on the Discovery Channel that sperm can live a long time.
When was the last time you fucked anyone?
- Six or seven months.
- That is not yours.
- Kathy, this is yours?
- No, it's not mine.
- Tiffany?
- No, it's not mine.
- See, it's mine.
- No, it's not.
- This isn't yours, right?
- You didn't piss on it,
- you're not fucking anyone.
- I've been wanting to get pregnant.
- Jessie, is this yours?
- Get off of my things.
- I'd appreciate it.
- Jo?
Where's Stormy?
- I want to keep it.
- Angel, don't!
Why do you want to keep it?
Someone pissed on that.
It's not yours.
Okay, kids, go to town!
Whoo!
Stormy, what do you get for a blowjob?
Okay.
- Give it to me. Is this yours?
- What is it?
I don't know what the fuck it is.
It stinks.
Get it away from me.
- Sit down.
- What?
- Are you pregnant?
- What?
Are you pregnant?
What the fuck is the matter with you?
Do I look like I'm pregnant?
No, I'm not.
- What's going on?
- Angel found it and thinks it's hers.
- But it's obviously not hers.
- Angel found it. It's probably hers.
Angel, honey, are you pregnant?
Congratulations, baby!
You'll make such a good mother.
Just don't leave the baby in the park.
Jo, sit down.
Look at me, will you?
Are you pregnant?
- No.
- How late are you?
I'm not late.
I'm not late.
I'm not late.
- Give it to me!
- Keep your hands off of my pills!
Fuck! What the fuck is the matter with you people?
- How late are you?
- I'm not late, okay?
All right, I got- give me this.
- What does that mean-
- It means you're pregnant.
It's a plus, there's a little blue plus sign right there.
All right, I'm not a moron.
I read the box.
- It's a plus sign, okay?
- Are you gonna keep it?
I'm not going to keep it.
I'm gonna throw it away.
It's disgusting.
What do you think?
If you want, I have a doctor.
- I think I got a defective EPT...
- No, you did not.
- because it was in my...
- It's so beautiful.
Honey, I have a doctor in
Culver City who can take care of it.
Okay.
Can you make an appointment for me?
'Cause I don't want to carry it around.
It's okay.
- Hey, Bobby.
- Hey.
- Bobby, you seen Charlie?
- Yeah, I've seen him.
He gave me a tip.
Fucking asshole.
Where is he? I have to arrange something with him.
You really want to know?
Yeah, why?
What happened?
Come on, let's go for a smoke.
Why?
What happened?
Asshole!
The motherfucker?
- What am I supposed to do now?
- You'll be fine.
What do you mean?
He told me he was going to come to the meeting with me.
I give him something and he was going to be my fiancé, and he made me a promise.
He said,
"I'm going to come with you, and then he goes off with the first- fucking little-
What, you need a leech?
Here, calm down.
Fuck! I need him to show I'm like a whole person who's going to get married and stuff-
Sit down. Sit down.
Relax.
Bobby...
You can do better than Charlie.
Yeah, right.
Some kid's going to be lucky to have you as a mom.
That's what you got to remember.
He wasn't going to be there with me.
He was going to go to the interview.
Now what am I going to do?
Let me look at that tip he gave you.
What are you doing?
That's my money.
- That's my money.
- That's Charlie's money.
You can have this.
I'll tell you what.
I'm going to check with Eddie and I'll give you a ride home.
Don't be a long time, Bobby.
Miss Willow?
You can come in now.
Miss Willow, why do you want to foster a child?
Well, because
I really love children, and I really feel that I could give them a safe and happy place to be while they're waiting for their parents to get out of rehab orjail-
Sometimes these kids do come from very disturbed backgrounds and it's important to have a safe and secure environment and someone with an open mind.
Yeah, I have a very open mind.
Yeah, like your sign that says,
"The hand of friendship has no color. "
I don't look down on Michael Jackson for changing the color of his skin.
We have people in my building that are- there's three lesbians living in one apartment.
All of them sleep in the same bed and they're the most normal people that you can ever meet.
Even though they sleep together, they're so nice.
Oh, I'm sure they actually- you live in the same building, so this is an apartment on Whitsett?
- Spec.
- Spec. You moved.
No, it's around the corner from Whitsett.
That was the direction.
Okay. So-
Okay, so how long have you lived in Los Angeles?
- For six years.
- And where did you grow up?
- Oklahoma.
- You moved here from Oklahoma?
- Six years from Oklahoma?
- No, I was in Vegas for a while.
What were you doing in Vegas?
- I was engaged.
- Did you get married?
No. I would have, but he didn't want to marry me because... he was a very wealthy man, but he had some character flaws.
What kind of character flaws?
He liked really young women.
You're a beautiful woman.
I can't imagine him finding someone younger or more attractive.
Well, thanks, but when I turned 25,
I was just kind of kicked out.
Do you have a significant other now?
Mm-hm. Charlie.
He's my fiancé and he was going to come with me today and I know you might be worried that he's not here but he had a big record deal and they needed him in New York because he might be doing some music with Yanni...
- Oh.
- or some other people.
That's very soulful.
- Okay-
- He's very soulful.
What do you fear most in life?
- Death.
- What does that bring up for you?
Not being able to live.
And what about the most pleasurable thing?
- Love.
- Love.
- Miss Willow?
- Hm-hum?
What do you think you can give a child?
Well, I have a Teddy bear that I had when I was a kid.
And I make a really good fluffer-nutter sandwich.
You are- you are very charming.
I want you to understand something.
Fostering a child is not a hobby
- and it's not an activity-
- Oh no, I know.
It's very serious.
It's an occupation.
It's a commitment that you're going to make.
I know, I understand.
I have too many hobbies already,
- so...
- Okay.
Would you look at my ass?
There's something in it.
Is it warts?
- I don't want to have herpes.
- No, it's not.
You just cut your asshole, that's all.
Just put a little...
You might feel sorry for me
'cause I only made one dollar.
- Ha!
- Oh, please!
Jesus, Angel!
Put some aloe vera on that, Jasmine.
I've been thinking about little Jo, because it would be really easy to remember.
It's like your name.
And it would be good for a girl or a boy.
Can I get your attention?
Don't forget.
Hello, Tiffany...
Party at my house the day after tomorrow for the foster kid.
Sometimes it takes a while to find the right guy, and people can piss off people and the thing is-
- Hello!
- What?
We're getting my apartment ready for my foster kid the day after tomorrow.
I'll make a map so everyone knows how to get to my apartment, okay?
Man:
Remember these glasses?
I was wondering if, maybe, you could hold them while I straighten things out with the landlord.
Straighten it out?
Those were my wife's.
She loved them and it's the only memento I got of her.
That's Stormy!
Eddie, Harry left his binoculars for you.
- Harry left these?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
- Hey, Desiree?
- Yeah?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Hi.
It's room 2-0-8.
Yes. No,
I am not going.
Yes, I stay one more night.
No, no problem.
You scared me.
You want me to get out of your way?
No, I have nowhere to go.
- Light me one, will you?
- Yeah, sure.
He's here, Bobby.
Who?
Sullivan.
Your brother?
Yes.
He wants me to go see him.
Mmm-hmm.
He's staying at the Sunset Hilton.
You know where that is?
Yeah. Yeah.
He's getting married.
He's going to be a daddy.
- You're going to be an aunt.
- Fuck you.
Fuck no,
I don't want to see him.
How did we do tonight?
We did all right.
Do you want some advice?
Wait until Christmas, buy them all nice little gifts, you go home, you take a picture and you go home.
I don't want your advice.
I want to see him.
74 Fleetwood.
We drove across the country in that car.
I always wanted to do that.
Best memories of my life.
- He's right there.
- Where?
Right there.
My brother.
- How do you know?
- I know.
I know he's on the left side of the bed and he's smoking a cigarette and thinking.
I'm not going up.
I don't want to go up.
- You want to go back to my place?
- No, take me back to my car.
All right.
Okay, this is an excellent guitar, so...
Thank you.
Baby, come here.
You look great with this.
Here, let me tell you.
You hear that sound?
Yeah, this is a '59 Gibson Les Paul.
There is more history behind this instrument.
You have to hold it like a precious baby.
Charlie:
Think baby Jesus.
Jessie:
I have the goods.
- I'm so proud of you.
- That'll be four, three, two, four, seven, ninety-three. Cash?
- Cash.
- That's cash. Take them.
- Okay. Excellent.
- Are you happy?
Thank you, baby.
I got all this great stuff at the 99 Cent Store and I thought-
Wake up!
I got this really great snorkel.
The kid can use it as a snorkel in this pool.
Oh, that's so cute!
Where's Jo?
Where's everybody?
I think everybody had an appointment.
I haven't heard from anybody.
You know that guy who throws that shit up on stage?
- Presents!
- Yeah, I need to wake up.
So I think we should smoke it right now.
Yeah 'cause we need to organize.
We need to concentrate.
- Did you move the couch?
- Yeah, I'm working on the feng shui.
What the fuck is feng shui?
- It's- aren't you from Asia?
- No, I'm from Seattle. Light me.
Well, feng shui is the ancient oreal- oriental ritual of decorating your house.
You move all your furniture so that chi...
- Oh, fuck!
- energy can go through the house.
It blows from one end to the other.
Okay, we can work with that.
- Ange!
- What? it's a fucking sty in here!
I know, I'm going...
I'm going to clean it right now.
I was waiting for everyone to get here.
Where is the kid going to sleep?
He's going to sleep in here.
I'll sleep on the couch.
This kid is going to sleep in a heart-shaped bed?
I was thinking I'd turn it upside-down so it'd look like a spaceship.
Good idea.
And get rid of the sheets.
- Get spaceship sheets.
- Good idea.
Oh my God, you have to fix this hole.
Yeah.
I'll tell Bobby to fix this hole.
We should make a list.
Okay. Dictate.
Fix the hole.
Um... buy wallpaper.
Bobby will know where to buy the wallpaper.
Okay...
Fix the air conditioning.
It's so fucking hot in here.
I can't fix the air conditioning thing because there are some rats living in it.
- You can't live with rats!
- I like rats!
We're gonna get rid of them.
Jasmine, don't!
I'm not going to kill them.
You've got to kill the rats.
Tell Bobby to kill the rats.
She won't let you keep the kid if you have rats.
I won't keep the rats.
- I'll put them at your house.
- I am not keeping rats!
Just temporarily.
We can take the unit out and put it at your house.
The kid needs air conditioning and he can't live with rats.
She won't let you keep the kid if you have rats.
I'm against killing them.
Sacrifice the fucking rats!
I'm hungry.
Maybe we should work on the list outside,
- and work on our tans.
- I want pizza. Do you want some?
- Yeah.
- What kind?
Any kind. You can't take your top off out there because Mr. Sherman, that 100-year-old man, always looks.
- Who's that?
- That's my dad.
Your dad is Adam West?
Well, he's who I like to think of as my dad.
Don't you think he kind of looks like me?
Look at his jaw and his mouth, even his nose and everything.
- Look.
- No.
- Look, if I stood this way.
- Hmm-hm. You don't look like him.
Really?
It's okay. You don't have to look like him.
Let's get pepperoni. Don't tell the lady your dad is Batman.
Why?
Ellen.
Ellen Taylor.
Okay, have a seat.
We'll call you when we're ready.
Okay.
- Your name is Ellen?
- Yeah.
That's what we want to name the baby if it's a girl, after my husband's grandma.
It's kind of old-fashioned, but it's so pretty.
Excuse me, Ellen.
You can't smoke in here.
- There's no smoking here.
- I'm sorry.
It's a doctor's office.
You should probably seriously consider stopping smoking at this point.
- Why?
- It's bad for the baby.
I'm sorry, Ellen.
You might be able to smoke outside, but you can't smoke in here.
And it's- like I said- it's bad for the baby.
A girlfriend of mine went for acupuncture-
I don't give a fuck about the girlfriend of yours, okay?
Everybody doesn't have a happy, cheerful, chirpy life like you do.
Okay? Everybody's not here to have a baby.
Some of us-
Fuck you!
Fuck you, bitch!
Some of us are here to have abortion!
- Did you ever think of that?
- I'm sorry, no.
Did you ever?
No, because you don't think.
You rattle on and on about your happy little husband and your happy little grandmother named Ellen and you don't give a fuck about other people.
You have a problem, lady!
You think you're the only one with reproductive organs?
I'm going to have this fucking baby, and my baby is going to sell drugs to your baby on the playground.
You fucking bitch!
Oh my God!
- Ohh!
- What the fuck is that?
- Oh my God!
- What are these for?
Jimmy:
These are for Angel.
- Stacy's Flower Company.
- Who are they from?
The driver said he was not allowed to tell me who paid for them.
- What are you talking about?
- They're from a funeral parlor.
I'm not dead.
- They look like they're big.
- Oh my God!
- These are so beautiful.
- Nice, Angel. Score.
Oh my God!
Who are they from?
The driver said he could not tell me.
Jasmine:
Did they give a card?
Jimmy:
No. I don't know nothing else.
I bet they're from Dale, the guy with the bald head.
- The sweet big man, kind of nerdy.
- The guy drives a bus.
Yeah but sometimes those nerdy guys are from Silicon Valley.
- He's a poor nerd.
- They invent toilet flushers...
- No, he's just poor.
- See you later.
Angel, these are 200 or 300 bucks! It's ugly, but...
I have an independently wealthy secret admirer.
I'm going to take one, okay?
Maybe they're from Charlie.
His record deal might have come through.
Just kidding.
Just kidding, sweetie.
Oh my God!
- I can't believe it!
- You lucky girl.
I know, it's like-
I'm like, so lucky.
We're gonna kick it into the next gear, because coming to the stage is our resident wild child.
It's Jo!
Jo, it's enough!
Dave, get over here.
Get Jo off the stage.
What the fuck is the matter with you?!
What the fuck is the matter with you?
Bobby:
Get her off the stage.
Bobby:
Angel, get out on stage!
- Fucking asshole!
- Is this her shit?
Yes.
You get the fuck out!
Get out of here!
You're a big man, aren't you?
You fucking piece of shit!
- You shit!
- Let her go.
Dave, you keep her out of here.
Keep her out of here.
I want my stuff, Jessie.
- Give me my stuff.
- Here's your stuff.
Okay, this one's from me.
"Pale shades of gray loft the clouds
Above the bed, half filled.
There is no smile in this room,
No laugh during love.
A pall gently descends over the space,
Once a sanctum, now a hollow shape,
As the sun rises, and my eyes fill with black. "
Thank you. Thank you.
All right.
I have a very special surprise for us today.
I decided to bring up a special mystery guest, and it's someone who's actually never read before, so when she comes up, give her a big encouragement.
Let's hear it for Jasmine.
Jasmine.
Come on up.
You don't want to read?
Come on up, give it a try.
Let's give her encouragement.
We've all been there.
Good luck.
My name is Cathy.
"If in the skylight, tawny afternoon a drift of care
It's only love, but gone in the way of everything.
If in the morning of your soul, a brush of tenderly imagined lips,
It's only love, but gone in the way of everything.
If in the messy cocktail dregs of a midnight glass, a teardrop falls,
It's only love, but gone in the way of everything.
If in the singing twilight of the dawn, you give your heart unwanted,
It's only love, but gone in the way of everything.
Then what in the hours of your life is love?
It's here and gone, and gives its name to everything. "
All right, well... that's it for today.
So we'll see everybody next time, and thanks a lot.
I'll see you later, okay?
Why did you call my name?
I didn't ask you to call my name.
I don't even know you.
That poem was really great.
Cathy... that was really great.
I don't know what to say.
Yeah, well, thanks.
Do you have any more?
- Yeah.
- You got to get up and read.
That's all.
You've got to get up and read.
- Why?
- Because you're good.
I hate to disappoint you, but you're really good.
Who is it?
It's... it's me.
It's you?
Yeah, I was sitting in my apartment.
That's me.
This woman
I used to be with, Maria... she was beautiful.
She was a painter.
She painted that thing.
She was North African, she had that pretty heavy accent.
She lived in Paris, New York, all over the place, and she had me sit five weeks.
Five weeks to do that thing.
You sit still for five weeks, huh?
You can't sit still for five minutes.
Yeah...
And she would talk to me.
She would talk about... shapes and colors, light, shadow, all that stuff- painter shit, and then she would use all of that, and that's what popped this thing to life.
She could look at your body, and she would paint you, but she would bring out the shit that you never see.
You know what I mean?
She was a wild girl, too.
When she got tired in the afternoon, she said,
"Eddie, you want to eat?"
I was alone in this room- in this apartment that I used to live with in Seattle.
He had a lot of books, so I would sit and read all day.
One day I just couldn't stand it any longer, and I shut the blinds and... kneeled on the floor and- bawling my eyes out, and I wrote it.
I tore it up.
I can't believe you want to hear this stuff.
Were you stripping then?
Yeah.
I was working up in Seattle.
How do you know I'm a stripper?
This kid who works for me said he saw you dance.
Tell him I said hi.
In this dream I had last night- remember that cat
Johnny Washington I got in a fight with in San Diego?
I don't remember him on purpose.
I saw my knife, my hand cutting, and cutting his face, blood getting on everything, blood all over.
Strange, man.
Then I couldn't wash my hands.
Remember that phone call?
The girl crying I played for you the other day?
Erase it.
I would have erased it last week,
I would have said, fuck the bitch, man... but... this week, I can't say, fuck the bitch, you know?
You got some herb with you?
Yeah.
Why don't you roll us a joint?
So, do you go to strip clubs?
No.
Yeah, you don't seem like the type.
Yeah? What's the type?
You know, married, lonely...
This kid who works for me, Jorge-
Yeah, he's the kind of kid that goes.
He said you're on the billboard.
Yeah, the Blue Iguana has a couple.
I'm only on one, since my tits are small.
I'll get them done.
So are you the kind of guy who likes big tits?
Actually, you know what?
I'm not used to that line of questioning, to tell you the truth.
All right.
Do you have any other writers at your club?
Maybe we could change the whole venue.
I don't know what you're doing with me.
What?
You should be with that French girl.
She's a good poet.
I really want to kiss you.
- Okay.
- No, I really want to kiss you.
I want to kiss the poet.
Do you have a problem with me dancing?
No.
Angel.
Yeah?
I have something for you.
Again?
- Oh my God! What is it?
- Open it up.
Wow!
Oh my God!
Look at that!
Oh my God!
Jewels!
Yes, it's jewels.
And look...
Charlie!
Hey, baby!
- Guess what?
- Charlie?!
They don't want me.
You want to know why?
'Cause I fucking hang out with skanks like you!
Charlie!
Aren't you pretty?
Aren't you fucking pretty?
Just to fuck morals!
- Come here!
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Charlie.
I met someone.
Okay... what's his name?
- Dennis.
- Dennis, and?
And?
And I think- I don't know.
He's a poet.
He runs that thing at the Coffee Ground, and... he likes my poetry, so...
So you're gonna go to San Francisco with Dennis?
Yeah, he invited me up there.
There's this big slam and...
And you're going to support him stripping?
No. I don't know. No.
I thought we'd just kind of write together-
Does he know what you do?
Yeah, and he's fine with it.
Yeah, he really fucking loves my poetry, so he thinks that I can, you know... get published or something.
Does he love you?
I don't know, I just met him three days ago.
That's really a smart thing to do then.
I think you should go to
San Francisco with Dennis the poet whom you met three days ago and write poetry and support him.
I need some more fucking cigarettes.
- Bad! You are bad! Very bad!
- Very, very bad!
- I've had a bad week-
- I don't care about your week.
I don't care about your week.
Are you hungry?
- Yes, Mistress, starving.
- All right...
- there you go, eat!
- Thank you, Mistress.
All right, enough of this shit.
It's time to take the little wormy for a walk.
Get down on the ground.
Get down on the ground and crawl. Crawl!
Crawl like the sub-human creature that you are-
Who the fuck is that?
All right, you stay right here.
Jessie, what are you doing here?
Hi, I just-
It's 3:00 a. m.
What the fuck are you doing?
I thought you needed company tonight.
Well, you thought wrong.
I have company.
- Goodbye.
- Who is that?
Jessie, I'm in the middle of something, can't you tell?
I have a life. Can you go?
Angel said you might need company on account of the baby.
Angel thought wrong.
Company is the last thing I need.
You got to go.
- Hi!
- Hi!
Don't talk to him.
He's being punished, okay?
Anyway, he doesn't exist, he's just a pathetic worm.
Get down on the floor!
Did I tell you to sit up?
Get down on the floor!
I don't want any conversation from you!
Jessie, get up.
- You have been a bad boy!
- I have, Mistress.
All right. Stop!
You don't talk to her.
Don't talk to her, okay?
Can't you see we're in the middle of something?
Come here, sit down.
- I want to play.
- I'm not playing.
This is business. Do you think I'd have fun with this?
- This is a client.
- Do you mind if I stay?
- I wouldn't-
- Don't talk. Shut up!
Get down on the ground.
Are you hungry, worm?
Are you thirsty?
Drink! Drink the fucking vodka!
Keep your head-
Jessie! Don't drink that.
That's disgusting.
It's dirty.
May I have two mistresses?
No, you are not having two mistresses.
Jessie, you have to get out of here.
No, Jo. Let me stay.
I have nowhere to go.
Let's not get all melodramatic.
All right. Come here.
Get up. Stand up.
What are you looking at?
Do you mind if I stay tonight?
- No.
- He doesn't mind.
Jo:
Your opinion doesn't count.
Jessie... what happened to you?
What the fuck is this?
Who did that?
Did Charlie hit you?
No, I just want to have a slumber party.
Man:
You should put ice on it.
Jo:
Can you stay out of this?
Jessie:
Let's have a slumber party.
Jessie, get up.
You don't know where he's been.
Come on, sweetheart.
Lie down and sleep it off.
This isn't a place for kids.
I don't want to.
I want to play.
All right, you win.
Stay here, but no more than one night,
'cause I have a life.
- But I want to play.
- No. You lie here.
Be very quiet, and sleep it off.
And don't bother me while I'm doing business with the nice man.
Just when you get back...
Officer.
Officer, could you help me with- could you help me take a picture of my-
I want to take a picture of myself in front of it.
- Is that you?
- Yeah.
Really?
I'm a lot smaller in person.
But, um...
See, I think I'm only getting my hat.
You realize you're not supposed to be down here?
Um... sorry, I'll leave as soon as I-
I just wanted to get a good shot of my picture.
- All right.
- Thanks.
- Is it ready to go?
- Yeah. There.
A little wider.
Can you take it a little wider?
- You mean back?
- Yeah.
How is that?
I got it all.
Ready? Cheese.
- Cheese.
- Cheese.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Did anyone ever tell you you look like Fred Gwynne?
You know, the guy who was Herman Munster?
No one has ever told me that.
I really like him.
He's the great-
Shit!
I locked my keys in my car and I have to be at work!
Oh no!
Damn it!
You have a hanger?
This side's open.
Would you unlock this door for me?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
This is the lock.
Ma'am, is this marijuana?
I think it's uh- it's an herbal cigarette.
Step around to the side of the car, please.
I- I did not inhale. I-
Step around at the side of the car.
It will take a minute.
Well, it's probably just oregano.
You should have it examined
'cause I don't feel stoned.
I'll have it examined.
It'll take a second.
- It won't be long.
- Do you have to handcuff me?
I'm afraid I do.
This will take a minute.
You can find me at the Blue Iguana every day.
I'm really a good person,
- and I have respons-
- Just stand still for a few minutes.
I'll take a look at the car for your license and registration.
Okay, but I have responsibilities, and children I might need to be a role model for, and if I get a record, it will be really bad.
I understand.
Is this your purse?
Yeah, that fuzzy- the pink.
- This?
- Yeah.
Officer, is there any way you could-
I'm gonna pay that.
I got an extension, and I-
- Which one is your wallet?
It's the one that say Bad Motherfucker on it.
Did you ever see Pulp Fiction?
No, I never saw it.
John Travolta's career came back after-
I was sick when they took that picture.
- A lot of bills, ma'am.
- Yeah, they're all ones.
You can have some.
- What are these?
They are my friend Jo's vitamins for her pregnancy.
I think.
Is there any way that-
Officer- that maybe you could forget about this?
Because I'm really a good person.
You can come down to the Blue Iguana.
They let LAPD all the time for free,
'cause we're a clean club.
- Is that right?
- Eddie gets mad.
Our managers sometimes can't get them out of the club because they like it so much.
My friend Jo works with a lot of LAPD guys.
- She's really beautiful-
- I'm going to ask-
- She'd really like you.
- I'm happy to hear that.
Stay by the car for a couple of minutes while I go run the license and registration, all right?
- Okay. Is that necessary?
- It is. I'll be back.
Officer, is this going to be on the news-
No, no.
It's gonna be okay.
I really can't- I don't-
I always wanted to be in the Enquirer but not for getting arrested.
I thought maybe if I had a handsome hunk or a nice dress...
Is there- is-
- Shit!
- It won't take a minute.
Okay.
Shit!
- Hi, Eddie.
- Where's Jasmine?
She wasn't feeling too well.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
- Oh fuck!
- What's the matter?
Fuck! Fuck!
- You have to go to work?
- No. No.
You want me to call your boss?
- I'll call him.
- No! Fuck off. No!
- Don't call him.
- Fuck off. What's his name?
Nothing.
Okay, I'd like to talk to Mr. Nothing, please?
- No!
- Okay.
Don't.
I want to stay here.
Okay. All right.
But I want to smoke.
You have a great ass.
You can hit it.
I don't want to hit it.
I want to kiss it.
You want to kiss my ass?
Thank you.
Hi, Eddie.
Sorry I'm late.
Better make it good, girl.
I have very bad cramps.
- Yeah, really bad cramps.
- I'm here.
That's a prize winner.
You're here late, God damn it!
Where the fuck were you?
You couldn't call?
I need VIP night off.
Goddamn, you're priceless.
Eddie, I can't work anyway.
My cramps are so bad.
Your cramps are killing you!
How long have you worked here?
You've worked here a year, right?
When was the last time you got off for cramps?
- Never!
- What's your problem?
What's my problem? I don't want you to tell me a goddamn lie!
- Jo and Angel have-
- This ain't about Jo and Angel!
I run this motherfucker.
I'm asking you what the goddamn deal really is.
So don't tell me about no fucking period!
I can't. I can't. I can't.
I'll come back on Monday.
I'll work the rest of the week.
- I need the weekend off.
- Tomorrow night, you're dancing.
You're one of my star girls.
I need you.
You come in late and ask for tomorrow off?
- What's the big deal?
- I need to know!
What?
The truth.
The goddamn truth.
Don't fuck with me, Jasmine.
You tell me what's up.
I can't. I can't.
What the fuck do you care about anyway?
You don't care about anyone else in here!
I care because I care,
God damn it!
Don't treat me like trash!
I'm not- I have a life and I need the weekend off.
You ain't got no life!
This is your life!
You got that?
You ain't got no friends.
Two minutes after you walk out of here, one of your double-crossing friends will come in here and snitch on your ass!
- Don't fuck with me.
- I fucking quit!
- God damn you!
- Sorry.
- Don't fuck my shit up!
- You have your life. I have mine.
You ain't got a life!
Miss Willow?
It's Sarah.
- Miss Willow?
Becky?
Hello?
- Hey, it's me.
Okay, let's see...
I've taken care of the registration.
We're both signed up.
I got our names signed up.
So, I put your name up there for the open read.
Don't be scared, there's a lot of people, but there's strength in numbers.
It will be really good.
Call me back so I know what time to get together with you. Bye.
- Jimmy, what's your favorite?
- And God Spoke.
- Is that a fuck movie?
- This place looks a little different.
Hey, Eddie, what it is?
Go to my car and get the box I left in there.
- No problem.
- Bobby...
What?
Start things up with this.
Call Jo.
I'm not calling her.
You want to call her?
Call her.
All right, I'll call her.
You're bringing her back to work?
We need everybody.
You got to rent
Behind the Green Door,
'cause the trapeze scene is hot.
Bobby, did you see the glasses on my desk?
I saw them sitting there last night.
- They ain't here.
- I don't have them.
The motherfucking broads!
Maybe the girls borrowed them for the opera.
Hey, how are you?
Hey, Eddie!
- This is Nico.
- Let me help you.
Let me get you a place here.
- That's Angel's seat.
- It used to be.
- That's Angel's stuff.
- Let me know if you need anything.
Excuse me?
- That's Angel's seat.
- Eddie gave it to me.
Hello, porn star?
- This is Angel's seat.
- Mind your own business.
Don't start with me again.
Will I have to haul you back to work?
- Get your ass out on the floor!
- Fuck you!
You should take care of this.
Everybody takes advantage of Angel.
Oh, that's so sweet.
- $15, please.
- I'd like to see Jasmine.
- What?
- I'd like to see Jasmine.
Is it important?
We're busy tonight.
- Yeah. I'm a friend of hers.
- Hold on a second.
Hey, Jasmine.
You got a Dennis out front.
You want me to toss him?
No, I'm on next, aren't I?
Give him a good seat.
He can watch me.
I'll throw the little boy to the lions.
Ladies and gentlemen, let's keep going.
Please welcome to the stage, Jasmine!
Something I can do for you tonight?
How much for a blow?
100 bucks.
Yeah, I can handle that.
Look at me.
Look at my eyes.
Yeah.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Do you want to sit down?
Sure.
I'm so sorry.
No, there's nothing to be sorry about.
No.
There's nothing to be sorry about.
I'm looking at this room with you in it...
I feel safe.
I feel safe now.
Make love to me.
- I can't. I can't.
- Okay.
- I'm getting married-
- Shh...
Nico!
Yes, is Harry Goldberg in?
Yes, Ed Hazel.
I'm a friend.
Has he gone away?
No.
Yeah.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
Ladies and gentlemen, the fabulous Nico, the one and only.
Ladies and gentlemen, the heavenly Angel!
Are you Angel?
I think you're up.
Okay, never mind.
Hey, fellows, how is it going?
Excuse my breasts, I'm lactating.
I can't get too excited,
'cause then my rubber rolls up.
Dave!
Don't move.
It's you, isn't it?
Dave!
Don't move.
Dave, can you help me with my money?
Please, could you pick it up? Don't move!
That Angel, everybody.
Show her your love.
It's the one- the flowers-
Jasmine, it's the guy- the flower guy is out there.
Oh my God, he's the most dreamy thing.
You know, the guy with the red dress?
Do you have anything to straighten me out?
Fuck!
What? What?
Wait a minute.
What are you going away for?
Wait a minute!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Oh my God.
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Jessie?
Yeah?
I can't sleep.
Are you okay?
Jo:
Do you want to come join me?
Sure.
Sing something.
Do you have a light?
Yeah.
Thank you.
You can go home now.
- Can I?
- Yeah.
What time is it?
I don't know.
Why are you still here?
- Why are you still here?
- Good fucking question.
Who knows?
I guess I fell asleep.
Is that what happened?
Yeah, you were asleep for a long time.
Could be worse.
You have pretty hair.
Thanks.
I'm sorry, I forgot your name.
So do I.
It's...
Nico.
- Nico.
- Yeah.
What are you writing?
What?
I'm just trying to keep you here.
I hate this part.
- Going home?
- No.
It's an awkward fucking transition, you know?
It's like- it's just three more hours till sunset- sunrise.
Where's your next gig?
You travel around a lot, right?
Yeah.
So where do you live?
At a hotel.
Hotels.
Where do you live?
I lost my house.
No big deal.
What are you writing?
What?
You write, right?
That's what you do.
You write.
You're a writer.
It's so fucking funny.
I mean, you writers, you all write and you never want to read what you wrote.
So you strip all night here and then you sit back here and write.
I'm safe.
I won't remember it tomorrow.
Is it a song?
No, I don't write songs.
Is it a story?
No.
I write poems.
Poetry.
I have a friend-
I had a friend who used to write poetry.
He used to call me and he'd read them to me.
He wrote really good poems.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
It's hard to write good poems.
It would really... be nice to hear a poem again.
Please?
"When light shattered across the floor
And briefly, there was a thunder between us,
If your eyes had held water, it would have not spilled.
And when we peeled aside the dreams, the skin underneath was still young.
When all was black, you smoothed aside the words and said,
It's there, the light.
When you want it, it'll be waiting for you. '
A certain peace came into your eyes
That this was no different,
That this was so different, yet every bit the same,
And your hands stilled with satisfaction.
You did this without touch,
So that, all around me, your hands stood shaped like shelters.
All around me there was room,
And after each hour, the hallways outside were like caverns.
And around the corner and down the stairs, there lurked as always
Light, as ever, light. "
Is it about a guy?
No.
Is it about you?
No.
Maybe.
I'm sorry, I just had a bad day.
- You have a light?
- Yeah.
What is it about?
It's about-
It's about-
You know how-
You know, like when you're in here, and it's always dark.
It's always like 1:00 a. m.
It's about... morning... stuff inside you.
Stuff inside you.
Me too.
It's a nice poem.
Thank you.
You know what a cryptographer is?
Bobby:
I never paid attention in school.
It's a code breaker.
During the war.
That's what Harry was.
There are only two or three of them in the whole world.
And Harry was one of them.
He was the best, man.
That shit's going to kill you, boy.
I hope so.
- You want to get something to eat?
- Sure.
You know,
I'll give that old Jew one thing.
I hope to God, when I'm that old,
I'll still love pussy like he does.
Even if I have to use binoculars to see it.
Have you ever sang?
- Sang?
- Yeah.
Like, in public, in front of people?
- Yeah, a long time ago.
- You did?
Did you get nervous?
Yeah.
'Cause Jessie's going over to Dimples this afternoon.
They know a place over in Burbank- karaoke- and a bunch of the girls are going. So...
- Our girls?
- Yeah.
Jessie said everybody can sing, so I thought-
Eddie:
Fuck, our girls can sing?
God damn!
This Russian motherfucker got shot.
And some shot.
Right through the heart.
In the window of his house in Woodland Hills.
Bobby:
Quick way to go.
I thought if you weren't doing anything, if you'd drop by, we could do it together.
Like a duet.
Frank and Sammy kind of thing.
- What time is it?
Ah no, man.
I'll be asleep.

I'm voting for Dukakis.
Hmm.
Well.
Maybe when you have children of your own who need braces, and you can't afford them because half your husband's pay goes to the federal government,
- you'll regret that.
- My husband's pay?
[Laughs]
I'm not gonna squeeze one out till I'm, like, 30.
Will you still be working at the Yarn
Barn? Great place to raise kids!
That's really funny.
A year of partying's enough.
She's going to Harvard next fall.
Mom, I haven't gotten in yet.
You think Dukakis will provide for this country till you squeeze one out?
Yeah. I do.
- Can I squeeze one out?
- Not till eighth grade.
Excuse me.
Donnie, you're such a click.
Whoa, Elizabeth.
A little hostile there.
Mom and Dad should pay a therapist
$200 an hour to listen to you so we don't have to.
OK. Wanna tell Mom and Dad why you stopped your medication?
- You're such a fuck-ass.
- What?!
- Please.
- Did he call me a fuck-ass?
- Hey.
- That's enough.
- Go suck a fuck.
- How does one do that?
- Want to know?
- Yes.
We will not have this at the table.
[Mom] Stop!
[Elizabeth stifles a laugh]
- What's a fuck-ass?
- [Dad laughs]
[knock at door]
[softly] Hi.
I'm reading. Get out.
Where do you go at night?
Will you get out of my room?
Did you toilet-paper the Johnsons'?
- You came to ask me that?
- No.
I stopped rolling houses in sixth grade.
What happened to my son?
I don't recognise this person.
You start taking the goddamn pills!
[Door slams]
Bitch.
Our son just called me a bitch.
You're not a bitch.
You're bitching, but you're not a bitch.
[Sighs]
I want to be a president who makes sure
we never again do business with a Panamanian dictator.
- That we never again funnel aid...
- Dukakis.
- Son of a bitch.
- Panama is friendly.
- I talked to Panama's president...
- Tell him, George!
...about cleaning up their money-laundering.
Mr. Noriega was there, but there was no evidence...
[clock chimes]
[ghostly voice] Wake up.
I've been watching you.
Come closer.
Closer.
28 days, six hours,
42 minutes,
12 seconds.
That is when the world will end.
Why?
[Buzzing]
[car drives off]
[sighs]
[rumbling and crashing]
[glass shatters]
[alarm]
[panting]
Son?
Son? Donnie Darko?
Donnie Darko?
- What's going on?
- Who is it?
It's Eddie Darko's kid.
I'm sorry about this. He's a local kid.
- Guess he was sleep-golfing.
- [Both laugh]
Watch out for that drool spot.
Are you all right, son?
Let's stay off the links at night, OK?
I'm sorry, Dr. Fisher. It won't happen again.
- I hate kids.
- Let's golf.
[Sirens]
[girl] Donnie! Donnie! Donnie!
What happened to your house?
- No-one's allowed through...
- This is my house!
He's OK.
[Girl] Donnie, we know you're OK!
[Reporter] Channel 6 News.
We have just arrived on the scene...
Wait a minute. Here's your brother.
- Oh!
- It fell in your room.
Watch yourself down there!
Mrs. Darko? I'm Bob Garland. I'm with the FAA.
- You're what?
- I'm with the FAA.
We'd like to speak to you and Mr. Darko privately.
- In private?
- Please.
All right.
And... here.
- You got it.
- OK.
We have arranged for you to stay at a hotel, get some sleep.
- We will take care of things here.
- Thank you.
[Dad] Kids, we're going to a hotel.
They don't know where it came from.
[TV announcer] Transportation authorities have begun a search...
Frankie Feeder.
...no airline will claim...
You remember him?
From high school.
Hmm.
He died.
- On his way to the prom.
- Mm.
- Remember?
- Mm-hm.
They said he was doomed.
Mm.
Jesus.
They could have said the same thing about Donnie.
[TV news continues]
If it fell from a plane, then what happened to the plane?
They don't know, Samantha.
Mrs. Farmer will bring you home after practice.
Bye, honey.
Donnie. Good luck.
Oh, my God. Tell me everything.
- I'm not allowed to.
- Oh, my God.
- Hi, Cherita.
- Shut up.
Darko cheats death, uh?
You're like a celebrity, man.
I kept calling you. Where you been?
We stayed at a hotel.
My dad saw you at the golf course.
You sleepwalking again?
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Now you're famous, have a smoke.
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad?
You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
- Goddamn right I will.
- So grotty.
Hey, Cherita. You want a cigarette?
- Shut up!
- Shut up!
Go back to China, bitch.
Just leave her alone.
Some good shit, huh?
It's a fucking cigarette.

"There would be headlines in the papers."
"Even the guys who ran the betting at the wrestling and the barrow boys would hear with respect how Old Misery's house had been destroyed."
"It was as though this plan had been with him all his life, pondered through the seasons, now in his 15th year crystallised with the pain of puberty."
What is Graham Greene trying to communicate with this passage?
Why did the children break into Old Misery's house?
- Joanie?
- They wanted to rob him.
Joanie, if you had actually read the story, which at 13 pages would have taken you all night, you would know the children find a great deal of money in the mattress.
But they burn it.
Donnie Darko, perhaps with your recent brush with mass destruction you can give us your opinion.
Well, they say when they flood the house and tear it to shreds that destruction is a form of creation, so the fact that they burn the money is ironic.
They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.
They wanna change things.
[Door opens]
May we help you?
I just registered. They put me in the wrong English class.
You look like you belong here.
Um, where do I sit?
Next to the boy you think is the cutest.
- [Excited voices]
- Quiet. Let her choose.
Joanie, get up.
The construction guys say it'll take a week to fix the roof.
That airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
- They still don't know?
- Know what?
Where it came from.
No. Apparently they can't tell us what happened yet.
Something about a matching serial number that got burned.
I had to sign a form saying
I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
We're not supposed to tell anyone what nobody knows?
Yeah.
But you tell...
What's your doctor's name?
- Dr. Thurman, Dad.
- Yes.
You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.
- Dad.
- What?
Dad!
[Dog barking]
No mail today. Maybe tomorrow.
[Whispers]
Well, what did she say to you?
- I made a new friend.
- Real or imaginary?
Imaginary...
Would you like to talk about him?
- Frank.
- Frank.
- What did Frank say?
- To follow him.
- Where?
- Into the future.
And then what happens?
And then he said...
Then he said the world was coming to an end.
Do you think it is?
No.
That's stupid.
[TV] For my entire life I was a victim of fear.
Love.
I was feeding fear through food.
Fear.
Finally I looked in the mirror.
Not just in the mirror. I looked through the mirror.
In that image I saw my ego reflection.
I thought ten-year-olds normally wet the bed.
- [Snorts]
- Shh!
The solution was there all the time.
I'm not afraid any more!
All over America, people have come together to join hands.
People who believe that human life is absolutely too important,
too valuable and too precious to be controlled by fear.
Hello.
My name is Jim Cunningham.
Welcome to Controlling Fear.
[Frank] Wake up, Donnie.
"And the prince was led into a world of strange and beautiful magic."
Hey, guess what!
I can't believe it!
The school is closed today because it's flooded.
- No way.
- Yes.
Holy shit! That's the best news I've ever heard.
My God. Is this ever gonna stop?
Eventually, yes. But I've got
12 classrooms full of water, all coming from a busted water main.
- What else?
- What else?!
Principal Cole, I'll show you what else.
- Unbelievable.
- That's solid bronze, isn't it?
How did this happen?
The boys' locker room was flooded.
They found faeces everywhere.
- What are faeces?
- Baby mice.
Hey.
Has anyone ever told you that you're sexy?
- I like your boobs.
- [Boys laugh]
Hey.
Hey.
School's cancelled.
Do you want to walk me home?
Sure.
- Don't look so freaked.
- I'm not.
Check your backpack.
Those guys love to steal shit.
- Why did you move here?
- My parents got a divorce.
My mom got a restraining order against my stepdad.
- He has emotional problems.
- Me too. What kind does he have?
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
Oh. Did he go to jail?
No, he fled. They still can't find him.
Mom and I had to change our names.
I thought Gretchen Ross was cool.
I was in jail once.
I accidentally burned down this house.
It was abandoned, but still...
I got held back in school,
I can't drive till I'm 21.
But I'm over all of that. I...
I'm painting and stuff. Writing.
I want to be a writer. Maybe a painter.
Maybe both.
I'll write a book and draw the pictures.
Then maybe people will understand me. Change things.
Donnie Darko?
What the hell kind of name is that?
It's like some sort of superhero.
What makes you think I'm not?
Look, I should go.
Monnitoff wants me to write this physics essay.
Greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
If it's Monnitoff, that's easy. Antiseptics.
The whole sanitation thing.
Joseph Lister, 1895.
Before antiseptics there was no sanitation.
- Especially in medicine.
- You mean soap?
I'm really glad school was flooded today.
Why's that?
You and I would never have had this conversation.
You're weird.
Sorry.
No, that was a compliment.
Well, look, um...
You wanna go with me?
[Laughs nervously]
Where do you wanna go?
I mean, like, go with me. You know...
That's what we call it here.
- Going together...
- Sure.
OK. Where are you going?
I'm going home.
So stupid!
I'd like to try something new this time.
Have you ever been hypnotised?
No.
When I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
Yes.
So, tell me about your week.
I met a girl.
- What is her name?
- Gretchen.
We're going together now.
Do you still think about girls a lot?
Yeah.
How are things going at school?
I think about girls a lot.
I asked you about school, Donnie.
I think about fucking a lot during school.
What else do you think about during school?
- Married With Children.
- Do you think about your family?
I turn down the volume and think about fucking Christina Applegate.
I asked you about your family, Donnie.
No. [Laughs]
I don't think about fucking my family.
That's gross.
I'd like to hear about your friend Frank.
Sam Bylen.
[Clears throat]
Donald Darko.
Daye Dennis.
Hey, you fuck.
Did you tell them I flooded the school?
- I didn't say shit.
- They think I did it.
If you're innocent, you have nothing to worry about.
Fuck you! Know what I think?
I think you did it.
[Coughs]
Beer and pussy. That's all I need.
We gotta find ourselves a Smurfette.
- Smurfette?
- Mm-hm.
Not some tight-assed Middlesex chick.
A cute little blonde that'll get down and dirty with the guys.
- Like Smurfette does.
- Smurfette doesn't fuck.
Smurfette fucks the other smurfs.
Why did Papa Smurf make her?
Because all the other smurfs were getting too horny.
Not Vanity. I heard he was a homosexual.
OK, she fucks them while Vanity watches. OK?
What about Papa Smurf?
He must get in on the action.
He does. He films the gangbang.
Later on he beats off to the tape.
First of all, Papa Smurf didn't create
Smurfette. Gargamel did.
She was sent in as Gargamel's spy, to destroy the smurf village.
But the overwhelming goodness of smurf life transformed her.
And as for the whole gangbang scenario, it just couldn't happen.
Smurfs are asexual.
They don't even have... reproductive organs under those little white pants.
That's what's so illogical about being a smurf.
What's the point of living if you don't have a click?
Dammit, Donnie, why you gotta get so smart on us?
- [Car horn]
- Grandma Death.
Excuse me! Excuse me!
Stay off the road, Miss Sparrow.
I'll have to call social services.
I hate that Miss Farmer.
She's such a fucking bitch.
Yeah.
- How old is Grandma Death?
She does the same thing every day.
Just walks back and forth, back and forth to the mailbox.
And nothing ever in there.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
She's going back to the box.
We may still have mail.
- Mail, mail.
- Here it is.
This could be it. Oh!
No dice, Grandma. Sorry.
Someone ought to write that bitch.
[TV announcer] Authorities continued their search
for a suspect in the school vandalism.
The school has asked for donations to help restore its mascot,
known only as the Mongrel.
In cooperation with the county police, we have begun investigating the cause of the flooding and our suspects include several of our own students.
I want to know why this filth is being taught to our children.
[Breathing heavily]
Kitty, I would appreciate if you would wait...
Dr. Cole, not only am I a teacher, but I am also a parent of a Middlesex child.
I am the only person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
[Frank] Don't worry.
You got away with it.
I have in my hand Graham Greene's The Destructors.
This short story is part of my daughter's English assignment.
In this story, several children destroy an elderly man's house from inside out.
How can you do that?
[Laughs nervously]
And how do they do this?
They flood the house by breaking through a water main.
[Frank] I can do anything I want.
And so can you.
We pay good money for this school.
It's our children.
I think this garbage should be removed.
Excuse me.
What's the real issue?
The PTA doesn't ban books.
The PTA is here to acknowledge that pornography is being taught.
- It's meant to be ironic.
- You need to go back to grad school.
Why did you make me flood the school?
They are in great danger.
Kitty, do you even know who Graham Greene is?
I think we have all seen Bonanza.
Well, uh... while we are on other topics...
Where did you come from?
Do you believe in time travel?
[Samantha] Who are you talking to?
I was just taking my pills, Sam.
[TV] It is time to breathe.
Thank you, Jim Cunningham.
Thank you, Jim Cunningham.
Now let us begin lifeline exercise NO.1.
Please press stop now.
As you can see, the lifeline is divided into two polar extremes.
Fear and love.
Fear is in the negative energy spectrum and love is in the positive energy spectrum.
- Duh!
- Excuse me?
"Duh" is a product of fear.
Now, on each card is a character dilemma which applies to the lifeline.
Please... Take this.
Thank you.
Please read each character dilemma aloud and place an X on the lifeline in the appropriate place.
Cherita?
"Juanita has an important math test today."
"She has known about the test for several weeks but has not studied."
"In order to keep from failing her test,
Juanita decides that she will cheat on the math test."
Good. Good. Very good.
Um, Mr. Darko.
"Ling Ling finds a wallet filled with money."
"She takes the wallet to the address inside but keeps the money."
[Sighs] I'm sorry, Miss Farmer.
I don't get this.
Place an X in the appropriate place.
No, I know what to do. I don't get this.
You can't lump things into two categories.
The lifeline is divided that way.
Life isn't that simple.
Who cares if Ling Ling returns the wallet and keeps the money?
It has nothing to do with fear or love.
Fear and love are the deepest human emotions.
OK. But you're not listening to me.
Other things need to be taken into account.
Like the whole spectrum of human emotion.
You can't lump everything into two categories and deny everything else.
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
Donald.
Let me preface this by saying that your Iowa Test scores are... intimidating.
So... let's go over this again.
What exactly did you say to Mrs. Farmer?
I'll tell you what he said.
He asked me to forcibly insert the exercise card into my anus.
[Laughs then coughs]
[woman] These are modern times.
My political attitudes are forthright.
If there's a vice presidential candidate worthy of my vote, it's Dan Quayle.
Nobody cares about responsibility, morality, family values...
Kitty...
Excuse us, please.
He's suspended from after-school activities for six months.
Ever since this jet engine fiasco
I don't know what's gotten into him.
Rose, our daughters have been on the dance team together for two years and I respect you as a woman.
But after witnessing your son's behaviour, I have doubts about your...
Our paths through life must be righteous.
I urge you to go home and look in the mirror, and pray that your son doesn't succumb to the path of fear.
[Elizabeth] Do you remember that weird gym teacher Mrs. Farmer?
Yeah.
My brother told her to shove a book up her ass today.
And then my parents just bought him all this new shit.
I know. I wish a jet engine would fall in my room.
[Frank] I can show you the way.
[Bells chime]
Yeah.
[Boys laugh]
- Dr. Monnitoff?
- Donnie.
Um, I know this is gonna sound kinda weird, but uh... do you know anything about time travel?
Ah! A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is theoretically a wormhole in space controlled by man.
So, according to Hawking, a wormhole may be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space time.
So to travel back in time, you have to have a spaceship that can travel faster than light.
- Theoretically.
- And be able to find a wormhole.
The principles of time travel are there.
You've got a vessel, a portal.
The vessel can be anything.
Probably a spacecraft.
- Like a DeLorean.
- Any metal craft.
I love that movie, the way they shot it.
It's so futuristic, you know.
Listen... don't tell anybody I gave you this.
The woman who wrote this used to teach here.
She was a nun many years before that.
Then overnight she became this entirely different person.
She up and left the church, she wrote this book.
She started teaching science.
Right here in Middlesex.
The Philosophy Of Time Travel.
Roberta Sparrow?
That's right.
[Laughs] Come on.
Roberta Sparrow.
Roberta Sparrow...
Grandma Death.
It's called The Philosophy Of Time Travel.
What does philosophy have to do with time travel?
- Let me see.
- Guess who wrote it.
Roberta Sparrow?
Huh! She wrote a book!
Grandma Death wrote a book.
That's a terrible nickname.
We almost hit her with the car.
She lives in that piece of crap house and you know she's loaded.
- She's...
- You're right.
She used to be known for her gem collection.
Kids... used to go up there and try to steal stuff from her.
She became a total recluse.
I didn't know she was alive till we damn near knocked her down.
[Donny] She was standing in the road, frozen, so I got out of the car and walked over to see if she was OK.
She leaned over and whispered in my ear.
- What did she say?
- Frank wants me to talk to her.
He asked me if I knew about time travel.
She wrote a book about it, so it can't be a coincidence.
What did Roberta Sparrow say to you?
She said every creature on earth dies alone.
How did that make you feel?
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
She died when I was eight.
She crawled underneath the porch.
To die?
To be alone.
Do you feel alone right now?
I...
I'd like to believe I'm not, but I just...
I've just never seen any proof, so I...
I just don't debate it any more.
I could spend my whole life debating it over and over and I still wouldn't have any proof, so I just... I just don't debate it any more.
[Laughs] It's absurd.
The search for God is absurd?
It is if everyone dies alone.
Does that scare you?
I don't want to be alone.
His tapes have made me realise that for the last 39 years I have been a prisoner of my own fear.
- Fear?
- [Sighs]
Rose, you have got to meet this Jim Cunningham.
I can't believe he's single.
[TV] It has been a disappointing night for these Super Bowl champions.
Coach Joe Gibbs is on the sidelines, water dripping off his glasses.
He'll be thinking, "What went wrong tonight?"
- Here's the kick.
- [Men groan]
And it's no good.
We need a quarterback. And a miracle.
We need to go for a safety.
Mark Rypien has some big shoes to fill.
He sure does.
You guys want anything?
I'm gonna get a beer.
[TV commentary continues]
[TV announcer] Good evening, ladies and ghouls.
Join us at the Middlesex pavilion hall
for the Middlesex Halloween Haunt.
[Ghoulish laughter]
[laughs]
[aeroplane]
What if you could go back in time and take all the pain and darkness and replace it with something better?
- Images?
- Yeah. Like a Hawaiian sunset or the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful...
You know, we've been going together for two weeks.
Yeah.
Well, I uh...
Do you wanna kiss me?
Uh...
- I... Sorry...
- Donnie, wait. I just...
I just want it to be at a time when it...
- When what?
- When it reminds me of...
When it reminds you how beautiful the world can be?
Yeah.
And right now there's some fat guy staring at us.
Thank you for seeing us at such late notice.
We both felt it was time to come in and discuss...
What I think is going on with your son?
Yes.
Um... Well, he's uh...
You know about his past, and he was suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher.
I'm not sure that's a good example.
He had just cause to insult...
Rose, let me just lay out what I believe is happening here.
Donnie's aggressive behaviour... his increased detachment from reality... seem to stem from his inability to cope with the forces in the world that he perceives to be threatening.
Has he ever told you about his friend Frank?
Frank?
The giant bunny rabbit.
What?
I don't recall him ever having mentioned a rabbit.
Donnie is experiencing what is called a daylight hallucination.
This is a common occurrence among paranoid schizophrenics.
What can we do?
I would like to do more hypnotherapy.
And increase his medication.
[Thunderclap]
Whatever will help him, really, because that's why we're here.
We just would like him to experience some... relief.
So if you think that more medication will do that, then I think we should give it a try.
[Bells chime]
Donnie Darko.
I know.
[Both laugh]
[music and applause]
- Good morning, you Mongrels.
- Good morning.
Is that all the gusto you can muster?
Good morning!
Good morning.
Now, that's a tiny bit better.
But I can sense some students who are afraid to say good morning.
[Students] Good morning!
That's what I like to hear!
Entirely too many young men and women today are completely paralysed by their fears.
They surrender their bodies to the temptation and destruction of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex.
Now, I'm gonna tell you a little story today.
It's a heartbreakingly sad story about a young man whose life was completely destroyed by these instruments of fear.
A young man searching for love in all the wrong places.
His name was Frank.
Um, my stepsister...
I sometimes worry that she eats too much.
- Shut up, Kim.
- Sweetheart, please.
- What can I do when I grow up?
- That's a hard one.
How do I learn how to fight?
"How do I learn how to fight?"
Son, violence is a product of fear.
- Learn to truly love yourself.
- OK.
- Get up here.
- OK.
All right.
- Good morning.
- [Jim] Good morning.
Um, how much are they paying you to be here?
Excuse me?
What is your name, son?
Gerald.
Gerald, I think you're afraid.
Are you telling us this so we buy your book? It's the worst advice I heard.
You see how sad this is?
Want your sister to lose weight? Tell her to get off the couch and exercise.
No-one knows what to do when they grow up.
It takes a while to find that out. Right, Jim?
And you.
Yeah, you.
You sick of some jerk picking on you?
Maybe you should lift weights or do karate.
Next time he tries, kick him in the balls.
[Gasps]
[Jim laughs] Son.
Do you see this?
This is an anger prisoner.
A textbook example.
See the fear, people?
This boy is scared of the truth.
Son, it breaks my heart to say this, but I believe you are a very troubled and confused young man.
You were searching for the answers in the wrong places.
You're right, actually. I am pretty troubled and pretty confused.
And I'm afraid. Really afraid. Really afraid.
But I think you're the fucking Antichrist.
[Shocked gasps]
Get him out of here!
Who do you think you are?
[Whistling and cheering]
It's amazing.
The man thinks he's telling the truth.
Everything he says is a fucking lie.
Everything he says.
Everyone thinks he's so rad.
He's such a chud.
- Everything...
- Are you OK?
- Yeah...
- Sit down. Calm down.
You ever hear of Grandma Death?
Who?
The Philosophy Of Time Travel.
What is this?
She wrote it.
I'm...
I've been seeing stuff.
Like a lot of really messed-up stuff.
Chapters in there describe what
I've seen. It can't be a coincidence.
[Monnitoft] Each vessel travels along a vector through space time, along its centre of gravity.
Like a spear?
- Pardon?
- A spear coming out of your chest.
Um... sure, yeah.
For the vessel to travel through time, it's got to find a portal, in this case a wormhole...
Could these portals just appear anywhere, any time?
I think that's highly unlikely.
What you're talking about is an act of God.
If God controls time, time's pre-decided.
- I don't follow.
- Every living thing has a set path.
And if you could see your path or channel, you could see into the future.
Like... a form of time travel.
You're contradicting yourself, Donnie.
If we were able to see our destinies manifest themselves visually, then we would be given a choice to betray our chosen destinies.
The fact that this choice exists would make all pre-formed destiny come to an end.
Not if you travel in God's channel.
Um... I'm not going to be able to continue this conversation.
- Why?
- I could lose my job.
OK.
[Birdsong]
[laughs]
Now you know where he lives.
And they grow out of our chest... solar plexus?
Like she described in the book.
The way they moved and smelled...
Like they're workers.
Assigned to each one of us.
They just... They're like liquid.
I followed it... into my parents' bedroom.
What did you find?
Nothing.
So we call them IMGs.
Infant Memory Generators.
So you buy the glasses for an infant and they wear them when they sleep.
But inside the glasses are these slide photographs, and each one is of something peaceful or beautiful, whatever the parents want to put inside.
What effect would this have on an infant?
Well, nobody remembers their infancy.
Anyone who says they do is lying.
We think this'll develop memory earlier in life.
Yeah.
Did you consider that darkness is part of infants' natural development?
No.
Yeah.
What if the parents put in pictures of Satan?
Dead people, crap like that.
Is that what you'd show your kids?
Uh, well, I mean... didn't your dad stab your mom?
Ha ha ha ha!
Get out.
Gretchen!
Gretchen. Gretchen.
I'm sorry about those guys.
- Two for Evil Dead, please.
- Two dollars.
[Slow, heavy banging]
Why do you wear that stupid bunny suit?
Why are you wearing that stupid man's suit?
Take it off.
What happened to your eye?
I'm so sorry.
Why do they call you Frank?
It's the name of my father... and his father before me.
Frank?
When's this gonna stop?
You should already know that.
[Laughs nervously]
Watch the movie screen.
There's something I want to show you.
Have you ever seen a portal?
[Clock chimes]
Burn it to the ground.

[Police radio]
Captain, looks like we got another room back here.
[TV announcer] The blaze was extinguished sometime after 8 p.m.
Firefighters discovered what has been called a "kiddie porn dungeon."
Cunningham, who has become a celebrity for his books and tapes,
was arrested this morning...
Oh, my God!
Arson has not been ruled out as the cause of the fire.
A group of Cunning Vision employees...
Dad played golf with that guy.
...denied alleged links to a child pornography publishing circuit.
In a vicious statement, Cunningham attacked fire department officials,
claiming a vast conspiracy.
[Dr. Cole] Karen, we don't think the methods you've used are appropriate.
What exactly about my methods do you find inappropriate?
I don't have time for a debate.
I believe I've made myself clear.
You call this clarity?
You don't have a clue what it's like to communicate with kids.
And we are losing them to apathy.
To this prescribed nonsense.
They're slipping away.
I am sorry that you have failed.
If you'll excuse me, I have another appointment.
You can finish out the week.
[Screams]
Good afternoon.
It gives me great pleasure to announce that the school dance team has been invited to perform on Ed McMahon's Star Search '88 in Los Angeles, California.
No, it was ridiculous...
I'll call you back.
- Rose.
- Kitty.
I'm sure you're aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
I saw it on TV.
Something about a kiddie porn...
Oh, please! Don't use those words!
It's obviously a conspiracy to destroy an innocent man.
I am going to spearhead the
Jim Cunningham defence campaign.
Rose, I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning.
The girls are scheduled to leave for Los Angeles in the morning.
As their coach, I was the obvious choice to chaperone them...
But now you can't go.
- Yes.
- Hm.
Now, believe me, of all the other mothers,
I wouldn't dream of asking you.
But none of the other mothers are available to go.
I don't know, Kitty.
It's a bad weekend. Eddie's in New York.
Rose, I don't know if you realise what an opportunity this is for our daughters.
This has been a dream of Samantha's and all of ours for a long time.
I made her lead dancer.
Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion.
Elizabeth will be in charge.
She'll drive you to therapy.
And if you need anything, promise me you will call Dr. Thurman.
OK.
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
It feels wonderful.
What do I tell the others when they ask about you?
Tell them everything is gonna be just fine.
What's "cellar door"?
[Sighs] This famous linguist once said that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history, that "cellar door" is the most beautiful.
"Cellar door"?
I promise that one clay everything's gonna be better for you.
Shut up!
- I want to talk about your past today.
- No.
I want to talk about you and your parents.
They didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas.
What did you want for Christmas that year?
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
How did you feel, being denied these Hungry Hungry Hippos?
Regret.
What else makes you feel regret?
That I did it again.
You did it again?
I flooded my school and I burned down that pervert's house.
[Laughs]
I only have a few clays before they catch me.
Did Frank tell you to do these things?
I have to obey him. He saved my life.
I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone, and then... and then I won't be able to figure out what this is all about.
I won't be able to know his master plan.
Do you mean God's master plan?
Do you now believe in God?
I have the power to build a time machine.
How is that possible?
How is time travel possible, Donnie?
Time's up, Frank said.
When is this going to happen?
Soon.
[Sobs] Soon.
What is going to happen?
[Sobs] Frank is gonna kill.
Who is he going to kill?
[Breathes heavily]
- Who is he going to kill?
- I can see him!
The sky is going to open up.
If the sky were to suddenly open up, there would be no law.
There would be no rule.
There would only be you and your memories.

Hey.

Horrible accident.
My neighbour... got killed.
What happened?
Got smooshed by a jet engine.
What was his name?
Donnie. Donnie Darko.
Hmm.
I feel bad for his family.
Yeah.
Did you know him?
No.
[Police radio]
Thank you, Charles.
Careful!
Thank you, young man.
At your service, Madame.
Such a gentleman...
I beg you, please. No!
Hercules, how could you do that to me? I begged you.
I just couldn't resist.
You couldn't resist?
I don't believe it!
Sylvia, what am I gonna do?
How can I ever explain it to him?
Regina, break it gently, then soak him for all he's worth.
I don't even care about the money.
REGGIE: All I ever wanted was someone--
JOSHUA: Excuse me.
JOSHUA: Does this belong to you?
SYLVIA: What's he gone and done?
He was creating a sophisticated surveillance system... behind the ladies' cabañas.
He's completely out of control.
It's all that nascent testosterone.
It's the scourge of the planet, that stuff. Herky, sit.
-Thanks for not turning him in.
-Oh, you're welcome.
See you.
Quitter.
-What?
-Nothing.
You called me a quitter.
You give up awful easy.
Yeah. Hi.
Can I ask your name now that we're in another country together?
-Regina Lambert.
-Joshua Peters.
REGGIE: Charmed.
I wanna ask you something quickly... and make it like ripping off a Band-Aid.
REGGIE: Go ahead.
JOSHUA: ls there a Mr. Regina?
-Not for long.
-Your ride didn't show?
Yeah. It's par for the course,
I'm afraid.
JOSHUA: Do you need a hand?
REGGIE: Yes.
REGGIE: Yes, that'd be great. Thank you.
-I'd invite you in, but it's not--
-I get it.
Nice neighbourhood. Fancy.
I'm off.
It was a pleasure meeting you.
Good luck.
It was really nice meeting you, too.
Something to remember me by.
REGGIE: "Caribbean."
I've just come back from there....
I guess you'll have to read it.
Find out what you've missed.
Maybe next time you're in Martinique you'll be single.
See you around, Reggie.
It's Regina, but that's okay.
REGGIE: Charles?
Honorine?
Charles!
Commandant Jeanne Dominique...
...of the Police Judiciaire.
This is Lieutenant Dessalines.
This is your husband?
Monsieur Charles Lambert?
DOMINIQUE: Your husband's body was found next to the train tracks... just outside of Montpellier.
Were you aware of his departure from France, Thursday?
REGGIE: Charles travels all the time.
His effects included a one-way airline ticket from Barcelona... to Caracas, Venezuela.
Also one to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Does he know anyone in Caracas? ln Rio?
Your husband was American?
Wait, no. Charles is Swiss.
Was Swiss.
-His profession?
-Art dealer.
DOMINIQUE: Where is his gallery?
He did most of his work over the telephone, on the computer....
-Okay. Family?
-I believe I'm all there is.
He was an orphan. An only child.
DOMINIQUE: Charles Lambert... was a wealthy man?
We live.... Lived quite well.
Why did you say his name like that?
Is this your husband's passport?
I believe so.
REGGIE: Yes.
You see? Switzerla.nd.
Swiss.
And this?
DOMINIQUE: And this?
And this?
Perhaps I will have that ciggy.
Forgive me, but you are married only three months?
-Is that illegal?
-And your marriage, a happy one?
I was about to ask Charles for a divorce, if you must know.
I see.
DOMINIQUE: How many financial accounts did you and your husband hold?
Why haven't you found the killer yet?
Where are my belongings, our furniture?
Why is my apartment empty?
Who tore it apart?
Your husband liquidated the contents of your flat... through three reputable auction houses and cashed the proceeds... roughly the equivalent of $1 .8 million, immediately.
Madame, there is not a. tra.ce of this money a.nywhere.
La. Direction Centra.Ie de la. Police
Judicia.ire is confident of this.
When we find the money, we find the killer.
Search him.
Stop! You're not permitted--
No. Nothing.
Okay, the cops don't have it, and Charlie's clean.
Then who the hell's got it?
DOMINIQUE: One Hermès wallet belonging to Charles Lambert... containing 1,000 French francs,
1,500 deutsche marks...
$300 U.S., 5,000 pesetas,
$50 Caribbean... the keys to Flat B....
DOMINIQUE: Your residence?
One trousse de toilette... containing the usual items, including one tube of Topol:
"The smoker's toothpolish."
-Yes.
-One letter stamped and sealed... addressed to you.
Addressed to me?
My dear Regina:
Today I'm off to Cannes.
Got a lead on a couple of Renoirs, maybe a Schnabel and a Basquiat.
Can't wait for your return.
Thought you might be amused by the enclosed clipping.
Love, Cha.rles.
PS: The tailor called.
Your dress is ready.
-Show me the clipping.
-There was none included.
We took the liberty of calling your tailor.
We felt perhaps we'd learn something.
REGGIE: Did you?
DOMINIQUE: Yes.
Your dress is ready.
His a.genda..
Cha.rles La.mbert's la.st da.y wa.s busy.
To us, largely meaningless.
"It is your right, as next of kin...
"to claim the possessions of the deceased at this time."
Et cetera. If you will sign.
Your cooperation today will be noted.
REGGIE: Noted?
REGGIE: Comma.nda.nt, I mean, do you actually believe...
I had something to do with my husband's death?
Ma.da.me, I'm sorry, but professionally...
I'm obliged to accept that possibility.
JOSHUA: Regina?
Joshua.
Your husband....
Reggie, I'm so sorry.
You terrified me.
I'm sorry.
I saw it on the news tonight.
This is the most horrific day of my life.
What a nightmare.
I've got to get out of here.
REGGIE: Next thing I know, caution's been thrown to the winds.
We're a.t the Porta.bella. retrospective in Berlin... visiting his old friends... in Uganda, Sarajevo, Montreal.
Impulse marriage at the Chelsea Registry Office.
It was all so exciting, so promising at first.
The whirlwind romance, move to Paris.
And then....
Then it seems like he's always off on business.
I'm mostly alone in this huge flat.
And now....
Now, I'm slightly drunk, I'm afraid.
-You're a good listener.
-No.
You're a good talker.
Have you ever been in love in Paris?
I can't say that I've had that pleasure.
Well, you're still young.
-Maybe you still have a chance.
-That'd be nice.
REGGIE: Yes, a bed. Thank God.
REGGIE: Thank you.
You are welcome.
JOSHUA: Sweet dreams, then.
REGGIE: What?
I'm gonna crash. Room 28, second floor, if you need me.
Sleep well, okay?
REGGIE: Charles' bag.
JOSHUA: What?
Sorry.
Good night, Reggie.
It's Regina, you know.
Nobody calls me Reggie.
Nobody at all?
Not till now, anyway.
Good.
Mr. Peters...
...a package for you.
Hold it for me, please?
My pleasure...
For me?
-Do something for me?
-Okay, I won't.
One moment, sir.
Sure thing.
May I ask what's up here?
I'm curious...
...about your relationship with Mrs. Lambert.
Unfortunately, we don't have one.
I just met her.
Already you're moving her into your hotel, tucking her in at night?
It's kind of a damsel-in-distress thing.
Yes, I know.
Slain husband, missing money.
-Cops breathing down her neck.
-Exactly.
And now the mysterious stranger.
Okay, fine. You're here on holiday?
Actually, I live here off and on.
She's a real beauty, isn't she?
I suppose she is, yes.
I always wonder with a woman like that... what kind of guy actually gets to go to bed with her.
In this case, a dead one, I guess.
Okay...
Surely you're not suspicious of her?
No.
-She just doesn't seem the type.
-Which type is that?
The murdering type?
Monsieur, I thank you.
Anytime, Commandant.
Good evening.
BARTHOLOMEW: I'll take that.
-Mr. Bartholomew?
-How do you do?
-Wait here, Pierre?
-Yes, sir.
Sorry our first meeting has to occur under such unhappy circumstances.
We have a great deal to cover, and I'm on a tight schedule today.
How are you holding up?
I'm bewildered, to tell you the truth.
BARTHOLOMEW:
French police bothering you?
They think I had something to do with this hideous--
We can't interfere there.
Not just now, anyway.
You'll have every protection the U.S. has to offer.
Protecting British citizens? lsn't that out of your jurisdiction?
BARTHOLOMEW: Your husband lent his services to us at the O.D.C.
The what?
The most secure talk space in town....
The O.D.C.
Office of Defense Cooperation.
We knew your husband by his real name, Charlie Lake.
BARTHOLOMEW: Now, Mrs. Lake, look at this photograph... and tell me if there's anyone you recognise.
BARTHOLOMEW: Have a good look.
REGGIE: Charles, of course.
BARTHOLOMEW: The other three?
Afraid not.
They worked with him almost three years ago... on an "operation" of an extraordinarily "delicate" nature.
I "get it."
I need to assess how precarious your situation is.
This gentleman who escorted you to your hotel last night.
A friend, Joshua Peters.
He has nothing to do with this.
-How long have you known him?
-Actually, I just met him.
Oh, boy.
Look, I don't mean to be intrusive.
We don't know what Charlie was up to, or who he was up to it with.
But we know $6 million is a great amount of money--
$6 million?
-Is that what this is about?
-Correct.
I want to make it clear even if we wanted to... which we don't, we couldn't force you to do it.
Your decision must be entirely your own.
-What decision?
-To work with us.
If you think I'm getting involved, you're absolutely bonkers.
-You're already involved, Mrs. Lake.
-Stop calling me that.
We want that money back,
Mrs. Lambert.
I don't have it.
Yes, you have it.
You just don't know you've got it.
A misplaced key to a safe-deposit box... a certified cheque in tomorrow's mail... a baggage claim ticket tucked in a paperback.
If you look for it, you'll find it.
You may not have a great deal of time, either.
People in that photo know you got it... just as surely as we do.
You won't be safe until that money is in our hands.
Is tha.t clea.r?
Here's my direct cell line.
Don't lose it.
Call me any time, day or night.
And this is crucial:
You mustn't betray the confidentiality of this dialogue.
You must not tell anyone about coming to see me.
Certainly. No problem.
I promise you.
It's clear that you're a decent person.
It's a rare quality, nowadays.
Tough situation you're in here.
I feel for you.
God bless.
DOMINIQUE: His agenda.
Charles Lambert's last day was busy.
To us, la.rgely mea.ningless.
REGGIE: 12.:00.
8, rue des Rosiers, Cligna.ncourt.
The flea. ma.rket.
Twenty-four.
Four. Okay.
Nine. So, then it must be....
Regina, right?
My name is Lola.
I knew your husband.
I see.
So, were you Charlie's trophy or his partner?
Do you know what I'm talking about when I say "Operation Verify"?
How about this:
46 Eppler-cut diamonds.
Believe it or not, Lola,
I don't want that money.
Okay, so you know about it, you just don't want it.
-I see.
-I may be the only one... but that's how it is.
Charlie ripped off some very dangerous people.
I don't know anything about my husband's business interests.
-I thought you said--
-I don't mean to be rude.
-Don't be.
-Are you finished?
Not quite.
See, your husband messed us up... something fierce.
Regina, am I getting through to you at all here?
JOSHUA: Reggie?
LOLA: Regina!
We earned that money.
We wa.nt it.
We deserve it.
JOSHUA: Are you all right?
Was that woman giving you a hard time?
REGGIE: You could say that. Yes, she was.
Joshua, what are you doing here?
I can't believe this. I saw you get in your cab, back in town.
I followed.
Almost lost you a couple of times.
Just caught up in time to see you coming here.
I really do seem to be caught up in a terrible mess.
Why are you here? ln this place?
I don't understand.
A notation in Charles's date book,
"8, rue des Rosiers."
I'm trying to make sense of his last day.
The places that he went to.
REGGIE: It's not just that he was murdered.
There's all this other money.
Government money tha.t's gone missing.
And there are other people who want it.
And that man is one of them.
So was the woman in the alley.
I'll get my messages, then I'll get that stuff from my room.
JOSHUA: I'll meet you upstairs?
REGGIE: Okay.
Have a good look.
I think you have something that belongs to me.
In here?
REGGIE: Joshua!
ZADAPEC: Wait!
REGGIE: Get your filthy--
ZADAPEC: I just want to open the bag!
JOSHUA: Reggie?
JOSHUA: Go!
REGGIE: Wait!
JOSHUA: Go.
Greetings!
Same to you.
Any fresh mint?
Certainly.
Excuse me.
-Hello?
-Mr. Bartholomew?
REGGIE: They're here. I sa.w them.
The ones in the photo.
Describe them to me, Mrs. Lambert.
Emil Zadapec.
Il-Sang Lee.
Lola Jansco.
BARTHOLOMEW: All very da.ngerous, highly ca.pa.ble individua.Is.
It's absolutely imperative that I see you as soon as possible.
JOSHUA: Reggie?
Coming! I've got to go.
-Please use extreme caution.
-Yes, I will. I promise.
JOSHUA: Everything all right?
REGGIE: What about you?
JOSHUA: Might be a bit wrinkled.
REGGIE: My dress.
JOSHUA: You okay now?
REGGIE: I'm still shaking.
REGGIE: What happened? What did you do?
JOSHUA: Nothing much.
JOSHUA: I don't think he'll be bothering you anymore.
How are you doing?
You know what's wrong with you?
What?
Absolutely nothing.
I feel a little funny about this.
My kisses are funny?
JOSHUA: No.
Are you hungry?
JOSHUA: Great.
REGGIE: I'm starving.
JOSHUA: I got lots to eat.
REGGIE: I'm gonna shower first.
JOSHUA: Okay.
Just make yourself at home, okay?
JOSHUA: Reggie?
How'd you know about those people today?
REGGIE: What?
JOSHUA: Those three.
And the missing money?
Where did you find out about all that?
Shoot.
REGGIE: Look....
I'm afraid I can't tell you.
I promised.
Promised? Who?
I'm sorry.
I want you to hear this.
It's Aznavour. You know him?
-Shoot the Pia.no Pla.yer, right?
-Exactly.
-Hello?
-Hello, Mrs. Lambert.
Don't ha.ng up on me.
Look, I'm sorry about the elevator.
REGGIE: I have nothing to say.
JOSHUA: Reggie?
ZADAPEC: We must talk.
JOSHUA: Who is it?
-The guy from the elevator.
-Give me the phone.
Wait, is that Dyle there?
REGGIE: Who?
ZADAPEC: Mr. Dyle?
Has he laid his "Charles Aznavour" routine on you yet?
What's he saying?
Yeah, that's right.
Okay, nobody wants to hurt you.
JOSHUA: What did he say?
ZADAPEC: All we want is what's ours, and we know that you have it.
Dyle's not to be trusted.
He wa.nts your money.
He'll do a.nything.
What did he say?
If I don't give him the money, he'll kill me.
Why would he kill you? He's just saying it to scare you, that's all.
-If they think you have the money--
-Then why is Charles dead?
He obviously knew where that money is.
Listen, I'm on your side.
I wish you'd tell me what you know, promises or no promises.
I could be of some help.
I think you'd better go, Joshua.
I'm afraid I've lost my appetite.
I'm very tired.
I understand. It's been a long day.
Please, I really need to think.
JOSHUA: Just remember, I'm on your side.
REGGIE: Yeah.
You people want to get rich or not?
Don't get all rhetorical on us now.
Answer my question!
Rich or not rich?
Does she have the money or not, Dyle?
-I think she does.
-Here's my problem.
You say there was nothing with Charlie in the train... his bags, clothes, whatever.
But size up, Dyle. It's all smoke.
You got zero credibility here.
You're right.
I already got what I want.
Yet I choose to subject myself to this bullshit anyway.
You just want to get in her pants, anyway.
I'm not touching your psychodrama in the elevator just now...
-and your crazed little phone call.
-You know what, Dyle?
One more little crazed phone call... this time to the Paris Police, and they have Charlie Lake's killer, no?
Right?
ZADAPEC: Don't forget that, the next time you come waltzing in here.
Don't forget that for a minute.
All high and mighty, like you're God's gift to us.
Zad?
He's right, buddy.
No more loose cannon stuff, okay?
We are stuck with him for now.
And he is stuck with us.
Cool, Zad?
Okay, maniac?
The only way this works is if she trusts me. Lose that, end of story.
Hey, Zadapec, your phone call really spooked her.
I want you to tell me exactly what you said.
Well, you're not gonna like it.
REGGIE: Mr. Bartholomew?
Are you there, Mr. Ba.rtholomew?
-What's going on?
-Mr. Bartholomew.
-Yes.
-Who is Dyle?
What about Dyle?
-The man in the elevator.
-Zadapec?
-He called Joshua Peters "Dyle."
-Zadapec called Peters "Dyle"?
-Tell me about him.
-Dyle?
-Now.
-Okay, all right.
BARTHOLOMEW: Okay, Carson J. Dyle.
Ma.jor, Specia.I Forces.
Highly decorated in the Gulf War,
Mogadishu.
Then he drops out.
Head-honchos Global Options... the top-drawer service outfit of the '90s, till his untimely demise.
-Demise?
-Death.
I know what demise means,
Mr. Bartholomew.
Carson Dyle was terminated in 1998 by Eastern European militia... near the former Yugoslavian border,
40 kilometres east of Sarajevo.
No, wait!
Dyle worked with Charles?
He knew Charles?
Unfortunately for Dyle, yes.
In '98, Dyle mounted a special ops unit... for a high-level, covert hostage extraction on behalf of the O.D.C.
In those da.ys... the O.D.C. couldn't dea.I directly with outside contra.ctors.
Tha.t's where your Cha.rlie La.ke ca.me in.
He wa.s a.n independent fa.cilita.tor.
The O.D.C. would put him on the resea.rch pa.yroll... for a. Iimited time.
He would book the professiona.Is, negotia.te with the a.dversa.ries... wra.ngle a.Il the slimy deta.ils.
Your husba.nd brokered the dea.I to go in... tra.nsfer the a.ssets, a.nd get our ma.n out.
Keep going. I'm with you.
BARTHOLOMEW: The unit choppered in, a.ccompa.nied by La.ke... tra.nsporting $6 million... in interna.Ily fla.wless
Eppler-cut dia.monds a.s ra.nsom.
They were a.mbushed shortly a.fter la.nding.
Dyle and most of the Global Options team were totally decimated.
Cut to ribbons. Never had a chance.
Your husband and the three from the photo... were the only ones to make it out alive.
We believe those four stashed the diamonds... with plans to return and claim them for themselves.
How did Charles manage to--
They lied during the inquiry and waited.
We believe Charlie Lake broke from his agreement with the others... recovered the diamonds on his own, and completely vanished.
REGGIE: And maybe Carson Dyle lived.
BARTHOLOMEW: Trust me, Mrs. Lambert.
Carson Dyle is dead.
You've got to find out what you can about your new friend Peters... or Dyle, or whatever his name is.
We need to know how he fits into the equa.tion.
Mr. Bartholomew,
I already told you my great goal... is for far less involvement in this sordid mess, not more!
I was wrong about you, Mrs. Lambert.
Meeting the widow of a man like Lake?
I was expecting... a siren, a harpy, a shrew.
But you ha.ve decency, dignity... what my father used to call gumption.
I'm very touched.
You are actually quite sweet for a stars-and-bars company man.
You've discovered my secret side,
Mrs. Lambert.
Keep it under your ha.t.
Boo!
Have you seen Mrs. Lambert?
She already left the hotel, sir.
She left this for you, Mr. Peters.
Aznavour.
That's him, Miss?
He's the one.
Could I speak to a Mr. Dyle?
STORE MANAGER: ls he an American?
REGGIE: Yes, he is.
STORE MANAGER: One moment, please.
I'll try to find out.
Mr. Dyle?
-Yes.
-It's for you, sir.
My God. You are Dyle!
JOSHUA: Reggie?
REGGIE: It's the only name I've got!
JOSHUA: We need to ta.Ik.
REGGIE: I've never been so betrayed... and humiliated in all my life!
I had to confirm you weren't involved.
You had to make sure
I wasn't involved?
JOSHUA: No, that's not what I meant.
Your package, Mr. Dyle.
But of course, sir.
You're meant to be dead.
I do owe you an explanation.
Reggie, my name is Alexander Dyle.
Carson was my brother.
Shake hands. How do you do?
You have got to be joking!
JOSHUA: Reggie!
REGGIE: It's Regina!
JOSHUA: I can explain everything!
REGGIE: Monsieur Philippe!
JOSHUA: Reggie, wait!
Now to the station, please.
JOSHUA: Please, you got to listen to me!
Thank you for waiting, Monsieur.
JOSHUA: Charles and the three people following you....
They betrayed Carson. They stole the money he was entrusted with.
I'm trying to get to the truth by conspiring with them.
How noble of you to embrace their techniques.
I'm sorry, really, about your brother and everything... but give me a break.
I hate that you're caught up in this.
But at the same time I'm glad, because it means that we've met.
I liked Joshua Peters.
And now he's gone.
I didn't know Charles was married.
His wife said Charles didn't have a mother.
One-way to London...
...the 1 1 :20, please.
Stay here in Paris, Reggie. With me.
Don't buy that ticket.
What do you think?
My ticket, please.
A round-trip to London, please.
ANNOUNCER: (Over loudspeaker)
This is the la.st ca.Il.
Did you mean what you said in the taxi?
Everything. Which part?
The part about that you're really... glad that you met me or something like that.
Deeply.
That's sweet...
Alex.
But I'm still going to London.
Wait.
No, you're not.
You're not going anywhere, Reggie.
JOSHUA: Reggie?
Cardiac arrest.
Sudden death syndrome.
Our prelimina.ry forensic report.
And nobody wa.nts to offer me a. more complica.ted expla.na.tion?
Oka.y.
Regina?
A word with you alone.
The rest ofyou ma.y lea.ve.
Comma.nda.nt, I was hoping to remain here with ma.da.me Lambert.
You, especially, Monsieur, may leave.
I was hoping that I could be of some assistance.
JOSHUA: It's okay.
You said yesterday that your husband was an orphan.
An only child.
That's right.
A woman showed up at the morgue early this morning... from the provinces, Rully.
She identified your husband's corpse... as her unmarried son...
Cha.rles du La.c.
Du Lac?
REGGIE: Du Lac.
Lake, Charlie Lake.
The old woman said her husband beat her son... and her without mercy every day... until one evening the father fell to his death from a bedroom window.
Fourteen-year-old Charles left home the next day.
She's seen him only occasionally in the years since then.
Why are you telling me all this?
DOMINIQUE:
The woma.n seemed quite dera.nged.
"The lights are off all over the house."
DOMINIQUE: I worry for her.
She's convinced you are responsible for her son's death... the missing money.
Well, there should be a club.
Unfortunately, she's already on a train back to Rully.
Regina, I trust you.
You're not a. suspect here.
But I do believe you can lead us to the killer.
And I very much want your help.
Comma.nda.nt....
Please, Regina, call me Jeanne.
May I have a smoke, Jeanne?
Of course.
I trust you, too.
You will cooperate?
If it means getting to the truth, yes.
I understand.
Exactly what kind of cooperation did you have in mind, Jeanne?
Whatever it takes to help us find out everything possible... about your mysterious Mr. Peters and his friends.
Whatever it takes?
I'm asking you to find out everything you can, Regina.
Open up. Dig deep.
Just be...very, very careful.
REGGIE: Okay, everybody.
The moment you've a.Il been wa.iting for.
LOLA: Charlie's last day.
REGGIE: You, too, Alex. Dive in.
LOLA: Okay, here's Charlie's letter.
You satisfied?
Tell us about Sarajevo, Mrs. Lake.
REGGIE: Sarajevo?
How did you know about....
I mentioned you told me a little about your travels.
BARTHOLOMEW: Mrs. La.mbert...
Carson Dyle was terminated in 1998 by Eastern European militia... near the former Yugoslavian border,
40 kilometres east of Sarajevo.
JOSHUA: You've got nothing to hide, Regina.
You can tell them about Sarajevo.
What about Sarajevo?
Tell us about your border crossings, customs checks... any chance encounters.
We need to know everything about Sarajevo.
Okay.
I'll start from the beginning.
Very good, Mrs. Lake.
Is that table reserved for them?
They don't know about this place.
You didn't tell them we were coming?
No.
Unlike everything else about us, what I confided in you... et cetera....
Reggie, what did the cop want when she asked you to stay?
She doesn't seem to like you very much, Alex.
Am I still allowed to kiss you?
Yeah.
That's nice.
Really nice.
JOSHUA: There's one other thing.
Which is?
I told them it was me who killed Charles.
Why would you say a terrible thing like that?
Okay, Reggie,
I'm gonna ask you again.
This person you don't want to tell me about.
What do they know about Charles?
I don't want to play that game anymore.
I don't want to play any games anymore:
I never break a promise.
Cha.ra.de d'a.mour for you a.nd me, chérie
Hea.rtbrea.king, such killing melody
Come on a.nd da.nce with me tonight
Come on, let's fight the devil of deception
Let's da.nce the ta.ngo roma.nce

SINGER: Ta.ngo, ta.ngo
LOLA: Regina...
I've really gotten to like you.
I think you're very special.
REGGIE: Yeah, I'm sure.
REGGIE: Now, can I have that money?
LOLA: Right. So, hand it over.
I couldn't sta.nd you when
I first met you.
I thought you were so stuck up.
But now I've got a. crush on you.
Shucks, girl!
Watch out for Dyle, Regina.
I mean it.
-Putting in some overtime?
-I see I'm not the only one.
(Singing) Deception
Let's da.nce the ta.ngo roma.nce
JOSHUA: You better back off, Lola!
Did you tell her who killed Charlie yet, Dyle?
-Back off, Lola!
-You back off!

It's her! Assassin!!
She killed my son!
Adulterer!! She killed my son!!
REGGIE: No!
Lola?
Regina...
Dyle....
Lola, you hold on.
-There's help coming.
-Dyle....
No, Lola.
He didn't really kill Charles.
He just told you that, I promise.
Dyle....
REGGIE: (Sobbing) No!
We were entitled to a share of those diamonds... after what we went through...
Mrs. La.ke.
REGGIE: She said, "Dyle."
That's the last thing she said.
-Reggie, l....
-Yeah.
And in the club she said,
"Watch out for Dyle."
JOSHUA: Reggie.
REGGIE: Alex... why have you never gone to the police with your suspicions?
Your brother's death?
Those three? Charles?
I guess I want that money, too.
This is very illuminating.
I'll see you tomorrow?
Tomorrow?
It's Saturday.
Charlie's last day.
Good night.
Good night, Reggie.
"My dear Regina:
I'm off today to Cannes.
"Got a. Iea.d on a. couple of Renoirs, ma.ybe a. Schna.bel a.nd a. Ba.squia.t.
"Can't wait for your...."
REGGIE: I've got it.
DOMINIQUE: Wha.t?
DOMINIQUE: What have you got?
Genius...
REGGIE: I know.
DOMINIQUE: Why didn't I think of tha.t?
Lt. Dessalines will be over in 10 minutes to get you.
We've got some work to do.
I'll get my people rea.dy... and see you at headquarters in half an hour.
Brilliant.
Now...
REGGIE: 12.:00 noon.
8, rue des Rosiers, Cligna.ncourt.
The flea. ma.rket.
Three legs of lamb!
Six specials!
TOURIST: Over there.
Let's go up there and take a look.
-Fancy meeting you here.
-Hi.
You find what you're looking for, Alex?
Reggie, you've found something, haven't you?
JOSHUA: Well, well, well.
The gang's all here.
Wha.t's left of it, a.nywa.y.
Do you speak English?
Yes, just a little.
Also some Japanese...
Mandarin.
This empty space--what is it?
DEALER PROPHETE:
Tragic history, Monsieur.
Mr. Hyppolite's place.
He made a great fortune last week.
He was retiring.
Going to see the world.
Next day... he was dead.
What did he sell?
Hector... he traded in postage stamps.
SANG: Stamps?
DEALER PROPHETE: Yes. The collectors... called him...
"The Seeker."
He could find a.nything for you... if you could afford.
Stamps?
What's he doing, Reggie?
Where's he going?
JOSHUA: Where's he going?
REGGIE: I don't know! Alex... get your hands off me.
JOSHUA: Stamps!
REGGIE: What are you doing?
Reggie, where is it?
Where's Charlie's bag?
JOSHUA: Where is it?
REGGIE: What?
The envelope!
The stamps!
Hello?
The subway! To your left!
JOSHUA: Watch out!
Anybody here?
REGGIE: Where is everybody?
Hello?
(Banging and clanging coming from other room)
It's not here, is it?
REGGIE: You killed him.
-Of course I didn't.
-You're a murderer!
JOSHUA: Reggie!
Reggie, don't be ridiculous!
(Joshua pounds on door and Reggie screams)
JOSHUA: Reggie, wait!
REGGIE: Mr. Bartholomew!
-It's okay, you're safe now.
-Are you armed, Mr. Bartholomew?
BARTHOLOMEW: At all times.
REGGIE: Thank God!
JOSHUA: This is convenient.
REGGIE: This is him!
Joshua Peters, Alexander Dyle, whoever he is!
BARTHOLOMEW: You have the assets?
JOSHUA: Wait a minute.
The assets?
Reggie, is this who you've been--
No. Yes!
BARTHOLOMEW: So, my long lost and nonexistent kid brother, Alex... a..k.a....
Mr. Bartholomew.
Nice to meet you.
No.
JOSHUA: I've never seen a ghost before.
Pleasure's all mine.
REGGIE: What's going on here?
JOSHUA: Reggie... my name is Lewis Bartholomew.
Really?
I'm a special investigator for the
U.S. Office of Defense Cooperation.
Really?
Your secret partner here is the real Dyle.
Carson Dyle.
Mrs. Lambert, I am Carson Dyle.
Obviously, I didn't die in Yugoslavia.
Came mighty close, though.
When I asked you about Dyle, you were describing yourself.
That's correct, Mrs. Lambert.
BARTHOLOMEW: I was shot up pretty bad.
Totally incapacitated.
ZADAPEC: Check on Dyle!
BARTHOLOMEW: Unlike the others,
Cha.rlie knew I wa.s still a.Iive.
CHARLIE: He's dead!
LOLA: Chief!
SANG: Chief!
BARTHOLOMEW:
But he told them I wa.s dea.d.
Dyle is dead!
BARTHOLOMEW:
He took the money a.nd ra.n.
A fa.rmer a.nd his fa.mily found me.
He was a Muslim, his wife, Christian.
They hid me, got me to a hospital... where a great little lady doc put me back together.
And you've been tracking
Charlie Lake ever since.
I located him in Paris, reinvented as Charles Lambert.
He got wind of you?
I always told myself I'd give
Charlie the benefit of the doubt.
I wouldn't kill him if he gave back the money.
So long as he didn't lie.
And you did kill him?
He did lie.
REGGIE: Charles never told the truth about anything.
None of you do!
JOSHUA: So, Dyle...
I'm moved that you want the O.D.C. to get their money back.
I always complete my assignments.
JOSHUA: But we still don't have the missing funds... and you've got blood all over your hands.
Is your intention to arrest me?
Look!
One of eight known remaining... inverted U.S. Teddy Nickels,
X.F. grade, 1928.
The legendary Algerian Oran 60.
Original slash mark intact, 1952.
And the true masterpiece... the mahogany Urate Lornis,
Madagascar, 1906.
The most valuable postage stamp on the face of the earth.
BARTHOLOMEW: There you are, investigator.
My work is done.
Just hand that over now, Reggie.
It's U.S. government property.
Reggie.
I don't believe you just did that.
I do.
DOMINIQUE: Carson Dyle?
DESSALINES: Police!
You look like hell, ll-Sang Lee.
Here for you, chief.
JOSHUA: Carson.
Mr. Dyle!
Question, okay?
You didn't happen to bump into Zadapec... on the 1 1 :20 to London yesterday, did you?
ZADAPEC: Check on Dyle!
CHARLIE: Dyle is dea.d!
ZADAPEC: Chief!
LOLA: Chief!
CHARLIE: He's dea.d!
That is correct.
I see.
Were you outside the Tango Palace when Lola bought it?
LOLA: Chief!
Go!
That was most unfortunate.
You've lost a lot.
None of it's coming back.
What's your point, Bartholomew?
JOSHUA: You still have your honour, Carson.
I've got a suggestion.
Tony!
Eric!
JOSHUA: Put them down!
Chief.
-See you in court, Comma.nda.nt.
-It will be my pleasure.
You are under arrest for the murder of Charles Lambert.
Shit.
JOSHUA: 'Morning, Ernie.
Good morning, Mr. Bartholomew.
Here are your messages.
Your mum called.
Hey, is that for me?
Is everything okay, Mr. B.?
Ms. Hoskins.
MS. HOSKINS: Yes, sir?
Some tea, please.
MS. HOSKINS: Coming right up, sir.
JOSHUA: Thank you.
Hey, boss.
How are you, chief?
JOSHUA: Good job, guys.
ODC OFFICIAL #1 :
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew.
She's okay.
JOSHUA: Come in, please.
REGGIE: Well, well, well.
Bartholomew.
JOSHUA: You can call me Lewis.
This is for you, Lewis.
My late husband's minor fortune.
-But before? The fire?
-Laser copies.
Courtesy of comma.nda.nt Dominique.
Thank you, Reggie.
-I'm not a thief.
-I know.
So long, Lewis.
Quitter!
-You give up awful easy, don't you?
-Not really.
Please... don't go.
I ha.ted deceiving you. I'm so sorry.
Please.
All that time, you should have trusted me.
Revealing my true identity was never an option, Reggie.
But I never tried to hide my feelings for you.
Lewis, what are you really like?
There's only one way to find out.
Why should l?
Because I love you.
What?
I love you, Reggie.
You've got to be kidding.
No, never.
-You're luckier than you realise.
-Why?
Because I was about to walk out of your life for good...
REGGIE: and the crazy thing is....
JOSHUA: Yes?
I would have regretted that for several weeks probably.

Good morning, Ma'am...
Good morning, Sir...
Thank you, Ma'am...
Enjoy your meal, Sir.
Thank you, Ma'am.
BARTHOLOMEW: No!
EXIT

They come in here, they're taking American jobs from American, hard-working American...
Those fucking idiots on this thing.
But I see that another man...
Think I have something here.
There you go. Know this?
Gordy?
You look tired, man.
You look beat.
Your turn to feed Emma?
No, well, she still has that, um... ear infection.
She's still got that?
She had that at the christening.
She's still got it? Wow.
How's Wendy holding up?
Tired. Same as me.
You need anything, Gordon, you let me know, okay? I'm here.
Hang in there, man.
You're gonna be fine, all right?
Uh-huh. No.
About 15 minutes. Yeah.
Okay, all right, I'll tell him right now.
That was, uh, Bill Griggs on the phone.
He says he's getting off the ramp.
He'll be here in a minute.
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thank you very much.
You know what?
Can I ask you a quick question?
Yeah, sure.
- When was the hospital actually closed?
- Yeah.
Yeah, because you know I'm curious, because you know they got you and you got the... the firearm on.
And it's not like people are trying to get out, right?
No, no, not out, in!
You know, kids, delinquents, homeless.
Oh, yeah, a lot of patients ended up in the streets when this place closed down.
And some of them, they come back.
I found a half a dozen squatting up there last spring.
The patients come back?
Yeah, they come back.
I mean, God knows why.
Wait till you see the place.
I mean, Jesus, I'd rather sleep in the street, personally.
- But, then, you know, I'm not nuts.
- Obviously.
- Hey, there he is.
- All right.
- Good luck, fellas.
- Thanks.
- We first in line?
- Nope.
Environmental Solutions,
American Yankees were up here last week.
Wow. What was their bid?
Under the Yankees, bid was fast and low.
But that's the way Griggs likes them.
He likes jobs fast, Gordon.
- I like them safe, though.
- But we cannot gamble with this.
Gordon, you want me to talk to him?
Phil, I know what I'm doing, okay?
Okay?
Holy shit! Look at this.
Look at this.
1871, that's when she went up, gentlemen.
We called her the "Kirkbride Building", named after Dr. Thomas Kirkbride.
Well, it's a pretty simple layout really, you know?
If you consider a giant flying bat.
You know, the main staff building in the middle, the bat body.
And slanting off to each side are these, like, giant crooked bat wings.
You know, one for female patients, the other for male, you know?
A bat.
Yeah, believe it or not, this place is listed in the national historic register.
You know, that's why I can't tear it down. I'd love to, you know?
Only one-tenth of it is salvageable.
But the land, the land is priceless.
You know, put up a Wal-Mart maybe, but the town manager wants to reclaim it, so...
Whoa! What the fuck is this?
Oh, what, are you a little scared, Phil?
This is hydrotherapy.
Used to be cutting edge.
They'd soak the nut jobs in cold water.
I guess that was a way to chill 'em out, I don't know.
Or they'd give 'em a lobotomy.
Yeah, yeah, the pre-frontal lobotomy was perfected here at Danvers.
Sounds like you've done your homework.
Well, you know, my wife Elizabeth, she's the town historian.
She likes to keep me in the know.
Hey, there's a fantastic morgue in the basement where they do the post-mortem...
Bill, Bill, could you show us the problem areas?
- Yeah. Sure, sure.
- Thank you.
Feed a fucking army in here!
Well, they did.
It was a self-contained town.
Church, movie theater, bowling alley, you know?
Oh, there's a lovely cemetery up behind the machine shop.
No headstones, just numbers.
You really ought to check it out.
Watch your step here.
This will become the municipal archives, my wife's department.
It was a dining area.
Is there gonna be a lot of foot traffic?
Well, yeah, it's like a library.
All these tiles will have to go.
These are deadly.
- They're loaded with asbestos, Bill.
- Really?
You know, the other bids didn't point that out.
Oh, they should have, man. It's standard.
All right, I'm gonna take you to the female wing now. Ward C.
It'll become Administration,
Town Manager's office.
- Department of Public Works.
- In other words, your office.
You better believe it!
Okay, each wing is made of four wards.
Wards A, B, C, and D.
Ward A, which I call the wing tip, is the farthest away from the staff building.
This is where they'd keep the extreme patients.
What do you mean, extreme?
Well, psychotic.
Keep the most dangerous ones furthest away, right?
Hey, you're so smart, Phil.
Whoever said you weren't smart?
You know what they called Ward A?
The snake pit.
Now, you follow these two down, they'll take you to C.
But I wouldn't advise walking on the floors.
- There's water damage.
- How do we get over there?
Any of you guys scared of the dark? What?
Over here.
Hello, Gordon.
Gordy? It's me, man. Come on.
Survival rations.
Yeah, duck and cover, my friend.
Bend over and kiss your ass good-bye.
You know, this place was used as a fallout shelter.
To me, that is a weird idea.
All these ducts are gonna have to be wet-stripped. You see this?
Yeah.
That breaks off, dust gets into the east tunnels.
You're gonna pollinate the entire building.
Oh, Jesus, I wouldn't want that.
Believe me, you don't want that to happen.
No, you don't.
Gordon, let me lead. Hold on.
Jesus. Okay.
Yeah, this used to be a solarium.
I call it the carpet-toned room.
Well, here we are, gentlemen,
Danvers Town Hall.
Reclaiming the dark past to build a brighter future.
Something like that. Huh?
- Crocidolite.
- Crocli... what?
- Oh, Crocidolite.
- Crocidolite?
Yeah, worst kind.
This is decaying, friable.
Uh, I'd say circa 1940s.
- Really?
- Yeah.
So, what's the deal, then?
Well, if I were you, Bill, I would...
I'd seal off the whole area.
Full poly, a couple of neg air machines, decon showers, the whole bit.
You know, OSHA won't let me start until you guys clean her up, and I got to get construction crews in here by Columbus Day. So...
You got a guesstimate on how long?
Roughly? Ballpark? What?
These rooms, game room, tunnels,
I would say...
Three weeks, minimum.
Three weeks.
Two. Two weeks.
- Two weeks.
- Two weeks.
Yeah.
You guys Mack and Myer for Hire?
What is it? Three or two?
Two. Two weeks.
- Two weeks.
- He's the captain, right?
You better believe it.
Well, I guess you guys have seen enough, huh? Need anything else?
- No.
- All right.
- What's all this, Bill?
- Ah, they're punks.
Little motherfuckers come in, and they get high, boot scag, shoot guns.
- Destructive little bastards.
- Shoot guns... at what? At what?
Well, hopefully, each other.
- Hey Bill.
- What?
What is this?
Hey, Phil, what, are you checking in?
Don't go in there without your bathing suit.
Oh, yeah, this is... this is seclusion.
That's what they called the patients' rooms back then, seclusions.
It's some part of some therapy that was big in the '70s.
All these cut-outs and... stuff.
You know, art therapy, creative expression.
You know, it helped them with their... you know, like, self-esteem.
Yeah.
Helped them feel good about themselves and more at home. It was creepy, huh?
Shades of your childhood, huh?
Yeah, there's a picture of me at summer camp somewhere up here.
Huh. Wow.
What do you think was wrong with this one?
I don't know.
Watch out for the broken glass here.
Yeah.
Hey, you know, I got a little time.
You want to check out that cemetery?
- 750 bodies buried there. It's like...
- Gentlemen, I'm... I'm sorry.
- What, Phil?
- I left a bag. I got to go back.
- Oh, you know where you're going?
- Yeah, middle of the bat wing, right?
You got it.
- Okay, I'll see you down here.
- I'll be out!
- Gum?
- No, thanks, man.
You know, I don't think I ever congratulated you and Wendy on your new addition.
Ah, thanks man. Thanks!
You know, I know how long you both...
Well, you know, we're just so happy for you and Elizabeth.
- You wanna see her?
- Oh, yeah. Bring a picture?
- I'll show you my baby.
- Aww.
Aww.
- Yeah?
- Isn't she just a doll.
- Emma.
- Oh, yeah!
Listen, I'll match Yankee's bid.
Well, this isn't how we normally do the bidding process.
I mean, the deadline's Friday, paperwork on my desk...
I know, I know. We'll be in on Monday, and we'll be out the following Monday.
- I thought you said two weeks.
- One week. I'll do it in one week.
I've got four really good guys.
I'll hire another guy.
One week, we're gone.
- One week?
- One week.
- That's fast.
- Uh-huh.
I'm good for it. You know I'm good for it.
I need the job.
I really need this job.
Roses? They're lovely!
What's the occasion, Gordon?
Genny is up and running, sir.
- Take the mask off, Hank.
- Are the ACO levels safe, sir?
Take it off, dickhead.
Here's what I want you to do, okay?
I want you to go down to the tunnel, hang up those glove bags.
Tag those ducts we looked at this morning.
Use the green slime.
You mean red, right?
Those ducts are hazards, Gordo.
- What?
- Red, right?
Yeah, red.
Hey ya, Phil. Amy says hi.
Keep it up, dickhead.
Don't shoot the messenger, Phil.
I'm just relaying information.
She says to me this morning, while we're laying in bed, to say hi to you.
Keep it up.
Yeah, I got it. That's the problem, right?
So dude, how long have you been working with my Uncle Gordon?
- Five whole years.
- All right.
Was he a slave driver or what?
Well, Gordon's a very reasonable man. I'm the slave driver.
Got a couple of rules though.
Safety first, get the job done, second.
And, uh, no drugs on the job, dude.
- Woo-hoo!
- What the hell is that?
So, Mike, you gonna show me the ropes?
- This the new guy?
- They call it Jeff.
It's Gordon's nephew.
- Mikey didn't tell you about these?
- What?
- You can't use these.
- Why not?
Rule one, music creates sonic vibrations.
Vibrations jiggle spooge dust into the air.
Gets into the air, it gets into your lungs.
This the kind of music you plan on listening to here, buddy?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. You trying to kill us all?
Put it away or play something else, man.
Like Yanni or John Tesh or something, all right?
I'll see you guys at lunch.
I'm going down deep.
Later.
Who's Yanni?
You know, Gordo, you finally landed us the perfect gig.
Next time someone says what we do is crazy, you just say, "Yeah, well, we work in an insane asylum."
You might actually want to be grateful, my man.
You're about to make some decent money.
Yeah, what? Five bucks an hour?
- You didn't tell him?
- You tell him.
Okay. $10,000 bonus.
Gordon arranged it with the town.
What's the catch?
We got to finish by the 13th.
The 13th? As in what, this Monday?
Come on, Gordo, you know this is at least a two-week job.
That's exactly right.
So, we're gonna work our asses off.
So, what is it? Ten G's each?
If you don't like it Henry, I'll give you a ride to the airport right now.
Let it go, Phil.
What about Amy?
You gonna take Amy to the airport?
She likes to travel.
- I know she likes to travel...
- Hank!
Hey, guys! I got your keys for the gate.
Thanks, man.
So, what do you think, huh?
Fifteen years really does a number on a place.
You know, it's hard to believe there used to be over 2,400 patients here at one point.
Yeah, so why'd they close this place down?
Nearly all these places got closed down in the '80s.
Ya know, the budget cuts.
The Feds called it Deinstitutionalization.
So, they just dumped the people on the street?
Some. Some went to, like, homecare-type programs.
So, the loonies are outside in the real world, and here we are with the keys to the loony bin, boys.
Well, it wasn't just the budget cuts, you know.
What was it, then, Mike?
Patricia Willard scandal, 1984.
Patricia Willard?
I don't recall that.
Patricia Willard, she was committed here in the 1970s by her parents.
Manic depression, that sort of thing.
Typical adolescent crap.
But in the 1980s, this new kind of therapy took off,
Repressed Memory Therapy.
See, the shrinks figured that with these new techniques they designed, they could release... hidden memories of traumatic events in your life: rape, incest.
So Patricia, with the help of her doctors, recalls that when she was 10, her father raped her.
But not once, right?
No, he'd do it three times a week.
And he didn't just rape her.
He came into her room at night wearing a black robe.
He'd take her and drive her to a wooded area where her grandparents and her mother were.
And they'd all have black robes on.
They'd take them off, and group orgies would ensue.
And then they bring out the newborn.
She was forced to watch, as her mother would cut this baby's heart out with a stone dagger.
She'd drink the blood, others would eat the flesh.
Her grandfather and father would fuck her repeatedly.
She was forced to have abortions, and they'd cook the aborted fetuses.
- Enough!
- Huh?
- This happened here?
- Oh, yeah. Everywhere.
Satanic Ritual Abuse Syndrome was big in the '80s.
Destroyed a lot of families.
Patricia was ready to sue hers.
It was all set to go to trial, and...
- What?
- She dropped the suit.
Why?
Well, her parents discovered a physical examination she'd undergone about a year prior.
Turns out she was a virgin.
None of it happened.
So the family countersues. They win.
That, and the budget cuts.
And... poof.
- So, Mike, is that story true?
- Yeah.
How do you know all that stuff, man?
My dad was a lawyer. He was on the case.
Aw, come on, Mike, don't be so humble.
His dad's the state attorney general, so you better watch your ass there, buddy.
Hank, leave it alone, will ya.
You were supposed to carry the torch too, right? Tufts Law School?
Hank, drop it.
What were you on there again, Mike?
The one-year plan?
- Need help with that?
- No, I'm fine, thank you.
- Jesus!
- Tough weekend, boss?
No, I think I pulled a muscle or something.
Mike and I called you Saturday night to take you out to Molly's for a beer over the winning bid.
Aw, cheers, man, sorry and all.
I was trying to catch up on some sleep.
- Baby still got that ear thing?
- Oh, yeah.
- So, Gordy, if we don't make Monday...
- Oh, Griggs likes jobs done fast.
No, I understand that.
But if we lose this bonus?
We won't lose the bonus.
Listen, man, I know where this is leading, but, believe me, Jeff is young, okay, but he's not as stupid as he looks.
I'm not talking about Jeff.
We ran into Craig McManus on Saturday night.
I told him about the job, about the bonus.
He would leave Yankee and work for us in a second.
Now, he has more experience than Hank, and he gives a shit.
Phil, your job here is to keep things on track and to eliminate obstacles.
And that's what I'm trying to do, is to eliminate an obstacle.
Jesus, man. We're talking about Hank here.
Now, listen, if I thought he was a liability, I'd let you sack him.
As it happens, he's not.
- And I don't agree.
- I don't care!
Now, let's finish the decon chamber.
Jesus, Phil.
Fine.
- All right. All right.
- Let's go, turn right, turn right.
Now, when you get it straight, you gotta bring the nose down.
Bring... Don't look at me. Look...
What are you, a lobotomy case?
- Fuck you, man! I got it!
- Put the nose down!
Turn around! Jesus!
- Nice job, Jeff!
- That wasn't me, man.
- Yeah.
- Fuck you, dude.
- Just, just wait there.
- What?
Just... hang on.
What the hell?
Huh?
Okay, go down and check the breaker box.
No, I can't do that.
Why?
I got nyctophobia.
- What?
- Fear of the dark.
Okay. I'll go check the breaker box.
You... just try not to break anything, okay, mullet head?
Thanks, man.
Oh, damn!
Goddamn!
- You okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.
- Good first day, Gordo.
- Hm-mm.
Listen, Mike needs another hour.
The genny carburetor's acting up.
Okay, but listen, I don't want anyone hanging around this place after dark.
Okay. No problem.
Good first day, guys.
It keeps up like this, we'll all be dead by Monday.
Hey, fuck you, Phil!
See you in the morning.
I know this is difficult, Mary.
And that's why we're here to help, okay?
I miss Peter.
I miss him so much!
Mary, I want you to try to remember what happened 22 years ago.
On Christmas night in Lowell.
That's where we grew up.
Yes. Can you tell me what happened that night in Lowell?
- Nothing happened!
- Mary, something did happen.
That's why we have these sessions, to help you remember, so you can get better, okay?
No. No, I can't remember.
File note. Patient is showing extreme agitation.
She is putting her fingers in her mouth.
Mary... Mary?
Will you share a doll, Mr. Doctor?
Who am I speaking with?
Mary got a china doll from her mommy.
And we can't find it now.
No, Princess, I haven't seen it.
Maybe Billy knows where your china doll is.
Silly Billy!
Princess, tell me what happened on Christmas 22 years ago in Lowell.
We got presents.
Mary got a pretty china doll, and Peter got a big old knife.
Then what happened?
Mary's mommy and daddy went to sleep.
And then we played upstairs.
Peter turned off the lights and hid.
And Mary tried to find him.
Who played upstairs, Princess?
Mary and Peter, and me and Billy, silly!
Has Billy told you what happened next?
Billy only tells me nice things, Mr. Doctor.
Like, that I'm pretty.
Princess, was Simon there that night?
Simon?
Ooh, I don't know any Simon.
Billy's never told you about Simon?
No.
I'm tired, Mr. Doctor.
Maybe Billy would like to talk now.
Billy's asleep, Mr. Doctor.
He's asleep.
You can hear me.
Genny's gassed up and running, sir.
Very good. Make sure she stays that way.
I don't want her dying on us.
Put your mask on, Princess.
Fuck off. I'm not your princess, dude.
What?
So, what's up with Phil and Hank?
What's up with Phil and Hank?
Hank stole Phil's girlfriend.
It's a nightmare.
You don't want to get involved.
You especially don't want to get on Phil's bad side.
He'll give you the grunt work, all right?
1883. Fuck, yeah!
Free at last! Free at last!
Yo, Henry, come back.
Hank? Come back!
Uh, yeah, yeah, Hank here.
I want you with Jeff and Mike after lunch, so bring your gear up.
Yeah, all right. Hank out.
Gordo!
Got your wallet.
Nice grab. Okay, ladies, time to thank Uncle Gordy for lunch.
Thanks, Uncle Gordon!
Your turn tomorrow, Hank. Where's Mike?
The equipment room, looking for those lost cartridges.
Jesus, Phil!
I told you, I didn't want anyone wandering around here by themselves!
Okay, boss. It won't happen again, okay?
Do you got my scratch tickets?
Yeah, I got 'em right here, Bubba.
I'm comin'.
Let's see, Hank, your scratch tickets.
There you go. There's one.
Oh, Phil, these are Jubilee.
You know I play Blackjack.
- Yeah, here's one for you, too.
- Hey, Phil... fuck you!
Mike, come in.
I can't talk anymore. I am too tired.
It appears Miss Hobbes is now entering a dissociative state, rubbing her eyes, appears to be switching to an alternate personality.
Uh, yeah, I'll be there in a minute.
- Mary?
- Hello, sir.
Well, hello, Billy. How have you been?
Never better, sir.
Billy, where does the Princess live?
- In the tongue.
- Why the tongue?
Because she's always talking, sir.
And where do you live, Billy?
I live in the eyes. You know that.
Remind me, though. Why the eyes?
Because I see everything, sir.
And where does Simon live, Billy?
Where does Simon live?
Hey, what's mortified pride?
Says here, three patients were committed in 1889 because of mortified pride.
Let me see that.
1889. Where'd you get this?
Under some boxes, man.
It's fucking intense, some of the shit...
When Phil calls lunch, it means lunch. Understood?
Sorry, no cartridges. I gotta go pick some up at Grossman's.
Listen to this.
17 were committed due to disappointed expectations.
Henry, they're talking about you.
They would've committed your ass back then.
Hey, what do you have to do now to get committed?
Mortify someone's pride?
Simple.
You kill someone.
Nah, that won't get you committed.
But it'll get you in jail.
If you get caught.
John Hinkley, temporary insanity.
He's not in jail. He's in a nut house.
Right, Mike?
That defense never works.
Most people are cognizant of their actions when they murder.
Homicide implies a motive.
Oh... God, Mike.
How did you fail law school? You're good.
Yeah, what are you, dude? A lobotomy case?
Jeff, come on, man.
- Hey! Hey!
- Mike!
- Mike!
- Mike.
C'mon, I'm just fucking around, Gordo.
- Don't hurt him!
- It's all right.
The Ice Pick method.
Insert a thin metal pipette into the orbital frontal cortex and enter the soft tissue of the frontal lobe.
A few simple smooth, up and down jerks to sever the lateral hypothalamus.
All resulting in a rapid reduction of stress for our little patient here.
Total time elapsed, two minutes.
Only side effect?
Black eye. Recommended treatment...
Sunglasses.
Brilliant! Very good.
All right. Let's go back to work. Come on.
I wasn't kidding back there, man.
You're smarter than this crap job.
You should be using your head, buddy.
Yeah, um, I gotta get a part from Gordon's van.
Make sure mullet head here knows how to operate that thing.
Hey, Mike, come on, don't forget this.
- You know how to ride a lawn mower?
- Yeah.
Oh, then, you're golden.
Basically the same thing.
So, I don't know.
Just push it in to that mid section there and just start over there, all right?
I'm gonna take a smoke break.
We just had a break.
Hey, Jeff!
- What's up?
- You know what a whale is?
Yeah, I know what a whale is.
A whale is a big time gambler.
I got this buddy, right, he deals out at Foxwoods.
12 hours, and this whale has the house down 300 grand, right?
As this guy's leaving, takes his car keys, and drops them in my friend's pocket.
- You know what they're for?
- What?
Porsche 911.
It's true, man, and that was the tip.
Fucking tip!
What's your point?
Just have an exit plan, dude.
If you stick with this job too long, it will mess you up, man.
It gets inside of you... the stress.
You see?
Already an itty bitty piece of this shit may have gotten into your lungs, man.
It incubates in your lungs, and tissue begins to grow around it like a... like a pearl.
Like a time bomb.
Time you hit 30... Boom!
You're drowning in your own lung fluid.
Look at you, you're not even wearing your mask now.
- Hey, where's your mask?
- Me? Nah...
Nah, buddy,
I've learned to sublimate my fear.
'Cause I got a fuckin' exit plan, man.
I have a way of dealing with the stress.
You think Mikey reads all those books for fun?
Nah, man, he's got an exit plan, let me tell you.
If stress gets too intense on this job, he'll bolt.
He's gonna go back, finish law school, pass the bar, get the big, juicy cases, make his dad proud.
That's his exit plan.
Phil, Jesus...
Phil's got his stress reducer.
He's got his plan. I'm sure he'll tell you about it someday.
Then there's Uncle Gordo.
Hey, did you know if he didn't get this gig, he'd have to fold H.E.C.?
Yep. Man, he can't even have an exit plan.
Fiber has always been his life.
It was over there. It is here.
Imagine that stress.
Hey, let me tell you something, buddy, you better hope, hope, you got some of Gordo's genes, though. 'Cause Gordo...
Jesus, Gordo is the Zen master of calm.
I've never seen old Gordo lose it.
I don't know, though, man.
The last few months, Gordo,
I'm seein' some cracks.
Ya know, I worry.
Mikey knows what I'm talking about, right, Mikey?
He does have the new baby, ya know.
It should be the joy of his life, dude.
Hank, when you and Amy have a kid, you'll see how hard it is.
Me and Amy? A kid with Amy?
Nah, I just fuck her to beat on Phil.
Hey, get off your ass. I want my bonus.
Hi, Wendy?
I know, but we need to talk.
Because we have to.
Would you let me finish?
Would you...? Hello?
Baby needs a new pair of shoes.
Let's do this thing.
Silver.
Yeah, baby, gold, gold.
Fucking eyeballs. Jesus Christ!
They ought to be worth something.
All right.
Yeah, baby, check that out.
What the fuck is that?
God!
Fucking birds!
Jesus.
Oh, damn.
So what's the verdict?
I'm getting nothing here.
He's not even left his answering machine on.
You a...
- You try Amy's yet?
- Do you know her number?
Okay, I'll try information.
No, fuck, give me the phone.
Huh?
I know the number, Gordon.
Give me the phone!
Thank you.
Hi! Hi, it's me. Yeah, uh...
Wait... Wait a second. What?
What are you talking about?
When? When? Slow down.
When did this happen?
Really?
No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no.
You hang in there. I'll call you back.
Well, our favorite piece of shit, Hank, went to Amy's last night, packed his car, told her that he found his meal ticket, and then bolted to Miami to Casino School.
That lucky fuck! And he probably scored on a scratch or something.
I warned her, didn't I?
I fucking warned this bitch, didn't I?
She said that he left without saying anything?
Gordon, it's Hank.
He's totally unreliable.
Mike, call McManus. Call Craig.
See if he's still available.
Gordy?
Gordy, this is a blessing.
We replace this asshole, and we move forward.
What's the problem?
Something's not right here. Some...
What's the matter?
Who are those two guys you were talking to yesterday?
- What guys?
- I saw ya.
- Now, what were you talking about?
- What is this?
I'm asking you a question.
What were you talking about?
Okay.
Okay.
- Are you questioning my performance?
- I don't know. Should I be?
- Mike, call McManus.
- Don't walk away from me!
Don't ever walk away from me!
You gonna hit me?
You think I'm doing a bad job, Mike?
No, you're doing fine.
This used to be a great deal.
Steady gigs, joking around, beers after work.
Hey, look! It says here, eight were committed for uncontrolled passion.
Then Emma came.
Don't look at me like that, man.
You know it's why we lost the last two gigs.
He's tired, and he overbid.
- Gordon loves being a father.
- Yeah, now he does, now he loves it.
But it was never in his heart.
This was Wendy's idea.
Look, Phil...
Just 'cause you say you don't want something, it doesn't mean you don't want it.
Now, six years ago I didn't want to be a lawyer, but now I'm thinkin' I might...
Wait! Wait! Who the fuck are you kidding?
You shuck fiber with us, in there, okay?
Look... That's not what I'm talking about.
I'm talking about... fatherhood is screwing this guy's head up, and it's fucking his job up.
At the very least, Mike, he should've canned
Hank's ass six months ago, and you know it.
What are you looking at?
Where you going, Mike?
- I'm gonna go take a piss.
- You got 25!
Hello, Wendy?
Can we talk?
Wendy?
I wanna ask you something.
Can you forgive me?
Uncle Gordon!
Wendy?
Hello?
Gordon?
- Sorry.
- Hey, man.
I didn't see you on the phone.
- Sit down. Sit down.
- Thanks.
I just... I just came to...
Thank you for giving me this job, you know?
I mean, I want to let you know
I'll bust my ass for you, okay?
I know that. I know that.
So, don't stress out, all right?
Things will work out.
I'm here for you, and I'm gonna bust my ass, all right?
Yeah.
- Family, man.
- Yeah.
- So, was that Aunt Wendy?
- Yeah.
- How's she doing?
- She's good.
She's, uh... tired, you know?
It's when...
- Kids tire you out sometimes.
- Yeah, no, I know.
My dad's got the photos back from the christening.
Yeah?
- Emma looks pretty pissed off.
- Yeah, she's pretty pissed.
Why are you crying, Mary?
I miss my family.
How come they don't visit, Doctor?
Mary, can you tell me how you got those scars on your chest?
How many times do I have to tell you?
I fell off my bike when I was a girl.
Is that what you remember, Mary?
Yes!
Now, can you tell me who the Princess is?
- No idea.
- And who Billy is?
I don't know anyone named Billy.
- Who is Simon, Mary?
- I have no idea who Simon is!
- I am sick of this!
- Mary, calm down.
- I just want to go back to my room!
- Mary?
Mary?
Mary is asleep, sir.
Billy, why won't you tell me what happened in Lowell.
I know you saw what happened.
You know perfectly well what happened, sir.
But Mary needs to know what happened, Billy.
- She needs to remember.
- No!
Well, then, maybe Simon would like to tell me what happened.
- He's asleep.
- Help me wake Simon.
- No!
- We must wake up Simon.
- I won't... scared!
- Billy, we have to wake up Simon.
You should take a shower, Gordon.
You shouldn't go home with that shit on you, man.
What's the stupidest thing you've ever done?
You mean, besides coming to work for you?
Uh... I would have to say...
I would have to say introducing Hank to Amy.
That was pretty fucking stupid.
I wish I had that one back.
I wish I had that one back.
I hit Wendy.
What?
It was Friday night. I wanted to celebrate getting this job.
I had the flowers. I had the champagne.
I went into the kitchen.
She was cooking pasta.
I wanted to kiss her.
She turned around, and before I knew it, there's a pot of boiling water all over my leg.
I don't know if it was the dog barking,
I don't know if it was Emma crying, but I slapped her.
I hit my wife.
I love my wife.
It was an accident.
But I slapped her for it.
I've tried to talk to her on the phone, but she wouldn't listen.
Where are you staying?
A motel.
You don't tell the other guys about this.
Oh, come on, man.
You were right about Craig.
You should give him a call.
You know, uh, they, uh, those kids, the other day...
I had a conversation with those fuckin' graffiti artists, and they will not be coming back our way again.
I spoke to 'em, I said, "If I see you again, I'm calling Security," so...
Anyway, so, that's taken care of, all right?
Okay.
Hang in there.
Take a shower.
Get that shit off of you.
Hello, Gordon.
Do you know who I am?
Roses? They're lovely!
What's the occasion, Gordon?
Not here, Gordon. Later.
Watch out!
Do it, Gordon!
Hey.
- You're up early.
- Yeah.
Guess I wasn't the only one who couldn't sleep.
I got, uh, I got Craig coming in tomorrow. Okay?
You okay?
I want to go home.
I'm gonna go inside.
Okay?
I gotta go.
It's gonna get ugly.
Ah, Jesus Christ!
- Jeff, what did you do?
- It wasn't me, man!
I'm gonna go check the breakers.
Mike!
- What?
- Take a break with me.
- I can't. I gotta go check the breakers.
- Let the kid do it.
Well, the kid can't. He's got nyctophobia.
Mike.
Okay, all right.
Fuck.
- We got a problem.
- What?
We have a problem, and I want you to know that this is not easy for me.
Look at me. This is not easy for me, do you understand?
All right.
- We need to talk about Gordon.
- What about him?
He needs to take some time off, Mike.
- Why?
- Because he's becoming a liability.
I.. Phil, look, I can see why you're a little paranoid.
Can ya? Do you know that he hit his wife?
He hit Wendy, Mike.
Now, I've got Craig coming over tomorrow.
If Griggs hears about this, you understand what that means, right?
You want to lose this gig?
You want to lose the bonus?
'Cause that's what's gonna happen.
So, what do we do?
Okay, you listen to me.
You follow my lead.
You let me handle this, okay?
I don't give a shit what happens.
Fuck! I'm in charge now.
So, what did he say?
It think it might happen Saturday.
I don't...
Hey.
We were just talking about your nephew.
And how he's coming along.
That sort of thing.
And how's he coming along?
Hank?
Yo, dude, hello!
Hank!
You're in some deep shit, you know that?
What are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?
Everyone thinks you're in Miami at that Casino School.
Fucking Gordon and Phil want your head, man!
So, dude, did you score on a scratch, or what?
What are you doing here?
Listen, I forgot something. I'll be back.
You know, um, he just needs a little motivation.
- That's... pretty much it.
- Yeah.
What do you think, Phil?
Same, I think he's a little slow.
But, uh...
With Hank gone and Craig coming on, we'll pick up the slack.
I mean, I'll motivate him... the little mullet head.
He may be party in the back, but I'll make sure he's business in the front.
- What time is it?
- I think it's noon. About noon.
- Lunch time.
- Yeah.
Want to place the order?
Yeah. Yeah, sure, sure.
I think it's Phil's turn, though, right, Phil?
- Fuck it, Mike. Let's flip for it.
- What?
- Let's flip for it.
- Where'd you get that?
Found it. It might even be worth something, too. You ready?
- You found it?
- Yep.
Call it in the air. Heads or tails?
Heads.
Tails. Get going, loser.
What?
- What?
- Hey, Uncle!
Gordon?
- I found Hank!
- Gordon?
What do you want, Jeff?
I found Hank.
What the fuck are you talking about?
I just found Hank... in the stairwell.
He was just standing there.
Don't be a fucking idiot, okay?
I'm not a fucking idiot!
I swear to God, I saw him!
If he's in Miami, Jeff, why would he be here?
How could that be possible, Jeff?
I don't know, but I saw him!
You know what?
Go back to work, we'll bring you lunch.
Where was he, Jeff?
In the staircase, next to the equipment room.
Wait... wait a minute. You believe him?
You believe this punk, Gordon?
Gordon! Oh, for Christ's sakes, Mike!
This is so goddamn ridiculous! Gordon!
- If he's in Miami, why would he be here?
- Ask him yourself, Phillie. Right up there.
We're gonna do that, Jeff.
We're gonna do that, my man.
That's what we're doing, man.
That's where I'm taking you.
We're gonna do that.
- I'm telling you, he's up there.
- Where is he?
He was standing right there.
It's fucking weird, but he's right here.
I'm telling you. He's right...
Right over where, Jeff?
I swear he was. I'm not lying.
Why would I make this up?
Nice going... Jeff.
Okay, listen to me guys, now.
You heard me on the phone with Amy.
Am I right? She said Hank went to where? Miami! Okay?
Now, we heard it, we all heard it, right?
No... no, we didn't.
What?
- I want to go to lunch.
- No, you stay where you are.
What are you saying, Gordon?
You told us that's what she said, but we didn't hear her say it.
We saw you on the phone, we heard you on the phone, we didn't hear Amy.
Right, so what you're saying to me is that it wasn't Amy on the phone?
Is that what... Mike, now, come on, man.
This is what I'm talking to you about.
- Mike. Mike, give me that cell phone.
- Why?
'Cause I want to talk to Amy.
What? I spoke to Amy.
You don't need to speak to Amy.
- Give me the cell phone.
- Don't give him the fuckin' cell phone.
- Give me the cell phone.
- Mike, that's what I'm trying to tell you.
- Give me the cell phone.
- He's losing it, man.
Mike, give me the cell phone!
This is what I'm telling you.
He's losing it, man!
- Look at him! He's losing it, man!
- Give me the fuckin' cell phone!
- What the fuck was that?
- It's Hank!
It's Hank!
Okay, okay. Jeff, Mike, go downstairs.
Make sure he doesn't come around.
- You, you come with me.
- Hey! Fuck you!
You come with me. Let's go.
- Mike!
- Come on, Jeff.
- Oh, wait, you heard him go that way.
- Take the tunnels. They're safer.
Safer?
Gordo, this could be anybody.
Could be squatters, could be kids.
Come on, Phil, slow down, man.
He's not fucking down here.
God!
Hey, Gordo, did you hear that?
I thought I heard something down there, in the tunnels. Did ya hear it?
No. No, it's this way.
Gordo, I'm going down in the tunnels, all right? You follow up top.
Mike! Mike, we stick to...
Fuck this.
What the fuck, Phil? Man, slow down.
- So fucking stupid! Why?
- Shh! Shh!
- I don't hear anything.
- Shh! Shh!
Give me your torch.
This is fucking dumb.
He's not gonna be down there.
Shut up! I want you to stay right there.
You see or hear anything, you call me.
You understand me?
- I left my walkie in the van!
- Stay there!
- Phil, wait!
- What, Jeff?
When I saw Hank,
I think he had blood on his hand.
Stay there.
And, Billy, you understand that you, the Princess and Simon are all in Mary?
Yes, sir.
And if Mary is sick, then, you are sick, too. All of you.
Yes, sir.
You want Mary to get better, right, Billy?
- Yes!
- So, help her, Billy.
Tell me about that night in Lowell, Billy.
We were playing hide n' seek, sir.
Mary was looking at her new doll, and she was looking for Peter.
It was real dark.
Phil?
No, I won't tell!
Mary's a good girl!
She doesn't need to know!
- What?
- What Simon did!
To who, Billy? To who?
To Peter!
- What did Simon do to Peter, Billy?
- I won't do it!
Tell me, so that we can make Mary...
Fuck!
Gordon.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
Billy, I need to talk to Simon.
He made me do it. It was awful.
- Billy, wait.
- It was awful. No!
What are you doing here?
- We need to wake up Simon.
- No, it's too awful!
Wake up Simon.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
Phil. Phil, I think I found Hank.
What are you doing here?
Gordon, come back.
Gordon, come back.
- Yeah.
- Where are you?
- Ward A. Third floor.
- I'm coming.
Hello, doc.
Simon?
You know who I am?
Billy has told me a lot about you.
Billy is a smart boy.
What happened on Christmas night in Lowell?
Use your imagination.
I'd rather you tell me, Simon.
Peter was naughty, doc.
What did Peter do?
He shouldn't have done it, doc.
Tell me, Simon.
He scared Mary, doc.
He crept up behind her in the dark.
And he scared her.
Mary fell down, doc.
She fell on her doll.
It cut her up, doc.
It cut her up real bad.
She needed someone to help her.
So I introduced myself.
Hello, Mary.
And I told her to cut up Peter, doc.
Do it, Mary.
To cut him up real bad.
Good thing his knife was brand-new.
Real sharp.
And then, just so her mommy and daddy wouldn't get mad...
...I told her to cut them up, too.
Do it.
There was a lot of blood, doc.
So much blood.
But Mary wanted to do it.
Do it, Mary!
So she did it.
Gordon, come back, please.
Who is that?
Gordon, it's Jeff. I'm by the van.
I'm sorry, man. I was freaking out.
The lights went out.
I got these in the van. Is that okay?
Come back.
Come back.
This is Gordon.
We found the one...
The one responsible.
You've got to be kidding me.
Freaking beautiful.
Gordon!
Hello? Hello? Hello?
Phil?
McManus is here. Where are you guys?
Phil?
I mean... I mean...
He was a liability.
Who did this?
Well...
I mean... He brought it on himself.
Didn't he? I mean, it's typical...
Typical Henry.
Wrong place at the wrong time.
You did this.
Gordon.
I need you to wake up... and take... a really... really... good look at him.
Oh, Jesus.
What are you doing here?
It's okay, Hank. Hank, it's okay, it's me.
You hang in there, brother.
You hang in there.
We'll try and get you some help, okay?
You know what I wouldn't do?
I wouldn't tell anybody about this.
Because if they find out about Hank, they're gonna find out about the others.
You did this.
What are you...?
What are you doing here? Huh?
You got those guys, didn't ya?
You hired those guys to do this?
Gordy, you are asleep.
- You hired those guys to kill him.
- You're asleep.
- Where are the others?
- Open your eyes.
- Where are they?
- You've got to wake up.
- You tell me where they are.
- Would you wake up?
- Tell me.
- Would you wake up?
I am fucking awake!
Hey! Gordon!
Who you talking to, man?
Gordon?
I'm a little confused here, man.
What's, uh... Hey, what is it?
Hey, Gordon!
No!
No!
Do it, Gordon!
What are you doing here?
Why did you do it, Simon?
Because Mary let me, doc.
They always do.
What are you doing here?
They always do.
You know what I wouldn't do?
I wouldn't mention this to anyone, Gordy.
- Gordy.
- I wouldn't tell anybody about this.
Because if they find out about Hank, they're gonna find out about the others.
I found Hank, Gordy.
He's hurt, and he said you did it to him. Is that true?
Gordy? Gordy!
Who did this?
Well...
He brought it on himself.
Didn't he?
Wrong place at the wrong time.
- Where are the others?
- Gordy, you are asleep.
Uncle Gordon!
Wake up!
The lights went out.
I'm sorry, man. I was freaking out.
I got these in your van. Is that okay?
Gordy.
I need you to open your eyes now.
Wake up.
And remember.
Roses? They're lovely!
What's the occasion, Gordon?
Not here, Gordon. Later.
Watch out! Gordon!
Oh, my God, Gordon...
No!
Stop!
No, stop, Gordon! No!
Do it, Gordon.
Do it, Gordon.
Do it now.
No!
Wendy. Wendy, it's me.
Please don't hang up. Please.
I just want to say how sorry
I am for what's happened.
I am so sorry.
I am so lonely here.
I want to come home.
I want to hold you.
I want to hold my baby.
Can you forgive me?
Can you forgive me?
And where do you live, Simon?
I live in the weak and the wounded... doc.

What anniversary?
You've escorted me home every night for a year.

You missed a couple nights here and there.
I tend to turn things into a habit.
- I'm a habit?
- Yeah, you're all overme like a nun.
- What is a first anniversary, paper?
- Something cheesy.
- Cheesecake? Is that what it is?
- Yeah.
Let's go have some cheesecake.
That's a good idea.
What?
- I was just thinking.
- About what?
About what happens next.
Wie spoon until you fall asleep.
Then I go upstairs, catch a few winks...
...get up at the crack, go to work, come home...
- Have a beer and make dinner.
- Make dinner, watch TV...
...head overto the theater and walk you home.
Good.

- And then you ask me what happens next.
- That's very good. Very smooth.

...between you and this guy on that night.
Joey owes me money, and he's gonna connect me with this guy, Picasso.
He's gonna talk Picasso into giving him dope so he can step on it and sell.
Wie drive through this hurricane looking forhim. Wie find him by this refinery.
Joey goes and says something.
Picasso pulls a knife. And Joey goes off on the fucker. Wiay off.
- I'm like, "What the fuck?!"
- That his real name?
That's what people call him.
He drives a Chevy Nova.
What are you doing here, Snake?
What do you mean?
You're not what I would call a concerned citizen.
- So why did you rat out yourpal?
- Joey Nova is crazy.
He said he'd cut me up if I didn't keep my mouth shut.
You'll give us Joey.
Where do we find him?
He's usually hanging around on the boardwalk. By the old casino.
I don't know.
Suppose we pretend to believe this fuck...
...you wanna get a description of this Joey?
Let me run a make on the Chevy Nova registration.
The reason you're here is because you're scared.
What I want to know is who you're scared of. You want to tell us?
Here's your change and your order.
Bye, now.
- May I take your order?
- A bacon cheeseburger and a blowjob.
How you doing, Gina?
- Fuck off!
- That ain't no way to treat a customer.
- What do you want?
- Joey Nova.
- Like I know where he is? Like I care?
- Tell him I want my 4 grand back.
Good luck.
Just get the hell out ofhere.
How's yourkid doing?
- You're gonna get me canned, asshole.
- All right. Catch you later.
CASINO
Wie gotta get a warrant.
It'll take a couple of days and he'll vacate. Bingo.
Stinks like a sewerin here.
Look at this. It's a shooting gallery, for chrissakes.
- This is where he comes to juice.
- Anybody home?
- Wie got special delivery!
- Ice. Blue Bellies.
Snow Caps. Quills. Whatever. Hello?
- Anybody home?
- Hello?
- No buyers.
- I guess not.
I think they're all dead.
Wiell, let's get out ofhere.
This place used to be beautiful.
My old man used to take me here all the time.
That's the first time I everheard you talk about your old man.
KEY WEST
- Hey, Gina.
- What are you doing here?
I just wanted to come take a shower or something.
Did you kill that guy?
- What? What guy?
- The guy you stole the $4000 from.
- What did you do with it?
- I didn't steal $4000.
That's not what Spyder says.
- Spyder?
- Yeah, the guy worked for Spyder.
And yourfriend Snake turned himselfin.
- Fuck.
- Yeah.
Fuck.
I didn't mean to do it. He came afterme. I didn't take his money.
What have you done?
I don't know.
- Are you staying clean?
- Trying.
Gina.
You gotta get out ofhere. Spyder's been hassling me, looking foryou.
All right.
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know. I gotta get out ofhere.
Maybe get some money and...
...then maybe I'll go to Key Wiest or something.
Then I could send foryou.
I don't have the dough right now, but-
- I'm skimming at work just to get by.
- No, I didn't mean from you.
Yeah, sure, Joey.
Here.
- Here.
- No, no.
Look...
...I got this foryou.
So maybe I'll see you in Florida.
All right?
Bye.
ALL SHOWiS $2.00
OPEN ALL DAY - PEEP BOOTHS
Here you go, Herb.
- Don't let the cops catch you drinking.
- One of them lives here.
- Nice guy?
- He's an asshole. Cheap with his liquor.
Long Beach got a positive ID on the Chevy Nova.
It's registered to Joey LaMarca.
- My Joey?
- Yeah.
Could you open up four, please?
Snake, come out here for a second.
- You know who that is?
- Joey Nova.
- This the guy who killed Picasso?
- Yeah, Joey Nova.
- Got anything to add to what you told us?
- No, sir.
- You stuck him!
- I didn't, Joey did!
- Close it up!
- Get in the cage! Come on, Vince.
Lieutenant, you all right?
Joey's my son.
His mother and me are divorced.
- I'm sorry.
- Put a warrant out forhim.
Get a search warrant forthat casino where he hangs out.
Keep checking with Traffic forthe Chevy
Nova. I'm gonna go see his mother.
Coverthe back, just in case he's in there.
- Who is it?
- It's Vince.
Can I come in?
- I'm sorry. It's late.
- What do you want?
- You know where Joey is?
- Why?
He's in trouble. I think he might've killed somebody.
- You know this oryou just think it?
- I'm pretty sure.
I know a very good lawyer.
He was with the D.A.
- Really?
- I'm gonna give him a call.
So let me get this straight.
You walk out 14 years ago and now you come back giving orders.
- Our son is in trouble.
- Wie don't have a son. I do.
Nothing here belongs to you.
- Learn a new song to sing.
- You walked out on Joey.
- Not on him. I walked out on you.
- What's the difference?
I'm trying to help.
You came here to arrest your own son. lfhe's responsible.
He'll have to face up to it.
That's funny. You, talking about facing responsibilities.
You ran away. Anything got too close, you ran to yourjob.
Tell him he's better off turning himselfin to me.
You think I trust you to bring him in?
You wife beater!
You have to bring that up.
You had as much to do with it as I did.
There was neverviolence in my family. Not like the LaMarcas!
You can't save him by saying it runs in the family.
He made a choice to be there and kill.
Like you made a choice to be a bitch.
Okay, Vince, you got it off your chest.
Nothing more to say now? So go.
Just tell him he's better off turning himselfin to me.
Hey, where you been?
I thought you got shot or something.
I'm sorry, I should've called.
Are you all right?
Rough day.
- Is something wrong?
- I'm just tired.
I just don't feel like-
- I just don't feel like talking.
- Okay.
- Chief.
- Close the door.
This is CommissionerJohnson and
Vanessa Hansen from the mayor's office.
- Actually, Deputy Assistant Mayor.
- Take a seat, Vince.
Wie wanted to meet you, see how to spin this forthe media.
- Spin what?
- They know about your old man, Vince.
Wie need a story on how the son of an executed child-murdererwas...
...promoted to homicide detective.
- One of the best.
- The best.
- Of New York's finest.
My father didn't kill the kid.
It was a stupid accident.
Yes, but the 11:00 news will be all overthis. Wie want to be ready.
- They'll wanna know how you got started.
- I didn't kill the kid.
But you were hired by Police Captain
McAuley, yourfather-in-law...
...who shepherded you into Homicide.
- What about him?
He arrested my father and he took a big, big chance with me.
I know. I'm just saying that this is how the media will frame it.
Afterthe execution, I had nothing.
That cop saved me, taught me everything.
He was the kindest guy I evermet.
Make that part of your story.
"Detective LaMarca is in no way responsible.
He's had a long and honorable career despite his father's violent past-"
- He wasn't violent. What is this?
- "-and that ofhis son."
- Excuse us.
- "He has fought criminals..."
- Something like that?
- Yeah, that would work.
I have to take you off the case.
- I should reassign you too, Reg.
- I want him on it.
- It's your call.
- I don't know.
I want Joey brought in safe.
I know you'll do that.
Okay, all right.
Rossi!
You're working with Reg on this.
Take the rest of the week off.
- I don't need a week off, sir.
- This isn't a democracy.
I'll take you home.
Put my ex-wife's place under surveillance. Awiretap too.
He may have killed a guy. It's easier the second time. You know that.
Whateveryou have to do, you'll always have my respect and friendship.
I'll do everything to bring him in safe.
You want company?
- How come you're not at work?
- Took a few days off.
I'm not used to seeing you in the daylight.
I look different?
I'm sorry about yesterday.
I'm sorry I didn't call you.
Wiell, we're not in high school, right?
- I just had a tough day, you know?
- No, actually, I don't know.
I just don't like talking about work, that's all.
Okay.
You got yourplace, I got mine.
No complications, and that's okay.
I'm 43 years old,
I like to keep it simple.
I don't want to marry you.
I just want to know you.
I think I know you, then something happens...
...and I realize
I don't know you at all.
You gonna say anything?
What's there to say? It's my problem, not yours. Why make it yours?
You see?
That's exactly what I mean.
- What's up? I got something foryou.
- How much you looking for?
At least a grand.
I need some traveling money.
- Where you going?
- Florida.
Really? What you gonna be doing down there?
Wiell, my old man manages a hotel down there.
He'll get me a job tending bar.
One of those beach bars. You know, palm trees. Right on the fucking sand.
- I'll give you a grand foryour Nova.
- How will I get to Florida?
- I can't sell my Nova.
- This is all shit.
Look, I got a silver-plated.45.
Bring me the piece, we'll talk money.
- See you later.
- Dude, we never close, baby.
- Yeah?
- Mr. LaMarca?
You Joey LaMarca's father?
- Who's this?
- Friend of Joey's.
- Who are you?
- I'm Gina.
Okay, come on in, Gina.
Sit down.
You want something to drink?
No.
So where's Joey?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
When was the last time you saw him?
I got something that belongs to Joey.
I was thinking I'd leave it here with you. It's just stuff Joey saved.
- Kind oflike a scrapbook, you know?
- How did you know to come here?
Joey brought me once.
One day he said he wanted to see you.
- And where was I?
- I don't know.
He chickened out.
Wiouldn't even push the doorbell.
Just like Joey.
He wouldn't let me either.
How do you get in touch with him?
I told you.
I don't know where he is.
Keep asking questions like that, you'll have to read me my rights.
You live in Long Beach?
Yeah.
I borrowed a friend's carto get here.
I gotta get it back.
You drove into the city just to give me this?
Joe's gone.
That stuff was real important to him.
I didn't know what else to do with it, and his mother don't like me, so...
So, what do you expect me to do?
Just, like, be his dad, you know?
I gotta go. I'm gonna get a ticket.
Gina?
Thank you.
Sure.
I'll talk to you later, okay?
Cheesecake?
- That you?
- That's me.
Mom, dad?
- Connie. His name was Angelo.
- He's handsome.
My old man was executed at Sing Sing in '59...
...formurder.
I was 8.
BABY-KILLER LAMARCA
ELECTROCUTED
What happened?
He was a moving man. Moved rich people into mansions out in Locust Valley.
Somehow he got into debt. I guess it was bad. He had this idea to fix it.
This brilliant, idiotic, stupid idea:
Kidnap a baby from a rich family.
Leave a ransom note.
They'll pay, no sweat.
He kidnaps the baby. While he's waiting forthe ransom in his car...
...the baby gets tangled in a blanket in the back seat and suffocates.
First murderin Long Beach, and it was my old man.
Just a little kid, that must've been hell.
You get through anything when you have to, but it was...
What kept me sane was the cop who arrested my old man kind of adopted me.
Captain McAuley, he was a good guy.
But this...
...is the ex-wife?
- Yeah, that's Maggie.
Who's this?
That's my son, Joey.
You have a son?
I'm sorry I lied to you when I said
I didn't have any kids. I'm sorry.
- Why did you lie to me?
- I don't know.
I hadn't seen him in a long time.
The divorce was a mess.
Maggie had been seeing this guy and...
I don't know, I just...
- I lost control of the situation.
- Lost control? Is that cop talk?
Wie fought a lot, shouting and yelling. But it never got physical.
And then one day, it did.
I lost control.
I, of course, regretted it.
But we never got overthat.
On top of that, I think my son might've killed a guy the othernight.
- What?
- I'm just trying to tell you everything.
Yeah, okay. Okay.
Why haven't you seen him?
I tried at first, but Maggie made it difficult.
I had supervised visits with a social workerwatching. Like I was a criminal.
Like I was back going to prison to see my old man.
I couldn't take it.
- So you just stopped seeing him?
- Not just like that.
Maggie was also doing a number on him, so he didn't want to be around me.
I just walked away. I quit.
Maybe I should've tried harder.
I don't know.
Why couldn't you tell me this before?
Wiell, I...
I don't know, I...
That was me.
With you, it's different.
I didn't wanna ruin that.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
It's what I asked for, isn't it?
- Not so simple, huh?
- No.
No, it's not.
I'm not your ex-wife. I won't judge you.
I neverhave, I won't start now.
But I've gotta think about this.
I've gotta think about this.
See you, okay?
Gina, I want you to know
I got a lot of respect foryou.
The way you got your shit together foryourkid. I got no problem with you.
Just tell me where Joey is.
- Look, I don't know-
- Don't! I don't wanna hearit.
I'll tell you what.
I'll give you till 12 noon.
Plenty of time to feed yourkid, whateveryou gotta do.
- But afterthat, you find Joey, okay?
- Yeah.
He's a good-looking kid.
- LaMarca.
- It's Gina.
- I need some money to pay the taxi.
- All right, I'll be right down.
You okay?
No. It's 52 bucks.
Give him $60, he's a nice guy.
- Who's this?
- Your grandson.
I try not to smoke around him.
Sometimes it's just, you know...
- What's his name?
- Angelo.
- Wie haven't eaten. Got anything to eat?
- I'll make you something.
- Does Joey help you out?
- He would ifhe could, I guess.
- How do you pay yourrent?
- Wiorkfare. Flipping hamburgers.
Until they figure out I'm dipping in the register, which is any day now.
- Then I'll be totally fucked.
- When did you see him last?
Night before last. Said he was gonna get some money and go.
- Go where?
- Like he knows?
Florida. Key Wiest. Whenever he gets rabbity, he's going to Florida.
Like it's some magic country when it's only the dope capital of the world.
Can I ask you a question without you getting mad?
Depends.
When you left Joey, was it hard?
Very hard.
You miss him?
Of course.
It get easier, you know, missing him after a while?
You just stop thinking about it.
Put yourhead down, keep walking.
Otherwise it'd be too difficult.
Wias it betterforJoey, you think, that you left?
For a while. All I know is I missed out on stuff.
- Like what?
- Like teaching him about things.
Like good music. Old movies.
Not being afraid to fight. Stufflike that.
I guess what you want and what you can do are different things sometimes.
Gina, I wanna help Joey.
You can't help him.
You never did.
That's what he says.
I'm gonna go buy some smokes.
Can I borrow a couple bucks?
Yeah, my wallet is in the hall on that table.
- You need anything?
- No, thanks.
- You mind watching Angelo for a bit?
- He'll be okay.
You be good.
Mommy's gonna be right back.
His Pampers and stuff are in the duffel.
- Duffy.
- Reg.
My son's girlfriend brought overmy grandson.
- Can you hearme?
- Hello? It's a lousy connection.
She's spooked. She just went out.
When she comes back,
I'll turn up the heat.
- When she comes-
- Wie're heading to Long Beach.
- I got a warrant forthe casino.
- Wiant me to meet you?
There's Mommy.
Thattaboy.
Who's this?
This is my grandson, Angelo.
Joey's kid.
His motherjust dropped him off.
I didn't even know he existed.
Listen, Vincent.
I brought yourkeys back. I think we need to take it easy for a while.
Why don't you come in for a second and we can talk?
Wie gotta talk. Come on.
Wie should talk, you know?
- I didn't go out to buy smokes.
- What's going on?
Look, I've been thinking.
I'm thinking about scoring.
- I'm sorry I took yourmoney.
- Forget the money. Let me come get you.
I'm gonna go away for a while, okay?
Don't do this, you'll regret it.
A kid needs his mother.
- Don't do this.
- He's better off without me.
No, that's not true. Please.
I'll come get you. Where are you?
You did it.
Maybe I'm like you.
I can't do it. I just can't hang.
Stay here. Or I'll get you your own apartment. Come back.
You're gonna pay forit.
It's a big mistake. Just come back-
- Wiould you listen to me?
- Please come back.
Joey might be crashed up at that old merry-go-round.
He's gonna be up in the attic.
- You won't hurt him?
- Of course not. But please come back.
- Please, you can't leave him.
- Sorry. You know, I tried.
- I'm sorry.
- What can I do to make you-?
- She's not coming back?
- No.
She told me where Joey was.
Can you...?
Take care ofhim? Can't say no.
I came here to give you yourkey back. And to get mine.
I'll come back and take care ofhim.
Just let me do this.
Wie'll talk then, all right?
Wie're right outside.
Yeah. Okay, thanks.
Wie're down here by this casino.
- Send us some backup.
- Come on, let's go.
- You're not gonna wait?
- Vince and I were here already.
Let's see if anyone's there, then get back to town. It's late.
All right. Easy, easy.
- This place stinks.
- Yeah, the lovely smell ofhumanity.
I'm taking my gloves off.
I got them fucked up last time.
Holy shit, look at all this.
- Wiatch it. There's used needles all over.
- I'll bet.
Shit!
Fuck!
Officer down.
Officer down, Long Beach Casino!
Officer down!
Rossi, what happened?
He was up there with a gun.
Reg is overthere.
- Oh, no. Jesus.
- I'm sorry, lieutenant.
- What happened?
- They called for an assist but didn't wait.
You don't go in for a murder suspect without backup!
He said you and him were already here before together alone.
Goddamn it, Reg.
One question.
Can I have a statement?
- Chief Henderson.
- Lieutenant Katt, Long Beach Police.
Crime scene is in here.
Lt. LaMarca!
Chief wants to see you.
Okay, here's the facts as we know them so far:
A.45-caliberreported stolen from a clinic this morning.
Suspect's name is Joseph LaMarca.
He's at-
- Wiait a minute.
- Not now.
You don't have enough to make
Joey the prime suspect.
- I know it's yourkid-
- Evidence. Rossi didn't see it.
- I didn't see it.
- He didn't see anybody.
- You said Joey hung out here.
- That was just a lead.
- It doesn't prove anything.
- This is an investigation.
I'm just saying you don't have enough to make him the prime suspect.
Wie got a fingerprint match on the murderweapon.
I'm sorry, lieutenant.
It's definitely yourboy.
I'm here at the crime scene at the boardwalk...
...where a detective was gunned down during a manhunt forJoseph LaMarca...
...a murder suspect police consider armed and dangerous.
They're tearing the house apart.
They say Joey killed some cop.
Not some cop. My partner.
I know what they'll do when they find him.
I know what cops do to cop killers.
One way or another, they'll find a way to kill him.
- It's too late.
- It's not his fault.
Then whose fault is it?
Did you pull the trigger?
- He doesn't know what he's doing.
- Don't start with that.
You choose right orwrong.
He's got nobody to blame but himself.
- Please help him. You're all he's got.
- Then he's got nothing.
Please, help him!
Don't walk away from him again!
- himself the son of Angelo LaMarca, executed for a horrific murderin 1959.
This photo shows LaMarca being booked forthe murder of the baby...
...who was strangled to death while
LaMarca attempted to collect the ransom.
Marge.
Here. Take these into the living room.
Come on now. Come on.
I'm sorry it was yourboy.
That'll be hard foryou.
I'm sorry. I'm just so sorry.
It's hard to believe Reg will neverbe coming home again.
Why did he do it, Vince?
Reg neverwould have hurt yourboy.
It's just so wrong. It's just...
It's just so wrong.
I swearto God, if there's anything I can do...
Daddy, no!
Bree's gonna miss him the most.
LaMarca has had a long career with this department...
...living down the tragedy ofhis father's past and that ofhis troubled...
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Where's Angelo?
- Asleep in yourbed.
LaMarca has been moved to a different case.
There they go. The big story.
I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry, Vincent.
I went to see Reg's wife.
You know, all the other cops wouldn't look at me.
Just like it was at school.
Nobody says anything, but they think you're guilty too.
You can't blame yourself for everything.
Is Joey my fault?
I don't know. But you're not responsible for everything your son does.
He's gotta choose who he wants to be.
You think we get a choice?
Wie just pretend that we got a choice.
It's more like a sentence.
When my old man did what he did,
I felt so bad, you know.
I felt like I was the criminal.
No way I'd feel that way again. I'd be so good nobody could pin anything on me.
That was my choice.
But now, whetheryour dad is a cop or a murderer...
...some kid's father's not coming home.
That's the real life sentence.
Yeah.
So, what do we do, Michelle?
Wiant yourkeys back?
- LaMarca.
- I didn't shoot that cop.
- Joey?
- You hearme? I didn't shoot him.
I didn't shoot him.
Somebody did. I just left the wife and daughter crying.
- Wiell, it wasn't me.
- Let's meet where we watched the planes.
- What?
- Rememberwe used to watch the planes?
- Yeah.
- Rememberwhere that was?
- Yeah.
- I'll be there, just me.
Why should I trust you?
Joey, you don't have a choice.
I'll be there by myself, I promise.
Please. You gotta do it. Please.
All right.
- You gonna meet him?
- I hope so.
- What are you looking at?
- The van down there.
- They're tapping the phone.
- But you're on their side.
I don't think they see it-
I don't think they see it that way.
- Speak.
- Let's not play games.
- Sorry, chief.
- Why get cute about the meeting spot?
I know what happens if the wrong cop goes.
You got my word that nothing's gonna happen to Joey.
Yourword is good with me. If I can,
I'll bring him in to you. I gotta go.
There will be a lot of cops up here looking forme. Bring Angelo to yourplace.
- Where are you going?
- You can't say what you don't know.
You still watch those planes.
Yeah.
I met Angelo.
Gina brought him over.
Nice little kid.
Because of Gina, not me.
She won't let me see him.
She says I gotta stay away till I get clean.
Which will be whenever.
- I got this lawyerready to meet with us.
- You wanna take me in?
I wanna help.
Did you hearme? I didn't do the cop.
I come to talk to you, you bring up a lawyer.
You think maybe yourlawyer could get me the electric chair? Fuck.
Too weird, huh?
If I got the chairtoo, just like your old man?
You everthink about him?
Sure.
- Did you love him?
- He was my father. Of course I did.
Because someone's yourfathermeans you gotta love him? You think I love you?
- I don't know.
- Right. You don't even know me, do you?
No, I guess I don't.
You wanna tell me?
You know I was quarterback in high school?
No. Yourmothernevertold me anything.
- I used to look foryou in the stands.
- I would've loved to see you play.
You should have. I was good.
Wie beat Cedarhurst in the county finals.
First time in 24 years.
The crowd went wild.
I didn't need drugs that night.
I was good then.
You should have seen me.
I wish I had.
All right, fuck it.
Wie all got reasons.
So you believe me about the cop, orwhat?
- Yourprints are on the gun.
- I wasn't there when the cop went down.
That cop had a name.
His name was Reg.
So who was there?
Fucking scumbag dealernamed Spyder.
He's afterme forhis fucking $4000.
If I had it,
I'd be on a plane to Florida.
Did you see him?
No, I didn't see him do it but I saw him right after.
- I mean right after. In the alley there.
- What about Picasso?
I don't know.
Look, I was fucked up...
...he came at me with a knife...
- I guess, in a sense, I killed him.
- In a sense?
I don't know what happened. One minute we're fighting and the next he's dead.
But that wasn't me.
All right? That wasn't the real me.
I wouldn't count on a jury believing that.
This is something you can't run away from. You can't. You can't run.
- Do you believe me?
- It doesn't matterwhat I believe.
Plead self-defense, you could get off with maybe six years.
What ifit matters to me what you believe?
I gotta take you in, you know that.
What are you, a cop ormy father?
I'm both.
I'm getting out ofhere.
What are you now?
Joey, come on!
Just fucking with you.
I knew the answer.
You know, when I was a kid,
I wanted to be a cop.
I really did.
Just like you.
Chief.
Where's yourboy?
Picasso worked for a dealer called Spyder.
Spyder's afterJoey forhis $4000.
Joey told me he saw Spyderin the alley by the casino after Reg was hit.
- Why didn't you bring yourboy in?
- He told me he didn't kill Reg.
- You believed him?
- I believed him.
He's your son, of course you wanna believe him.
- I've been a cop 25 years-
- The operative word is "cop."
You're not sometimes a cop, sometimes a junkie's father.
You're either a cop oryou're not a cop. End of story.
This is bullshit.
You're under oath to perform your duty. In this investigation-
What investigation?
You already made yourmind up.
Peace, all right?
Don't be playing no bullshit neither.
A motherfucking ghost.
- How come you still breathing, Casper?
- Listen.
Athousand dollars formy Nova.
Cops got yourwheels, boy.
I'm sorry, man.
Will you do me a solid here, please?
I need help.
Please.
What's the ring?
- It's a football ring. It ain't for sale.
- Let me see.
This is worth like 100, easy.
But I'm saving it formy son.
Wie'll treat it like a loan until I get you the 100 back.
Yeah, sure.
All right.
Here.
No, Carl, I can't use this.
I need cash.
- You'd be the first junkie who couldn't.
- Give me the ring.
Back the fuck off!
You lucky I'm giving you anything!
Please, the ring's important.
It's formy boy.
You ain't gonna be around to see yourboy.
And you ain't going to Florida.
You got Spyder and the cops chasing you. You a junkie!
Only place you're going is the morgue.
County, motherfucker!
Wiait a minute! What are you doing?
There's nothing in there foryou.
Wiant to come over and see my soup?
Look, here's grandpa.
This is Evelyn Hancock.
She's an old friend.
You're a big boy, Angelo.
Evelyn is with Child Services.
What's going on?
She's taking Angelo until
Gina comes back. It's temporary.
She's not coming back.
I can't take care ofhim.
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure.
Go see this nice lady.
I just wanna talk to him for a minute.
- What are you doing?
- What am I supposed to do?
- Take care ofhim. You're his grandfather.
- Nice idea, but I can't.
Vincent, Gina's gone.
You think his fatheris coming back?
- This is the best thing forhim.
- No, you're the best thing forhim.
- I can help you.
- You neverhad kids, you don't know.
- You're gonna walk away from him.
- What do you mean, walking away?
- Like with Joey.
- I'm not walking away!
- That's what you said you did with Joey.
- I'm not-Wialk away?
Let me show you something.
Let me show you something.
You think I want him growing up with this? Like the son of Frankenstein?
"You neverknow what he might do."
"Don't mention his father!"
Call it walking away, but I'm doing the best thing forhim.
That is not about Angelo.
That's about you.
You told me. You told me you neverhad a choice, right?
- Wiell, you got one right here.
- Michelle, try to understand.
Right now it's more than I can handle.
I can't do it.
That's how you make a choice.
Goodbye.
Morning.
Let's try to wrap this up.
Wie got pretty substantial evidence.
Fingerprints are clear.
There are no others on the gun.
Shells and ballistics identify it as the shooter's.
Wie know he frequented the carousel and used drugs there.
- Excuse me, sir.
- Go ahead, Dave.
A shoe print in the blood doesn't match LaMarca's size.
So, what do we think?
That O.J. was there?
Maybe Bruno Magli?
One last thing.
This kid has killed twice.
Don't give him a chance to do it again. Wie got that?
You got a phone call on my phone.
How come you're giving out my number?
- I don't even know yournumber.
- This guy knows it.
Make sure you leave a nickel in the ashtray.
Dave Simon.
I couldn't call you direct.
What's going on?
I have something you should see.
Could we meet at York and 59th Street Bridge?
It's copies of crime scene photos
I tried to mention.
What are they?
Footprints in the blood at the top of the ladder.
Wie can account for all of them...
...except for one heel from a size 10 cowboy boot made by Justin Boots.
At your ex-wife's we found some of Joey's stuff.
Joey wears a size 121/2 shoe.
There's no 121/2 prints anywhere in this blood.
I appreciate this.
Wiell, you know, it doesn't all have to be bullshit.
- You born in Long Beach?
- No, Army brat. Wie lived all over.
- Distant climes, huh?
- Wie traveled a lot.
- Now we got a baby. I hardly get out.
- Kids change everything.
Isn't that the truth.
Sir, listen,
I'm real sorry about your son.
I appreciate it. Thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
City by the Sea
It's more than I can handle.
- Wie just pretend we got a choice.
- Wie don't have a son, I do.
I wasn't gonna feel that again.
- You think I love you?
- I should've tried harder.
You said you neverhad a choice.
- What are you, a cop ormy father?
- That's my son.
Please help him. You're all he's got.
He's your son!
This is something you can't run away from.
Just like his dad.
Sorry, sir. Wie're closed.
- Anybody know where Spyderis?
- Wie're closed, mister.
Where's Spyder?
Peace, brother. Peace.
Stick the Friar Tuck act up your ass.
Where's Spyder?
- You know who I am?
- Yeah-
Tell Spyder I know he killed my partner. I got proof.
He wants to see me, I'm at the Seaway
Motel. Room 105. You got that?
Yeah.
105. Seaway Motel.
Here's where we're expecting the storm.
On ourmap, lots of green.
And within that, yellows and reds.
These are the areas where we're expecting heavy rain.
In New York City, the storm will move in by tomorrow morning.
You got something forme?
Dave Simon.
Lt. LaMarca.
Got it.
I want backup and emergency units to Ocean and Neptune. Lt. Katt?
OCEAN AV
NEPTUNE AV
Don't fucking move!
Don't move a finger.
Give me the gun.
Give me the fucking gun! Go ahead.
Move!
What the fuck is this?
What are you doing telling people I shot that cop?
I know you killed my partner, scumbag.
It was yourjunkie kid.
I'm not the only one that thinks so.
You left a footprint in his blood.
Are those Justin, size 10?
- You're a long way from Manhattan.
- But too close to home foryou.
You broke into my property.
I'm within my rights to defend it.
I couldn't take the chance he'd hurt Gina or Angelo.
Wiould be just like him.
You broke in here pretty good.
You learn that in cop school?
So, what now, Joey?
Hold back and hold yourfire!
Hold yourfire!
Keep eyes on that door and those windows!
Block that road!
I don't want one TVvan!
Right up there.
Okay, enough. Give me the gun.
It'll be hard enough getting you out alive without them seeing that.
This is no game, son. Please.
You saved my life but they didn't see it. They don't care.
- I ain't going to jail.
- I understand. I wanna help you, just...
Just give me the gun.
Lt. LaMarca, signal yourlocation!
All right, talk.
Talk?
What are you now, fucking Oprah?
You got a son and a woman that loves you. Don't run away from that.
- You did.
- Yeah.
I did.
And I'm sorry.
I've regretted it ever since.
Wie all gotta pay one way or another, right?
What's going on?
It's called "suicide by cop."
Quick and easy.
No pills. No fucking around.
I thought I'd try it.
How did we get this way?
I rememberthe day you were born.
Wiell, I rememberthe day you left.
So we're even.
- I'm not gonna kill you, son.
- Wiell...
Yourfriends out there will.
You know it.
- There he is!
- You two!
Hold back! Hold yourfire!
Get the building secure.
Give me the gun.
- I don't want to shoot you.
- You do. You think I deserve it.
- Get back!
- But you won't. It's not the real you.
- You don't know anything about me.
- I do. You're my kid.
You're not a bad kid. You're a scared kid whose old man left him.
You didn't get a choice and it hurt. I know.
But you're my son. You always will be.
Then why did you leave?
I was stupid. I forgot what it felt like to be alone.
You don't want to do to Angelo what
I did to you. What my old man did to me.
- You can't.
- He don't need a junkie.
You're not a junkie to him.
My old man wasn't a killerto me.
When my old man left, I hated him all my life forwhat he did to me.
But all I wanted was forhim to walk in the doorbecause I missed him.
I didn't want to be alone anymore.
Wie all pay a price forwhat we do, but when's enough?
Because I paid. And you paid. And what?
Now Angelo has to pay?
You can't! Wie got a second chance here, me and you.
I let you think you didn't matterto me.
But I swear I won't run away again.
I'll stay with you, I promise.
You just need to choose it.
Know how many people would love a second chance?
Help me.
- Dad, are you okay?
- It's just my shoulder.
- I didn't do it.
- I know.
Get rid of the guns!
Empty yourpockets.
Don't give them an excuse.
- They'll kill me.
- It's okay. I'm with you now.
Identify yourself!
It's okay.
It's okay, there are no guns!
Raise yourhands.
See the hands? No guns.
- Get down, drop the gun!
- Show us yourhands!
- They're down.
- Move away!
Move away from him!
- Told you to move away!
- Take it easy.
All right, take it easy on him!
Listen! Anything happens to him, you'll answerto me.
Easy with him! lt'll be all right.
It's okay, son. It's okay.
Here he comes.
This way.
Wiatch yourhead.
I love you.
I want to go on the rocks.
Yeah, those are the rocks.
That's the jetty.
Let's go on the rocks.
Yeah, those are the rocks.
Look, see that?
You see that, the airplane? See?
- Where do you think that's going?
- Flying...
You want to fly away with your dad sometime? Yeah?
Because he wants to go with you.
He told me so.
He told me he wants to take you to Key Wiest.
You wanna go?
Yeah? Good.
When he comes back, you'll go with him to Key Wiest.
Me, you and him.
Grandpa, Daddy and you.
Wie're gonna go to Key Wiest.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
Okay, sweetheart.
You want to put the water in the thing?
Go put the waterin the thing.
Stop pushing.
Stop pushing.
Please, calm down.
In November of 1924, during a weekend yacht party bound for San Diego, a mysterious death occurred within the Hollywood community.
However, there was no coverage in the press, no police action, and of the 1 4 passengers on board, only one was ever questioned by authorities.
Little evidence exists now, or existed at the time, to support any version of those weekend events.
History has been written in whispers.
This is the whisper told most often.
The yacht, you see, belonged to
William Randolph Hearst.
Only in a place like this do reporters and autograph hounds have absolutely no scruples about stampeding mourners at a funeral.
Welcome to Hollywood, a land just off the coast of the planet earth.
After we all leave, the man in the box will disappear.
Just his ashes will remain.
After all, it's fire that can hurt you, not ashes.
...you're listening to KFI.
And stay tuned for our weekend music marathon, with our own
KFI studio orchestra.
I fear this bizarre yet fascinating town, but I can't leave it.
You see, I'm never quite certain if I'm visiting the zoo, or if I'm one of the animals in a cage.
Don't you dare!
I will not be seen arriving early.
Yes, ma'am.
I want to avoid the solution to this riddle but the man in the box forces us to confront it.
All of us were there that weekend.
Stop!
I am not here.
The birthday boy is early.
He must be anxious.
My God, this thing must be 200 feet.
- He owns that?
And the ocean it's sitting in and the sky above.
What are you doing?!
The old boy should give you the ship as a birthday present, Tom.
We could sell it and get the studio out of hock.
Don't be melodramatic,
George, no one's in hock.
We're not far away.
I don't know about this new strategy.
It's like I told you, people's tastes have changed.
They want to read more modern stories.
Contemporary, adult.
Like the kind you read in Hearst's magazines.
Will it be like this all the way to San Diego and back?
Besides, he has a lot of other assets to offer.
Yeah, cash.
I still don't think it's the right time. Too obvious.
Relax, George.
No one's going to be obvious.
Business. Business.
Yes, take that bag.
Kono, a starving man eats the wooden planks of his log cabin.
- Is that funny?
- No, Mr. Chaplin. Not funny.
Don't hold back.
Tell me what you really think.
Huh? Hmm?
Don't tell me
Elinor Glyn has arrived on time?
Good God, perhaps even early?
Oh... all right then.
Hello, you little bastard.
The "little" I object to.
I see your young passion flame is not accompanying you.
Lita? She's not here?
I seem to have forgotten her.
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
Oh my God!
...they cost him a fortune.
Mr. Chaplin, it is an honor, and I mean a true honor to meet you, sir.
Louella Parsons.
I write for Mr. Hearst's paper the New York American.
I've been there a whole year.
Louella Parsons of the East, meet Elinor Glyn of the West.
Elinor is the finest and naughtiest writer in the entire world.
Oh, you don't have to tell me that.
I wish I could be introduced as being "of the West."
Whatever makes you happy, dear.
Well,
I'll leave you two alone.
I have something-or-other to attend to.
Mr. Chaplin, did you happen to notice the rave review
I gave your last picture,
"A Woman of Paris"?
Yes, I did.
Thank you, that was most kind.
So deserved, so deserved.
It just stinks that nobody went to see it.
At least you won't lose your shirt on the next picture too.
I hear at least you have the good sense to be in this one.
"The Gold Rush."
I hear that's just a hint as to how much this picture is costing you.
Oh, there's the birthday boy!
- Marion, sweetheart.
- Happy birthday.
Thank you. It's not until tomorrow but I always love it when a beautiful girl kisses me.
- Wow, look at you!
- Thanks.
We should try to find a naval picture for you, so we can get this look on film.
- What do you think, George?
- Absolutely.
- Drinks?
- A natural comic too.
- Thanks.
- So, where's our captain?
He'll be down in a minute.
...if I'm truly going to make a difference, is a daily column with my name on top, marking the place where both the people in the audience and on the screen can come together to read the truth, not just vicious gossip and innuendo.
Keep after old WR,
I'm sure he'll come around.
I plan to, believe you me.
Take you, for example.
I want you to know that l, for one, am so sorry about your difficulties with your little co-star, this little girl, Lita...
Oh! We're here.
- Allow me.
- Yes, it's... moving.
Oh! So, Mr. Chaplin, if you ever need a sympathetic person to confide in, I'm all ears.
After all, you'll need someone on your side when the shocking truth emerges.
Thank you very much, Ms. Parsons.
- Lolly.
- Hmm?
Lolly. All my close friends call me Lolly.
- Lolly.
- Um-hmm.
So, Mr. Chaplin...
Goddamn son of a bitch!
If you kids'll excuse me again for a sec.
- Charlie, how are you?
- Safe, for the moment.
You know George Thomas, my business partner?
- George.
- Charlie.
This is Miss Margaret Livingston,
George's guest and a delightful actress.
- Charmed, I'm sure.
- Me too.
- And Mrs. Ince?
- Couldn't make it, one of our boys isn't feeling well.
- Sorry to hear that.
- Yeah...
Say, that "Woman of Paris" was a terrific picture.
Pretty big risk you took by not being in it.
You're a risk taker, Charlie, just like me.
Just when you got everyone laughing at your Little Tramp character, you make some weepy melodrama without him.
You can't fault the man for taking a gamble.
And anyhow, failure is a character builder. Right, Charlie?
I don't know, Tom, you tell me.
Thanks a lot. You introduce me and then you hog him to yourself.
Little prick.
Really? I hear he's got a pretty big one.
Actors running a studio.
It's like the goddamn serfs running the palace.
He lost his shirt in that last picture.
He's so over budget on "The Gold Rush," his partners aren't even returning his phone calls.
And his 1 6-year-old leading lady collapsed on the set... pregnant.
- No kidding?
- Uh-huh.
They learn about the birds and bees so much younger these days.
The buzz is that
Chaplin did the pollinating.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, Zoe. Can you get me some more of these? Thank you.
Did you hear that hack lecture me?
Hack? The man built three movie studios all by himself.
Just 'cause he builds a paint shop doesn't make him Van Gogh.
Why haven't...
Come here.
Why haven't you returned any of my phone calls, you little shit?
'Cause I hate telephones.
Maybe I was calling to tell you to stay away this weekend.
That would pretty much ensure that I turn out, wouldn't it?
Willie's heard about us.
He's even had private detectives around.
He only invited you so he could watch us.
Nothing can happen this weekend.
What are you doing next weekend?
Jesus, Charlie! You didn't get me into bed and you're not going to.
- Says who? You or Captain Willie?
- Says me.
I've got to go help little Miss Lolly...
I mean it!
You start anything, I'll throw you and your smirk overboard.
Marion!
Do you believe
I would've stayed away?
No.
But you should really believe that I wanted you to.
I won't have anybody walk on this boat without being introduced to everybody.
Lolly, this is everybody.
Everybody, this is Lolly.
- Hi.
- Louella Parsons.
This is one of Willie's insightful movie reviewers.
Especially because of the wonderful things she writes about me.
And...
I wrote them before I knew you were Mr. Hearst's...
You know, before you and the boss... I knew that...
Uhm...
Gosh, this thing is big, isn't it?
Yes, dear, but does he know how to use it?
Well, that's that.
I'll get the captain so we can shove off.
Did you hear that, Pops?
I'm coming up.
Very convincing.
- Oh, is anyone here yet?
- Everyone's here and you know it.
Are you gonna come down from Mount Olympus or what?
There's no need for sarcasm, Marion.
You're the one up here in radio central spying on everyone.
- Those who have nothing to fear...
- Save the Bible quotes.
- It's not from the Bible.
- Whoever then.
Fine, go right ahead and keep spying
'cause there's nothing to see.
There have been whispers.
Stop listening to whispers and listen to me.
There's nothing going on between me and Charlie.
Okay?
I bought you something... in New York.
- Willie...
It's beautiful.
But you already gave me a butterfly brooch.
Oh no! That's diamonds and rubies.
This is diamonds and jade.
You don't have one of these.
There are a lot of things
I don't have.
- If you love someone...
- You can't buy me all of them. you try to get them what they don't get themselves.
I love you so much.
Don't ever stop.
And I'll always be here, don't you know that?
Thank you.
Every time you thank me... what do I say?
"Shut up and keep me happy, Pops."
Exactly.
Ah, Dr. Goodman.
I didn't see you come on board.
You know me, Joe.
Elusive as ever.
- How's the chief today?
- A little edgy, Dan.
- Marion?
- Why else?
No, I mean, how is Marion?
Oh. The usual.
- Spunky.
- Uh-huh.
Permission to come aboard!
Here we go.
- Frank, how are you?
- Joseph!
- Not late, are we?
- Not at all, not at all.
- Who's he?
- Boring Frank Barham, the pill of the
Hearst publishing world.
They are invited to remind WR that for every one of us
- There are two of them.
- What's the wife called?
Who knows?
Oh my word!
What a big boat!
Correction, who cares?
Marion! Marion, honey.
Do you trust Tom Ince?
Do you trust him?
Well, he doesn't drink during the day.
- Can't trust him.
- Hmm? Oh...
And I better not catch you two talking business.
- Or what?
- Or you'll get yours.
Aww...
Well, here he is.
Finally.
Welcome!
Such a remarkable economy of words for one who controls more print than Jesus Christ.
Take that back, or I'll have to dishonor your good name.
I hope someone does.
I'm feeling rather frisky.
Lolly, Madam Glyn would like a word.
Bastard!
Mrs. Glyn, I've read every one of your wonderful, wonderful books.
How lovely for you, dear, but do forgive me,
I have to go to write another one.
Chief, it's nearly noon.
We should try to keep on schedule.
Stop!
Raise the gangplank!
- No!
- Oh my God!
- Wait!
- Stop!
Oh, thank God.
He always does this to us!
Every time!
I'm sweating like a pig.
How am I gonna land anyone with sweat dripping down my nose?
Don't bitch, Didi,
I'm not in the mood.
Hi! Hello!
I think this is going to be a most enjoyable boat ride.
Yeah... the cat's meow.
That's it everybody!
Out to sea!
Wow.
Jesus Christ, Tom!
- You want everyone to hear you?
- Yes!
- Be sensible, please.
- God!
You said this time was going to be different, that I was going to come off
George's arm and onto yours.
You will.
We've gotta be delicate.
We've got to find the right moment.
No one cares if you're having an affair.
Look at Hearst and Marion, for Christ's sake!
Mrs. Hearst knows about Marion.
She doesn't approve of divorce, but she approved the arrangement.
She wants to stay a very rich woman with the last name of Hearst.
Who can blame her?
Now it's your innocent, vulnerable wife who's the excuse.
I'm trying to make a deal with the guy.
So not getting on his morally objectionable side...
The man's whole life is morally objectionable!
You're getting loud!
Sorry. You just... get me crazy sometimes.
No, you're right.
I'm sorry. It's my fault.
I'm not giving you a chance to strut your stuff.
- I don't want to strut my stuff...
- See, there you go...
- You're selling yourself short.
- I just want to strut with you.
You're a fabulous actress and you should be given a chance to shine.
We can't be pushy is all I'm saying.
Let me work some of my magic on the old man... and we'll get you noticed.
As an actress or on your arm?
The lady places a tall order, but maybe we can do both.
- Yeah?
- Hmm...
Okay.
"Flames of Youth"?
Dear God!
WR, you're early for dinner.
I always like to come out just before sundown.
The best time to watch for seagulls.
What? Oh, yeah.
Beautiful creatures.
You know, Tom,
I just love movies.
I always thought the press was the most powerful thing for a communicator
- But that's not true these days.
- You're absolutely right.
Words don't always translate well across seven continents.
But through those fabulous, fabulous moving pictures...
Well, it's a universal language, and morality and politics... and any other goddamn thing
I can put into someone's head.
Son of a bitch!
Your days are numbered, you little bastard!
You gotta keep your gun low or else they see it.
Yeah, yeah... I see.
- Can I be frank with you, WR?
- You can be whoever you like, Tom.
I think your eye for movies is right on target.
- You do?
- But you have to face facts.
There's some things even you can't control.
- Like what?
- Your whole empire, your family, is based on the east coast.
- The movies are in California.
- I'm aware of that.
You should also be aware that movie producers can't send orders over the telephone and they can't have yes men represent them when real decisions...
You're being almost inexcusably frank.
God damn it!
There's a lot of money in movies, WR.
Yeah, mine!
I've made millions from this business and... we both know that despite the quality of your pictures you've never made back a dime...
All right, suppose I believe your frank observations, are you implying that Thomas H. Ince can make a difference?
I'm not implying,
I'm stating.
I'm talking about personally overseeing Cosmopolitan Pictures.
- Marion's career in particular.
- How personally?
Well... consulting with you on which scripts and directors are right for her.
- Making sure her productions...
- What's in it for you?
The stories in Cosmopolitan and other magazines, for starters.
Hmm...
It's not that I doubt your background in the business, Tom.
On the contrary... that's just where it's been lately, in the background.
You have to admit, you're not the force you were five years ago.
That maybe true of both of us, WR.
But I think we both have different strengths to help the other's weaknesses.
No offense, Tom...
But if I'm in trouble I don't need a cripple to help me up.
Ha! Gotcha!
Look at him fall.
Splash.
That's the one that tried to get away before. Stupid bird!
You've ever eaten a seagull, Tom?
- No.
- They taste awful.
Just like eating a crow.
Are you gonna let me in?
I'll kick the door in.
I'll kick your teeth in.
- Come to my room then.
- Your room?
I mean it. I have a love letter that needs proofreading.
Why don't you have Lita proofread it?
- She's not old enough to read.
- How could I forget?
Admit it. You're in love with me, aren't you?
Not as much as you are with you, Charlie.
Oh, Doctor. There's something
I wanted to ask you.
Every time I eat grapes
I get extreme palpitations.
I wouldn't worry about it.
My heart starts pounding and then I break out in a rash.
Everything all right, Chief?
Everything's just fine.
I can't believe he still only let us have one drink.
Well, Didi, it is illegal.
Yeah, but not for us.
You had yours?
I'm saving it for later when I'll really need it.
"I don't need a cripple."
He actually said that to you?
Nice way to treat the guest of honor, huh?
If I had the same mean streak,
I'd throw that fling
Marion and Chaplin are having right on his face.
- Marion and Chaplin?
- Saw them holding hands on deck.
Notice they're the only ones we're still waiting for.
I advise you to keep it to yourself.
- I know, I'm a decent man.
- I need my escort, if you don't mind.
I hope you were not waiting for me to eat your appetizers.
Since you've decided to grace us with your presence, perhaps you'd have the decency to tell us where to sit.
If Willie had it his way, he'd talk business all night.
So you, Mr. Birthday Boy, will sit at my end of the table.
And Willie, why don't we have
Charlie sit by you
- To keep you laughing all night?
- Or is that vice versa?
Now, Charlie, hold your tongue.
And your seat.
You got me, WR.
I've done it to many people, but never had it done to me.
How does it feel?
Invigorating.
Get over here, Lolly.
Sit down.
That was hysterical, Mr. Hearst.
Good band, huh?
Especially the saxophone player, eh?
Yeah, isn't he... ooh, you caught me.
So, Big Joe, what have you been up to since I saw you last?
Well, I saw you in "Lady of the Harem."
Ohh, you did, huh?
And what did your mama think about that?
Well, Mama was sitting on my lap.
You're a dirty, dirty boy.
I should forget about him if I were you.
Pardon me?
Married moguls and mistresses don't mix, Margaret.
Oh, it's rather good.
I must use that in a novel.
- Have you got a pen?
- Yes.
Marion, not even a teensy weensy bit of business talk?
What is it, Tom?
I'm trying to negotiate a deal with WR, and you gotta tell me the secret.
How do you get through to him?
- You want to know my secret?
- Uh-huh.
I don't have to do a goddamn thing.
I don't follow you.
People have funny ideas about me and Willie.
- The whole gold-digger thing.
- No, no, no! I didn't mean...
The truth is,
Willie did the pursuing.
He used to buy two seats every night when I was in the Follies.
One for him and one for his hat.
I never once asked him to put me in a picture.
It would take more to get him to stop putting me in his pictures.
That's my secret, Tom.
With Willie, I don't have to dig.
So, your husband is Mr. Frank Barham?
- Yes, he certainly is.
- Hello, darling.
- Who's that?
- That's Mr. Barham.
Oh, I thought maybe your lover was on board. Too bad.
- Dan, don't be modest.
- Oh, no.
Mr. Hearst takes full responsibility for Cosmopolitan Pictures.
Everyone knows you're one of his top executives.
I'm actually a physician by trade.
- Oh, you're a doctor?
- Semi-retired.
Oh nice. Very...
Medicinal.
Maybe I should ask you.
What do you think, Charlie, about Marion's pictures, how we've been handling her?
I don't think you've recognized that she's a wonderful comedienne.
I mean, her eyes, her smile, her laugh. She's a delight.
Comedy... I don't want people laughing at Marion.
Well, she doesn't need any more stodgy period dramas.
Excuse me, but Marion belongs in serious, important pictures, certainly not running around in baggy pants comedy.
No offense, Charlie.
Excuse me, you're not doing what's right for Marion.
No offense, WR.
I'd like to make a toast.
It's usually Willie's job, but as you know, a few weeks ago, us gals, we got to vote for president again.
So I figured I can do whatever the hell I darn well please.
Here's to our birthday boy.
Not only did Tom invent the cowboy picture, but he helped build this town.
He figured out how to run a studio that could make
- 1 0 movies at the same time.
- And took credit for all of them!
Oh, Willie!
- To Tom!
- To Tom!
Thank you.
That was very sweet.
Mr. Hearst,
I just want to say, it's so wonderful to be here.
The more I see the lovely people of California the more I'm reminded of the need for a columnist...
You know, Lolly, the first rule of California living is never to mix business with pleasure.
Now, what were you saying?
Oh, uh...
I was just saying it's so... wonderful to see all these fascinating people assembled in one place.
You see, Charlie?
That's why I've hired her.
Even with a gun to her head she still gives me unconditionally rave reviews.
As long as nobody pulls the trigger...
What are you laughing about down there?
It was the funniest thing ever! it was all about... there was a gun at my head and somebody pulled the trigger!
Guns and triggers, such violence!
All in line with Madame Elinor's
California Curse.
California Curse?
What's that?
Not that nasty thing.
Not now.
Yes, Elinor, do educate our visitor.
The California Curse strikes you like a disease the minute you set foot in Hollywood, so pay close attention.
Oh, I am, I am.
You see, this place you've arrived in, this place we call home, isn't a place at all, but a living creature.
A living creature?!
More precisely, an evil wizard.
Like in the old stories.
- And you all live on him?
- Like fleas on the belly of a mutt.
Exactly.
But unlike the helpless dog, this wizard is able to banish the true personalities of those he bewitches, forcing them against their will to carry out his command, to forget the land of their birth, the purpose of their journey, and whatever principles they once held dear.
Don't forget about the symptoms, that's my favorite part.
The curse is taking hold of you if you experience the following: you see yourself as the most important person in any room; you accept money as the strongest force in nature; and finally, your morality vanishes... without a trace.
Well, thank God none of us have been infected, eh, WR?
Umm... yes.
Thank God for that.
Charleston, everybody!
Come on, Pops, let's show 'em how it's done!
You bet!
What are you looking at?
Oh, I'm tired.
Let's sit down.
Sit? I want to pound my feet so hard the devil will complain.
Come on, Jay, take us to the moon!
They've just shot all this a couple of days ago.
I haven't seen any of it yet.
Shh!
It's wonderful...
There!
You see that throne?
That throne is from the 1 6th century.
That's King Lewis II.
I brought that over from Hungary.
Honey, you're wonderful.
Just wonderful.
Get in there!
- Ow!
Wow, Marion, look at you!
Yeah, but that movie sure went in the shithouse.
Okay, Willie's at the wheel for two hours so who's first?
- I am!
- Hands off, you little tramp!
Marion, you always have the best moonshine.
That's because every hour, bottles arrive from her many admirers.
Well, this one sure's got sex appeal. Who gave it to you?
Who do you think?
Hmm, I see...
Well, it's mine now.
Ahoy there.
Tom, how are you?
Stuffed!
That was some banquet.
Wait until tomorrow. Marion's prepared quite a birthday feast.
- Marion is a special woman.
- Yep, she is.
It's so hard to love someone in our business.
There's so many men who prey on beauty.
And not sincerely either, but in cruel ways, just for the conquest.
Take a character like Chaplin for example.
He's absolutely notorious.
I'm sure you've heard about Lita, his leading actress.
Mm-hmm.
Apparently she's pregnant with his child... she's only 1 6 for Christ sakes!
That's why I keep my Nell far away from show people.
Women aren't as strong as we are.
They're easily fooled, their hearts are easily corrupted.
Yeah, yeah, it is a concern.
It must be, especially... considering the amount of time you're forced to spend 3,000 miles apart.
This might be something else
I can help you with.
- What do you mean?
- Well... if we were to merge our motion picture interests, along with all the other benefits,
I could keep an eye on her for you.
Hmm...
What makes you think she needs to be watched?
- Well, she certainly has...
- Is four a crowd?
Not at all. Join us.
You were saying, Tom?
We can talk later.
- Such a charming cabin!
- Good night, everyone.
What a nice man.
Yes. Very nice.
- Here I am with surprises!
- Charlie!
- Let's see what you got, Celia.
- It's dope, Didi.
You had that the whole car ride?
If I'd told you in the car that box would be empty right now.
Is it true what they say about a Jazz man and his instrument?
- Every word, sister.
- Oh!
You're with me.
Come on.
Hey!
You're not gonna be a flat tire about our playtime, are you?
You do as you like,
Marion, dear.
Just don't expect me to join you in such infantile nonsense.
Frank, I admire your marriage.
So simple... clean.
- Thank you, WR.
- Nothing complicating things.
Frankly I feel uninteresting compared with the... colorful lifestyles of your other guests.
Lord knows what they're all up to at this hour.
Frank,
I won't hear such talk.
The codes of decency are something to be held in high regard.
We should feel no shame for not being as liberal-minded as the rest.
Darling, please.
No disrespect, but you know what one of those actress persons
- Said to me at dinner?
- What?
She had the gumption to ask if Frank was my lover!
- No!
- Yes!
What did you tell her?!
I said, "Mr. Barham is my husband, deary, we're not lovers."
- You set her straight.
- The thought of such a thing!
Among the finest
I've ever tasted, Celia.
The absolute finest.
- Who is it?
- It's me.
If you say,
"It's Tom Ince to see Ms. Margaret Livingston alone in her cabin on a Saturday night," you'll get a big surprise.
It's uh...
Tom Ince to see
Miss Margaret Livingston alone in her cabin on a Saturday night.
I suppose that's the best
I'll get out of you.
...He said it was a sausage!
All right, everyone, time for charades!
We call them "sha-raids."
These are the subjects
I've prepared.
Well...
We will be one team.
Very well.
Didi and Celia will be team two.
- What a gyp.
- Shut up!
Come on, Marion. Choose.
Two medical students
I once knew.
- Let them get started.
- Noo...
"Indian Love Call," by Harback and Hammerstein!
- Guppies!
- No, no.
King and Queen Tut!
There was no Mrs. Tut!
- Oh oh oh!
- Oh, he's getting her now.
Concubines!
Oohh!
I know! Sex!
This charade is being misread.
Marion, come outside so I can explain it to you.
Now, Marion, what's going on?
I promised myself this wouldn't happen.
You had to promise yourself?!
I don't know, l... can't think straight.
Have you slept with him?
- No.
- Have you?!
- No!
- Thank God.
You're not in love with him?
He thinks he's in love with me.
Charles is only capable of a monogamous relationship with his own movies.
But I want to trust him before l...
Before you what?!
Listen to what you're saying!
You know, Willie's the first man who ever had faith in me.
And I'm all he's got keeping him a human being.
I think he'd... he'd... he'd die if I left him.
I think he would.
And you think Charles Chaplin would die if you left him?
Charlie might cry at my grave and recite some lousy poem he wrote.
But give him a day or two and he'd be back in the market.
A day or two?
Charles would copulate with a reasonably attractive pallbearer.
What is it, baby?
I'm sorry.
No. Don't be sorry.
- It's just that...
- Talk to me.
- It's just what?
- Everything.
- I feel like it's all slipping away.
- What is?
Everything. Me.
Tonight Hearst called me a cripple in the picture business.
- That's a lousy thing to say.
- Do people see me as a cripple?
- No.
- Or a credit hog?
- No, honey.
- Oh God...
I used to be a force in this town.
- You are a force.
- Not too long ago.
I used to make 40 pictures a year.
Now I'm lucky if I can get one off the ground.
- God, I need him so badly.
- You'll get him.
- You think so?
- I know so.
- Do you?
- Yeah, I know it.
You're a force.
- I am, aren't I?
- You are.
Marion must think you're a lousy kisser or else she'd be back by now.
Hey, Charlie, you look just like
Adolphe Menjou in this ad.
That's 'cause it is Adolphe Menjou.
No wonder I never heard of the picture. Who wants to see a Charlie Chaplin production without Charlie Chaplin?
Type it up, will you?
Shit.
Just be strong and keep telling him no.
- Understand?
- Yeah.
Four people on the bed and Chaplin's the only one asleep.
That's something you don't see every day.
WR?
A wire's come through from the New York office.
It's an item that will be published in tomorrow's
New York Daily News.
- Grace Kingsley.
- Oh God!
Which one of my pictures is she bashing now?
- I'll leave it here for you.
- No, no, go ahead and read it.
"Charlie Chaplin continues to pay ardent attention to Marion Davies.
He's spent the evening at Montmartre dining and dancing with the fair Marion the other night.
There was a lovely young dancer entertaining that evening.
And Charlie applauded but with his back turned.
He never took his eyes off
Marion's blonde beauty.
Miss Davies looked very fetching indeed."
Photos?
Studio close-ups of each of them.
- Placed side by side?
- Yeah.
Caption?
"They're still seen around with each other."
I'll leave it here for you.
Fine, fine.
You can go now.
- Shall I make a call?
- Get out!!
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Two men starving to death decide to eat their hair like spaghetti. Is that funny?
Hmm... well, it depends whether by "funny," you want to make people laugh.
Sarcasm doesn't suit your hat, Elinor.
I want to show you something absolutely fantastic.
Bring the cannon out here!
Ladies, don't be frightened.
Mr. Cannonball!
Bring it up here, boys.
How is it going?
Stop.
Get back, boys.
Get out of the way.
Put those down there.
- Ready, Mr. Cannonball?
- I'm ready.
All right. Get back, you'll get blown up.
Only us brave performers are gonna stay up here.
- Ready, Mr. Cannonball?
- I'm ready!
Amazing!
Amazing, amazing!
Every single time! By jingles!
I don't know how many times
I've seen you do that but it never ceases to amaze me.
I believe I saw you before on Catalina last summer.
Yep. Catalina, up and down the coast from Frisco clear on down to Ensenada.
Wherever you see a cannonball hit a man's stomach and you see that same man walk away on both legs, you're seeing me.
Didn't I tell you?
- Tom, that was good.
- Wonderful.
You've seen it
1 00 times...
How many more times do you suppose it'll take before the cannonball explodes through the poor man's back?
I don't know, but Hearst will be there with a match in his hand.
That is what he's waiting to see.
George.
You know, Margaret, there's a certain unspoken bond between single women who are trapped on a yacht together.
What Didi wants to know is, is it true you're Tom Ince's lover?
- I beg your pardon?
- I think he's very attractive.
Not to mention influential.
He's a little short, but then every man in this town is much smaller than you'd like him to be.
Excuse me.
Have you lost your mind?!
I've tried your approach.
It doesn't work.
I have to show him I can handle his private life too.
- Marion only affects him.
- By proving Marion's unfaithful?!
Which will make him hate you forever.
I know you're looking for some harpoon, but this one is dangerously double-edged.
- Tom, we need to talk.
- Not now, Margaret.
Look...
Hi, everyone!
Did I miss it?
Marion!
- He can do it again.
- Shut up.
Oh, you just missed it!
It's amazing how I manage to miss it every time.
Hello. I don't think we've been properly introduced.
I'm Jessica Barham,
Frank Barham's wife.
- Margaret Livingston.
- Charmed.
And what is it that you do?
I'm Tom Ince's lover.
You're listening to KFI's studio orchestra with our weekend musical number,
Right here on the voice of the southland.
Willie?
WR!
I've been looking all over for you.
How about that tour you've been promising?
- Oh, yeah.
- I've been meaning to tell you...
I have news...
If you were starving and had no food, would you eat your shoe?
- What?!
- Your shoe. Would you eat it?
- Of course I would.
- You would?
- I'd have to boil it.
- That's funny.
Well, this isn't.
Oohh!
Daily News gets the scoop.
Embarrassing for Willie, not even a Hearst newspaper.
If Willie asks you, I want you to tell him what I've told him,
- That it's all cheap gossip.
- You lie if you want to, if he asks me I'll look right in those impotent eyes and tell him I want to take his girl, rip off her dress...
Don't!!
Don't punish me for being with Willie!
You're scared 'cause you can't admit that you love me.
I can say it!
I love you, Marion!
- I love Willie!
- He could never love only you!
He has his papers and his politicians and his wife and kids.
I can give you all my love.
Did you promise Lita all your love and then take it away now that she's pregnant?!
That was a mistake!
My fascination with Lita is caused by some part of me that's trying to tear my life apart.
But I could never love her.
I could never marry her.
If I did it would destroy
- Everything I've worked for.
- It's all about you, Charlie!
No. I came from nothing!
You have no idea what poverty is.
I know what dirt tastes like and you don't!
Everything I've worked for,
I've earned myself!
Yeah, and Willie had nothing to do with it?
You wanna know about Willie?
Willie can always be trusted.
I give to him because he doesn't demand it.
He doesn't demand it?
He expects it!
- Go to hell!
- Here's my mansion and my yacht, here's my Marion Davies all stuffed and mounted.
But Marion could never leave the castle
'cause if she did she'd realize she'd never really lived.
Why are you doing this to me?
Because we're meant to be.
Just words...
No, passion!
I don't mean passion for... yachts or gin or dope or the goddamn Charleston!
I'm talking about...
I'm talking about...
Now that, boy, that is a thing of beauty, WR.
I tell you,
I may be married to Nell, but boating is my secret love.
What? Oh, yes.
Secret love.
And this boat... has always made me happy. Calm.
My God, it practically purrs!
When I come down here, this sound calms me.
You're a civilized man, WR.
Why does that surprise you?
Because, you have the power to act uncivilized.
You could overstep the rules, but you don't.
Before I'd call you a rich or a powerful man,
I'd simply call you decent.
Thank you, Tom.
I'm not just saying that.
It's amazing to me how civilized you've been behaving all weekend.
I mean... considering.
Considering what?
Well, it's clear...
Chaplin has designs on Marion.
I mean... the nerve of him flirting so blatantly.
After you.
Everyone knows what he's up to.
It must be so infuriating.
Yes, I have everything under control.
What do you mean "everyone"?
What?
You just said "everyone" knows.
Who's everyone?
Well... everyone on this boat for example.
If someone was coming after my Nell,
I don't know that
I'd be able to exercise such... impressive restraint.
You always have to keep control.
Otherwise you're just like everybody else.
Excuse me...
Could I get into the library?
Damn! I locked it!
Sorry about that, Dan.
I'll see you up top, Tom.
"Up Top, Tom," try to say that three times fast.
WR?
Thanks for the weekend.
Ohh.
Thanks for playing with me.
Don't mention it.
It really is rather dull, isn't it?
What is?
Ping-pong.
- I thought you wanted to play.
- I did. I want to get better.
Anybody who's anybody plays ping-pong.
It is rather dull. I only play
'cause I can beat Tom.
- Tom Ince?
- That's right.
Why should it matter if you can beat Tom Ince?
Because Tom Ince is my lover.
That is fascinating.
I mean, that is truly fascinating.
We only just met, and yet you instinctively feel like you can trust me.
You know something,
Margaret, that's happened to me all my life.
People feel that they can confide their deepest darkest secrets in me.
Like you just did.
I hate to burst your bubble,
I would have told whoever was on the other side of that ping-pong table.
Yes, but how fortunate that I just learned how to play ping-pong or else you might have told the wrong person.
There are wrong people, you know.
Yes, I know.
Don't worry, your secret is safe with me.
My serve?
Marion! Marion!
Bring it in!
Happy birthday, Tom!
Make a wish!
All right, here it goes.
Would you take it to be cut?
Thank you.
All right, hold it down back there.
Hold it down.
I want to propose a birthday toast to my good friend and cowboy creator,
- Thomas Harper Ince, one of the giants of the motion picture industry.
To just give you an idea of how big he is, he's just made a proposal that we merge our holdings in the motion picture industry.
We haven't come to an agreement yet, but I can say, that he's one of the most insightful and... observant men
I've ever known.
Perhaps now's the time...
I hereby call this meeting of the board of directors
Officially over!
All right, all right.
Music, music!
Here's to Tom!
Thank you, WR.
You're too generous.
Now the real thing on everyone's mind is whether or not
Willie will let us have another glass of champagne?
Is that what's on everybody's mind?
A second glass of champagne?
Well, it's on my mind,
I can tell you that.
I do not ask much.
But the little I do ask I... must be respected.
I don't say this... as a threat,
It's just a wish
I have as a man.
I...
I...
I'm a man asking for people to... behave according to my wishes... on my boat.
Why is that so difficult to understand?
Charleston! Charleston!
Charleston!
Dah-da-da-da-da...
Excuse me for one moment.
I'll be right back.
- Everything all right, Tom?
- Yeah. Damn ulcer. It'll pass.
Watch it, Charlie, we're doing the tramp now.
I'm proud of you.
Proud of what?
I'm observant, I'm insightful but I still don't have a deal yet.
- Tom, for God's sake...
- You don't understand.
I need a firm decision from him or this whole weekend is worthless.
- Let's dance, Georgie-Porgie.
- Certainly.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Marion Davies,
The New Tramp.
WR.
Hello, Tom.
I have to thank you again for making this birthday so memorable.
Don't mention it.
I also want to thank you for your kind words about my business proposition.
I really think we'd make a great team.
Yes, Tom.
Partnerships of any kind are based on two things, trust... and sharing.
If you had information to share with me I'd trust you to do so.
That's why I think it best that
I bring something to your attention.
While you've been busy being such a gracious host,
I've been keeping an eye on another situation.
Thank you, Tom.
I needed to know.
Now I'll...
I'll handle this matter.
You see what I want,
I want Mr. Hearst to listen to me but I don't want to be rude.
You'll get nowhere with WR by behaving politely.
Really?
Good manners are for waiters and doormen.
Writers and artists are exonerated from such impractical behavior.
Best to avert your eyes, dear.
But what about the baby, Charlie?
Willie'll turn the lead into the biggest scandal.
The press knows already.
There hasn't been a scandal yet.
It'll be a scandal if you don't marry her.
Or worse, if you run off with some gorgeous blonde.
They'll rip you to pieces.
You'll look so pretty while you're digging my grave.
Stop.
Come in.
I did it.
I got to Hearst.
You didn't get him just yet.
I've taken care of any worries the old man might have.
I'm glad someone's worries have been taken care of.
Oh, come on, honey.
I mean...
I'm feeling good right now.
Don't spoil it for me, okay?
I wouldn't want to spoil anything.
I'm having the best time, playing ping-pong with Lolly Parsons and hanging around for those moments you want to screw!
I'm sorry that in the middle of trying to save my professional life
I wasn't able to give your acting career a boost.
This isn't about my acting career, God damn you!
This is about us!
I... really don't have time for this.
I want out.
Not again.
- No, not again. This is it.
- I'm liable to take you seriously.
Really?
That would be the first time.
All right.
I can see that you're in no mood to discuss this rationally so,
I'll take a walk on deck, let you calm down.
But, if you still want out, please have the decency to be discreet.
Why, I'm the very flower of decency.
Here's your goddamn birthday present!
Shut the hell up!
We've got to say the hell with the press and Lita and Willie
- 'cause we believe in us.
- Charlie...
I know, I know.
Time, time...
My mother always said,
"Romantic love fades.
Marry for sympathy and friendship."
But you're not married.
Yet.
Uh-hmm.
Maybe Marion's awake.
I loved Willie... or I still love him.
- You gotta think about us now.
- Hey, have faith in me, okay?
I have faith.
What do you think about this?
"The Gold Rush," starring
Charlie Chaplin and Marion Davies.
- What?!
- I gotta replace Lita.
- So, I'm your second choice?
- You would've been my first if...
If I had slept with you sooner.
Yeah.
We were good tonight.
Well, I was good.
I was better.
Oh my God!
Marion?
- Tom. It's you.
- Who were you expecting?
No one.
I... had a chill for a moment.
Can I be frank with you?
If I'm going to be overseeing your pictures,
I need for us to come to terms about a few things.
Things that are... troubling WR.
Like?
Like you and...
Charlie.
And I'd be the first to admit that I had my share of indiscretions.
But I need to know the truth in order to balance your needs with... with those of WR.
He will find out, you know.
And when he does, I'd rather be someone who can help you.
How do I look?
Silly, right?
Charlie had certain feelings for me.
But I've convinced him that it's useless to pursue me.
He says he loves me.
But there was never any love.
At least not from my side there wasn't.
I don't love him.
I never have.
So... that's it.
That's really all there is.
Noo! Nooo!!
What? Be quiet!!
Oh my God, Willie, what the hell did you do?
Yes?
I'll be right there.
Hello?
What?!
Hurry! Please!
Oh, Christ's sake!
I didn't mean to do it.
It was an accident.
Ahhh!!
Oh, for God's sake!
Joe.
Shut her up.
Is he dead?
No.
It's okay, Lolly.
It's all right.
Ahh!
Shh... it's okay.
Come on, let's get you to your room.
We've got to get him to some real facilities.
Where's the closest port?
Chief?
Where's the closest port?
It must be San Diego.
Come on, Pops, let's stand up.
Here, let's go this way.
Willie...
- That was Tom.
- Willie.
That was Tom.
Look at me.
- Huh? What?
- You've got to be strong.
Why?
Why did you say... there was never any love?
That wasn't about you.
Who then?
Charlie.
I was talking about Charlie.
Is that true?
Yes! That's who
I was talking about.
You see, you are my... my whole... whole world!
Is he gonna die?
- Maybe.
- God help us.
- God is who we work for.
- Then God's in trouble.
Come on, who do you think got Coolidge elected President?
It's just Tom Ince lying here, right?
- Who knows Tom Ince?
- Just a guy, I guess.
Less than that. lf... if we move him, what are his chances?
It's hard to say, WR, there doesn't seem to be an exit wound.
The bullet's in his brain and he's still alive?
It's not uncommon.
Lincoln didn't die right away.
If they'd known more about bullets and brains he might've survived.
- We know any surgeons in San Diego?
- Nobody we can trust.
I'd rather get a private ambulance from Los Angeles and treat him up there.
Then get cars for the others two hours later. No sooner, Joe.
Lincoln was overrated.
Let's move Tom now so we can get him off the boat fast.
- Your cabin would be best.
- All right.
I think he's trying to say something.
WR, why don't you take Marion to her cabin and... you give her these.
It'll help her sleep.
You can handle that?
Of course I can.
I'm not a child!
Tom's gonna be all right.
Aren't you, Tom?
Is everything all right?
I thought I heard noises.
Everything's fine, George.
Go to sleep. l... I'm sorry...
I just...
Poor Tom...
I feel so...
He's gonna live.
I know it.
Dr. Goodman told me.
He said that...
Abraham Lincoln was... never mind that.
Here.
You have to take these.
- Grab him!
- I got him.
Yes?
Is someone there?
It's just Dr. Goodman...
...sorry to wake you.
That's all right.
All right.
Okay.
I'll get things started.
- WR?
- Hmm?
Joe, yes, yes.
Be careful, just lift him very gently.
That's it.
Be careful.
Watch his head.
What the hell?!
I thought we said the cars wouldn't be here for two hours.
I don't know what he's doing here so soon.
He's not one of mine.
I called Chaplin's driver.
- God damn it, Joe!
- He always insists on his own man.
I didn't want to arouse any more suspicion than necessary.
Oh no.
No suspicion at all!
Hello? Hello?
Nell? WR Hearst here.
Mr. Hearst, how are you?
- I'm fine, Nell.
- I'm glad to hear it.
Unfortunately, Tom's had an accident. A bad one.
Oh dear God! What happened?
- Nell,
- Yes?
I don't know to tell you this, except to start by saying that
Tom's been very depressed about his business lately.
I know.
Well, I hate to be the one to tell you,
- He's been unfaithful.
- What do you mean?!
Just let me get there, will you?
He uh... he's taken to her very strongly, and to the best of my knowledge... she tried to end it.
Please, tell me what's happened to Tom.
Now, Nell... well, God-save-'im, he shot himself.
Huh? Shot himself?
Nell, he's alive, and he's getting the best of care.
Our Dr. Goodman is escorting him to your home by private ambulance.
Nell?
I'm here.
Give me the name of his private physician. Can you do that?
Yes. It's Dr. Glasgow...
Ira Glasgow in...
That's fine.
By God, Nell, I'll make sure none of this gets in the papers.
Oh my God, you have to!
- I just said I would, Nell.
Now... you've got to remain strong and silent, and wait for Dr. Glasgow.
We'll have him there any time now.
I'll wait for the doctor... bless you, Mr. Hearst.
No one will ever find out.
I value Tom's friendship too much for that.
- Sorry, what did you say?
- His friendship, Nell!!
- Of course...
- We... we're telling everyone that it's his stomach.
- His ulcers.
- Ulcers, yes.
I know this is hard, but I've got to hang up now and call Dr. Glasgow.
- You just sit and wait.
- Just sit and wait...
- Goodbye, Nell.
- Tom. Poor Tom...
Goodbye.
Yes?
Good morning, Chief.
You seem well rested.
Yes, well... whatever Dr. Goodman gave me put me right to sleep, thank goodness.
I'm so glad.
It was a tragic accident,
Mr. Hearst.
Yes, Lolly?
Still... these things do happen, as they say.
It's nobody's fault, really, when you consider all sides.
You're very good at that, considering all sides.
You meet so few people capable of considering all sides.
It's a goddamn gift.
Mr. Hearst,
I must confess, and...
I know I've been a bit obvious but l... you have a second to talk?
I have two and one half minutes.
Good.
Well, I was gonna break one of your golden rules this weekend by mixing business with pleasure.
I was going to ask you about expanding my syndication with a more prominent by-line.
Why didn't you say something?
I'm sure we can arrange...
I was going to say something but then I started thinking, and the only way I can have a real effect on the readers and the community that
I'm covering, is if I have time.
Lots of time,
WR.
I agree with you, 1 00%.
I'll have the office draw up... an eight-year contract.
Eight years?
WR, now really.
Eight years won't do either of us any good.
We're at the point in our careers where we need security.
Security?
Security from whom?
The wrong people.
There are wrong people, you know.
I know.
I'm willing to devote my life to Hearst newspapers.
But I need to know here and now that you're willing to grant me the life I want.
You give me my security... and I'll give you yours, WR.
For a lifetime.
Lifetime contract...
Is that a question or an answer, WR?
I swear I heard a shot.
Some people will say anything to get attention.
I did!
I heard noises all night.
But not a gunshot.
The only shot Didi was close to had whiskey in it.
Be quiet,
I know what I heard.
I heard noises too.
Have you seen Tom?
No.
Why have we stopped?
Where are we?
We're in San Diego, sir.
But I don't know the plan.
We weren't scheduled to stop here.
I'm aware of that.
Perhaps he's taken up shooting fish.
It's just me.
- I love you.
- Is he all right?
He's gonna be fine.
Everything is.
Now you go back to sleep.
Kono.
What brings you to San Diego?
They told me change in plans.
- Who told you?
- Mr. Hearst's office.
- Has anybody left yet?
- Just the doctor and the injured man.
- Injured?
- There were bandages on his head.
- There was blood.
- What man?
I don't know. For a minute
I thought he was you.
- Was he conscious?
- Not to my eyes.
Goddamn Jap!
...Or WR shot an albatross for our breakfast!
You know it's bad luck to shoot an albatross.
- Good morning, Charlie.
- Good morning.
Good morning.
- Unfortunately, I have bad news.
Tom Ince took ill last night and decided to leave early.
- What was wrong with him?
- He said his ulcers were acting up.
- Why didn't anyone call me?
- Hell, we wanted to, but Tom said not to bother you.
He's fine.
Dr. Goodman is taking him home.
Where's Marion and Lolly?
Ah... they looked after Tom during his difficulties.
You know,
Lolly has an ulcer herself.
They were up half the night.
They're both still resting.
Which... given the delay, means that we have to cut our journey short here in San Diego.
- You're kidding.
Oh, no.
Don't worry,
I've already got cars for everyone.
We must go up and visit the birthday boy.
That's a splendid idea.
However, there is one thing
I want to ask you, and I can't say this with enough seriousness.
To our eyes,
Tom Ince left this boat with a bout of angry ulcers.
But I can't begin to imagine what the press is going to make up.
Wild birthday party, illegal alcohol, orgies...
Reputations are... so fragile.
Just terrible.
They'll link
Tom's innocent ulcers to every secret everyone of us ever kept.
And drag us all down.
So,
I'm asking you to join me in uh... in an oath of silence.
Just a little one.
You were asleep, you left early, any excuse you like.
But you do not know what happened to Tom Ince aboard this boat.
I would love to take an oath... any oath.
Me too!
Let's make it in blood.
Rather dramatic, WR, but I'll take an oath to that.
Of course, why not?
Good. Thank you all.
Marion?
Oh, Charlie...
Are you all right?
What the hell is going on here?
I'm sure I speak for Tom when I say thank you all for coming and making his birthday such a memorable event.
Why don't we all pack and meet on deck in an hour?
WR!
Did all this happen before or after I saw you?
Saw me? When?
Last night, in the corridor.
You didn't see me, Tom.
It's George, and...
All you have to do is get in that limousine and go home.
But he doesn't even look like me!
He... he... put on your hat, it was dark...
Willie...
Jesus!
Excuse me, Mr. Hearst.
Are you sure Tom's all right?
He's just fine.
Everybody is talking about noises... sounds, gunshots...
I haven't had the chance to tell you you're quite a fine actress.
Thank you, but if Tom wasn't feeling well...
Please, don't worry, he's getting the best of care.
We need to meet at the studio.
God, you're good!
I saw that picture that you did and you played the... uh... the lovely young woman, what was it called?
Oh, I can't remember the title, but you were splendid.
What about next week?
Friday? How's that?
Oh...
Friday. Uhm...
I... I want you to know that Tom spoke very lovingly about you and he wanted you to know that he's very sorry about what happened.
Why wasn't I awakened?
Didn't he want me to accompany him?
Accompany him?
Child, you're his mistress.
You can't accompany him home to greet his wife and children.
I'll see you Friday.
What are you waiting for?
Let's get off this bloody boat!
- You have things to do.
- I just bet he does.
Okay, WR, here I am.
Easier to hit than a seagull.
You left this in his room.
There's something for your scrapbook, Charlie.
I sure as hell didn't get
Tom Ince's blood on it!
You two are the reason for that blood!
Haven't you any sense of responsibility?
Did I pull the trigger or shoot him in the head?!
That version of events can be arranged, Charlie.
I can produce three witnesses on this boat alone.
You see?
It's better for everyone if Tom Ince had an ulcerous attack.
And you, Marion?
Better for you?
Only Marion knows what's best for her.
As long as it agrees with her master's voice.
No.
All I want is to see Marion happy.
That's what I devoted my life to for the past seven years.
And all the years
I've got left.
Can you promise that, Charlie?
If he can, Marion, and if you can believe him... then go.
Go.
Good luck to both of you.
Come on.
For how long?
For now, forever, for as long as you want!
For as long as you want.
You're not telling me that this... attempted murder has rekindled your love for Willie?
Just leave, Charlie.
Leave with me.
I love you.
Old goat's really got you, hasn't he?
No...
I've got me.
I am not here.
Ma'am?
Like others with tiny bullets hiding in their skulls,
Thomas Ince held on unconscious for two days before dying in his own bed.
There was plenty of misinformation in the days following his death, much of it coming straight from the Hearst press machine, which inexplicably reported that Ince was "stricken unconscious" while visiting Hearst at his upstate ranch!
Three weeks later, the San Diego District Attorney conducted an obligatory investigation and was,
"satisfied that the death of Thomas H. Ince was caused by heart failure as a result of acute indigestion."
He did not examine the body because
Ince had been cremated immediately, and except for Dr. Goodman, no member of the boating party was ever questioned, including Hearst.
The San Diego DA suggested that the Los Angeles office continue the investigation.
They politely declined.
Marion.
Hello.
Charlie, what are you doing, you dope?
Don't you have a ride?
I just...
I wanted to see you.
Here I am.
He's... dead, Charlie.
I know.
I know.
I move to Mexico in a couple of days.
Mexico?
Another try at the old marriage game.
How bad can it be?
Come on, Charlie.
Get in.
And go where?
I've got arrangements to make, avoiding the press and that kind of fun stuff.
Come on, I'm not as pathetic as all that, am I?
Goodbye, Charlie.
I'll send you a postcard.
"Love and Kisses from me and the missus."
To this day, no two accounts of that weekend cruise are the same, including who, in fact, was on the boat.
There are no logs, you see, no records or photographs of any kind.
And not a single person involved wrote or spoke about that weekend... that is... until significantly after the old man's death, and even then only in riddles.
Soon after Tom's death,
Margaret Livingston's salary inexplicably jumped from $300 to $1,000 dollars a week.
Eventually, she retired to manage her husband, Paul Whiteman, the bandleader who popularized the Charleston.
Lolly got her lifetime contract, and for the next 30 years, became the most powerful and feared gossip columnist in America.
Three days after Tom's funeral,
Charlie married Lita Grey in Mexico.
It lasted two years.
He did, however, recast her role in "The Gold Rush," and re-shoot all her scenes.
Despite costing a small fortune, the picture was a smashing success.
It took three more years for WR to let Marion do a full-fledged comedy.
As Charlie predicted, she triumphed.
She retired in 193 7, but stayed by Hearst's side until his death at the age of 88.
I've had a recurring dream recently...
I'm back on the Oneida, having a glorious time.
But I'm watching how ridiculous everyone else looks and I wonder why they don't realize it.
Then I see that, in fact,
I too look like a fool.
Yet, it's so much fun... that none of us can stop.
If we stopped... we'd have nothing.
Come on, everybody!
* Dead, I'm the one exterminating son *
* Slipping through the trees strangling the breeze *
* Dead, I'm the sky watching angels cry *
* As they slowly turn conquering the worm *
* Dead I'm the pool spreading from the fool *
* Weakened want you need
Nowhere as you bleed *
* Dead I'm the rat
Feast upon the cat *
* Tender is the fur
Dying as you purr **
It's never quite that easy.
You go through the door, and they're never just sitting there waiting for you... with a welcoming smile on their face.
Best you can do is hope they fuck up... and do what you can to be there when they do.
And then blame yourself for the killings?
Oh, no. I blame the asshole who did them.
This man's whole life is about killing.
He studies it.
He knows forensics.
He understands police procedure.
He prepares methodically so as to not to leave any evidence at the scene.
After he picks his target, he'll watch her for weeks.
He'll study every detail of her routine-
When she comes home.
When she goes to sleep.
In the morning before the sun comes up, he can walk right up next to her.
Even though the sun's still down, no one perceives it as night.
Women who are careful at midnight, walk around half-naked seven hours later.
Finally, he'll pick a day.
Takes a kit of tools and props- duct tape, handcuffs, a weapon- whatever he needs.
He'll let himself in.
That night, she'll get home.
Go about her business, unaware that he's in the house.
Oh... this is good.
Shall we dance?
No, don't play hard to get.
This will be fun.
Shh.
Shh. It's over.
It's all right.
Shh.
I said, "Shut... up. "
When she passes out... from fear or pain, he'll revive her over and over again to-
Um-
What were you going to say?
Time's up.
Joel.
Why did you turn away from me?
Why was it so hard for you to accept?
'Cause you know
I did it for you.
You came so close to me that night.
I remember clearly what I felt when I heard your footsteps following behind me.
Pride.
I thought it would keep us together forever.
For me, it was our finest moment.
I can still see the flames.
Oh!
Shit.
What the fuck?
Oh, fuck!
I didn't see anything.
- Wanda, you wanna run that in to Sarge?
- Right on it.
Hey, I'm Detective Mackie.
Welcome to my crime scene.
Can I help you find anything?
I'm just going home.
I live upstairs.
Did you not happen to notice that yellow police tape marked "Do Not Cross"?
If you're done with that,
I'll just take it and go home.
Do you know this woman?
No, I've never seen her.
What happened? Is she dead?
Oh, I haven't made any reference to homicide.
Why would you hasten to such a conclusion?
Well, you got half the block taped off, and you got what, about a dozen cops in there, fuckin' up your crime scene?
It just doesn't seem like someone boosting stereos to me.
Look here. Give me a call if you think of anything.
All right?
- Hello. Yeah, this is Hollis.
- Hello.
This is Campbell.
I'm the guy- We met last night.
Yeah, Joel Campbell. Our ex-F.B.I. friend from apartment 805.
We did a little checking on you after you after you left. What can I do for you?
I can hardly- Are you busy? It sounds like you're in the middle of something.
Yeah, some genius jacked a Honda a couple blocks ago. That's an '86.
- What, do you want me to call you back?
- No.
When did she die, the girl?
Monday night.
Three days ago. Why?
- 'Cause I know who did it.
- And how might you know that?
He mailed me a picture of her still alive.
I got it three days ago-
Monday morning.
Hold on a minute, Campbell.
Tan honda's on the run.
Okay. Sorry to keep you.
Now... you wanna meet me back at my office? All right.
Is it your custom to open your mail four days after you get it?
Nope. Sometimes it takes up to two weeks.
Well, this would appear... to answer any questions we had whether these two cases were related.
Goodness gracious.
Nothin' like a good serial killing to kick off the holiday season.
Right in here.
- Gimme a minute in that room.
- Okay, Lieutenant.
We got him sending his pictures in the mail.
Campbell, hell, we oughta get Bob
Barker in on this son of a bitch.
It's a damn game show.
His last alias was
David Allen Griffin.
I worked the case for three and a half years in Los Angeles.
We attributed at least
11 homicides to him.
What's he doing in Chicago?
I assume he's still strangling young women with piano wire.
All the victims were left partially unclothed, and all the swabs came back negative.
Exactly.
No touchy, no feely.
Have you ever seen this guy?
No. No one's ever seen him.
Well, then we can't necessarily conclude it's the same fella, can we?
Come on. He sent me fuckin' pictures.
Shoved the vic right up my ass in my own fucking building.
- Sorry.
- It's quite all right.
You looked adorable.
This film stock says it's for exterior sunshine, but... how does it handle in fluorescence?
Uh, I'm sorry. I have no idea what you're talking about.
I just work here.
- You do film processing here.
- Uh, yeah, one hour.
- Do you mind?
- Sure.
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to test it out.
I'm gonna shoot some pictures, and you're going to process them for me.
Perfect.
Yeah, chief of Chicago P.D. already called.
Not surprising, I suppose, they're inviting us in on this.
They're setting up a joint task force as we speak.
I'd like to know if you think you can handle it on our end.
I know that in L.A.-
Oh, no, this isn't L.A.
It's not my job anymore.
You know what? The only reason that your burnt-out, messed-up ass... is standing in my office is because you had a three-year head start on us.
This perp is dead set on putting you in the middle of this shit, whether we like it or not.
You're right. The field office in L.A. has the relevant files.
I can't tell you anything that's not in them.
I'm sorry.
Mike. Excuse me.
Mike, we got several sets of prints off the FedEx envelope and the photo itself.
I'm sorry. This is none of my business, but, uh, you can run the prints.
You're gonna get me, the driver, three guys from the warehouse,
Santa Claus... a whole bunch of elves.
Definitely not this guy.
Who the hell is that?
Run it.
Yes, sir.
* Ooh-ooh *
* Can't anybody see *
Well, you're young.
Do you plan to live on disability your whole life?
I take 200 milligrams of Seconal just so I can sleep two and a half hours a night.
Twice a day, I take
400 milligrams of acebutolol... and 20 milligrams of lotensen for high blood pressure.
I self-inject migraine medicine whenever the fuck I please.
They don't... mix well with work.
Hmm.
Maybe you're just afraid.
Fuckin' right.
I am afraid.
Okay.
Let's talk about that.
I go places, and I forget why I'm there.
I miss exits on the freeway.
I'm lucky to... find my way home from the grocery store.
And if I do, then... most of the time
I've forgotten my groceries.
But yet, you make it here every week.
Twice a week.
Yeah.
You do.
What if the next picture that arrived was of your daughter?
Would you really want me to be the one looking for her?
Yes.
Yes... I would.
* From this moment *
* How can it feel *
* This wrong **
- Hello.
- Hi. It's me.
Me?
Me who?
It's freaking cold here.
Why'd you move here?
What the fuck do you want from me?
You hardly leave your apartment.
And when you do, it's to eat... at that same terrible Vietnamese restaurant night after night.
You seem so bored.
I was expecting a warmer welcome.
I didn't fuckin' ask you here, did I?
The guy they replaced you with-
I tried to make it work, but we just didn't see eye to eye at all.
I was going to quit the game entirely, but then I thought, "Chicago's not so bad. "
At least you didn't move to New Jersey, right?
Yeah.
So, why don't you grab a pen?
I'll give you the name and number of the... agent that's on your case.
You can... share your inner turmoil with him 'cause I don't give a shit.
I know your job is hard, Joel, so I'm willing to take steps to try and make things work between us.
- What are you talking about?
- The photos, Joel.
I'll send you a picture, and you can have a day to try to find her.
I'll give you till 9:00.
What do you say, Joel?
I say I should have moved to New jersey, asshole.
Good night, Joel.
- Are you all right?
- I think so.
Shit!
- Who is it?
- Flowers for Joel Campbell.
You didn't answer the phone.
The door downstairs was open, so I thought I'd just bring-
Put the flowers on the floor.
Thank you.
The photos, Joel.
I'll send you a picture, and you can have a day to try to find her.
No, I've never seen her.
Is she dead?
I haven't made any reference to homicide.
Why would you hasten to such a conclusion?
- Are you just afraid?
- Fuckin' right. I'm afraid.
What if the next picture that arrived was of your daughter?
Really want me to be the one looking for her?
- Yes.
- I'll send you a picture.
You can have a day to try to find her.
I got this a half hour ago.
I want the case.
Can you handle it?
I guess we'll find out.
What else did this asshole say last night?
That's everything.
We already have a trap and trace on that line and on your cell phone.
What is that?
Is that, a bird?
This is a poster.
Looks like it was shot inside.
Could be taken anywhere.
It was processed commercially.
See if these numbers are traceable.
If not, get me a list... of every place in the city that prints on this Kodak paper.
You got it.
Is that mine?
Thanks.
- I'm sorry. I can't remember your name.
- Mitch Casper.
Mitch, get this in the computer and blow it up.
Find out what's behind her on the wall. That thing right there.
Find out what kind of earrings she's wearing, what kind of blouse that is.
- What's that on her glasses?
- Reflection, yeah.
Find out something about her. Anything.
Both girls are basically loners, very little social contact.
The last girl's parents were deceased.
No close friends as far as we can tell.
Is that his victim profile?
No. I mean, the victims were always young women, but he's sending pictures now.
He's only gonna target loners.
You know, women people don't notice.
He's not gonna send me a picture of the prom queen.
Yeah. Well, listen.
Before we go any further, we're gonna have to make a decision as to whether to go to the press with this.
We gotta make it now.
Look. There's no decision to make. There is shit else we can do for this woman.
Let's get him in front of the cameras.
They're gonna like him.
All I can tell you at this time is that... we have substantial reason to believe this woman's life is in serious danger.
The Chicago Police Department and the F.B.I. are working in concert... to try and locate her, and we're gonna be grateful for any help... you guys can give us in this endeavor.
Every hour is critical.
That's all.
This young woman is missing.
Authorities are frantically searching for her. They fear for her safety.
Any information on the whereabouts or the identity of the woman... police are referring to as "Jane Doe, " please call the number on your screen.
This is the photograph of an unknown young woman... who they say might fall victim to a murder if she is not located by 9:00.
"What kind of earrings are those?
What kind of blouse is that?"
- What are you bitching about?
- Oh, come on, Diana.
This was my case. Ibby opens the door and in flies "Captain Barbiturate. "
You know, I don't care how well he knows this creep.
I say if his pupils don't dilate, then we don't need him.
Ma'am, there- There hasn't been a reward established, but I'm sure something can be done.
Okay. Today?
Was that today?
Okay, thank you.
We'll check it out.
Anything yet?
Eighty-five, ninety calls in the last fifteen minutes.
I mean, lots of "maybes" and "possibles. "
We're trying to sift through the shit, but there's a lot of it.
Despite a massive search this afternoon, police still have not located the anonymous woman... whose photo was received this morning.
They continue to rely on your help in this frightening case.
Mitch.
- What is that? A sign?
- Uh-huh.
- See?
- Yeah, all right.
I'll enhance the drum scan. We'll bring it even closer, and we'll see what we got.
- All right?
- Fuck.
- Yeah.
- The numbers are only relevant... if you find the location where it was processed.
- What about the paper?
- The list is on its way.
- Eleven hundred locations.
- Eleven hun- What?
Do you know where there's a Lou
Mitchell's restaurant on Oak Street?
- Yeah, it's in the Gold Coast area.
- We'll take it. Let's run.
Yep, I'm pretty sure that was her.
She was wearing a headband.
Was she alone or eating with someone?
- Uh, she was alone.
- When was the last time you saw her?
I don't know.
Sometime last week.
Can you be more specific?
What day?
No. Not without making shit up.
We don't want you to do that.
I want every employee that worked here in the last week... in the restaurant within the hour- managers, cooks,
- dishwashers, cashiers.
- That's gonna be hard.
Life is hard. Pull every credit card sale for the week.
Eliminate men, married women, anyone over 40. We need to call every one of them.
Got it.
I gotta be on the phone.
See if we can get some help.
- Okay.
- Can you spare anyone?
I'll get you all the help you want.
Good. We'll fax them a list of names.
They need to start making calls.
I'm on it.
Okay. Thank you very much.
Authorities are hoping that as millions return home from work... and turn on the television, that someone will recognize this young woman.
They are taking this threat on her life very seriously.
What the fuck do you want me to say?
It's five to 6:00, for Christ's sake.
If they're not home, call back in 45 minutes.
They're getting home from work.
Excuse me.
Check this out.
You were right.
It's definitely...
"A-P" and the line is an exclamation point.
Does that mean anything to you?
Add a "C-R" to it, it spells "Crap. "
No. What do you want me to say?
Yeah, that's true.
It spells "Crap. "
One of your waitresses saw her here sometime last week.
Look at the picture carefully and tell me if you remember her.
Sorry, man. I make it a point to pay as little attention... to the customers as possible.
- Does it seem like playtime to you?
- No.
Take a look at the fucking picture and tell me if you saw her.
- I never saw her.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
- That's too bad.
Thank you for coming in.
Come on, darling.
Click on your television set.
It's Thursday night, goddamn it.
"Must-see TV."
Earlier today, we told you investigators were combing the streets of Chicago... searching for this woman- a woman they are...
- referring to as "Jane Doe. "
- Put up the fuckin' number.
Let's go. Come on.
They are still in need of your help.
- Come on! Don't take-
- The city council approves a new budget.
If that's all the help they're gonna give us for this woman's life-
What was the time of death on the other two?
- What?
It's done.
We're not gonna make it.
We're not gonna make it.
Okay. Good night, Ellie.
See you tomorrow.
That was it.
Third possible sighting in Fox Pavilion Mall.
Grab some backup.
You wanna come with?
You know me, your hat's on backwards.
- Talk to you later.
- Bye.
Guys, look.
She's been sighted here on three separate occasions, okay?
Everybody we see walking around here is a possible witness.
So, I want you to fan out. I don't know if she works here, if she lives nearby.
Take these fliers. Get them to everybody in the place.
- I wanna show 'em, okay?
- You guys come with me.
- Who spoke to the most recent caller?
- I did.
- You? Let's go.
- Take level three.
Can you take a look at these pictures, please?
Speak to the gentleman back here.
Take a look at that, please. Thank you.
Take a look at that?
Thank you.
- If you see her, please give us a call.
- No, I've never seen her.
Frank? Hey, Frankie!
How was your day, hmm?
Oh, yeah? That's nice.
Mine? Not so good.
Excuse me.
- Are you the person who saw her?
- Yeah.
- Is this her? Where?
- Yeah, that's her.
I saw her down there in the food court.
- There? Right there?
- Yeah.
- When?
- At 2:30 this afternoon.
Excuse me.
Hollis. Hollis!
What do you got?
The photo store.
- Where? Where?
- The photo store.
Here. Right here.
This is where he shot it.
See? There's our little bird. Hello?
- Hey! Hey!
- Sorry.
Do you know this woman?
Uh, yeah. She just started working here. It's Ellie.
I'll need her phone number and last name. Right now.
- Get her number now.
- Okay. I have to call my boss.
- Do it. Do it!
- Okay.
Goddamn cows.
Hello.
Mom? Calm down.
What is it?
No, I'm sure that you're overreacting.
Gimme a break.
Why are you saying that?
Look, Mom. I very much doubt that your pharmacist is just trying to poison you.
Can we not do this right now, Mom?
I'm in the middle of a movie.
Yeah, Mom, with a man.
Yeah, he's cute.
I- I don't know if it's serious or not.
Look. If I tell you his name, will you let me get off the phone?
His name is Frank.
Good-bye.
Come on. Come on.
Yes?
Uh, I need to speak to Ellie Buckner immediately.
Oh, she can't come to the phone right now.
No, no, please, please. Put her on the line immediately. It's a life-or-death emergency.
Not anymore it's not.
Wasn't that fun? It hasn't felt that good for years.
Wasn't it suspenseful?
Oh, yeah, that was a blast.
This way is much more fun.
It's amazing, isn't it?
We're all stacked right on top of each other, but we don't really notice each other anymore, do we?
You notice me though, don't you, Joel?
Yeah, I notice you.
Ellie Buckner.
Single, 24, parents live in Florida.
So far, no known boyfriend.
She has a cat named Frank.
Apparently, he doesn't watch the news.
Wonder what happened to that cat?
Pull the phone records, okay?
Diaries, journals, letters, address book.
See if he's in contact with these girls.
Hey, ma'am.
Can you spare some change?
Hey, guys. Hey, Dad!
Dad, don't you recognize me?
Hey, sir. Can you spare some change?
What are you doing out here?
Spare changing, man.
What's it look like?
- Don't you have a job or anything?
- Yeah, whatever.
Look. Are you gonna give me some money, or what?
- Only if you dance with me.
- Shut the fuck up.
- I'm serious.
- There's no music.
I'll lead, you follow.
And one, two, three.
One, two, three. One, two, three.
Damn it.
Having a tough time there, aren't you, with that?
I need a damn garden rake to eat this.
It's all in the tool.
I'm done with that for sure.
So, listen here.
What's the skinny on that radiant vision of loveliness down at the feds?
What's her name?
Diana?
What I wouldn't give for 20 minutes with her at a drive-in and a decent bowl of chili.
Damn if you haven't found the worst restaurant in the whole city of Chicago.
A really fine restaurant.
The other night, Griffin was giving me... a hard time about it too on the telephone.
What's up? What's up?
What do you think the chances are he's watching us right now?
Hey. Hey!
Get outta here.
Murder suspect heading west on Commerce, near the intersection of Lincoln.
Blue, two-door sedan, mid- '80s, maybe a Ford.
Fuck! Goddamn it!
I'm standing outside the apartment of Ellie Buckner, the woman who Chicago has come to know as "Jane Doe. "
The harrowing search came to a tragic end about 9:20 P.M., when police discovered Buckner's body at her Wicker Park apartment.
It is a murder that has shocked this quiet neighborhood.
Right-
See you later. Bye.
Excuse me.
I can't stay long.
I just wanted to come by... and tell you how much
I appreciate... what you... said the other day.
How have the headaches been?
About the same.
Are you sleeping?
Some.
How's work?
It's great. I'm building an excellent fan base with the homicidal set.
How do you feel about that, about this man following you to Chicago?
Is it a vendetta?
That's a strange question.
No, I don't think vengeance has anything to do with it.
I think there's a story, a ritual that he follows.
Over the years, I became part of the story.
It probably didn't make sense without me.
In other words, he missed you.
Odd, isn't it?
Did you miss him?
What the hell does that mean?
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Campbell.
- We received another photo.
- I'll be right there.
Where is she sitting?
Let's get somebody from the city up here.
See if they can tell us something about this section of sidewalk.
Is this the "El" here, you know? Parking meters.
Yep, I'm on it.
Mitch, let's get her picture in tattoo parlors.
Got it.
What's your name?
Well, usually,
Mr. Abraham,
I do an introductory session, where we both explore what you hope to get out of therapy.
If we both feel I'm the person to provide that for you, then we can decide on a schedule together.
And- And I like to record my sessions.
But if you prefer-
Is that something that you do with all of your patients?
Yeah, with most of them.
- Would you prefer that I didn't?
- Yes, I'd rather you not.
Okay. That's- That's fine.
So, you say that you might need help. In-In what area?
I'm not sure.
What kind of help do you provide?
Well, I-I work with patients on many different issues.
Do you think... some of your patients... might pay to come and see you because... you're very pretty?
Let's keep this focused on you, rather than on me, Mr. Abraham.
Sure.
Nice trick.
- I'm gonna try it again though, okay?
- Yeah, whatever.
A couple of years ago, they did a neighborhood renovation... where they put those benches around some of the trees downtown.
Where downtown?
Bring up the city.
Basically the Broadway and Belmont area.
- That's 15 to 20 city blocks.
- Yeah.
There are five million people in this city.
- How can no one have known this person?
- Can you spare some change?
How can this happen in the communication age?
Authorities have focused the search for "Jane Doe #2 "-
Hey, Dad. Dad, it's me.
Don't you recognize me?
- Leave me alone.
- Come on, Pop. I need you, man.
The city of Chicago is on alert.
Police are searching for a woman connected to the photograph they have received.
It appears the murder may be linked to a serial killer in the Los Angeles area.
At this point, the woman police are calling "Jane2"... has not yet been located...
- and all those involved are very concerned about her well-being.
Yeah.
We've got Jane Doe's mother on the phone.
I'll be right there.
You know what? Get a picture at every skateboarding place and guitar shop... that's anywhere near that
Broadway and-
- Belmont.
- Belmont. Exactly.
- Wish I could find some letters.
- There aren't any.
She never wrote anybody.
She called three times after she disappeared.
Did she say where she was calling from?
She said all kinds of things. I never knew what to believe. She has a new boyfriend.
- So tell me about the boyfriend.
- He's a lawyer. Yeah, right.
Can you remember anything else about the calls? Anything might help.
A few months ago, she called to announce she's got a job at Seattle's Best Coffee.
Seattle's Best?
Not good news. She does not work, nor has she ever worked at Seattle's Best.
I don't care whether she works there or not, she is sitting in front of a coffee shop.
I don't know.
It looks like a bench to me. It could be anywhere. I'll be honest with you.
Look at the photo. There are seven people in the picture.
Three of them are holding the same kind of coffee cup.
She's sitting in front of a fucking coffee shop.
Get someone into every
Seattle's Best in the city... and any place that sells coffee in the Broadway Belmont area.
- Take a look at this.
- Okay.
Is that too fast?
- Okay, okay.
- Whoa!
- You wanna kill me, sweetie?
- Come on, get on.
I thought you were gonna impress me.
Yeah, yeah. You're so tough.
Hey, you mind posting these?
Thanks.
Ma'am, we're looking for this girl.
We're trying to contact her.
Totally, dude.
She comes in here all the time.
We found a kid that knows her. Seattle's
Best, Lincoln and Wisconsin. All right.
Thanks. I gotta go, Jess.
I'm sorry. I'm so late.
- Can I sneak into your room?
- No.
The last time we got caught, my dad went ballistic.
- Don't be sad, Jessie.
- Forget about it.
Yeah, I let her use the bathroom, you know. I told the other dudes.
I don't give a shit what you told the other guy. I wanna know where she lives.
- I wanna know where she is.
- Dude, she lives on the street.
* As our light goes out *
* There's nothing left to say *
* There's nothing left to say or talk about *
* You can't say anything I don't know *
* I already understand *
We gotta find this woman. Call the police if you find this woman. Help us out here.
Somebody, help. Look at this.
Call the police if you find this woman.
Help us out here.
Leave me alone.
- Hey.
- Get back here.
Look at the fucking picture, all right?
Look at the picture.
- You seen this girl, huh?
- No.
Excuse me.
Have you seen that girl?
Look at the picture before you answer.
- You seen this girl? Thank you.
- No. Sorry.
See that.
That's what I want, okay?
Excuse me.
You see this girl? Huh?
- No, I haven't.
- All right, thanks.
You seen her?
Have you seen that girl?
Sir, have you seen this girl?
Have you seen that girl?
- Hey, hey. Stop, stop.
- But I didn't do anything!
I never said you did. Just look at the picture. Have you seen this girl?
- She's about your age.
- Fuck you, cop. I don't know shit.
* You can't say *
* Anything I don't know *
Hi.
- Hey.
- That sounds great.
Yeah? You like it?
Absolutely.
Then here, let me turn it up.
If you don't tell me where she is, your friend Jessica will be dead within the hour.
All right.
She stays on the top floor, man.
Please, God.
Please, please.
Please, God.
Help me please.
Just up the way there.
- Get him out of here.
- Come on, come on.
Campbell.
Campbell, you okay?
Campbell, open the door.
Open it.
Campbell? You here?
Joel?
He's freezing.
Mitch, call a paramedic.
Shit.
This morning investigators are stilling search... for the serial killer responsible for last night's rampage.
Three policemen were killed and one young woman was murdered.
The F.B.I. agent in charge of the task force has been hospitalized.
Hi.
Hey, hey. Come in.
You didn't have to come here.
Yeah, well.
I didn't think you could get to me.
So-
Besides, I don't have that many patients yet, so I really can't afford to lose one.
Yeah.
I've never seen you outside the office.
You look so different.
Really? Hmm.
'Cause you look exactly the same.
Yeah.
Have you eaten?
Do you need to eat?
All I got is Jell-O.
Okay.
You wanna eat?
Yeah, let's eat.
Okay.
- In other words, he missed you.
- Odd, isn't it?
- Did you miss him?
- What the hell does that mean?
- In other words, he missed you.
- Odd, isn't it?
- Did you miss him?
- What the hell does that mean?
Look, I'm sorry. I can't talk now.
I'll call you back, all right?
Excuse me, Agent Casper? This just came for Agent Campbell and I just-
How did you get this?
The post office forwarded it from his apartment.
Thank you. Shit.
Good morning. Thank you for your attention.
My comments today will be brief.
Uh, as many of you know already, we have received another photograph.
No, no, no.
I am not going to answer any questions today.
I just am here to pass out this photograph... and to request that you continue to assist us in this investigation.
- That's all.
- Police Detective Hollis Mackie... informing us that this horrible game of cat and mouse will continue today.
Here is the photo of the killer's latest target.
- You all right? You sure?
- Yeah.
- I think so.
- I'll be right back.
Help me. Help me.
Help me!
Hi, Joel.
How's the heart, pal?
Here.
You want a beer?
It would make it feel better.
Stop.
Here.
Tell me something.
Did you move 2,000 miles to live near this woman's grave?
You did, didn't you?
Man, you've gotta get out more.
I mean, is this a satisfying relationship?
You know, she loves me.
She's decomposing.
She loves me.
She's decomposing.
What are we doing here? What is this?
You here to give yourself up?
Why didn't you tell anyone you were fucking her?
Just 'cause she was married?
We don't seem to be communicating.
Let me be clear with you.
I have no problem with shooting you dead where you sit.
Well, you do have one problem.
If I'm dead, your friend Polly is going to meet a rather gruesome fate... involving candlelight and quite a large pool of kerosene.
And you know something about attractive women burning, don't you?
Tell me, what was it like?
Could you smell her flesh burning?
You've already killed her.
Come on. You know me better than that.
That's not even her blood.
Take me to see her then.
Oh, I don't know about that.
Can't we just sit here for a little while and talk, Joel?
We'll talk once I see her.
I just need to know if there's anything to talk about.
Go on, take it.
I just need to see that she's all right, then we'll talk.
Well, fine.
Let's go.
It's good to see you, Joel.
It really is.
Wow, it's loaded.
We're going to make it through this, aren't we, Joel?
I think that's more up to you than it is to me.
You look older since you were in L.A.
You're a good friend.
You're like a brother to me.
Did you know that?
Do you have any real brothers or sisters?
What the fu- What is that?
I'm trying to have a real conversation, and you're psychoanalyzing me.
- What are you, Dr. Polly now?
- I was just curious.
Look at me when I talk to you.
You're trying to control this situation.
Stop trying to control this situation.
Can't you just leave your job out of this? Just this once?
I'm telling you. I think you're spending too much time with that Polly bitch.
What do you need?
I want you to think about what you need.
It's up to me to try and get that and make an exchange.
Anything you need for Ms. Beilman's safety.
What I need is you.
Hold on.
Hello.
I knew if I just came here and talked to you in person, you'd understand me better, Joel.
Fuck me, he's got
Campbell! Trace it!
You were the only one who thought about me, who really knew me.
For a long time,
I was the only one you had.
And then you met Lisa.
Pull in here.
Give me a second.
Give me a second.
Okay, he's about 20 miles north of the city.
Yeah, you're gonna have to do better than that. Now come on.
No shit! Give me another minute and we'll have his exact location.
I got him! I got him.
He's right on the water.
Come on in.
Polly, Joel.
Joel, Polly.
* She freak out at a damaged life like a jailbait in the park *
* A teenage wolf and a bloody knife going down in the dark *
* How to make a monster baby *
* How to get it on *
* How to make a monster baby *
* How to get it on *
* Go, go, Zombie
Go, go, yeah, yeah, yeah *
* Go, go, Zombie
Go, go, yeah, yeah, yeah *
* Roots in hell and time will tell if your baby is insane *
* A child bride with bloody eyes and Satan on the brain **
Wakey, wakey, Joel.
That hurts, doesn't it?
I've heard that flashing lights and migraines don't go together at all.
You're no fun.
Oh, no, Polly. No, no,
I'm not gonna kill him.
We need each other.
We define each other.
We're... yin and yang, black and white.
Isn't that right, Polly?
Polly?
I said, "Isn't that right?"
I don't understand the question.
Did you or did you not, in your professional opinion, reach the conclusion... that Joel and I need each other in order to give meaning to our lives?
Yes. Yes, but I-
See?
Take your fucking hands off her.
I said take your fucking hands off her.
Sit down, Joel.
Sit down.
I'll sit here and listen to you talk all night. Just take your hands off her.
Come on, put the fucking gun down.
We both know you're not gonna do it.
And why do we know that?
Because you can only kill her once.
He's right.
Upsy daisy.
How's this for deja vu?
We've got the fire.
We've got the pretty girl.
Only instead of bringing us together, you move to Chicago.
The guilt must have been unbearable.
Or something like that.
Is that what you want me to say?
I feel guilty a woman is dead because
I made a terrible mistake.
No.
No, no.
That wasn't the mistake.
The mistake was turning back instead of pouring all you had into us.
What do I want you to say?
I want you to say thank you.
I want you to say thank you for coming here and saving your pathetic life.
David, do you know how many serial killers are active in Chicago right now?
Five. In the Midwest, at least a dozen.
I could work on any one of them without even packing a bag.
You get hit by a bus on a Thursday,
I'm working on a new guy on Monday.
You're my job.
You're paperwork.
I can't believe you still don't know who you're talking to.
No, no, no!
No, please don't-
I have to do this. He's not going to understand anything else.
You heard him. "Paperwork. "
Thank you.
- What did you say?
- I said, "Thank you. "
Tell me again.
I said, "Thank you. "
Get out of here.
Let's go!
Run, run!
Joel! Joel!
Give me your hand!
Reach for it!
Ready? Reach.
Here you go.
You all right?
Give me that blanket.
Where's the girl?
Is she all right?
She's right over there.
- Let's get the fucking body out.
- Okay.
It's never quite that easy.
You go through the door.
They're never just sitting there waiting for you with a welcoming smile on their face.
The best you can do is hope they fuck up and do what you can to be there when they do.
Time's up.
Attention. Please prepare for docking procedure.
There's a package for you,
Miss Perkins.
They didn't leave a name.
- Said it was important.
- Thank you.
I don't like this business you're getting yourself into.
I'll be just fine, Mr. Paley.
You know what a careful girl I am.
I move my mouth, words come out, you don't hear.
- I'm late for a movie.
- I don't like it when you smile at me.
You don't like my smile?
I don't like what's behind it.
Listen, Polly, six scientists are missing, probably dead.
Somebody out there means business.
I don't want you in the middle of it.
It's only a movie, Mr. Paley.
I'll bring you some popcorn.
Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
We must be over the rainbow.
You sent me this?
Who are you?
- What's this all about, Mr...?
- Doctor.
Dr. Walter Jennings.
I'm a research chemist.
I specialize in nucleic-acid emissions.
The bonding enzymes in proteus molecules which...
The missing scientists.
You said you knew who was next.
Yes, l...
I have a deadline to meet, doctor.
I was one of seven scientists chosen to serve in a secret facility stationed outside of Berlin before the start of the First World War.
It was known only as Einheit Elf,
"Unit 11."
We agreed never to discuss what went on behind those doors.
The things we were made to do there...
Terrible things.
- I shouldn't have come.
- Now I know we're not in Kansas.
Are you a good witch or a bad witch?
Doctor, you said you knew who was next.
Yes.
Don't you see?
- There is only one left.
- Who? Who is it, doctor?
Me.
He's coming for me.
Who? Who's coming?
Totenkopf.
It's Totenkopf.
There!
All citizens, attention.
New York City must be evacuated at once.
Proceed in an orderly manner to the East River Drive.
All members of the police and fire department on leave or off duty
shall report immediately to their precincts or company command.
This is urgent.
- Editor Paley.
- Mr. Paley, it's me, Polly.
What's going on? They're calling for midtown to evacuate.
Listen, Mr. Paley,
I don't have much time.
I need you to dig up anything you can on a Dr. Walter Jennings and someone named Totenkopf.
An address, a phone number, anything you can find. It's important.
Totenkopf. Who is he?
He may have something to do with the missing scientists.
Quick as you can.
Polly, listen to me.
I want you to get out of there.
I want you to put the phone down, close your notepad and get the hell out of there.
Wait a minute.
I can see something now coming into sight above the Palisades.
They're crossing Sixth Avenue.
Fifth Avenue.
They're a hundred...
They're a hundred yards away.
Polly. Polly!
Oh, my God.
Polly!
Polly!
Polly!
Stop! Come back!
Fire!
Get out of here!
They've broken through the perimeter.
Send reinforcements.
Send everything you've got!

Come in, Sky Captain.
This is an emergency protocol, 90206.
Calling Sky Captain.
Sky Captain, do you read?
Calling Sky Captain.
Come in, Sky Captain.
This is an emergency protocol, 90206.
Calling Sky Captain.
Sky Captain, do you read?
Repeat. Calling Sky Captain.
Come in, Sky Captain.
This is Sky Captain. I'm on my way.
Polly.
Joe.
Further details of the attack continue to pour in.
The central portion of the city is blacked out from radio communication
due to damaged power lines and electrical failure.
Cables received from English, French and German news agencies
now confirm the attack was not limited to the city.
The BBC is reporting that a steel mill in Nuremberg
was virtually excavated
by what witnesses describe as a mechanized tornado.
News agencies in Paris and Madrid speak of strange burrowing machines
rising from the ground,
robbing entire communities of their coal and oil reserves.
Meanwhile, with military resources stretched thin across the globe,
world leaders must once again call upon
the elite mercenary forces of Sky Captain and his army-for-hire
to uncover the meaning of these mysterious events.
Where's Dex?
Shazam.
I thought you said this thing was big.
Can I have it?
You find out where it came from, and I'll buy you one for Christmas.
Oh, I need to show you something.
I recorded this signal just before the first machine appeared.
I didn't think anything of it until I played it back.
- Morse code?
- See, that's what I thought at first, but the syntax is more complex than that.
There's a sub-carrier hidden in the lower frequency.
I think it's being used to control them.
If it shows up again, could you track it?
I can try, yeah.
- Good boy, Dex.
- Thanks.
In the meantime, see what you can do with that thing.
Find out what makes it tick.
- You don't mind, do you?
- I don't mind.
I wanna know where it comes from,
Dex. Who sent it here.
Switch to map coordinate
69 SW by 49 E.
Tummy ache?
How you been, Joe?
- Miss me?
- Get out.
Well, it's nice to see you too.
Dex said you might be in a mood.
Dex?
Get in here!
It's been three years, Joe.
You're not still mad at me, are you?
Can't even remember what we were fighting about.
You sabotaged my plane.
Right.
I spent six months in a Manchurian slave camp because of you.
- They were gonna cut off my fingers.
- Joe, for the last time, I didn't sabotage your damn airplane.
All so you could get a photograph of Tojo Hideki in his bathrobe, remember?
You know, I'm starting to think that you've invented this whole sabotage nonsense to cover the fact that you were running around on me with your little mystery girl the whole time we were in Nanjing.
Never happened.
All in your imagination.
Who was she, Joe?
- What was her name?
- That's enough.
What are you gonna do?
Shoot me?
Oh, great. We all made up.
It's been a pleasure, Polly.
Let's do it again in ten years.
Escort Miss Perkins off the base, Dex.
If she resists, shoot her.
- Hi, Polly.
- Hi, Dex.
- I gotta...
- It's okay, hon, I know.
Okay.
It's just as well. I guess you wouldn't have been interested in this, anyway.
- Where did you get that?
- There's more where this came from.
Lots more.
- I want that blueprint, Polly.
- I want this story, Joe.
And you're gonna help me get it.
Maybe we should show her, Cap.
Maybe she can help.
Show me what?
Show me what?
My God. What is this?
Where do they come from?
They started appearing three years ago in remote areas.
We managed to keep it a secret until now.
They show up without warning, they take what they need, and then they disappear without a trace.
Three years and we still can't explain what they want or who's sending them here.
A man came to see me today, a scientist.
He was terrified.
Said someone was coming for him.
I asked him who he was so afraid of, and he repeated one name:
Totenkopf.
He nearly went white when he said it.
Totenkopf, who is he?
He's the invisible man.
I've been through every library record twice looking for anything.
I've called every contact I have from Paris to Bangkok.
This is the only thing I could dig up.
He ran some kind of secret science unit outside of Berlin before the start of World War I.
Something called Unit 11.
It's been more than 30 years since anyone has spoken his name.
Until today.
Note the insignia he used for the unit.
It matches the markings on all of these machines.
The scientist, where is he now?
We're in this together, right, Joe?
Nothing gets published until I say so.
You don't write a sentence or take a photograph without asking me first. Understood?
Understood.
What?
I missed you.
Thanks for saving my life today, by the way.
Were you down there?
You missed me too. How nice.
This is it. This is Jennings' lab.
Dr. Jennings? It's Polly Perkins.
Dr. Jennings!
It's locked.
That window there.
I may be able to get in through that window if I can attach a line...
It's open.
We're too late.
Someone beat us here.
All right, Polly...
...no more games.
What the hell is going on?
I was hoping you could tell me.
Dr. Jennings!
You must stop him!
Stay here.
Stop!
I don't wanna hurt you.
- Miss Perkins.
- I'm here, doctor.
- I'm going to get you some help.
- You must promise.
If Totenkopf finds them, the countdown will begin.
- This world shall end.
- I don't understand, doctor. Find what?
Promise.
He's dead.
I think I found something.
Dr. Jennings had this with him this morning at the theater.
- I'd better get back to the base.
- I'm coming with you.
Of course you are.
Reconnaissance picked up something on radar traveling at over 500 knots and coming straight for us.
- How long before they reach us?
- There!
Get my plane ready. I'm going up.
- What are you doing?
- I'm coming with you.
Don't be stupid. Remember what happened last time you flew with me?
- We had a deal.
- This is not a game, Polly.
- People are gonna die.
- You are not leaving me, Joe.
Not this time. This is my story, and we had a deal!
Go, go, go!
Get in.
There you are.
- Cap, this is Dex, do you read me?
- Hang on, Dex, I'm a little busy.
Come in, Dex.
Look, whatever you do, don't shoot!
- Okay.
- You shot it, didn't you?
- Yes.
- Listen, Cap, the signal's coming from one of those machines.
You gotta keep them in one piece.
Which machine is it, Dex?
There's no way of telling.
It could be any one of them.
I think I found it, Dex.
- Wait, Cap, I'm losing the signal.
- It's heading for the city.
Don't let it get away. I need you to bounce that signal back to me.
If we lose it now, we may never get it back.
You let me know when you've got something, Dex.
I'll let you know. Out.
All right, I want a full-spectrum sweep of every incoming signal.
Amplify any variant frequency cycle and route them to me.
They've come back for the generators.
Who is this guy?
- You okay?
- Great.
There's a bottle of Milk of Magnesia under the seat if you need it.
- I'm fine.
- You don't look so good.
Pull up!
- Joe!
- I see it!
It's getting away.
- I lost the signal, Cap.
- I'll find him, Dex. Sit tight.
- Go left.
- Sit back, Polly.
There's a shortcut down Broadway.
You can catch him on 42nd Street.
I know these streets like the back of my hand. Go left!
Hey!
Okay, okay, now go straight.
- No, no, no, go right!
- When?
Back there.
I could use a little more warning next time.
Go left!
Tell me you got something, Dex.
We're getting clobbered up here.
It's no picnic down here either, Cap.
Hang in there, I've almost got it.
Joe!
Dex! We can't hold them off any longer!
- I'm almost there.
- We have to evacuate now!
Go ahead without me.
I'm right behind you.
- Lovely.
- Okay, turn left at the drugstore.
- Left again.
- We're going around in circles.
Will you just trust me? Go left!
- It's a dead end.
- That's not supposed to be there.
It's a dead end!
There's no way out!
Oh, bugger.
Joe!
- There's the lead ship.
- Shortcut!
I got us here, didn't I?
- Dex. Dex!
- Thirty seconds, Cap, that's all I need.
- Thirty seconds.
- Plus or minus.
Listen, I'll try and take them out over the water, buy us some time. Over.
Still glad you came?
Joe, I found it! Joe!
Dex, come in. Where is it?
Come in, Dex. Are you there? Dex?
Dex, do you read me?
Dex, are you there?
I can't outrun them much longer.
Hold on.
Joe, what are you doing?
You're heading straight down!
- You're gonna kill us!
- I know what I'm doing. Just hold on.
We're going too fast.
We're not gonna make it.
Joe, you have to pull up!
Pull up!
- We went underwater.
- Dex rigged it up.
Got the idea from one of his comic books.
You mean, you knew this the whole time, and you let me think we were gonna crash?
I thought we were gonna die!
You should have said something!
Look, Polly, it was your idea to tag along, not mine.
If you can't take it, that's not my fault.
Oh, I can take it.
- I can take anything you dish out.
- Good.
Because that was nothing.
Dex, come in. Do you read me?
Do you read me, Dex? Copy.
Dex!
Dex!
Dex.
They're everywhere.
Joe, look out!
Dex!
Why would Totenkopf do this?
Why Dex?
It doesn't make any sense.
He was looking for something.
Dex said he knew where the transmission was coming from.
He must have got too close.
- He was trying to tell me something...
- Joe.
Good boy, Dex.
These journals belong to Dr. Vargas.
He must have passed them on to
Dr. Jennings before his disappearance.
- My God.
- What?
"Totenkopf was awarded his first patent when he was 12 years old.
By 17, he had already received two doctorates and was one of the most highly regarded minds of his day.
One year after his disappearance, ominous rumors began circulating.
Whispers that Totenkopf had begun work on what was darkly hinted to be a doomsday device.
Efforts to locate him have consistently failed, and to this day, his whereabouts remain a mystery.
Even less is known about his companion, an assassin who controls his machines."
She's the one who took Dex.
What else?
These are Unit 11 supply logs.
This is everything he's used his machines to collect for the last three years, including generators from the city.
It reads like a shopping list from all over the world.
What have you been up to, doctor?
It'll be all right, Joe.
Dex can look after himself.
We'll find him.
My old friend Joe.
- So glad to see you again.
- It's good to see you too, Kaji.
- So glad to see you again.
- It's good to see you too, Kaji.
This is Polly Perkins.
She'll be coming with us.
Nice to meet you.
- Kaji, did you get the maps I needed?
- Yeah, they're inside.
Did you get a little something for me?
Of course. Three cases, just like you asked.
Vienna sausages.
My God, it's been so long.
Kaji, how's your Tibetan?
Come, I'll show you the maps.
- How well do you know him?
- Kaji?
He's old legion.
Reconnaissance. Why?
I don't trust him.
That's funny, he said the same thing about you.
Here. Get changed.
Your clothes stay behind.
You won't be needing high heels where we're going.
Dex tracked the signal to here, this valley north of Karakal.
This is where the transmission originated.
Why is there no writing here?
What is this place?
- Shambhala.
- You know it?
It is forbidden.
It's said to be the source of the Kalachakra, Tibetan magic.
Those who live there are said to have supernatural powers.
You can get us there, Kaji, can't you?
No one has ventured this far.
It's very dangerous.
Shambhala is said to be protected by the priests of the Kalachakra lamasery.
If they find us there, they will kill us.
Why? Why is this place so special?
Shambhala is known by many names.
To the Hebrew, it is Eden.
To the ancient Greek, it was Empurios.
You may know it as Shangri-la.
A storm is coming. If you still wish to go, we must go now.
I need to send a message.
Editor Paley, this may be the last message you receive from me.
We've tracked a radio signal to Nepal in search of Dr. Totenkopf.
The story grows stranger at every turn.
Clues about a countdown.
But to what, I don't know.
I fear time is running out.
With any luck, I'll be back soon with Dex and the story.
I hope. Polly Perkins.
This is where civilization stops.
A blank on the map.
We must be careful from here.
Hurry.
What is it?
It looks like a mining outpost.
Something bad happened here.
Seems to be abandoned.
Tell your men we're heading down.
I want a closer look.
What is it, Joe?
Uranium.
The whole mine's contaminated.
- We can't stay here.
- Let's go.
Where's Polly?
Polly!
Miss Perkins?
We'll have to split up.
Polly!
Let her go.
Give me the vials and the girl will live.
What vials?
What are you talking about?
I will not ask a second time.
Drop the gun.
I told you, I don't know what you're talking about. You'll just have to kill us.
As you wish.
Wait! Wait. Wait.
I'm sorry, Joe.
Goodbye, my friends.
Your journey ends here.
I was going to tell you, Joe.
You have to believe me.
- What was in those vials?
- I don't know.
- You expect me to believe that?
- I'm telling the truth, Joe.
Dr. Jennings gave them to me just before he died.
He said that the world would end and the countdown would begin if Totenkopf got his hands on them.
You've done nothing but lie to me from the beginning.
Okay, I'm a liar. But I don't exaggerate.
That is what he said.
That was what Totenkopf was looking for.
- That's why he took Dex.
- I'm sorry.
I never meant for any of this to happen.
Do you hear that?
Dynamite.
That noise again.
Move!
What are you doing?
Come on!
Oh, great.
We're safe.
Polly, this may be our last moment together.
There's something
I need to ask you.
Yes, Joe?
Did you cut my fuel line?
Damn it! I didn't sabotage your lousy airplane!
Our last moments on earth and this is all you have to say to me?
Could we just for once die without all this bickering?
There you are.
- Why did you lock the door?
- Run!
My film.
Polly, leave it!
There's no time!
Polly.
Polly.
My clothes.
What are you doing in here?
Get out. Get out!
Not unless you have some pants hidden under there for me.
- Oh, don't tell me you're...
- Naked.
- You can say it, Polly.
- This isn't funny, Joe.
Where are we? What happened to us?
Where are our clothes?
Stop looking at me like that.
Like what?
Turn around, Joe.
I'm serious. Turn around.
Hi, Joe.
Ask him what he did with our clothes.
The clothes are burned.
Burned? Why?
He says the mine is poisonous.
Our clothes were infected.
He says he's arranged for a guide to lead us back down the mountain.
He will take us there once we are dressed.
We appreciate that. But explain to him we are here to find a man.
He says we must leave before it is dark.
There's nothing more he can do for us.
It's very important we find this man.
His name is Totenkopf!
He says, what do you want with this man?
I've come to kill him.
And to find my friend.
He says he will help you.
What do you think?
I think they burned the wrong clothes.
You said I couldn't bring anything else.
I think you look like a woolly mammoth.
They're waiting for us.
The priest says that Totenkopf enslaved his people, made them work in the mine, but the mine was poisonous.
Those who did not die right away were brought here for him to study.
Where is Totenkopf now?
He does not know. Only that
Totenkopf is gone, many years ago.
I can't believe this is happening.
I only have two shots left.
We're in Shangri-la and all I have is two shots.
Everything I had was in that bag.
You should have let me go back for my film.
You're right, I should have.
So where's he taking us?
To meet the only living survivor of Totenkopf's experiments.
What experiments?
Ask him, where is Totenkopf?
Tell him it's important we find him.
He wants to know why.
Why do you seek Totenkopf?
To make him pay for what he has done.
His staff. He's asking for his staff.
He says, follow Rana. The staff will lead you there to Totenkopf.
Rana? Is there such a place?
He says now that he has helped you, you must help him.
Of course. Anything.
What do you want?
Kill me.
Have you looked at this?
There's markings on it, like a ruler.
And there's a moon and a star.
And all I ask is a tall ship
and a star to steer her by
A star.
He wasn't talking about a place, he was talking about a star!
Rana is a star.
Ancient sailors used to navigate by using the night sky.
They could determine their position by the moon and the stars.
The Vikings were known to create maps for certain stars,
The Vikings were known to create maps for certain stars, latitude tables that required a key to decipher them.
The key was called Jacob's staff.
This has to be the key!
You mean this could really work?
You could really find Totenkopf with this thing?
We do things a little different nowadays.
All we needed to know was where to look. What's the date?
- March 2.
- March 2.
Using Karakal Plateau as our assumed position...
March 2...
Rana is at latitude 20.40.
Right ascension, 03 hours,
43 minutes.
Declination, minus 10.60.
There's nothing there.
Are you sure you did it right?
I'm sure.
If the old man was right, that's where Totenkopf is now.
Dead center in the middle of nowhere.
What's that point there?
That's where we run out of fuel.
Oh, great.
So how do we get there?
- Franky.
- Who?
Frank Cook. An old buddy of mine.
Runs a mobile reconnaissance outpost for the Royal Navy.
If I can get a message to them,
I may be able to arrange a rendezvous at these coordinates.
And what if they don't get the message?
Franky's never let me down.
They'll be there.
They'll be there.
Is that light supposed to be on?
Relax, Polly, everything's fine.
- We're out of fuel, aren't we?
- Buckle up.
Manta Station, do you read me?
Where are you, Franky?
What are you doing?
You can't land this in the middle of nowhere.
I'm not. I'm landing it on that.
- What is it?
- It's a mobile airstrip.
Dex had a hand in designing it.
It's kind of a secret. You can keep a secret, can't you, Polly?
Yeah.
I can keep a secret.
Two shots.
Permission to land on platform 327.
Maintain your present course.
Copy, 327.
Welcome aboard, captain.
Joseph Sullivan.
I was sure you'd be dead by now.
It's good to see you too, Franky.
This had better be important or one of us is in trouble.
It's important.
What is that?
You be nice.
Commander Cook, meet Polly Perkins.
Polly Perkins.
I've heard so much about you.
It's a pleasure to finally meet the competition.
It's been a long time since Nanjing, hasn't it, Joseph?
So, Franky, I hear you've been having trouble with that number-three engine, or at least you were last time...
Commander, we're tracking six enemy submersibles bearing 30 degrees northwest.
- Who wants to kill you now?
- Man your battle stations.
- All hands on deck.
- Follow me.
Take us to 10,000 feet and deploy countermeasures.
Yes, commander.
Reconnaissance located an island
3 kilometers northeast of our current position.
It is not, however, on any of our charts.
- That has to be him.
- That has to be who?
What have you got me into this time, Joseph?
Nothing you can't handle, Franky.
Polly, try not to touch anything.
Enemy warships bearing 316, mark 4. Closing fast.
- Give me a visual.
- Launching radio imager.
We're receiving a signal.
On-screen now.
Totenkopf.
Commander, we've lost power to the forward rotors. We're losing altitude.
All engines, reverse full.
Get us out of here.
Francesca, you've got to get me on that island.
I'm not about to risk the lives of my men for one of your silly antics.
He's got Dex.
Rescind order!
You'll never make it from the air.
We have to find you another way.
There's a tidal flow on the eastern face of the island.
It's too deep.
We're not rated past 300 meters.
But...
...this area here, there's an undersea inlet at the southern tip and it runs beneath the entire length of the island. That is your only way in.
Everything else is sheer rock to the edge of the water.
What about those machines?
How do we get past them?
Leave that to me.
Alert the amphibious squadron.
Report to main station carrier.
What?
Nanjing?
I can't hear you, Polly.
You'll have to speak up.
Keep your nose up, Joseph. You always were bad at the short takeoff.
Keep up, Franky. I don't wanna have to come back for you.
I thought your takeoff was just fine.
Thank you, Polly.
So you heard that, did you?
Manta leader to Manta team, impact in ten seconds.
Switching to amphibious mode.
Impact in five, four, three, two, one.
Franky.
You remember our milk run over Shanghai, don't you?
We had the target buttoned up and he was jinxing in the flak.
- Pops a rivet, thinks he's taken a hit.
- And started yelling:
- "Protect the rabbits!
- "Protect the rabbits!
- Protect the rabbits!"
- Protect the rabbits!"
Enemy target spotted four points to the right. Depth, 1,600. Look sharp.
Joe, watch out!
- Joseph, there's the inlet.
- I see it.
Get ready to make a run for it.
We're about to clear you a path.
Hold on, now, Polly.
Hold on.
Manta leader to Manta team, arm cluster torpedoes and stick close to element formation.
Fire.
Joseph! Pull up!
Joseph, it's still alive. Disengage.
Do you hear me? Disengage.
Do you hear me?
- What is it?
- Do you hear me? Pull up!
- The rudder's jammed. I can't steer.
- Joseph!
Disengage!
- Thank you, Franky. That was close.
- Get ready to make a run for it.
You're only going to have one shot at this.
Franky, what are you doing?
This is no time to show off.
- She's heading straight for it.
- On my mark.
- She's going to ram it.
- It's suicide.
Franky, pull up.
- Three.
- Pull up, Franky.
Two.
One.
You're all clear.
Good luck, Joe.
Thank you, Franky.
We'll take it from here.
She's some kind of girl.
Yes, I know.
I'm taking us up.
What?
- What is it?
- One of Totenkopf's creatures.
- You're not gonna photograph that?
- I've only got two shots left.
Who knows what's waiting for us out there.
Suit yourself.
There's a clearing up ahead.
Totenkopf can't be far.
Run.
There.
Polly!
Oh, great.
Come on!
Polly!
Come on!
Are you mad?
Are you mad?
Are you completely insane?
You could have gotten yourself killed!
- It's okay.
- No, it isn't.
- I didn't mean...
- I shot the ground!
- What?
- When we were running,
I shot the ground.
It isn't funny.
I only have one shot left.
One shot!
What is it with you and that stupid camera, anyway?
You gave it to me.
You don't even remember, do you?
You were flying with the American volunteers in Nanjing,
I was covering the evacuation of Shanghai.
- I remember.
- Joe, I wanna ask you something and I want you to tell me the truth.
I don't care one way or the other,
I swear. I just need to know.
The girl in Nanjing was Franky, wasn't it?
- Polly.
- How long were you seeing her?
Look me in the eyes.
I never fooled around on you.
Never.
I sabotaged your plane.
- Three months.
- I knew it!
I can't believe I ever trusted you, you lousy...
He's here.
You all right?
Through there.
Through there.
My God, Joe.
It's an ark.
He's building an ark.
What are you doing?
You honestly think you're gonna find something more important than every single creature on Earth being led two by two inside a giant rocket ship?
I might.
- Like what?
- I'll know when I see it.
- Ten minutes to liftoff.
- They've started the countdown.
We have to find Totenkopf.
You've got a gift.
- Dex!
- Hurry, get in!
Einsteigen. Komm, springt!
Are you all right?
How did you find us?
We escaped into the tunnels once the countdown started.
Some of the scientists were caught.
They didn't make it.
The machines that were guarding us are loading everything on this island into that ship.
We've got about ten minutes to stop that thing from blasting off.
Dex! Get us out of here!
Good boy, Dex.
Thanks, Cap.
- Who are they?
- They're Unit 11.
Or what's left of them.
They were brought here to finish what they started 30 years ago.
Finish what?
Tell them.
Totenkopf believed that humankind was doomed to extinction, so he proposed the unthinkable:
To build a vessel that would carry the building blocks of a new civilization into space.
He used his machines to collect specimens representing all life on Earth.
What Totenkopf called
"The World of Tomorrow."
Those vials that Dr. Jennings gave me, what were they?
Adam and Eve.
Totenkopf's masterpiece.
Seeds of a technological utopia.
We smuggled them off this island, knowing Totenkopf would never leave without them.
But now that he has them again, there is nothing left to keep him here.
Then let him go. Let him go where he can't harm anyone.
No, no, no, that ship must never leave this Earth.
Why? What haven't you told us?
When the rocket reaches 100 kilometers, at the edge of space,
- Earth will be incinerated.
- How do we stop it?
Only Totenkopf can stop it now. But we've never been allowed near him.
He's too well guarded even to be seen.
- Where is he?
- We're on our way, Cap.
Good boy, Dex.
Careful. Careful.
Hurry, they'll be coming for us.
Through there.
That's the only way in.
You see, there is no way past them.
Five minutes, Joe.
- Wait here.
- You'll be killed.
He knows what he's doing.
I think.
Hey, that's my gun!
- Dex?
- Try shaking it.
- We must hurry.
- Don't do it, you idiot!
Doctor, stop!
Who dares come before me?
Who dares enter this place?
What has begun cannot be stopped.
- The time for this world is over.
- Totenkopf.
Hello, doctor.
Why are you doing this?
I have been witness to a world consumed by hatred
and bent on self-destruction.
Watched as we have taken what was to be a paradise
and failed in our responsibilities as its steward.
I know now that the course the human race has set for itself
cannot be changed.
I am the last, desperate chance for a doomed planet.
Now, leave this place or die!
- Is it safe?
- Well, there's only one way to find out.
I meant throw something.
He's not here.
We're too late.
These are his personal papers.
He would never leave without them.
He must still be here.
- We must find him.
- I found him.
It's impossible.
It can't be.
The last entry in his journal was made on October 11, 1918.
He died over 20 years ago.
We've been chasing a ghost.
Three minutes to liftoff.
They never stopped. They're finishing what they were programmed to do.
Don't you see? This entire island is Totenkopf. Every wire, every gear.
He's found a way to cheat even his own death.
So how do we kill somebody who's already dead?
- How do I stop it?
- Nothing can stop it now.
- There must be some way.
- His machines would never allow it.
Leave the machines to me.
Dex, show me what to do.
If you can cut the lead in the system terminal, it should create a short...
...which will ignite the fuel line before the booster engines can fire
- and destroy the atmosphere.
- That's it?
- That's all I have to do?
- The terminal's onboard the rocket.
You won't have time to escape.
Contact Franky as soon as you're off the island.
- She'll know exactly what to do.
- What are you talking about?
- I'm going with you.
- Not this time.
We had a deal.
You're not gonna leave me now, just when things are getting interesting.
- I won't let you.
- I wish we had more time.
And I only hope, one day, you can forgive me.
- Take care of her, Dex.
- Good luck, Cap.
One minute to liftoff.
We meet again, my mysterious friend.
How do you wanna do this?
Nice shot, Polly.
What took you so long?
She's a machine.
Ten seconds to liftoff.
Nine...
... eight...
... seven...
... six...
... five...
... four...
We've gotta get those animals off the ship.
Ninety kilometers to booster ignition.
There's no time.
That's our only way across.
Eighty kilometers to booster ignition.
Danger! Danger! Danger!
Cargo release imminent!
What did you do now?
Come on!
Seventy kilometers to booster ignition.
Sixty kilometers to booster ignition.
Hold on!
Please! Don't touch anything else!
There's no time. We'll never make it.
Fifty kilometers to booster ignition.
Run!
Forty kilometers to booster ignition.
Come in, Manta station.
Do you read me?
Thirty kilometers to booster ignition.
Franky, it's Dex. Do you read me?
It didn't work.
Twenty kilometers to booster ignition.
Joe, you're running out of time.
You've gotta do something.
And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth...
- He thinks he's God.
- And God said unto Noah, the end...
Shut up!
Ten kilometers to booster ignition.
Nine...
... eight...
... seven...
- ... six...
- Why won't you die?
Five kilometers to booster ignition.
Four...
... three...
... two...
... one.
Warning. System failure.
Booster malfunction.
Danger. Danger.
Danger.
Warning. System failure.
- Booster malfunction.
- Look!
Danger. Danger.
- What is it?
- It might be our way out of here.
I see them, commander.
Ready assault teams.
All hands on deck.
One shot.
You got your story.
Polly.
- You...
- It's all right.
You don't have to say anything.
Lens cap.
Picture a waterfall running into a beautiful, clean river.
You stand on the bank of the river.
Soft grass brushes against your bare feet.
The water is clear as crystal.
The sky is profoundly blue and everything is clean.
Now take a drag on your cigarette.
Look at the sky now.
You've poisoned the sky.
Now look at the water.
It stinks.
Throw away your cigarette.
Now look at the water.
What do you see?
You won't want to smoke anymore now.
Good.
- That’s 150 pounds, is it?
- Yeah.
Cash.
Yeah. I knew that.
Try to avoid things you associate with cigarettes.
- Alcohol, stress...
- Sex.
If you get the urge to smoke, just clear your mind.
Revisit the beautiful meadow, the cool river.
But... think only nice thoughts.
No more... little girls floating underwater, okay?
- Come in.
- What did you say?
I have another appointment.
Come in, please.
Now, take a drag of your cigarette and look at the water.
- Look how dirty it has become.
- I need to speak to you.
Look at the filthy sky.
I'm sorry, I'm in the middle of...
Why did you mention the girl?
- You have to leave.
- You saw her, didn't you?
- I didn't see anything.
- A girl in a white nightgown... underwater, in my head.
That 's amazing. That 's incredible.
You could help me.
Something bad happened.
Now she won't talk.
Not a word.
She needs to tell what, you know, happened.
I'm sorry.
I just do cigarettes. Bye.
Is it lunch time yet?
No, it 's dinner time.
And it 's daddy's turn to cook... so you'll just have to wait.
Martha! Yuk! Yuk!
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Hi, honey.
- Look what I got for you.
- A doggy!
- Thank you, daddy.
- How's my girl?
Fine.
Sorry.
Great. A toy that barks all day.
Only when you touch his head.
How was your day?
Long. Lonely.
Nicer now you're here.
Martha's starving.
Again?
- Guess what I'll cook for dinner?
- Macaroni and cheese.
- How did you guess?
- That 's what you always make.
"That 's what you always make!"
Take this.
Come on. Come here.
What are you worrying about?
- Is it kicking?
- Tap dancing on my kidneys.
I think I should find a new office.
- What about over a tobacco shop?
- I'm serious.
Let 's save a little money first, okay?
It 's gonna be all right here,
Michael.
- It 's just like home.
- You think so?
It will be. When we get this place fixed up... find Martha a better school... make at least one friend.
I'm kidding.
- I like the English. They're so...
- What?
Outgoing.
Hello, Dr. Strother.
Mind if I call you Michael?
- I'm late.
- I'll walk up with you.
- Is it about the...?
- No. No craving at all.
I gave you my final word about the other thing.
Why do you charge cash? Do you have a National Insurance number?
Does the Inland Revenue even know about you?
If you don't leave me alone,
I'll call a policeman.
I'm a policeman. Policewoman.
Police person.
You want to see my badge?
I don't care about your taxes.
All I care about is that yesterday you did two impossible things.
- Two?
- I haven't thought about smoking.
I can't read minds.
Nobody can.
Then how do you explain yesterday?
A feeling. Intuition.
It happens to everyone, even to you.
You just don't pay any attention.
I'll pay you 5OO pounds, cash.
If you can get her to talk.
You don't know what you're asking.
- I'm asking you to help a child.
- I'm sorry, no.
Well, you will be sorry when I shop you to the taxman.
- So, where in America did you live?
- Seattle.
- That 's a Seattle accent, is it?
- No.
I'm from Europe, just like you.
I moved to America1O years ago.
I'm not from Europe, I'm from
London. Wouldn't live anywhere else.
This is where we're keeping her.
Her mother's name is Grace.
She's not going to like you.
Ready?
- No.
- You'll be fine.
Hello, Keith. This is Dr. Strother, come to see Heather.
- Is she awake?
- I've had no word about this.
No. Typical, ain't it?
Hi, Grace.
What 's this?
Another doctor?
This one's special.
Got me off the fags in one session.
A bloody miracle.
- How's Heather?
- Same.
- Any words?
- Not a sound.
I won't do anything unless you say so.
Damn right you won't.
He just talks.
That 's all.
He won't even touch her.
I trust him.
Well, go on then.
- Could you...?
- Sorry. Keith, sit down.
Hi, Heather.
My name is Michael.
Is this a new one?
Do you like music videos?
You know, sometimes... the lights and colours act like musical notes.
See how the colours get brighter as the beat gets louder?
You can almost feel the music on your face, can't you?
And on your chest.
And the louder the music gets... the brighter the colours get until... they merge into one.
One great, white light.
It 's almost difficult to watch, isn't it?
Difficult to keep your eyes open.
Maybe you should close your eyes.
Just for a moment.
Let them close.
You'll feel better.
Don't fight it.
Just close your eyes.
That 's much better, isn't it?
Now tell me, Heather... what do you see with your eyes closed?
Like stars in the night sky?
Millions and millions of stars stretching away to infinity.
Travel through them... past them... beyond them.
Now faster... and faster and faster.
And now you see one very bright star ahead of you.
The most beautiful star you've ever seen.
And it comes closer... and closer.
You feel happier and happier.
The light covers you up.
Swallows you.
Makes you feel safe and warm.
And now... you pass through the light... to the other side.
To the place where you lost your voice.
Heather!
Heather!
Heather!
Where are you?
Heather!
Wake up.
Wake up, Heather!
You talked!
I don't know what you said, but you talked! Tell me something! Anything!
Are you all right?
She's that girl in the papers...
...who escaped the Tattoo Murderer?
- Yeah, well spotted.
I don't want anything to do with her.
Michael, you were brilliant.
- She didn't actually talk, but...
- Just forget about me, okay?
- Did you see anything?
- No.
Yes. I mean, nothing really.
Losey, it 's dangerous.
If I screw up, she could...
Christ!
You're gonna have to tell me everything.
She was kidnapped from her home in Hackney 3 weeks ago.
1O days later she crawled out of a canal near Lime house.
She had bruises. No broken bones.
No evidence of sexual assault.
She had quite a few needle marks on her arms and legs... but no trace of any identifiable drugs in her blood or hair.
And no indication, yet, of any particular infections.
The only thing we have to go on, really... is the tattoos.
Have a look at these.
Mean anything to you?
No.
Not really.
What do you mean, "not really"?
We found traces of wicker under her nails and in her hair.
He may have kept her locked up in some kind of basket, Michael.
She's lucky she got away.
The other three dead kids were all tattooed the same way.
All of them died from catastrophic serological reaction to blood... human blood of the wrong type, injected into their veins.
They were all type "O".
Heather's type "AB".
So what are you saying? She's got the killer's blood in her veins?
Probably.
So, what did you see, Michael?
Nothing much. A face.
- Man or woman?
- Man.
- The killer?
- I don't know.
- Could you identify him?
- How?
- Well, we can make a photo fit.
- No.
So that 's it?
I guess so.
I haven't got 5OO quid.
I don't have to be a mind-reader to know that.
Stars in the night sky...
Heather!
Batteries. Where the hell am I gonna find batteries?
Moloch, Gog, Drammlach,
Lord of the Rats.
Hear the darkness beseech.
Hear the Darkness.
The Fabric of Sorrow beseech thee.
Yield once more the Contagion of Woe.
What are you doing?
Did I wake you?
It 's 3 o'clock in the morning!
I can't sleep.
Two nights in a row. Don't tell me we're gonna go down that road again.
I'm just...
I'm thinking about the baby.
You promised if we went somewhere completely different...
I will be okay. Okay?
I'll be up in a minute.
- Take a pill, Michael.
- I did.
Take another one.
What are his qualifications?
Is he even a medical man?
Is he certified in any specialties?
Do we know anything about him at all?
- What does he charge?
- He's working for free.
- That 's pretty damn suspicious.
- He got through to her. She talked.
Right.
Why didn't you say so sooner?
What did she say?
Only gibberish, but it 's a start.
- Did you record any of this?
- Yeah.
- May we hear it?
- I haven't got it with me.
I was there, Chief. What Heather said didn't make any sense... but he was very good with her.
And you have vast experience in this field, do you?
No, ma'am.
Only gibberish?
Your only remit was to look after Heather's welfare?
- What?
- Yes, sir.
Yes, sir!
- That 's all you were asked to do.
- Listen... our experts on the occult can tell us all about zodiacs... but they can't tell us why we keep finding tattoos on dead children.
6O officers have spent 17 weeks and 6 million pounds... and all we know about this monster is he's certain to strike again, soon.
And you're gonna have to go on the telly again... and say we know fuck all again!
- I think Losey needs a holiday.
- I think you're right.
But...
I'm gonna allow her to continue, for now, with this...
Thank you.
On condition that you get me his full story.
- Home Office check, the works.
- You won't regret it, sir.
- I'd better bloody not.
- I'd like to record my objection.
Done.
You stole my tape, you bastard.
"Contagion of Woe,
Lord of the Rats".
- So what is that about?
- Hell if I know.
It 's hardly something an 11-year old girl would say.
It could be what we call a Flashbulb Memory.
A vivid recollection imprinted on the brain by trauma.
She probably just heard those words and doesn't know what they mean.
Jesus! Where are you going?
What about Heather?
We'll get there.
First, there's a man I wanna see.
Couldn't you see him later?
The researchers we've been using haven't come up with shite.
I talked to this guy on e-mail.
He's got a fucking weird website.
Paranormal, Aleister Crowley.
All kinds of creepy occult stuff.
I was gonna ask him about those tattoos, but... maybe he'll have some idea about this business, too.
It 's almost on the way.
Elliot?
Can I help you with anything?
You sent me an e-mail saying
I could come and talk to you here.
Right.
When I wrote that, I certainly didn't expect you to be a woman.
Well, I am.
Obviously.
I must admit you two don't look like the usual sort of...
...interested types.
- What do they usually look like?
- Me.
- I'm with the police, Elliot.
- But I haven't done anything.
- Of course not. We want your help.
Okay, well...
I'd be only too pleased.
You ever hear of
"The Lord of the Rats"?
Well, you tell her. Go on.
What 's this?
She's dressing up in my shoes.
The bike's in the way.
What is it, Heather?
Is it stuck?
Heather!
- Michael!
- Stop there, Heather.
Don't go any further.
Close the door.
Now come back to me and your mother, where it 's safe.
Come back to your painting.
- A pen. Quick.
- Pen. Keith?
You're back with your painting.
This time, Heather, I'd like you to draw a different picture.
Something you remember from that time.
Something that sticks in your mind.
Go on, Heather.
We're all here.
You're safe.
No one can hurt you.
The glass slipper fit perfectly.
So, they brought Cinderella back to the palace...
I just... realized she'd been gone too long.
I went to the door to check.
It was standing open.
Someone had just... taken her.
Let her sleep at least an hour.
I know how important giving up smoking is to you.
Your husband is not gonna leave you.
Well, okay, maybe he is.
I can fit you in tomorrow.
Tomorrow morning?
Well, yeah, okay.
I'm very sorry.
I'm very sorry. Bye. Bye.
You're not sorry at all, are you?
- Lf my wife finds out, I will be.
- Jealous?
8 months pregnant, second child.
I can't afford to lose my clients.
I'd be jealous.
You're not married, are you?
Bit permanent, marriage.
I thought that 's supposed to be the attraction.
- Impermanence has its attractions.
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- What are you looking for?
- Sleeping pills.
The bathroom window downstairs was wide open.
- So?
- So?
- Someone could get in.
- Someone 8 inches tall.
- Talk to me, Michael.
- I just need some sleep.
- Is it about money?
- No.
We have enough till things pick up.
Things will pick up.
Look how well you've done in the last 7 months.
This time next year you'll be booked solid and you can double your fees.
Then, write a book, sell videos.
Yeah, keep my head down, work the cigarettes.
You're the one who described it as saving lives.
What 's wrong, Michael?
Nothing, it 's...
- It 's just the sex.
- What?
I'm sure I just miss sex.
Honey, so do I.
Anyway, it 's... it 's not entirely out of the question.
What the...?
Relax your ankles, relax your knees... relax your stomach, relax your chest... relax your face.
Try to relax.
Relax your body completely.
Start with your toes.
Very relaxed.
Let the feeling move up to your legs.
Very, very relaxed.
All the way up to your stomach... chest...
Breathe deeply.
Feeling relaxed.
Very, very relaxed.
Please, no.
No.
"Nistnesus".
I'm sorry, just...
You're through to Hargrave Models.
Please leave a message.
Hi, it's Michael Strother.
We met a couple of days ago.
I wonder if the word "Nistnesus"... might mean anything to you?
Yeah, thanks.
Telephone number...
O2073...
- Have you got one, then?
- All right, all right.
Light.
Hey, look.
Let 's check it out.
Now, the diagrams you gave me... these three are pretty much standard hermetic stuff.
Just as all Christian sects use the symbol of the cross... most pre-Christian sects use the signs of the zodiac.
Likewise, certain number patterns.
Sacred numbers are very important to adherence of the Old Knowledge.
- I didn't know.
- Yes. Yes, oh yes. But... these other two diagrams, they're very interesting.
And very peculiar.
And they tie in absolutely with both the typed liturgical fragment... and the other term your partner called to ask about.
- Liturgical?
- Precisely.
A liturgy. A ceremony.
Do you mind my asking where you came across this stuff?
- Check this out.
- No way.
Wuss!
- Who's the wuss now?
- Fuck off, that 's blood!
- Hi, Elliot.
- Glad you could make it.
Elliot tells me you asked him to research something for you.
I assume this has got something to do with a crime.
- What sort of crime?
- What term did he ask you about?
"Nistnesus".
The unwitting will of the mind to flee the body.
What 's that all about?
Michael?
Something I thought of after you left.
Right. So, what 's the tie in?
Paladine. Francis Paladine.
He wrote the liturgy, invented the term "Nistnesus"... and he's the man you're after.
Is this Paladine a friend of yours?
- He's dead, isn't he?
- Only about 5OO years.
He was executed in France for heresy.
His living bowels were burned before his eyes.
He believed the soul was infused in the fore part of the brain... behind the eye.
Are there many practicing disciples of this Paladine these days?
I don't think there are any.
It was never a cult or anything.
So, how do you know all about it?
Well, I read books.
Try "The Hidden Light", by Catherine
Lebourg, there's a chapter on him.
Why don't you ask her yourself?
I'm sure she's still alive.
- You look like shit.
- I feel like shit.
- Are you having my house watched?
- You're getting paranoid.
Big silver Mercedes, lurking.
Drove off when I ran outside.
You don't need to watch my house!
Policemen in England are poor.
They don't drive big silver Mercs... they drive clapped out old bangers like this. You want a lift?
- No, I'll get a tube.
- Bye.
At least now we know what kind of trainers he wears.
Hallelujah.
I think we should get Heather here.
It might spark her off.
The American Medical Registry has no record of any Doctor Michael Strother.
- You checked him out?
- It was your assignment, wasn't it?
He's here on a student visa.
So is his wife.
- He could make us look very bad.
- That is not gonna happen, sir.
All I want from you is to look after Heather!
I don't want him going near her again!
Now stop running around playing detective!
Yeah, we had a little baby girl.
I'm walking through a crime scene... which I believe to be connected to the so-called "Tattoo Murders".
And just look at what I've found.
The mark of Edward Lippard-Smith.
Who was by no means a godd Christian.
What do you think you're doing here?
- I'm a consultant on this case.
- And I'm Britney Spears.
Did any of you happen to notice by whom this church was built?
Get a life!
I'll get it!
Jesus Christ! Martha?
Martha?
Martha?
Where's Martha?
I thought you were watching her.
All right?
Who the hell are you?
Gas man.
Reading your meter.
For God's sake, Michael! Martha's right out here in the garden.
- Get the fuck out of my house.
- Take it easy.
Michael.
Absolutely.
Yes, sure, I will tell...
It 's very, very urgent that he gets this information.
Yes, Elliot Spruggs.
Thank you. Goodbye.
- Good night.
- Good night, daddy.
Your consultant just called.
- What?
- He thinks you're a policeman.
Spruggs. Elliot Spruggs.
I don't know anything.
Losey and Michael know everything.
All right?
I have Michael's number over there, by the telephone.
What are you doing?
Please don't.
That arsehole Elliot called my wife. I'm in the shit.
You can always come and stay with me.
Yeah, right.
Elliot said he'd been to the crime scene... and he took some important video footage.
I think we should go to his place ASAP.
Michael?
Sorry. It 's okay.
I'll meet you there.
Is it okay?
- I need to do this.
- What 's going on, Michael?
I'm helping the police treat a little girl.
The little girl in the papers?
Yeah.
Michael.
I think I can help her.
We've flown 4,OOO miles to start a new life in a new country... because you couldn't sleep in your own bed anymore! Remember?
- This is different.
- No! This is not different.
That 's why the insomnia's back, isn't it?
I'll be back soon.
Fuck!
You're a bit jumpy, aren't you?
The door's been forced open.
Elliot?
- What was he doing in the church?
- I don't know.
- Did you tell him about it?
- How? I didn't know anything.
Elliot could have followed me.
I drove straight to the church after meeting him.
We looked at the video, and his
"very important evidence".
It 's a19th century mark of an architect called...
Lippard-Smith.
Do you know anything about him?
No.
Pity.
Apparently the rat is recovering nicely.
It 's not your fault, Losey.
I think I know who we could ask about Lippard-Smith.
She won't be able to talk long, just had a biopsy.
Professor Lebourg, you've got guests.
And I'm not deaf.
I'll be in my office.
Well... don't just stand there grinning like monkeys. Do sit down.
- Professor...
- Please, call me Catherine.
- What 's your name?
- Strother. Michael Strother.
Are you famous?
No.
Pity. Is she?
No, I'm not famous, either.
We're doing some research.
We've been reading your book.
- Oh, yes? Which one?
- "The Hidden Light".
Not my best.
We are specifically interested in Francis Paladine.
A great man.
Greatly misunderstood.
Do you know of any active followers of his ideas?
Half the population of Silicon Valley.
I'm sorry?
Naturally none of them have ever heard of him... but they're all trying to download their consciousness into computers.
Or so I read.
Paladine was after the same kind of transfer.
5OO years ago.
Well, only his method was supposed to work from man to man.
Why?
How old were you when you first realized that one day you would die?
We'd also like to ask you about a19th century church architect... called Lippard-Smith.
Not a great man.
He built ten indifferent churches around London.
Was he interested in the occult?
Not as much as he was in prostitution.
Was Lippard-Smith a follower of Paladine?
I'm tired.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
Not outside my house.
Drop me a bit further down.
Better wipe the lipstick off your cheek.
There is no lipstick, Michael.
- You need some rest.
- Yeah, I need some...
What 's wrong?
Michael.
...following the discovery of a body in East London.
Chief Inspector Clements confirmed that the derelict church... stumbled upon by two schoolboys yesterday... is linked to the "Tattoo Murders".
- Who the fuck are you?
- Easy, pal. I'm just doing my job.
The police are using you in the case, right? They are, aren't they?
Don't tell me you're a newspaper photographer?
Am I right?
Ask him why he left America.
We can look on it as free advertising.
I'm sorry.
Should we try Australia?
Didn't you realize that this case would put you in the public eye?
I had other things on my mind.
You didn't drown that man.
And saving this girl, or any other, is not gonna bring him back.
He could swim. He was on his high school team, but... something happened.
I never found out what.
And he developed a real terror of water.
He couldn't go near the lake or even a swimming pool.
So, where did you go wrong?
I did the thing someone like me should never, ever do.
I took away his fear.
I convinced him he had no reason at all to be afraid.
I made him feel invincible.
So the very next day he went down to the lake.
It was early April.
The ice had only just melted.
And... he went for a swim.
The coroner said... a man of his size and weight would have survived 1O minutes.
15 at most.
It would have been a case of suicide if I hadn't told them what I'd done.
- They blamed you for it.
- No. But the newspapers did.
Is that why you aren't registered as a doctor in America?
I'm registered, all right.
You checked up on me?
Of course you have.
Strother is my wife's name.
Hello?
Yes. Okay.
Number 35...
King Charles Avenue,
London, England.
- Martha?
- Bye.
- Who was that?
- A man.
St. Mary Magdalen, Clerkenwell.
St. John The Baptist, Whitechapel.
St. Luke, Westminster.
Holy Trinity, Bermondsey.
St. Stephen's, Blackheath.
What?
Nothing. It 's okay.
Go back to sleep.
Fuck!
- Have you seen my filofax?
- No.
I'm sure it was here.
- I haven't seen it.
- We need to get out of here now.
Heather, do you want a cone?
An ice-cream cone?
I'll go. Do you want one, Keith?
Sure.
With a flake.
And because... when I flick this switch... we will see on my screen... the answer to the biggest question of all.
Where exactly are we anyway?
That 's 3 pounds, please.
Thank you.
Thanks, love. Bye.
Bye.
What are you doing here?
I tried to call, but no-one here would give me the time of day.
My family needs protection.
Sorry, but we've got worse things than photographers to worry about.
- He was in my house last night.
- Go to the Press Complaints.
I mean the killer was in my house!
He did this.
And he took my filofax.
Oh, God.
He has the address of the safe house. Get Heather out of there.
What?
Keith is dead.
Heather's been kidnapped.
It 's all my fault.
That 's why I've been sacked.
Sign there, please, sir.
How long will you be staying?
Not sure.
Come on, sweetheart.
It 's not so bad, huh?
No, it 's fantastic.
We can put the baby's cot right here.
The changing table over there.
Sterilize the bottles downstairs.
- Dad, it 's cricket.
- It 's just like baseball, honey.
I'll find a way to make it up to you.
At this point, if anyone would let me on a plane...
I'd already be halfway home.
They will catch him. Soon.
Don't we at least get a guard?
Now he has Heather back, they think he won't bother us.
What 's he gonna do to her?
Francis Paladine.
A great man.
Greatly misunderstood.
He believed the soul was infused... in the fore part of the brain behind the eye.
The mark of Edward Lippard-Smith.
Who was, by no means, a good Christian.
Moloch, Gog, Drammalach,
Lord of the Rats. Hear me.
Yield once more to the Contagion of Woe.
Forthine is the Bitterest Pill and the Dismalest Traffic.
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Listen.
What if the killer used that church specifically... because it was built by Lippard-Smith?
Maybe it 's some kind of sacred place.
I mean, sacred to him.
The killer.
And Lebourg said there were ten churches.
- Maybe he's in one of them.
- Clements is way ahead of you.
He checked them out.
They're all active places of worship... and the priests in charge are all on alert.
- There are only eight churches.
- But Lebourg said ten.
We got a list from the C of E.
Lippard-Smith never worked for anybody else.
They say there's only eight.
- Do you have the list?
- Yeah, I've probably got it.
Can you fax it to me?
There you go, sir.
Thanks.
Excuse me, can we get some more tea?
Daddy, are you looking for a better hotel?
Daddy?
Daddy?
Daddy!
- Sweetheart.
- Hang on, I'll get it.
Wait a minute.
If we add one church here... and one here...
Losey, listen: Lebourg was right.
There are ten churches.
Look at your map.
If you add two more, one in
Shepherds Bush and one in Hackney...
Hold on, hold on.
...it makes a five pointed star.
Do you see?
Like the mark of Lippard-Smith.
- You're right.
- They could've been changed.
That 's why they are not on the list.
I'm near Hackney.
You look in Shepherds Bush.
If you find it, call me.
Don't go in.
It 's a taxi. I gotta go.
I gotta go! Bye.
Taxi!
I'm looking for a church which is no longer a church... somewhere around Hackney.
This is the place?
No. It 's a synagogue.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
- What are you doing here, love?
- You gave me such a fright!
I thought you were...
No, never mind.
Thanks.
Yes?
Hi. I wonder if I could ask you a couple of questions?
Yeah? What about?
This building you live in, I'm doing some historical research...
Please, I need to use your phone to call the police.
It 's an emergency.
Thanks.
- Were you mugged?
- No.
- Could I sit down, please?
- Sure. Phone's round here somewhere.
Bloody portables.
There's a man in the cellar.
Have you noticed anything odd down there?
What kind of "odd"?
Downstairs...
How did that telephone get down there?
Where's Heather?
How did you find me?
We know all about you.
Who's "we"?
The police.
Losey?
Yeah.
Then where is she?
Talk to me.
You're lying.
What are you doing?
Hey, what are you doing?
Where's Heather?
Talk to me.
I'm listening.
What do you wanna know?
The truth.
You don't have to talk.
We'll find out what you know.
Can't you talk to me?
How much do you know?
How much do you know?
Talk. Talk. Come on!
Shit! Talk to me!
Heather?
Heather, where are you?
Heather?
Moloch, Gog, Drammalach,
Lord of the Rats. Hear the Darkness.
Yield once more to the Contagion of Woe.
Forthine is the Bitterest Pill and the Dismalest Traffic.
I'm tired.
You know who I am, don't you?
Relax...
I shall show you.
Moloch, Gog, Drammalach...
Lord of the Rats.
Beseech thee for more Darkness.
The Fabric of Sorrow beseech thee.
Yield once more to the Contagion of Woe.
For thine is the Bitterest Pill and the Dismalest Traffic.
I am Francis Paladine.
Do you know the darkest fear that gnaws at the heart of men? Do you?
I have examined your mind and found that, like me, you have a gift.
But you have hidden your gift under a bushel.
Men choose to be weak, because power frightens them.
So also do they choose to die.
But I have cheated the Reaper nine times with my physic... and today will mark a tenth.
Farewell, sweet Michael.
Ignorant Michael.
Sleep now.
Allow thyself to slip away.
Wake up, Michael.
Wake up, Michael.
Wake up, Michael!
He is strong.
Kill him.
Are you looking for Tony, love?
- Is he in?
- No, he's been held up.
- I've been waiting for an hour.
- Maybe you can help. I'm looking...
- Is this more historical research?
- What?
There was a bloke here earlier, said he was researching the building.
- What did he look like?
- Tall, dark hair, nice looking.
- What happened to him?
- I don't know, he's long gone.
Seemed a bit disappointed.
Something about being the wrong sort of church.
- Want to leave a message with Tony?
- No, thanks. It 's okay.
Heather?
It 's Michael.
We're alone.
Listen to me, Heather.
Listen to my voice.
Remember your paint set?
Remember the colours?
Now close your eyes, Heather.
Picture that row of colours in your mind.
And the sable brushes, Heather.
Remember how soft they felt?
How smoothly they glided across the paper?
Now... spread the blue paint over the paper.
- She's gone.
- Are you sure?
Yes.
We'd better get on with it.
Quickly.
Quickly.
And under that sky... the greenest field you've ever seen.
Full of yellow buttercups.
Wouldn't it be wonderful to run around in that field?
But you can't.
You're stuck, aren't you, Heather?
I'm afraid.
Afraid of him.
Listen to me, Heather.
I'm gonna count to three.
And on three... all your fears will disappear.
Are you looking for Tony?
No, he's been held up.
I've been waiting for an hour.
I've been waiting for an hour.
You are invincible, Heather.
Nothing can make you afraid.
Push, Heather.
It 's okay.
It 's fine.
Untie me, quick!
Michael!
No, don't move.
Don't move.
Heather?
You are invincible, Heather.
Hurry, Heather's in there.
How do I get in?
Nothing can make you afraid.
Shit!
All your fears will disappear.
Heather!
Heather!
Come here.
I've got you, little one.
I've got you. I've got you.
I can't find my other shoe.
Let daddy sleep.
She's beautiful. They both are.
Filthy habit, that.
I know this cute hypnotist.
I think he could cure me.
You mean that quack from the papers?
Publicity pulls punters.
It also pulls the Home Office.
I'm not allowed to work anymore.
Funny you should mention that.
- I hope this isn't a cheque.
- No such luck.
It 's a recommendation from the highest level... that you and your family be granted permanent residence here.
If you want to stay, of course.
- Thanks, but I won't be needing it.
- No?
I'm taking my family back to the States.
And you?
Well, thanks to you,
I've been promoted.
What about Heather?
Not bad.
Doctors say no permanent damage, physically.
Emotionally, I guess, only time will tell.
So it was Lebourg's blood they were putting into her all along?
Yeah, apparently.
- What was in it for her toy boy?
- Sure you want to know?
- Yeah.
- He was her son.
Anyway, you can see how Heather is yourself.
Hi, Michael.
- You look great!
- I am great.
You want an ice-cream?
- Vanilla?
- Okay.
RUSSIAN ARK
I open my eyes and I see nothing.
I only remember there was some accident.
Everyone ran for safety as best they could.
I just can't remember what happened to me.
How strange. Where am I?
Marie, I must tell you something.
Judging by the clothes, this must be the 1800s.
Where are they rushing to?
What if we are denied entry?
I've never been so frightened!
Don't forget, the girl in white is mine.
Where are you all going?
It's cold! Close the doors!
Quickly!
Move ahead!
I went looking for the right way to go.
Those officers don't know the way.
Can it be that I'm invisible?
Or have I simply gone unnoticed?
Can it be? Has all this been staged for me?
Am I expected to play a role?
What kind of play is this?
Let's hope it's not a tragedy.
What does it all mean?
-Where should we go?
-Maybe here?
No, it's there.
That man in black.... He wanders about, too.
He nods to me but goes away.
Pardon me for speaking before we've been properly introduced.
What city is this?
What city? Well, everyone speaks Russian.
I so hoped this was Chambord during the Directoire period.
-What language are we speaking?
-Russian.
Russian?
How strange! I never knew Russian before.
What are they doing in there?
Shall we enter?
-Where? There?
-Yes, something is going on.
No, I have to find out what on earth I am doing here.
These wanderings about, this knowing Russian....
I want to leave.
Your curiosity is not amusing.
Could all this be theatre?
Farewell!
Our paths must part.
Farewell.
You have answered all my questions.
-Farewell then.
-Where does this door lead to?
What a pity.
We will never meet again.
He was obviously a foreigner.
Why would he be so rude otherwise?
It's best...
not to get involved in this.
Let's not disturb them.
In any case, it's much too late.
Sir, sir! I'm here.
My Russian cicerone! Do you know the way?
-Yes, let's go together.
-This is your country.
Yes, but not my century.
How did I come to be here?
I think I saw Peter the Great.
I hear delight in your voice.
Was it interesting?
Yes, very interesting.
Really.
In Asia, tyrants are adored.
The more terrible the tyrant, the more his memory is cherished.
Alexander the Great, Timur... and your Peter the Great.
You're wrong about Peter.
He taught Russians to enjoy themselves.
A spiral staircase.
Where has everyone disappeared to?
I see. But why?
What's so interesting up there?
You'll see...
Peter ordered his son's execution.
The same man who taught the people to enjoy life. How funny!
I thought you knew where we were going.
He built a European city over a swamp.
He introduced order of the most primitive kind.
-Where are they going?
-But the city is still European!
To a party. But why the back staircase?
They were taught to have fun.
So they go to parties.
And the officer and the lady?
-At the party.
-Where are they?
They've gone to the underworld.
Down, down, down!
And they are no more.
Be careful. The stairs are steep and dark.
Thank you. I can see.
Do you see where we are?
No, I don't know yet.
Sir, be careful!
Don't betray our presence.
No need to remind me.
Do not forget I brought you here.
Please don't get involved in anything.
And you, do not get too close to the actors.
Bend towards me. You are beautiful.
-Do you remember?
-Yes.
Good.
-Why are you pushing me?
-Don't scratch me!
-Why is she pushing me?
-You are pushing, too.
What an impressive orchestra!
They must be Europeans!
No, they're Russian musicians.
No, Europeans!
Italians!
They're Russians, for God's sake!
So?
I say it's good.
Very good!
I need to piss!
I can't hold it in anymore!
No, no, don't, don't....
Ah! Yes, yes.
Sir, sir!
Don't yell!
-Where are you?
-Here. It's only Catherine the Great.
Follow me!
I love the 18th century.
A time of genius and manners.
I would have to agree with you.
-Never contradict me.
-Very well.
Where's the Empress? Gone!
Russia is like a theatre. A theatre.
Careful!
I think I know where we are.
How pretentious they are!
Don't lag behind, sir.
I'm not. I think we're speaking too loudly.
No matter. They're completely deaf.
I'm careful. I won't touch anyone.
Theatre.... What actors!
And those costumes!
Thank you, sirs. Thank you.
They can't see me.
This seems like the Vatican.
Is that where we are?
Those reliefs are painted, are they not?
What naturalism!
Weren't those decorations inspired by Raphael's sketches?
Raphael, yes.
Better than the Vatican.
This is Saint Petersburg.
So they're copies?
Your authorities don't trust your own artists.
Russians are so talented at copying!
Why?
Because you don't have ideas of your own.
Your authorities don't want you to have them.
In fact, they are as lazy as all the rest of you.
Lazy!
There was a painting gallery here.
-On the upper floor.
-With 1 1 1 Italian paintings.
-But not the best masters.
-Not the best.
The tsars were mainly Russophiles.
But sometimes even they dreamed of Italy.
Wasn't the Hermitage created to satisfy those dreams?
-Raphael isn't for you.
-Not for us.
-For Italy.
-Italy.
-It's warm there!
-Warm.
What beauty!
The small Italian gallery....
Who are these people?
Of which milieu are they?
Do you see that vase?
Yes! Empire style is everywhere.
-And those Voronikhine lamps.
-Lamps....
Empire, Empire, Empire!
I have no enthusiasm for it.
That style is too silly.
Don't forget it was born under Bonaparte.
Then it became fashionable here... to the point of becoming the national style... to the detriment of its originality.
We battled Napoleon, not the Empire style.
Who are they? Who are these people?
Petersburgers, of when the city was no longer a capital.
It's better that way.
A capital city should be... an ancient city like Moscow. Not a Chimera.
-Who are these people?
-Should I introduce you?
-Only if it's not impolite.
-No, they are friends.
Oleg Konstantinovich, medical professor.
Lev Mikhailovich, actor.
Shouldn't they rise?
My European friend, he is visiting Russia.
-My pleasure.
-He's European.
Medicine is a fine profession.
I haven't spoken for years.
Aside from my new accomplice.
Such a long time.... What is that odour?
Odour?
A curious odour.
Have you been in Saint Petersburg long?
Yes, for one hour.
-And you came straight here?
-I had my reasons.
You must love art!
Are you interested in beauty or just its representation?
No, Marquis. We're here to rest.
"Marquis"?
How do you rest?
Today, we've come together.
It smells of formaldehyde.
Formaldehyde.
Marquis, I'll show you a splendid painting.
These men are emitting a very strange odour.
Marquis, look at
The Birth of John the Baptist.
The Marquis smells of formaldehyde.
Is he alive?
No, it's you.
I know this painting.
I saw it on my last visit here.
It comes from Paris, from the Crozat collection.
Catherine II acquired it in 1 772.
One of the earliest pieces of the Hermitage collection.
Such information is for specialists.
For us, detail is more interesting.
Look closely here.
A chicken and a cat are in the foreground.
They are symbolic figures.
The chicken represents greed, avarice... the cat, cynicism and cruelty.
Cynicism and cruelty.... The cat....
They are both calmed by the birth of John.
How interesting.
Why is he dressed like that?
Cleopatra, for example....
What do you know of her?
Massimo Stanzione....
Cleopatra is on the same wall...
as The Circumcision of Christ by the pious Lodovico Cardi.
-What bothers you?
-Bothers me?
Right next to Saint Cecilia?
Can you imagine!
By Carlo Dolci!
And next to Eastern Still Life!
-Why does that bother you?
-Don't argue, Oleg.
As a Catholic, that shocks me.
What do you think of Wagner?
Who is Wagner?
Oleg, he doesn't know Wagner!
Wagner is that child who behaved badly... with my best friend, Meyerbeer.
I have never listened to Wagner.
-Broaden your horizons!
-That doctor is so insistent!
-But I'm not sick!
-We wish you much success.
Sir, why are they badly dressed?
My friends, how could I think...
that you would get along so badly?
I'll tell you one day.
I'm in a strange situation.
Why quarrel with everyone?
If you do, we will never discover why we are here.
Such clothing kills a man's creative essence!
Why do you find it necessary to embrace European culture?
For what reason?
Why borrow also Europe's mistakes?
My God! What is all this?
Mother!
Canova!
What an elevated approach to art!
What feel for the material!
How wonderful!
He is a true heir to the masters of antiquity!
Canova almost married my mother.
Was your mother a sculptress?
Yes. In Rome.
In Rome? Your mother, a sculptress....
In this Canova collection, there are even sculptures...
that Tsar Alexander bought from the wife....
Of Napoleon?
Yes.
It was 1815, I was at the Congress of Vienna.
What were you doing there?
-I was a diplomat.
-A diplomat?
This collection was the object of a harsh dispute.
Look where we are now!
Is this a dream?
Maybe, maybe.
I don't know about you, but I'm wide awake!
It's amazing how well I speak Russian!
Yes, quite well.
Who was that small man?
Wasn't that Pushkin?
-Good day.
-Good day.
Is that your great poet? Your beloved one?
I read him in French. Nothing special.
Sir.
My God, how touchy you are!
Pardon me!
I'm sorry if I've offended your nationalist sympathy.
What is that, nationalist sympathy?
What's that there?
-Please....
-Who is that?
Please don't rush.
All alone, without an escort?
It would be wiser not to talk to that lady.
Don't bother her.
Let's move along.
Excuse me, madam, have you lost your guide?
Thank you for your concern.
I know everything here.
Of course. Do you work here?
Not at all. I'm here to admire the works of the old masters.
Would you accompany me into the next salon?
To see the Flemish masters?
With pleasure. Your slender fingers see all.
-1 40 paces, straight ahead.
-1 40, is that so?
How many are left?
Watch your step.
-One cannot be so intrusive, I told you.
-It's not the right time for this.
It's all your fault.
-You are compromising me!
-Oh, don't.
How dare you! Quiet!
-We're here.
-Yes.
Can we go closer to that painting?
Would you like me to tell you about it?
The Virgin with Partridges by van Dyck.
Catherine II acquired it.
Tell me about this painting.
Please, tell me.
See the calm and serenity around the Madonna and Joseph.
-Joseph, yes.
-God protects them.
There is no doubt about his unseen presence.
The apple tree represents life.
Sunflowers stand for piety.
On the upper right, partridges symbolise frivolity.
-They're flying away.
-Partridges....
Angels dance and play.
So many other symbols that we can only guess about.
Sir, leave her. She's an angel.
Why have you gone quiet?
The partridges, the children, the Madonna....
Thank you, madam. Thank you.
I highly value your opinion on the works of van Dyck.
You'll definitely be interested in another painting.
Be very careful!
A Rubens.
Sir, do not disturb me!
The Feast in the House of Simon the Pharisee.
The Pharisee....
I don't see it.
Where is it?
Thirty-six, thirty-five....
No, that painting isn't here.
Not part of the Tsar's collection.
Yes, it's here.
That particular Rubens is not here!
Yes, it was from Lord Walpole's collection...
like The Virgin with Partridges.
But that Rubens isn't on exhibit.
But it's here.
-Where are you?
-What a wonderful scent!
The scent of oils....
Sir, let's leave here now.
No, let's stay a while.
What wonderful paintings!
What are those men counting?
You were right. I found it.
Let's take a closer look.
There it is.
We're almost there.
Face the painting directly.
There it is.
Yes, there it is.
-Something to say about Rubens?
-Van Dyck.
Rubens considered van Dyck to be his best pupil.
You know, there was a time when all these paintings... were placed much higher and much closer to one another.
The Tsar himself supervised how they were hung. Did you know this?
-Who are you?
-I'm a sailor.
-Insignias.
-Yes, the Navy.
The Tsar visited his collection every morning.
He personally saved all this... during the fire.
-Which fire?
-In 18....
So you are asking me?
Enough, let's go.
It's time for me to go.
May I accompany you?
What a pity.
I must ask you to leave.
The museum is closing.
Please see yourself to the exit.
Quiet. Close the door.
The museum is closing.
-How was my scene?
-I wasn't impressed.
I was joking.
Joking....
-Do you hear music?
-I hear something.
Russian music makes me break out in hives.
That has nothing to do with the music.
Why do you look at me like that?
-Rags.... A dog....
-Rags.... A dog....
-Eternal people....
-Eternal people....
Live and go on living.
-You'll outlive them all.
-Eternal people....
What are you doing? Eavesdropping?
Are you interested in painting?
What nice little hands!
Stay away from me!
Amen. Amen.
-Beautiful, isn't it?
-Absolutely.
-Are you Catholic?
-No, I'm not Catholic.
Why do you ask?
It seemed to me that you were deep in thought... while admiring the images of the founders of our church.
I don't know. I wasn't thinking about that.
You were not....
Do you know that those are the apostles Peter and Paul?
Yes, that's what I heard.
That's what you heard. And so?
I looked at them because I like them.
You like them....
-One day, all men...
-All men....
-...will become like them.
-Really?
How can you know what will become of people...
if you don't know the Scriptures?
Why aren't you saying anything?
Look at their hands.
The hands are beautiful. And so?
How can you know what will become of people...
if you don't know the Scriptures?
For you, they're just two dusty old men.
-Just flesh.
-They're covered with dust... from their long road to appear in this painting.
-What happened?
-They are good and wise.
How can you know their character... if you have not read the Gospels?
How can you know all that?
Sir, why are you frightening him?
He was already afraid.
He's not afraid.
These people are never afraid.
Leave him alone.
Better to appreciate the scent of the paintings.
-It smells good.
-Very good.
You need not fear.
So strange to hear those words.
Now I understand. We're in the gallery.
Yes...
I understand.
We're in the Tsar's gallery... near the portrait of a medieval fanatic.
Where have we wandered to?
That music was good, after all.
Who was the composer?
-Glinka.
-Who is he? A German?
A Russian.
No, he's German.
All composers are German.
All composers are German?
EI Greco.
Very nice.
Looks like a Rembrandt.
EI Greco.... Dust from the roads.
What dust from the roads?
Nice, very nice.
-Something you don't like?
-Not at all.
-It's nice, very nice.
-Nice....
More flesh.... Very nice.
These are nice paintings.
Nice paintings....
They're getting better and better.
There's an angel.
Pardon me for addressing you without an introduction.
To whom was that directed?
Do tell.
-I'm speaking to the painting.
-You are speaking to the painting?
How interesting!
-I must speak my mind.
-Speak your mind?
And so you talk to the painting.
Would you like to try?
Must I try? Very well.
-Like that.
-Like this?
Now, like this.
Now a turn.
Sometimes I prefer speaking to myself.
This painting and I... we have a secret.
Really?
-Yes.
-Now it's over.
That's all, gentlemen. Good-bye!
Where are you going, madam?
She's offended. She has left.
Hi!
Good-bye!
Farewell, gentleman!
How charming!
She's offended. But so charming!
Where has she gone?
Marble... a white stone... very white.
Rather cold, isn't it?
When you first came here, it must have been disastrous.
That was just after the fire.
I have been here before, but it's as if I have not.
What luxury!
What is that?
It's under the Convention that everything was devastated.
You don't know
20th-century Russian history.
Our Convention lasted 80 years.
A real revolution.... Very sad.
What kind of system is there now?
A republic?
I don't know.
I have never believed that a republic was suitable... for a country as large as Russia.
You Europeans are democrats who mourn the monarchy.
-You are French, is that it?
-Who are you?
Excuse us, we're lost.
-Please be on your way.
-Let us live! Let us live!
-Remaining here is forbidden!
-Help us, please.
Who forbids it? What is forbidden?
What language! Everything is forbidden!
It's better not to argue.
We're going, we're going.
I know where we can hide.
I suddenly feel afraid.
I don't like military uniforms.
-Not that door, sir!
-But I like it.
-Such a beautiful door!
-No, not that one!
Why is it so cold?
I told you not to enter.
What cold! Frames.... But where are....
Where are the canvases?
Let's go back, I beg you.
-Who's there?
-It's me.
-Why have you come here?
-I don't know. I simply entered.
-Come closer.
-I'm coming.
Maybe you need help, kind sir.
Who is the "kind sir"?
Me.... You....
Not here, not there.
There is no one.
Only coffins and corpses. Come and see.
-I'm coming.
-That's my coffin.
-Your coffin?
-Yes, I made it myself.
Why that strange tone, kind sir?
Why coffins in the Hermitage?
"Kind sir"!
-It's my coffin.
-Yes, it is yours.
-He looks well-fed!
-But where are the corpses?
Why do you ask "where"?
Don't step on the corpses.
He looks well-fed!
You stepped on the corpses!
-What happened?
-The war.
Which war? Against whom?
-Against Germany.
-What is Germany?
The unified state of the Germans.
In the 20th century,
Russia was at war with Germany.
The Germans surrounded the city.
But the city did not surrender.
More than 1 million dead.
-More than 1 million?
-Yes.
That's a high price to pay. Very high.
Saint Petersburg and the Hermitage paid dearly.
In Russia, it is said that freedom knows no price.
A very high price.
But maybe not.
But it has already been paid.
I was wrong, by the way... when I criticised your tsars... for all this beauty and opulence.
Even if they all were... tyrants.
Quieter, please.
But it is beautiful, isn't it?
What do you see? Who is it?
Maybe Catherine II, but I'm not certain.
Nothing could be less certain.
That's enough! Lisa, take away the children.
Don't go too near to her.
If it is Catherine, she has a sixth sense....
Like this.
Lower, lower!
That will be all.
The candles, the candles.
It's stuffy in here.
-There.
-No, I won't let you.
That's it.
But it's cold outside.
That's it.
Sir!
Where are you?
I hear your footsteps. Where are you?
Mortals must not chase royalty.
You won't catch up anyway.
I hear your footsteps.
I hear them.
Sir, what are you doing? It's cold!
-Come this way.
-Yes, it's cold.
-She disappeared.
-I know.
-She disappeared again.
-Move aside.
-Do you know where to go?
-Help us. Come.
Let us through. We are allowed.
Where is the door? Where is it?
Greetings!
Don't be shy. Come. We will not stay long.
Thank you very much.
A new hairstyle is necessary.
What beautiful hair you have! Those curls!
Tea! Would you like tea?
I don't either, but they insist.
Where is the tea?
We're in a hurry. Where is it?
-I know I'm beautiful.
-Too beautiful.
What do you want me to say?
-Come on!
-I have nothing to say!
What is that?
-Did you write this book?
-Not me. He did.
Neither he nor I. But he will dedicate it.
Follow me.
Sir, what are you looking at?
Shall we continue?
What do I see? Nothing for the moment.
Some people are obviously waiting for something.
Let's proceed with caution.
These madmen could eat you.
They liked your hair.
Of course, good writers always have beautiful hair.
-Be more careful and quiet now.
-I'm following you.
-Close the door quickly.
-It's done.
When I was last received here at the Winter Palace... it was being renovated after the terrible fire.
-The parquet doesn't creak.
-It doesn't creak....
-The ambassador of Persia!
-Excuse us for being late.
Sir, let's go.
The ambassador of His Highness the Shah...
Prince Khozrev-Mirza... the son of the future Shah, with his entourage.
-Do you know what is happening?
-Not yet.
We are witnesses.
Nicholas I received an apology from the Persian emissaries... regarding the murder of Russian diplomats.
Griboedov was one, I think.
How interesting.
Are you able to see?
What uniforms!
Luxury, empire...
power....
Look over there. Higher.
Can you see?
Yes, I see now!
One must not trust this world. You are right.
Beware, court officials are cunning.
Some of them are mediums.
They could sense your presence.
Thank you for your advice.
We Gemini are curious by nature.
I'll move ahead.
Maybe I'll meet old acquaintances.
Good luck. I'll find you later.
Mighty Sovereign Emperor!
The peaceful nature of Persia and the sacred union that exists... among His Majesty and the Shah were both upset by evil.
Under its power, a frenzied Tehran crowd... committed unheard-of acts of evil.
The resulting victim was the Russian mission.
The honest heart of Fetkh-Ali-Shah... was horrified by the idea that a handful of wrongdoers... might destroy our peace and union.
His Majesty the Shah has sent me, his grandson... to request that you, Sovereign... erase from memory this event.
Let the world know that, despite this terrible event... two wise monarchs, with their infinite wisdom... speak openly and vanquish all suspicion.
With the greatest joy, I stand before you...
Your Imperial Majesty.
I carry out my grandfather's will... that we strengthen peace... between our two peoples.
His Imperial Majesty... commands me to assure Your Excellence... of his pleasure at hearing your explanation... as well as the righteous plea... of your sovereign.
I've been observing you. Who let you enter?
-You have no business here.
-That's correct.
Then you must leave at once.
Off you go, sir! Away!
-I had no intention of staying.
-Away!
This ceremony will continue for a few more hours still.
As a former diplomat, I'm aware of that.
A terrible boredom will set in. Terrible!
Leave me alone!
-And what is that?
-What did you say?
I adore luxury and regal splendour.
Stasov wasn't a bad architect.
He loved discipline, but left space for breathing.
We cannot stay here.
The ceremony will finish.
Then they will all come in.
My God!
Sevres porcelain, my weakness!
-Beautiful.
-Yes, yes!
-Inimitable!
-Beautiful.
This is the cameo service?
Yes, it is.
Not so close, please.
What gold!
Sir, it's awkward setting the table with you here.
You can admire it later when you are seated.
Please do go away.
What pure tones!
The blue and gold are enchanting.
And the wine-sediment colour!
AIways such marvellous cooks here in the Winter Palace.
Do you recall the taste of food?
No, I have forgotten.
You've forgotten....
Visit the other salons while waiting for the dinner bell.
-That blue!
-Please, sir.
There's dancing. Come on.
Let's leave here.
-We're being chased away.
-Chased away....
It's so dark here.
Heavens!
I see you have never seen a tsar... nor grand princes in all their magnificence.
-Monarchy is not eternal.
-As if I didn't know....
Don't I have the right to dream a little?
We are free, you and I. Dream away.
There's someone here. Do you hear voices?
Sir, don't you hear them?
No, I don't hear anything.
Look, someone is moving there.
Where?
Mr. Orbeli, I don't understand.
What has upset you so?
You and my father know:
No insect can harm this throne.
-It's made of silver and treated oak.
-It's not the throne.
I'm very worried.
See that velour from Lyons.
It's completely worn out.
-We'll restore it. Be patient.
-You don't have the time.
You're right, Boris.
We don't have time either.
You won't ever see him again.
Speak!
He's your son.
What difficulty are they having?
They seem uncomfortable with each other.
What do you expect?
You descend from the heavens... and no longer know how to behave.
Your son is Hermitage director.
Like you and I before him.
The wars ahead.... Terrible wars.
But we managed to preserve all this through the catastrophes.
I can't hear anymore.
And you?
Yes, I hear. But not very clearly.
What are they saying?
The elder Piotrovsky is asking...
whether the director's telephone is still under surveillance.
His son tells him, "Forget that."
"I would prefer telling you about the Hermitage cats."
"They are still here...."
There are so many people that I wasn't able to help.
Ten years have passed.
You know what I'm referring to.
But everyone speaks well of you.
Your books are still in print.
Those of Mr. Orbeli, too.
That's particularly admirable.
The dead weep with joy when their books are reprinted.
Especially 37 years later, Mikhail.
Is something still troubling you?
Is it the authorities?
They want acorns from oak trees.
They are not interested in knowing how to nurture the tree of culture.
But it will be their doom if the tree falls.
Then there will be nothing left.
Can't they understand that?
Mr. Orbeli, what awaits us?
-I'm coming!
-Speak!
-Listen, Mikhail....
-Let him go.
You're completely alone.
They won't tell him anything.
I know, ask me!
I am asking you....
Everyone can see the future... but no one remembers the past.
Look how handsome they are!
Such fine young men!
Beautiful uniforms, even if I don't like the military.
You didn't answer my question.
Nothing, you know nothing.
Sir! Wait!
He doesn't hear me.
I must apologise.
They said other things.
I could hardly hear them.
I made it all up, about Orbeli....
About Piotrovsky, too.
-Only God can judge you.
-I made it all up.
We are free, you and I. You said it yourself!
Please, don't run.
Run! I can't keep up with you.
Little birds.
Children!
Anastasia, where are you going?
They are... so light!
You're always watching me.
I have a bad feeling.
Don't be alarmed.
Pray. And I shall pray for you.
Did you hear that?
-Did you hear shots?
-Calm down. God is with you.
I think someone is following us.
Calm down, Alexandra.
If only Alexis could run....
Doctors are good for nothing.
There is no hope.
It's my fault.
Children!
Children, behave yourselves!
Sorry, excuse us.
Come here, Anastasia. Where were you?
I looked for you all morning.
We were playing.
Let's go.
Where is Alexis?
-Thank you, I can manage.
-Of course.
-Are you in pain?
-I'm fine, Mother.
Move your chair forward.
You are late for tea.
Forgive me.
What do you think? Shall we forgive her?
Anastasia won't do it again.
It looks like it's not your fault.
Good-bye.
Fly away, my little angels!
And here's their cage.
They're all here, of course.
There haven't been so many guests for a long time.
Good evening.
Look at that strange fellow.
But...
where has my European gone?
Where is he?
There he is!
He doesn't see me.
I should go up to him.
Otherwise he will be offended.
Sir! He can't hear me.
But I'll see him later.
Wouldn't it be nice to jump about like that?
You know...
Aristarkh Konstantinovich is being sent to Africa.
What a tiger! He could eat anyone!
Your mother has trained the servants well.
Don't be shy! You are doing very well.
The most important for the mazurka is....
You are doing great.
Thank you.
Saint Petersburg has the best balls in Europe.
Everyone is so easygoing.
Like one big family.
There must be over 3,000 people.
Maybe less.
I've forgotten everything!
I dance so poorly! I've forgotten everything!
But it's all coming back to me!
Good, very good!
Bravo! More! More!
Where were you? I lost you.
I'm here.
I lost you.
Lost....
I'm sad.
Let's go.
To where?
Where? Forward.
Forward....
What will we find over there?
Over there? I don't know.
I'm staying.
Farewell, Europe.
It's over.
You might say I grew up here.
But I'm not quite myself.
It's as if I were in someone else's house.
Listen up! Look here!
Poor man, your lady has gone away!
-Flown away like a bird!
-Gone....
In a flash!
Shall we dine together?
I'll wait downstairs. Bring up the coach.
Have our coats brought up.
And don't lose them!
When we return to Kursk, we must organise a ball.
Just before Lent, for example.
I think we should invite your nephew as well as Varenka. Let him see.
Nathalie!
It feels like we're floating.
It seems all this is but a dream.
But you have found her!
Nothing has happened!
Custine!
Let me pass!
Sir, sir....
It's a pity you're not here with me.
You would understand everything.
Look.
The sea is all around.
We are destined to sail forever.
To live forever.
All right ! Let her go !
It floats
Not bad, uh ?
It's fantastic
Can I get on ?
You paid for her
I'm the one who has to ask permission to board
Go ahead
Here you go
Frank
No
I'll take one of these
To Frank Morrison for building us the most beautiful boat in the water
Thank you ! Thank you !
That boat was the bargain of the century
I made a price, kept the price
And if you build any more at that price you'll go out of business
Theresa,
I should explain to you my theory of noble failure
But Danny's got a game
See you
So how come your boyfriend's not coming with you?
Danny said he wouldn't play if he saw Rick in the stands
He's really got it in for the guy, doesn't he?
Coach ! Coach !
How are you?
Hey, Frank, how's it going ?
Where's Dan ?
He isn't here
Why not?
I asked him to stay, but he chose to leave
I don't know where he went yeah
This is
Frank Morrison
Oh, really?
What is that Danny?
Okay, we'll be there
He's at the police station
Mom ! Dad !
I can't believe you would stow away in some complete stranger's car
Where did you think you were going ?
No... Anywhere, What difference does it make?
Christ, Danny, what are you thinking ?
What's the big deal ?
I'm sorry, okay?
I just didn't feel like playing today, so I booked
Mr. and Mrs. Morrison
Please come in
Wait here
The first time we picked him up, it was for breaking windows
Danny insisted that we had the wrong kid
He wanted to hire a lawyer, we remember
That was two years ago after you guys separated
Six months later we got him in here for truancy
That was right after - Right after we got our divorce, yes
All this acting out is
Danny's way of trying to get us back together
Look we've logged a lot of hours a lot of counsellors
Clearly, it hasn't done us any good
Any idea what set him off this time?
Yes, I'm sure it's because
I'm getting remarried
Oh, boy who's the lucky guy?
Rick Barnes
I know Rick
Of course, you do
Everybody does
Congratulations then
Well, they do, honey
Your mom's getting married
I know you don't like it I get it
But you're not going to use it as an excuse to get wild
Okay, Dad
No, I'm not kidding,
Danny
Your mother's got a right to move on with her life
I think you ought to give this guy a break
What do you think?
Dad, do you ever wish that things could be like they were?
Well, Danny, maybe you don't remember,
But things weren't all that great
I remember you were home every day
Yeah, I know
The truth is, your mother and I tried hard to make it work out but we were arguing all the time and frankly
I didn't think I was doing you any favours by sticking around
Guess what?
The mast is up on the big boat
So we're still going sailing Saturday?
Yeah, you bet
Great
See you Saturday
Saturday
Frank, will you hold on for a second ?
I'm sorry, Mom
It's okay, sweetheart
I love you
I love you, too
Bye, Dad
All right, so he said that he would give Rick a break
At least it's something
Yeah, cool, thank you
Your're still taking him sailing on Saturday?
Yeah, why?
It's just that Danny takes his cues from you
And I thought that maybe if you asked Rick to go sailing with you guys
Jesus Susan I mean, giving him a pep talk is one thing
But taking your fiance sailing with us?
Come on ! Jeez !
I'm sorry
I shouldn't have asked
Damn it
You okay?
Yeah, I'm okay
Susan asked me to take
Rick sailing with us this weekend
So Danny and he can bond
Maybe it's a good idea
What ?
Danny needs to accept the fact that his mom is getting remarried
And you're going to have to accept it too, Frank
I have no problem accepting it
I don't want to hang out with the guy, that's all
So what really bothers you about sailing with Rick?
You afraid that Danny might get to like him?
Maybe I don't want him bonding with him
Maybe I don't want him to have a new dad
Remember my friend,
His ex-wife ran away with Keith Barrel, the football player ?
We'll his kid admired the guy so much
That he took his name
And then eventually stopped seeing his dad altogether
Come on, Frank, Danny loves you. You're his Dad
Diane, these things happen
And Rick Barnes
Ever since he got in town, everyone's just falling all over him just cause he's loaded
He's got more than just money, Frank
Yeah, what?
According to everyone, he's a very nice guy
Well, I'm a nice guy, too but no one's falling all over -Yes, you are
I'm just a boat builder
A poor boat builder at that
All right, it's just like a car, okay?
You turn left to go left, and right to go
Port
No, that's left
Right, right, right
And that's starboard
I know what you mean
Maybe we should stick to lefts and rights
That way
That I understand
I'm impressed, Danny
You know a lot about boats, man
You know, my Dad and I, we spend a lot of time out here
I can see why,
It's beautiful
Thanks for including me today, I'm having fun
No problem
There are so many beautiful places in the world
How did you end up here?
I invested in this pharmaceutical company
They came out with this new blood pressure medicine
Stock just went through the roof
It was like winning the lottery
It gave me a chance to do something different with my life
You know, Frank, I'd never try to take your place with him
I just want a shot at being his friend
I tell you what
There are two things you have to remember with a kid
Number one you have to show them that you love them
Number two, give them stuff
You mean bribe him, right?
If you bought him a new baseball g love, you'd be right in with him
Sounds like a plan
Danny ! Ready about !
Pull it in. There you go
See you, Rick
See you later, Dan
Frank, you know the sea
Cliff Resort at Buzzard's Bay?
The dump? Sure
What about it?
Actually
I just bought it
It's beautiful
The idea is to try to turn it into something beautiful
How would you feel about building me some boats?
We're so busy lately
Come on
Frank You would be doing me a favour
I'll think about it
So
Are you maybe feeling a little bit better about your mom marrying Rick, or what?
I guess, yeah
Good
But I'm still not going to the wedding ?
Why is that?
It would just be too weird watching mom get married
You have to go
Cause you're going to break your mother's heart if you don't
You going ?
No, but that's different
We were married
It's different
See? It's too weird for you, too
You're right, you're right
Okay, I tell you what,
I'll go if you go
Deal ?
Deal
Good, we'll make fun of them together
Yeah
Susan sure did hit the jackpot
I'm kidding, Frank
Hey, Dad
Look at you
You are so handsome
I'm doing great, I guess
Wait, I got to show you what Rick got me
I'll be right back
Dad !
It's a Cal Ripken g love
That's great
Everyone please take your seats
The ceremony is about to begin
Danny time to get ready
Hey, folks, look over here
Susan do you take Rick to be your lawfully wedded husband for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health till death do you part?
I do
Rick, do you take Susan to be your lawfully wedded wife for richer, for poorer in sickness and in health, till death do you part?
I do
I now pronounce you husband and wife
You may kiss the bride
You're a trooper
I'm proud of you
Appreciate you coming
Friend of Rick's
Congratulations
Long time no see
Yeah, Ray, we got a lot of catching up to do
I can't wait
Thanks for dressing up
You look beautiful
Thank you
Congratulations
I'm glad you came
Thanks
Who's your buddy?
He's an old business acquaintance
I'm surprised he even showed up
I know, you looked surprised
What do you mean ?
You just looked surprised
Diet Coke and champagne to go
How are you?
You're a friend of Rick's, right?
That's right
Frank Morrison
Ray Coleman
Nice wedding, huh ?
She must know some pretty good tricks to make old Rick settle down
That's my ex-wife Susan
You ex?
You're kidding me
No
So where are you from?
Bay area, California
Came all the way out here for the wedding, huh ?
I had some business in DC
So how long you know
Rick?
We go way back, went to school together
Really?
What about it?
Oh, nothing
He told me that you were in business together, or something
Excuse me, Frank
Catch you later
It really is too bad
What's that, Ray?
You registered
I saw the gift table
Registered at Crate and
Barrel, wow
The dishes, table cloths, soup tureens
You registered for a soup tureen ?
That's what I would've got you if I'd been invited earlier
In fact, I could have been your best man
I appreciate we got some things to discuss here, Ray
But now's not a good time
Are you busy?
What I'm going to do is put you up in a motel for a while outside of town, and
I'll get in touch with you in a couple of days
Why can't I stay here?
You've got plenty of room
That's not a good idea,
Ray
I'm very lucky, Danny
I'm fortunate to have three great men in my life
Who's number one?
You are, sweetheart
You'll always be number one
I'll see you guys later
Where you going ?
I got some shopping to do
All right, well, have fun
Come on, Rick, throw the ball
See you later, sweetheart
Good catch
Come on, you could have had that
I should have had that?
Yeah
You should have had that
My g love, it's not broken in all the way
G love's not broken in yet, all right
Is your arm not broken in yet?
That was practically right to you, Rick
That was practically right to me
My dad would have had that
Who's you dad,
Shaquille O'Neal ?
He used to be captain of his baseball team
He's great all sports
You know, your dad is going to be working for me
I hired him to build me some boats
Did he tell you that?
No, he didn't
If your dad's such a great baseball player, how come he never taught you how to throw a baseball ?
I can throw the ball
Then why are you standing with your feet like this and putting the ball everywhere where I'm not?
When you throw a baseball, you point your foot to somebody so the ball goes to them
Just throw the ball
I'm going to throw the ball
But I don't want to run or jump for the ball
I want the ball to come to me
Aim and concentrate
Take it easy !
I am taking it easy
How the hell are you supposed to learn anything out here?
Come on, turn the ball loose
You throw like shit
You know, Rick, I don't want to play anymore
Suit yourself. Bring the g loves in when you're done
Don't ask me to play again if you're going to be a brat !
You want about a half inch up
Just trim it off like that
All your strokes are even and forward like so, right?
And you use the other side of the brush, as well
This is the important part, make sure that the edges don't dry
Because then you'll get distortion
No open spots
You ready to try it?
What if I mess up?
That's a very interesting question, 'cause that's what I asked my dad
And that's what he asked his father
So do you know what your great grandfather told your grandfather who told your father who's telling you now?
What?
That's why God invented sandpaper
So this is okay?
Yeah, it's very good
So what happened with that whole window thing ?
I told Mom it was an accident
Yeah, well, tell me it was an accident
I just got mad, okay?
Why, because he had a problem with the way you threw a ball ?
No, he threw it hard and he tried to hurt me
Come on, Danny, was it any harder than a line drive coming at you?
No
Maybe he was just trying to prepare you for a real game or something
Why do you have to work for him, anyway?
Tell him you don't want his money, that you don't need anything from him
I can't do that
Why not?
Because the truth is,
Dan
I love making these wooden boats, but people don't want them anymore
When your grandpa made them, they'd line up from here to Maine
Just to have one
But they want plastic now
It's cheaper, they can afford it
You understand ?
Yeah
I was in the donut shop this morning
You know who I saw?
You know that girl Katie that you like, what's her last name?
Lewis? she was there with a girlfriend
She was talking about you, she said, he's nice or something like that
Since she got her braces off, she's a total babe
I know, and then she said that she thought your dad was a fox
Here you go, Frank
Have a nice day
You too
How's it going ?
Frank Morrison, I met you at Rick's wedding
Jesus, of course !
Ray, right !
You want to sit down ?
Sure
Sorry Frank, yeah
I'm getting really bad with faces
It must be early
Alzheimer's or something
It's been a while since the wedding
I wouldn't worry about it
I was just surprised you're still here
You said something about just being in for the day
Yeah, I decided to stick around, grab myself a little R& R
Tell you what, Frank, now that I've been here for a while
I can see why Rick really fell in love with the place
I'm actually thinking about looking at some real estate myself
No kidding
I kid you not
Well, if you're serious about it, I know a realtor
Sam Jones, he'll hook you up
You know that
I'm noticing ?
I haven't seen any adult bookstores in this town
No kidding
I kid you not
Just the man I wanted to see
I owe you a call
Good to see you
You're a busy man
If you weren't so busy, you wouldn't be getting
Southport's Man of the year award
Yeah, well, it's a slow year, we all know that right?
How's the backhand coming ?
Coming along, want to play tomorrow?
Let me give you a call
Give my best to everybody
I will
Open up, Ray
What the hell were
How did you know
I was in town ?
What are you doing with my wife's ex, Ray?
Having eggs
Why did she leave him?
He was great
Told him
I was thinking about buying some property here
And he offered to find me a realtor
Maybe you and me could be neighbors
I had a good reason for wanting you to stay out of town, Ray
You talk too much
You always have
Maybe I'm not the only one
How do you think
I found you?
When we were on the inside doing our little stretch
We'd all take our best shots at imagining
Where you'd run off to spend our money
You're lucky it was only me who figured it out or you would have had all three of us for wedding guests
What about Tommy and John ?
What about them?
What are you going to send them their share?
So? Don't you want to know how I found you?
Yeah, of course I do,
Ray
I remember this one time you were drunk and telling me how crappy your childhood was
Except for this one summer you spent on the Maryland coast
Where there was clean air and friendly people
I ain't saying you were easy to find
I mean, I only had a general idea of where to look and a lot of times I came this close to just giving it up
But then then you made the papers
You know, I'll tell you something, Ray
You know what I came to hate most about working outside the law?
Having to associate with scumbags
You found yourself a lawyer to get yourself off
Maybe that makes you smarter than me doesn't make you better
I'll call you, Ray
I'm sick of you stalling me, Jack !
I told you, Ray it takes time to put this kind of money together
Name's Rick
It's funny how quick you can forget a name
Rick
Stay out of town, Ray
You don't belong there
Well, I was right, the doctor said pregnant
Baby, I'm so happy
That's so great
Oh, Susan, I bet you it's going to be a boy, too
You want to bet me on that?
What's wrong, honey?
Nothing
I just didn't expect it to happen so soon, that's all
You know how much I wanted to have a baby
I'm happy
I know you do, I do, too
Promise
You just worried about Danny, huh ?
Ya I'm just first married and... Baby, it's hard to handle, You know for kid...
Danny ! Dan, Don't !
Sweetie, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I did not mean it for you to find out this...
Leave me alone, Mom !
Danny?
Danny, can you at least try to be happy for everybody?
No !
Danny, please don't !
Please don't let him ruin this
This is the happiest day of my life
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Just give me two minutes
I'll be right down
Diane, it's me, is my dad there?
I have to talk to him
No, honey, he's not home yet
When is he coming home?
Soon, I guess, Danny, are you okay?
Tell him he's got to come and get me,
I have to talk to him
Who are you talking to?
Take me to my Dad's house. I want to go now
No, this is between us
You and I are going to sit down here and we're going to talk this through, okay?
I know that you're upset, sweetheart, but you have to believe me when I tell you that a baby is not going to change the way
I feel about you
I know, Mom, I'm number one, remember ?
Check out of your room
Meet me out front at seven
Did you get it all ?
Yeah, Ray
I've got it all
All right,
I'll be waiting
About time
What did I miss?
Excuse me guys
I got to go into town for a little while, but it shouldn't take long
Okay, will you wait?
I'll walk you to your car, okay?
We're not through
I'll be right back
How do you think the conversation's going ?
You don't understand
I feel like I've betrayed him, or something
Stop it, will you? You haven't betrayed anybody
He's just upset
He'll get over it
Listen, I'll wrap this thing up as soon as
I can and I'll be home
I love you
Please drive carefully
It looks like there's a storm coming in
It's been a pleasure having you
Mr. Coleman
Come back anytime
See you around
Take care
Put it in the back
Good - bye and good riddance
So where you off to?
Miami Beach
Starting tomorrow
I'm going to be working on my tan and a case of Cuervo
If you ever get fed up here in Frontier land come on down
Miami's got no appeal for me
None whatsoever
I'm going to have a kid
Get the hell out of here
Isn't that great?
You're really going all the way with this
" Leave it to Beaver " thing
Two kids?
Danny's not mine
That's got to be tough, putting up with some other guy's brat
I couldn't do it
I put up with the damn kid because I got no choice you know
I got to make a stop here
Why?
You don't think I had that kind of cash on me did you?
No, I got it stashed up here at a brickworks I own
Comes in handy for stuff, Jesus !
What?
No, it's just that I've never been out here before at night
And I can't see a goddamn thing cause it's pouring
Are you kidding me?
No, I'm not kidding you
You see anything in this shit?
Jesus ! What are you, lost?
Relax, it's around here somewhere. Let me just look at the map, all right?
The map's in here
I got a flight to catch !
Stop bitching at me ! look in the back for the map
Jesus Christ
I don't see no goddamn map
It's in here somewhere
You see it?
This is unbelievable !
Wait till you see what you got back here
What's going on ?
It's Danny, Rick
He ran away
Are you okay?
I'm fine
It's okay, Mr. Barnes
Your wife got a call from Mr. Morrison
Danny showed up over there
Thank God, you want to go get him?
Hold on, Mr. Barnes
There's more
What is it?
He told his father he saw you kill a man
He told his father what?
He claims he was hiding in the back of your Suburban
He says that's where he saw you do it
Susan, what would make
Danny say something like this?
It's obvious,
Rick, it's Danny's way of getting back at us for the baby
We should head down to the station
And we'll be needing the keys to your Suburban
I know what I saw, I'm not making this up
He killed a guy
Danny, are you sure you're not doing this because you're mad at Rick?
Diane, please
Danny, let's go over this again, all right?
Take your time, start from the beginning
Don't leave anything out
Send them in
It's your mother and stepfather
They're going to join us
No Dad, please no
I don't want to see him, Dad
Danny
A already told you, he never said his name
Dad ?
Just answer the question
It's okay
And you say that you heard your stepfather and this man talking about money
They were supposed to be going to get some money
Only, Rick killed him instead
Danny, stop this, please
He said that he loved the baby and that he hated me
Sweetheart, listen, I know that we've hurt you,
But what you're doing isn't fair, it's not right
I'm telling the truth
No, Danny, you're doing what you do when a situation comes along that you can't handle
Look, he knows the truth, he knows what he did and you're just going to sit there and let him get away with it, Dad
Come in
Johnson just called in from the brickworks
Excuse me
So, no charbroiled skeletons?
If a body was incinerated in a kiln like they got over there, it would take a forensic specialist-
I am not wasting any more time or money on this sick kid's bullshit story
David, phone call, line seven
Hold on
Stevens
It's the garage
Okay, go on
There was
No visible evidence at all at the brickworks or, for that matter, in your truck
Keys are at the front desk
You all should go home
Danny, let's go home
I'm not going home with him
Danny, we are going to go home and talk about this okay?
Dad, please don't make me go home
Susan, let him come home with me
No, Frank, every time he has a problem, he comes running to you
I want him to come home now
Dad, don't make me go
Jesus, Danny, knock it off !
Dad ? You don't believe me, either ?
You're asleep right now
This is a dream
You're dreaming that someone's got their hand over your mouth and it's hard to breathe and you can't wake up, can you? can you?
Now, you had a dream about a murder
And it felt like it was real
It's only a nightmare
You don't want every moment of your life to be a big screaming nightmare do you, Danny?
Better wake up
He wants me to pick them up?
Have the port lights come in
I'm expecting them this afternoon
All right, call and make sure
Hey, how you doing ?
Good morning
How are you, Frank?
Rick
You got a hell of a place here
Frank, I just want to let you know I'm not taking what happened last night personally
I just look forward to getting past it
But on to something more positive here, I do have the start- up money for the Seacliff, $50,000
When do you think you could start building the boats?
You know, when I went home last night,
I couldn't even think about sleeping
But here's what I did think about
My son is living with you in your house
And I have absolutely no idea of what kind of man you really are and, honestly, that scares the hell out of me
Well, Frank, you're a good dad, you know
But before you start letting your imagination
Run away with you here,
I'd ask you to remember something
It's true that you may not know me so well, but you do know Danny and he lies, I know that
He lies to his mother his grandmother
His teachers, the police
Just about everybody, but
But what?
He doesn't lie to me
Hard as I tried, I couldn't think of a sing le time
I didn't kill anybody,
Frank probably not, Rick
I'm glad to hear you say that
As long as my son is living with you under your roof,
" probably" isn't good enough
Jesus Christ, Frank, who's this guy, Ray?
What about him?
He's your school chum he's your business acquaintance
The other day I saw him, he was looking for real estate
Ray
Yeah
So now it's Ray
I supposedly killed, is that right?
I tell you, Frank, trying to be a stepfather
To a child that hates your guts, isn't exactly a picnic
I thought you were on my side for this
I'm on Danny's side
Give my best to Diane then, Frank
Right
I just think it's a good idea if he stays with that's all
I'm not having this conversation with you
I know that Rick threatens you-
He threatens me, all right
You're so wrong about him
You don't even know what he's really about
You're the one that
I don't really know anything about anymore,
Frank
Do you think that I so desperately need a man, that I'm going to endanger my own child by marring a-
Danny
What are you doing here?
Come on,
Danny, let's go
No, he's coming home with me
He's scared of the guy
It's not right
What do you get?
Have I ever stopped you from seeing him?
This is not about custody
Danny, please get in my car
If you want to fight me for custody-
I don't want to fight you for custody !
Please don't do this !
Hold on a second, Frank
This is none of your business
What if I make it my business?
Don't !
Frank, don't do this !
I'm sorry, Mike
Dad, that was so cool
Put your seat belt on
That was awesome
Knock it off, Danny
You know what I've just done?
It's called kidnapping
How could it be kidnapping ?
I'm your kid
It just is
It doesn't matter
So you believe me now?
Yeah, yeah
What are we going to do now? I don't know
Dad, watch out !
You never struck me as the kind of guy
Who would exploit the emotional problems of his son to make a play for custody
Sergeant, I know you have a history with my son
I know that's why you're having a hard time with this
But this character,
Ray Coleman he was at the weeding -
When Ray Coleman showed up at the wedding,
Rick Barnes wasn't happy to see him
But there's more they had two different stories about how they met
Maybe Ray Coleman is a little confused
But he wasn't confused
Maybe he'd been drinking, come on now
You can go now
Mr. Morrison
Your ex-wife isn't pressing charges
And, for the time being, neither are we
By the way, I checked with the police in the
Bay Area
No Ray Coleman was reported missing
That's not good enough
Good-bye, Mr. Morrison
Jack, look, it was not my intention to fight for custody
But now I have no choice, do I ?
Right !
Okay, all right, I'll see you there at 10. Thanks
That was Berman
He's tough, man
But he's good, he's the one who handled the whole divorce thing
Just have to figure out
What?
I'm sorry, Frank
I can't believe that you have actually managed to convince yourself that this man -This man ?
This man who only wanted to help-This man ?
Do you want me to ignore the fact that my son is living with a killer ? is that what you want?
This fantasy of yours, it sure does give you a good excuse, doesn't it?
For what? Excuse for what?
An excuse to hold on to your old life
I know Danny's your son,
And I would never ask you to choose between us
But I won't hang around while you take Susan on in some insane custody battle
Diane, I have never failed Danny, ever
And I can't fail him now not when it counts
I'm sorry
I'm sorry too, Frank
But I can't do this
Rick, sweetheart will you please hurry up?
I don't want to be late for this
Calm down will you?
Moms always win these things, right?
No, it's never a sure thing, Rick
You all right?
I still can't believe this is happening
You know, Susan ever since Frank hit us with this custody thing, there's something I'd like to talk to you about
About what?
Well, I feel like I've done
Everything I can but stand on my head with
Danny's concern
And he won't give me a break. There's no way-
I know and I'm sorry sweet pea
There's nothing for you to be sorry about
It's been hard on everybody
But maybe if Danny went off to live with Frank for a little while
That wouldn't be the worse thing in the world for everybody
What?
I'm just trying to think about what would be best for everyone, dear
Rick
Susan things get really tense when Danny's around and the doctor said if you get stressed out, you could lose the baby
I don't give a damn what the doctor said,
Danny's my son
It's bad enough he hardly talks to me anymore
If he goes to live with Frank
I'd be lucky if I ever see him again
Rick, we talked about this
I'm sorry
Danny's not going to go anywhere,
I promise you that, okay?
Dan, listen up
Whatever the judge decides today
I want you to know that your mother loves you remember that
I'll see you there
All right
Love you
Love you, too
I'm ready to go
Mom?
She's bringing the car around,
Danny She can't hear you
I'm not afraid of you
I don't give a damn if you're afraid of me or not
What I want to know is, do I need to be afraid of you
Danny?
What do you mean ?
This custody hearing thing that you have us all going to today if we come home without you
Dan that's going to upset your mom and like I said to you
I can't allow that to happen
Now, I know that you love your dad very much
How would you feel if something happened to him?
Look, I'll do whatever you want
Just, please, leave them alone
I want both parties to know
That a child of
Danny's age is old enough to have a voice in determining which parent he would be better off living with
Now, that being said call your witness
Mr. Berman
Thank you
Your honour, we'd like to call
Danny Morrison to the stand
Hello, Danny
Danny Morrison ?
Yes, sir
How old are you?
I'm 12, sir
Twelve, so we can't swear you in
But it is your word of honour when you sit in that witness box do you understand that?
Yes, sir
Good, then let's get to work
Counsellor
Thank you, Your honour
Hello, Danny
I'm going to ask you a few questions you all right with that?
All right, let's go back to the evening of October 18th
That was the night your mother cane home from the doctor with some news just tell what happened
I found out that my mom was going to have a baby
Yeah ? How did you handle that?
I guess I kind of freaked
Go on
After that, I wanted to go and see my dad
How come?
Cause I felt like I needed to talk things over with him
You and your dad are pretty close then ?
Yes, sir
All right, Danny, just take your time and tell us what happened next
Well, I hid in the back of Rick's truck cause he was going into town, and that's near where my dad lives
And then
And then he stopped at this office building and
I jumped out
What?
I ran to my dad's house,
And I made up this story about seeing him kill some guy
Danny, what are you doing ? Tell them the truth
This is the truth, Dad
Did he threaten you?
You keep this up
Mr. Morrison,
I will have you removed from this courtroom
This is not how
Frank sit down
Let me ask you something, Danny
Do you want to give it another try with your mom and Rick
Or do you think you'd be better off living with your dad ?
I'd like to stay with my mom and Rick
Look
Frank
I know what happened today
I'm glad somebody does. Drink?
I'm not going to drink with you
Frank
Too bad
You ought to go home
Okay
Frank
Danny lied
Again
But at least he's not living under the same roof with a killer
I'll drink to that
No, this is how you lost Danny the first time
Come on
Frank let's go home
That's the best offer
I've had in a while
You get fresh
Frank
I'll make it real
It's my day to see him
Susan
Yeah, I know it is
What?
I tried talking to him but he just went racing out
I'm sure he just feels badly about lying to you
I'm sure it'll be okay
I'm sorry
I have to go,
But I promise I'll tell him to call you
Cheeseburger and french fries
Can I get you anything to drink?
Diet Coke
Sounds good
Took me 15 years to get one of these. How long you been here?
Been here about two years but I being here for a long time
Two years
At the rate you're going, we'll be naming the town after you
Thank you very much, I appreciate it. Thank you
I'd just like to say thank you to the men and women of Southport
For recognizing me with this honour, I feel flattered to be included
Hey, Dan
Hey, Dad
You're a hard man to get a hold of lately
What are you doing here?
What is this about,
Frank?
I'm just trying to talk to my son
Ten o'clock at night?
It's not your business
Frank, do you really think
That showing up here drunk in front of your son
What is that supposed to make him want to spend more time around you?
Are you crazy
Frank?
What are you doing ?
Screw you, Patterson !
Just because this asshole's got some money to spread around you don't give a shit who he is !
Dad why don't you just go home?
Dad you dropped your wallet
Dad wait up
Sorry Danny I shouldn't have come here
You dropped your wallet
That's not my wallet, Dan
Dad, you have to stop making trouble for him
So, Dad, please just lay off, okay?
How are you?
What do you want?
Nothing much
Just five bucks
You wouldn't happen to have $5 you could lend your old step dad would you, Dan ?
No
You don't?
Maybe we should check your wallet
Where's your wallet,
Danny?
I don't know
You don't know?
Don't you think you should probably start looking for it?
I really hope you didn't lose that, Dan
Start looking for it
I didn't tell him anything, Rick
Maybe you think I've just been fooling around with you is that it, Danny?
All I did was say I was sorry for not being home-
Bullshit !
I swear to God, that's all I said
You're a little fucking liar, aren't you, Danny?
I'm telling the truth, Rick
I hope so
Does Ray Coleman sound familiar to you?
Ray Coleman ? That name doesn't sound familiar
Would you check your register ?
Because my sister's really worried about him
Here we go, Ray Coleman
Checked in on
September the 8th and checked out on - check the 18th
Yeah, October 18th
How about a telephone number, address?
I could check his bill
Yeah, yeah
Here we go, C, Coleman
These are just the local calls
What's this?
Pizza Hut
How about this?
He called this a lot
Yeah, he liked the ladies
You patty?
Who are you?
A friend of Ray's
Ray?
Coleman
That shit owes me money
Join the club
Can I talk to you?
I didn't know Ray that well, we were just killing time
You know how it is
Yeah, I can't believe this guy
He never even told you where he was from?
No
What did you guys talk about?
We didn't do that much talking
We weren't doing that
We were watching TV
I don't know what Ray likes better to screw or watch basketball
At least he gave me this
I know that lighter
Let me see
Oh, yeah
It was my birthday a couple of weeks ago
I like this lighter
It's not even real
Yeah, but I like the horseshoe thing
Buy it from you
How much ?
I don't know, it's a pretty nice lighter
Cool
If you can just have this dusted for prints
I'm sure we'll find that this Ray Coleman's got a record
And if he does then we know that Rick Barnes will have one, too
A lot of people have handled this lighter
The lab could only manage to lift off one clean set of prints
It turns out they belong to a convicted felon
Her name is Patty Walsh
Prostitution, Drug use
Hey, Frank
I'm glad I ran into you
About last night, we both got a little bit hot under the collar
And I felt terrible about it
Recognize that?
Probably fell out of Ray's pocket when you pulled him from the truck
What are you doing,
Frank?
You touch so much as one hair on my son's head and I swear, as God is my witness that'll be the last thing you ever do in this world
You're the second guy today who's been in here looking for Ray Coleman
You again ?
What do you want?
What basketball team did he root for ?
What are you talking about?
You said that he liked to screw and watch basketball, what team did he root for ?
Chicago
Ray Coleman -Three
Convictions in
Racketeering Case
Oh, God
Is Detective Stevens there?
No, this is
Frank Morrison
When will he be back?
You have an e-mail address there?
Thank you
No, wait, listen
When he gets in, have him check his e-mail
And have him call Frank
Morrison at the boathouse as soon as he gets it
Thank you
As you can see, this venerable building a long time fixture in the
Southport community
Continues to bum
It just keeps ringing,
Mom
It's okay, sweetheart
You know how careful Dad is
I'm sure he's fine
He's fine
No, Mom, Rick said he'd do this !
He said he'd hurt Dad !
He killed the guy, just like I said, and he threatened to kill Dad, too !
Forget it, Mom, you won't believe me, anyway
Danny, what are you talking about?
Danny, we're getting out of here
Mom?
Now
Sweetheart, I didn't hear you come in
Just got back
Danny, you go wait in the car
Where are you going ?
There was a fire at
Frank's place and the boathouse burned down
What?
Danny wants to go and make sure that Frank is okay
You want me to take you?
It's okay
Danny's really upset and
I think it's best if I take him alone, okay?
Stevens
What is this?
Frank Morrison sent it over
Rick Barnes, indicted for extortion bribery attempted murder
His real name is
Jack Pamell
Your reckon the
Chicago Chamber of
Commerce gave him an award, too?
Hello?
Frank Morrison
Susan, it's Frank
Now, listen
You and Danny get out of the house now !
I know I'm in the car with Danny-
I think I better drive
Danny
I'm fine, Rick
Get out of the car, Susan
Mom?
It's okay, sweetheart
I just need to hang on to him till I'm someplace safe
Please don't do this
Please
Mom, are you all right?
Give me the keys
Take me instead, please
You were the best thing that ever happened to me
Run, Danny, run !

Did you lock everything ?
Yeah, did you call the police?
Go ! Run !
Leave him alone !
Mom, get up
Mom, wake up
Mom, please get up
Get up
You're going to sit still, aren't you?
You sure you're going to be okay?
I'll be fine, Mom
We'll follow you to the hospital
Frank, I'm sorry
No, it's okay
I'm sorry about the baby
Mom, I love you
I love you too, sweetheart
Mr. Morrison, hold on
There's really not a whole lot
I can say right now, except
Just say it to him
Danny, I'm sorry
It's all right
Tomorrow marks the one year anniversary since Velez Air Flight 180 exploded and crashed shortly after takeoff from JFK Airport.
It's a disaster that's affected many.
None more so than
Mt Abraham High School, which lost 40 students and four faculty members in the crash.
But it was the events after the crash that has turned this tragic story into something even stranger.
The survivors who managed to get off the plane before it crashed died soon thereafter in a series of mysterious and bizarre accidents.
Now, to some, these deaths are just tragic coincidences, but to others, they're an indication that there are more sinister events taking place.
That's the contention of tonight's guest.
Thank you for joining us this evening.
Thank you for having me.
And I appreciate you using the word sinister.
Most people say supernatural because they think I'm talking about ghosts and witches and stuff like that.
Here's your chance to set the record straight.
Great. Okay.
I believe that there's a sort of force, an unseen malevolent presence... that's all around us every day.
And it determines when we live and die.
And some people call this force the devil, but I think that whole religious thing is... so I prefer to call it
Death itself.
So I'm surrounded by Death?
Absolutely. Absolutely.
Every day, everywhere, all the time.
And that's what I want people to understand... that Death has this grand design that we all fit into.
So when Alex Browning got off that plane and took the other survivors with him, he basically screwed up
Death's plan.
And that's what I'm trying to warn people about.
And the fact that all of the survivors have died is your evidence of this?
Well, it's not so much that the survivors died, but it's the way that they died.
I mean, there were so many weird, seemingly random things about the way they died.
It just didn't make sense.
And that's the proof there's something out there...
Wait, that's not proof.
That is your interpretation of events that can't be proven in order to support your ideas.
Kimberly.
You should be more open-minded...
What happened after that was just coincidence.
May I finish?
Mere coincidence would have one or two of these kids die.
But not all of them including their teachers.
Yes, but people die all the time, so why should this be any different?
It forced people to question these so-called everyday coincidences.
What if they were something more?
What if you could do something about it?
Please, are you listening to yourself? This is crazy.
You're saying we should be on guard every morning when we leave the house?
That's exactly what
I'm saying.
Exactly it.
And in order to survive... the only way to survive is to look beneath the visible world.
Because in the end no one can escape death.
And today may be your day to die.
Okay, I'll call you.
Kimberly, are you sure you've got everything?
Credit card, cell phone, Triple-A card?
Dad, it's Daytona, not Somalia.
Alright. Fix-a-flat, road flares, sunblock, mace?
Condoms, whips, chains.
Just kidding,
Mr. Corman.
Don't worry,
I'll keep an eye on her.
That makes me feel a lot better, thanks.
- Okay.
- Alrighty.
Can we go get the guys?
I'm getting horny.
Go on.
Okay, I'll call you.
Whips and chains.
That's nice.
Whatever, your dad's cool.
Buckle up!
Watch it!
- Oh, easy, Kimmy. First year of driving?
- Sorry.
- Oh my God.
- Fucking freak.
Yo, Dano, shouldn't we help your mum?
Good one, man.
You're hilarious.
You're not getting any of my weed.
Nothing.
Whatever.
What are we going to do in Daytona?
We're going to see lots of honeys there.
We're gonna get drunk, we're gonna smoke this big 'El Gagerero,'
We're gonna have this awesome party...
Pileup! Pileup!
A candlelight vigil to mark the one year anniversary of the crash of Flight 180 will be held at 8:00 P.M. Tonight at the Mt Abraham high school auditorium.
# Highway to hell... #
Oh my God.
- Hello?
- Hey, Kimberly, it's Dad.
- Hey, what's up?
- Your car's leaking transmission fluid.
- So I want you to get it checked right away.
- Okay, yeah.
I'll do that.
I mean it. Take care of it.
- Is that someone coughing?
- Yeah, okay.
I'll take care of it.
I'll talk to you later.
- I love you.
- Bye, honey.
- What did you do?
- Look at those titties!
- Shut up.
- You missed that?!
That's too bad.
That's too bad.
Oh, shit!
Fuck man, there's a cop behind us!
Pull in the right lane now!
Shit.
Seriously, put it out.
- Put that thing out.
- Alright.
Wait, wait, wait!
- Get rid of it.
- Shit.
Hey, it's Kat.
Listen... what the hell?!
Just wait. Not you.
I think we better pull over and check the car, because...
Kimberly, the car is going to be fine.
Your dad's going to be fine, you're going to be fine.
Okay?
Look at that guy.
He's drinking a beer.
Oh, yeah, that's real responsible.
You ever hear of the ozone layer, arsehole?!
# When it comes to this drug shit
I was made to play #
# Don't come around if you ain't got no cocaine to bring... #
What? I'm wearing my seatbelt.
You're gonna bust me, bitch?!
Aaah!
Son of a... bitch.
Fuck!
- Oh my God!
- Watch out!
- Stop!
- Oh my God!
Watch out!
Aaah!
Shaina?
I can't get out of here!
Help me!
Oh, easy, Kimmy.
First year of driving?
Yo, Dano, shouldn't we help your mum?
Good one, man.
You're hilarious.
Pileup! Pileup!
- Oh my God.
- What?
There's going to be a huge accident.
We're all gonna die!
I just saw it.
That's it.
My turn to drive.
- No, I'm serious.
- Kim, what's wrong?
- What are you doing?
- Oh my God.
...of Flight 180 will be held at 8:00 P.M. Tonight at the Mt Abraham high school auditorium.
'Highway to hell.'
'Highway to hell... '
'Highway to hell'?
# I'm on a highway to hell... #
Okay, Kimberly, you're scaring me.
- Green means go, Kimmy.
- Yeah.
Are you out of your friggin' mind?
What the hell are you doing?
What the fuck, Kimberly?
What's this?
Kimberly, you just got to breathe.
Oh, shit, shit.
Five-O's coming. Let's fucking roll.
- What?
- Oh my God.
Do you know how much fucking weed I have on me? Huh?
Okay, Dano, just shut up!
Just stay cool.
Oh, fuck. I'm going to jail.
I'm fucking going to jail.
What's going on here?
I think there's going to be a huge pileup.
I saw it.
There were bodies everywhere.
There were logs...
I saw it.
It just happened.
Alright, miss, I'd like you to please step out of the vehicle.
Just pull over!
I know,
Mummy's hungry, too.
Come on.
Come on!
Oh, fuck this.
I'm going to get this and we're going to go.
Fuck.
What the hell is going on up there?
Excuse me!
Is there any way that we could drive around?
- I have a delivery...
- You need to get back into your vehicles.
- Just move it...
- Now!
That's it!
That's the truck that's going to kill everybody.
You need to stop that truck!
I told you again, you have to calm down!
Why won't you listen to me?!
- Fuck!
- Oh my God.
This is unit 13 requesting medical assistance and backup for a major traffic accident...
Kimberly, what's going on?
No!
No!
Listen, sir, this girl is really freaked out.
In fact, all of them are...
- scared as you can imagine.
- Scared?!
These people are the luckiest sons of bitches on the planet.
Get this guy,
Evan Lewis... yesterday the kid wins the lotto.
Today, some loony bitch blocks traffic and he avoids the worst pileup in years.
I should be so damn 'unlucky.'
Go babysit the rest of them.
I'll be done with Lewis in a minute.
Hey, excuse me...
We're trying to do the best we can.
We're going to get you out of here as soon as possible.
I just think it's a bunch of bullshit.
Listen, I know you've gone over all this with Detective Suby... but would you mind telling me what happened?
It was like I was there.
I knew something bad was going to happen even before it did.
- I just felt wrong, just like...
- Just like what?
Look, I know this sounds crazy but... you guys all heard about Flight 180, right?
The kid who got off the plane?
Well, it happened a year ago, today.
My premonition was just like his.
- What are you talking about?
- Come on.
You must have read about the kid who had a dream about a plane blowing up, so he got all his buddies off the plane and then the thing blew up just like in his dream?
- Yeah.
- But did you hear what happened after?
So a month goes by, right?
Everything seems cool.
But then all the survivors start to die one by one.
'Cause when your number's up, your number's up, right?
You know, some people even say that
Death itself was stalking them, hunting each one down until they were all... dead.
Please.
There was one survivor.
Clear Rivers is in a padded room at the Stonybrook Institution.
Well, that's encouraging.
Okay, you want me to believe that this is true, that this is happening all over again?
I don't know why we're even here.
What do you want from me?
But if I was never meant to pull over, we all should have died in that pileup.
Which means Death could be coming for us.
Yeah, like, what if we're all getting that 'Different Strokes' curse or something?
I think you're all are certifiable.
I can't believe I've been listening to this crap.
Let's go.
Let's go, Tim.
Mrs. Carpenter, please.
Kimberly!
Oh baby!
- Are you okay?
- I'm so sorry.
Shh, shh.
You can all go now.
Thank you for your patience.
Could I ask you something?
Anything.
Did Mum ever have any...
I don't know, weird feelings about anything?
What do you mean?
Like visions or premonitions.
Sweetie, are you sure you're okay?
Dad, I know this sounds crazy, but I'm really scared for the others.
I don't know,
I have this really bad feeling.
What?
It's not over yet.
Jesus Christ!
Shit!
Hey, Evan, it's Tawny.
Sorry I haven't called.
Hey, listen, I heard about your lottery win.
Let's hook up.
Call me.
Yeah.
Hi, Evan, it's Nikki.
We met at Tucker's party last year?
I know it's been awhile, but I've been thinking about you.
I just wanted to say congratulations.
So give me a call.
555-0123. Bye.
You little bastard.
Shit.
Come on.
Come on.
Fuck. Fuck.
Come on!
Come on.
Fuck!
Jesus!
Oh!
Hey, this is Evan.
Leave a message.
If you're looking for Rick,
I don't know where he is, and I don't know when he's coming back. Thanks.
Evan, call me when you get in, you lucky fuck!
Come on! Come on!
Come on!
Aah!
Jesus!
Come on.
Aah!
Shit, I'm lucky.
Aah!
Jesus Christ!
No, Mother, just turn on any station.
Well, I don't know how you missed it, it's been on all day.
Yes, Mother,
Channel 4 is fine.
Okay... here it is!
I got to go, okay?
I got to go!
To recap our top story,
Route 23 was backed up for almost nine hours today.
A record-breaking pileup killed an estimated 18 people.
Emergency crews spent hours sifting through the wreckage hoping to recover any survivors from this tragic collision.
So far police are refusing to release the names of the victims until the families are notified.
The camera of a highway patrol car managed to catch this shocking footage.
- A semi comes...
- Oh my God.
And smashes into a red SUV.
- The driver of the SUV...
- No, um... leave it.
...may have saved her life.
He pulled her back at the last second just as the semi ploughed into the vehicle.
The passengers inside the SUV...
Oh, oh, oh! You guys see that?!
Shit, I was there, baby!
In other news, a freak accident took the life of a lotto winner.
- Friends say Evan Lewis...
- Hey, shh.
Was on top of the world after recently winning $250,000.
But in tragic turn of events,
Lewis died today while trying to escape a fire in his apartment.
He managed to make it out of the building, but somehow the ladder on the fire escape slipped and impaled him.
Investigators believe Lewis died instantly.
Come in.
Hey, buddy.
I want you to take this so you can get some sleep.
And then tomorrow it's off to the dentist, which I know you love.
Now, get some rest.
- Mum.
- Yeah?
You think those guys were BSing us today?
Yeah.
Some people just need some rewiring, that's all.
Lights out.
At the request of the patient, you'll relinquish any sharp objects such as: 'nail files, pencils, pens, safety pins, bobby pins, your necklace, matches, lighters, belts, belt buckles, earrings, hair clips, glasses, shoelaces, paper clips, watches, money clip, pocket knives, food, drinks, keys, cell phone... '
You have a cell phone on you?
'... poisons, pills, medications.'
Great. And let me see your nails.
Good. Then I think we're all done.
Wait.
Is she dangerous or something?
No, honey, she expects you are.
No, no, no.
Get him off me.
Get him off me!
How long are they gonna keep her locked up like this?
Depends on her, I guess.
She's voluntary.
- Clear Rivers?
- Don't come any closer.
They told me you had something to do with the crash on Route 23.
Look, I don't know how to explain it, but I saw the pileup before it happened.
And I saved some people.
And now you think Death is after you.
Nice work.
Maybe if you're real lucky, you'll wind up in here with me.
Anything else?
One of the people died in a freak accident last night.
What if the other people are in danger, too?
If you put them on the list, they're already dead.
List? What list?
Death's list.
The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash.
That was Death's original design.
The list.
I was supposed to die in that crash with my friends.
So you're telling me that I'm next?
You said someone else died last night.
That means someone must have intervened.
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
Congratulations.
You'll be the last to go.
But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.
It always does.
This doesn't make sense.
You said that you die in the order you're originally meant to.
But my friends died last in my premonition, not first.
Wait.
Died last?
Backwards.
Are you sure?
In my premonition that Nora woman and her kid died.
Then Evan, then me and my friends.
Why is this even happening to me?
That's what Alex used to ask himself.
So, what am I supposed to do?
Clear.
Watch out for the signs.
What?
Have you ever seen anything creepy or ominous?
An in-your-face irony kind of thing?
The songs on the radio.
Yeah, the guy in the beer truck, everything on the road.
Well, don't ignore it.
Recognizing those signs usually means the difference between life and death.
You got to help me.
I don't have to do anything.
But you beat it.
Take a look around.
What did I beat, Kimberly?
If you were smart, you'd save yourself and just forget about the others.
How can you say that?
You have a responsibility.
My friends are dead.
That's how I can say that.
This is what happened to Alex when I was responsible for him.
Get out.
Before you hurt me or yourself.
- Alright, you know what?
- What?
I think you're a coward.
You hide out in here because you're too damn bitter and selfish to help any other person.
In my opinion, you're already dead.
I tried calling you last night, but your father said you were sleeping.
- Evan Lewis is dead.
- Yeah.
I've been getting calls all morning from everyone who was on the on-ramp.
We're meeting tonight at my apartment.
Wait, so... you believe all this Death stuff?
Well, at first, no, I didn't.
Until last year when I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.
Clean up, I don't...
- Did you see that?
- See what?
- Pigeons.
- Pigeons?
- It's a sign.
- A sign of what?
If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacked by pigeons.
I'm not following you.
They're next on Death's list.
If we don't find them, they're going to die.
The doctor's ready for you, now.
If he gives me the gas and I wake up with my pants unbuttoned...
- we ain't paying.
- Tim.
There you are.
What happened to you yesterday, Tim?
We missed you in here.
We got hung up by that accident on
Route 23.
Good Lord.
How lucky that you're okay.
Your mum says you've been having some pain lately.
Not really.
I'm disappointed, Tim.
Does your mum know you've been smoking?
Uh-huh.
Ow.
Yeah, that one's going to have to be filled.
Damn those pigeons.
How many times am I going to have to replace those goddamn windows?
We can't do it, boss, we can't do it!
This will only sting for a moment.
Open big.
Little bit wider.
Wider.
Okay.
Oh God.
How do they expect me to...
Would you rather just have the laughing gas?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Jean, I'm going to need you in here.
You'll have to speak up, there's too much noise.
What?!
I can't hear you!
Excuse me, what?!
Yes, the sixth at 2:00 P.M.
Jean! Let me get this started.
Tim, you'll be awake, a little groggy, but you're not going to be able to move much.
Okay, great, thanks.
Alright, turn around.
The cleaning lady said they're at the Ellis Medical Complex off of 14th.
God damn it anyway.
- Okay, I got it.
- I can't find a box!
Not again. Careful.
There we go.
Jean, how's Tim doing in there?
What did he say about your tooth?
- Did he say...
- I can't remember.
- Nora!
- The pigeons!
What? Pigeons?
Hey, whoa, whoa!
Kid, kid!
- No-oo!
- Tim!
Look out!
- Stay back, stay back!
- No! Please, no!
Nora's not coming.
She won't leave her son.
- No, but she's next...
- Right now I don't think she cares.
This is really happening again, isn't it?
I hoped we'd get there and they'd be fine, and Clear Rivers was just full of shit, and Evan Lewis' death was just some freak accident.
But we're all going to die, aren't we?
I'm so scared.
I know you didn't ask for any of this... but I don't think you have it in you to quit either.
A second one just died.
A 15-year-old kid.
I hope you're ready for this.
It's this way.
How is this guy going to help us anyway?
He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about Death than he ever told us.
Shouldn't we knock first?
He probably already knows we're coming.
Hello, Clear.
I've been expecting you.
Oh my God.
- That's Evan Lewis.
- Come to pick my brain?
Just a simple question and we'll leave you alone with your new friend.
Dead... yet still fresh.
Look, we drove a long way to get here, so if you happen to know how to stop Death, it would be really great if you told us.
You can't cheat Death.
- There are no escapes.
- Bullshit.
You told me Death has a distinct design.
But Alex and I cheated Death, not once but dozens of times.
The design is flawed, it can be beaten.
Such fire in you now.
People are always most alive just before they die.
Don't you think?
Look, please... if you know of anything that could help us, what harm could it do?
Only new life can defeat Death.
What the hell does that mean?
Some people say there's a balance to everything.
For every life there's a death, and for every death there is a life.
But the introduction of life that was not meant to be, that can invalidate the list, force Death to start anew.
You have to follow the signs...
Kimberly.
How do you know my name?
- Whoa!
- Wait a second.
'New life defeats death'?
'Follow the signs'?
Where did you find that guy?
I thought he was supposed to help us, not freak us out.
What the fuck are you thinking?!
I'm thinking suck on my junk, bee-atch.
Little punk.
What is it?
What did you see?
You have to tell us, what did you see?
Kimberly, look at me!
You have to tell us.
What did you see?!
I was driving a white van.
I don't know,
I must have lost control, because I crashed into a lake.
- And I drowned.
- You were there?
I can practically taste the water in my mouth.
Wait, remember, the on-ramp?
There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van.
He said only new life can defeat death.
If she gives birth to a baby that would've died in that car crash... a brand new soul that was never part of Death's design...
It throws the whole list out of whack and we start over with a clean slate.
- It seems like a reach, don't you think?
- What else could it mean?
We have to find the pregnant lady's number.
I don't have it.
She never came to the station.
We have to warn her about the lake so she can stay alive to have the baby.
- That'll be an easy conversation to have.
- How are we gonna find her?
There could be thousands of white vans in the state.
Hey!
I'm a cop, remember?
Wait, that's it.
Got it.
With the plate number
I can put out an APB.
Here we go.
The vehicle is a delivery van registered to Marcus and Isabella Hudson.
We should pick them up pretty quickly.
Come on, let's get to the meeting.
Hey, hold the door!
Hey, let go of my shoe!
Give me my shoe!
I wrote to management two weeks ago about these friggin' bumpers.
Is that dogshit, dude?
Eww.
Oh, you got something on your...
It's still there, bro'.
Here, I can get it for you.
No, it's alright.
I'll do it if you want me to do it.
Just let... I'll...
Let me do it.
What?
Hey, man, how you doing?
Listen, any word on that white van yet?
Okay, keep checking.
Does anybody have a Valium?
Oh, yeah.
Here.
You're just going to want to take half of that.
Keep 'em coming.
If what you're saying is true, that means I'm next.
This is crazy, people, come on.
First Death is stalking us, and now premonitions?
What?
You're not next, Nora.
Nobody has to be next.
That's the point.
We need to help each other in order to get through this.
This cannot be happening.
See, because my career is at a peak and I finally met a quality guy.
I just bought a house.
Maybe if you shut the fuck up, you'll live.
Like I'm going to take advice from you.
Okay, look, if you know what to look for, you have a fighting chance.
If I call and say,
I don't know... subway...
Get to a high-rise fast.
A place where no subway could ever possibly go.
Get it?
Okay, you guys, listen... just because Kimberly has these visions, it doesn't mean we're not all capable of seeing signs to some extent.
Okay, okay, look.
I gotta call bullshit.
I mean, I've sat here and listened to all your theories and all your stories, and I think it's just all bullshit.
Call it what you want!
- It'll keep your arse alive.
- Darlin', my arse is alive!
Has been all day.
There is nobody after us but you, trying to make us all crazy.
I should have seen that coming.
Yeah.
If Death is out to get you, why don't you get the hell away from us?
She's the only one that's dealt with this before.
We need to look out for each other from now on.
Sleep in shifts.
We need to safe-proof this death-trap.
Get you to step out of the van, miss?
Are you kidding me?
- What did I do?
- This vehicle's been reported stolen.
Ohh!
Screw this.
I'm going for a smoke.
No, no, no, it's not safe out there.
So, Nora's got to bite it before me anyhow, huh?
Oh, you people have no sense of humor.
Nora, you okay?
Four years ago my husband died.
Now Tim.
There's nothing left for me.
Don't say that, okay?
If it is my time to go and be in heaven... with my family,
I can accept that.
You got to trust me.
We can fight this.
If we just stick together long enough for her to have her baby...
If you'll excuse me,
I have a funeral to plan.
Nora.
What do you think you're doing?
- I'm finished. I'm out.
- Don't leave, Eugene.
Look, look.
I control my life, alright?
Not some crazy list that
Death has put together.
I'll be sure to carve that into your tombstone.
Whatever. You may be able to scare these people,
- I'm not buying that shit.
- Be careful, man.
- Hey.
- What?
Even if you don't believe, give this to Nora.
I'm just going to put this in the... closet.
Sorry.
Whoa.
Man with hooks?
Man with hooks.
Hey, I think I see a man with hooks.
Is that...
- a sign?
- Oh my God.
- Do you guys see that?
- He's right.
- The phone.
- Shit.
What the fuck?
- Hello?
- Nora!
- Who is this?
- Can you hear me?!
Officer Burke,
I can't...
I can't hear you!
What?!
What does he...
What?!
A man with hooks is going to kill you.
- What, what?
- Oh...
What is it, Nora?
No!
- Wait, wait!
- Let go!
Wait, wait, Nora!
- Get me out of here!
- Will you stop it?!
Let me help!
Let me go!
Let go of me!
Kat!
Help me!
- Wait!
- I don't want to die!
Aah!
Let me out of here.
I got it, thanks.
They found the van.
Isabella's being held at the Greenwood Lake sheriff's station.
I'm in control of my life!
- Kiss my arse!
- Eugene, what is it?
- I control my life!
- What happened, Eugene?
- You hear me, you Reaper cocksucker?!
- Calm down.
- What happened? Where's Nora?
- Back the fuck up!
- Whoa, whoa, okay!
- Back the fuck up!
Eugene, what's wrong?
Just tell us what happened.
Alright, give me the gun, Eugene.
- Give me the gun.
- No! Fuck no!
Eugene, you just got to relax, bro', okay?
You just got to calm down, man.
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun, Eugene!
- No, no, no, no!
- Don't do it! Don't do it!
- I ain't going out like that.
- Hey, Eugene, no!
- On my terms!
- Oh my God!
You hear me!
God!
Oh!
You don't keep it loaded?
- Maybe they're all duds.
- Six in a row?
Never.
That's impossible.
It wasn't his turn to die.
Can we find the pregnant woman, now, please?
Is this safe, guys?
I mean, someone in this car is about to get whacked.
Do the rest of us really feel like sitting next to him?
Or her?
Hopefully her.
Okay, guys, let's not panic.
- Isabella's safe.
- How do you know?
You said she was going to drive into a lake.
How can she if she's in protective custody?
Look at me.
Come on.
Does it look like
I'm in the condition to commit grand theft auto?
This is insane.
Look, hopefully the district judge will have it all sorted out by Monday morning, okay?
Marcus.
Marcus, Marcus.
When I get out of here,
I am going to sue his...
- Oh my God.
- What, what now?
My water just broke.
- What?
- My water, it just broke.
- I'm gonna have my baby.
- No, not here.
- No, you can't do this to me.
- Don't just stand there!
- Get me to a hospital!
- Give me a second to think!
I am not going to have my baby in a jail cell!
Get me to the hospital!
Okay, okay!
Sheriff Perry, this is Deputy Adams, come back.
God, I need the car!
Sheriff Perry, I need the car!
My van! My van!
Take my van!
Okay. Okay.
Yeah, we'll go.
We'll go.
Yeah, we'll go.
Come on, come on!
Y'all want to hear something crazy?
It's not the first time
I cheated Death.
A kid came to school with a knife... killed his teacher.
Teacher would have been me, but I was transferred to another school two days before.
That's fucking weird, man.
You want weird?
Last year my partner and I were heading out when a call came in about a train wreck.
Frank decided to let me handle it alone.
He died that night in a shootout.
If that call had come in just 10 seconds later,
I'd be dead, too.
Oh my God.
I'm sorry.
It's just I got one, too.
Okay, so last May
I'm supposed to go and stay at this cheesy little bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania.
Anyhow, there's this major gas leak that no one knows about, and all the guests suffocated during the night.
So what happened?
I don't know.
I never made it.
The bus I was on splattered some girl all over the road.
Was that in Mt Abraham?
Yes. How did you know?
That bus you were on killed
Terry Chaney.
She was supposed to die on Flight 180.
Hey, do you guys remember that theatre in Paris that collapsed last year and killed everybody inside?
Well, I had tickets to go.
But one night I'm in Paris and I'm just tripping on acid and sipping lattes and such.
And then all of a sudden this dude out of nowhere just gets whacked by this falling sign.
- Carter.
- Wait, wait, wait.
The teacher I replaced, her name was Val Lewton.
She was from Mt Abraham.
She died in an explosion.
Shit. The call about the train wreck that saved my life... that was the night
I scraped up Billy Hitchcock.
Wait a minute.
Who are these people?
The people who got off of Flight 180.
They were my friends.
Kimberly, tell us what happened.
About a year ago my mum and I were at the mall.
I was supposed to meet her outside, but I got caught up watching this news report about some kid that committed suicide.
I kept thinking,
'How can you strangle yourself in the bathtub?
That's stupid.'
It felt wrong.
And yet...
I heard some gunshots and I ran outside.
Some kids were trying to steal my mum's car.
She tried to fight them off, she was a fighter, and they killed her.
After the funeral I kept thinking that it should have been me.
I guess everyone must think that.
But I guess I was right.
Get there.
Could you drive a little faster maybe?!
- I'm going as fast as I can.
- God!
When we got off
Flight 180, it didn't just change our lives.
It affected everyone and everything we've come into contact with since.
I'm not sure
I'm understanding you.
Being alive after we were supposed to die, it caused an outward ripple.
A rift in Death's design.
So if you had never gotten off the plane... we wouldn't be alive in the first place.
Yes, that's why Death is working backwards!
It's tying up all the loose ends,
Sealing the rift once and for all.
Oh, shit!
Jesus Christ!
Hang on! Hang on!
- Is everybody alright?
- Oh God.
God, Eugene!
- He can't breathe.
- Oh, my legs!
No, please.
- It's not going to wait.
- I got to go help those people.
Do you want to deliver this baby?
Those people can help.
Let's go.
Officer Adams reporting a vehicle collision off 9-A at the 180 mile-marker.
Send all emergency vehicles to the scene.
- We have to go. Go!
- Okay, okay, okay!
Just... okay, okay!
We're going! We're going!
- Easy, easy.
- Here, here, here.
I think he has a collapsed lung.
- Everyone okay?
- Call an ambulance!
Stay with us.
Hey, hey you!
Hey! Come on.
Help me out.
You got to get me out of here before this thing explodes or something, okay?
I think it's okay.
I don't smell any gas and nothing's dripping.
Alright, get this thing off me.
Just pull. Hurry.
Okay. Be careful.
Ready?
Oh God, Jethro!
Jesus Christ!
I got to be able to use my legs when I'm done.
I'm so... Dad!
Eugene, everything's going to be okay.
If he doesn't get a respirator, he's not going to make it!
We're going to get you to the hospital.
Be careful with that!
Check the gauges on the regulator, and watch out for overdoses!
- And look out for potholes and puddles.
- You can't come in, miss.
And watch out for power lines!
Watch it!
You trying to get yourself killed, little boy?
You got to use your head, man.
Get that news van back.
Thanks.
Okay, let's go.
How is she doing?
I think she's going to be okay.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.
When I die... is it going to hurt?
I don't know.
You're going to die after me, right?
Yeah, I guess so.
Would you take these?
And if I die... would you throw out all my drugs and my paraphernalia and my porno?
You know... anything that's going to break my mum's heart.
Please?
Thank you.
This is Cheyenne Jacobson reporting live from the Gibbons farm.
Sheriff Perry,
Officer Burke here.
I'm trying to get some information on Isabella...
She did?
Okay. Thanks.
Great.
Kimberly!
Isabella's at Lakeview Hospital.
They're prepping her for delivery.
- We got to go now.
- What about Kat?
I'll go talk to her.
Hi.
Just find Isabella and get this thing over with, okay?
Go on, I'll be fine.
- Where's Rory?
- I don't know.
Could you be a little quieter with that thing, please?
Yeah, sure.
I'll just put it on quiet mode.
That would be good.
Rory.
Oh my God!
Somebody get out there!
- We have to get to the hospital now!
- Well, take my truck!
The keys are in it.
Kimberly!
Kimberly!
- Kimberly.
- What do you see?
- What are we looking for?
- It's not here.
This one was different.
It was like the van crashing into the lake.
I was in a hospital, there was screaming and a nurse was trying to choke me.
I couldn't see her, but I could see her name tag.
It was right in my face.
Kalarjian.
I think a nurse named
Kalarjian is going to try and kill Isabella.
Listen to me, Isabella!
I need you to stop pushing!
What's wrong?
Is my baby alright?
The cord's around the neck.
This baby's in trouble.
A bizarre accident has left two people dead, one of them killed by a safety device meant to protect us.
Ironically, the woman was impaled through the head after her emergency airbag deployed.
She was trapped in her vehicle after it crashed into a field near Greenwood Lake.
Suddenly the airbag went off...
Isabella Hudson!
What room is she in?
We may need to do a stat Caesarean!
Get Dr. Kalarjian up here now!
Dr. Kalarjian, code blue.
Delivery room six.
I'm just going to wait outside,
'cause I'm just really in the way here.
- Don't you dare leave me!
- Okay, okay.
You guys, get to Isabella!
I'm going to find Eugene!
Dr. Kalarjian, code blue.
Delivery room six.
Dr. Kalarjian, delivery room six.
Code blue.
Dr. Kalarjian, in here, hurry!
That's her.
Wait, wait, wait!
Contractions have stopped.
Arrest in descent halfway through the birth canal.
Bad tracing, it's losing oxygen.
The cord's compressed!
- Down to 40.
- Oh God! What's happening?!
Where's Kalarjian?!
Dr. Kalarjian!
- Dr. Kalarjian!
- Not now, I'm busy.
- Ow! Hey! Hey!
- Police business.
Just push a little more.
Oh, no.
Isabella, is the baby okay?
I'm sorry.
You can't be here.
- I have to ask you to leave.
- I need to know...
I need to know if the baby's alright!
It's a boy.
Thank you.
Congratulations!
Who the hell are they?
Oh my God!
- Clear.
- I can't find Eugene.
- No, don't worry. She had the baby!
- It's okay.
It's over.
It's okay.
- Kimberly.
- What did you see?
I don't think Isabella was ever supposed to die in that pileup.
Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean?
Try to remember.
Bloody hands.
Someone with bloody hands.
Eugene.
Only new life defeats death.
What is that supposed to mean?
You saw an ECG machine and what else?
Bloody hands.
What else did you see, Kimberly?
Wait.
Eugene.
Oh God, no!
Bloody hands.
It's me.
The premonitions are about me.
- What?
- Crash cart.
Let's go! Move it!
Dr. Kalarjian.
ECG machine.
The lake.
The white van.
What are you talking about?
New life.
What is it?
I know what I have to do to save us.
- I have to die.
- No, that's crazy.
You can't give up now.
We have to fight this thing.
Get Kalarjian.
Only new life can defeat death.
If it is my time to go and be in heaven... with my family.
I can accept that.
Flight 180...
I know what I have to do to save us.
There are no known survivors.
I have to die.
Ready and clear!
Nothing!
Ready and clear.
Nothing.
- Come on.
- Ready, clear.
She's back!
Epinephrine.
Two milligrams, IV push.
I want her prepped and stabilized for ICU.
Welcome back.
They lost you for a minute there.
Hey. We did it.
Thanks to you, we cheated Death.
Would you like some wine?
I think I'll stick to our beer, thanks.
Alright.
This is really great,
Mrs. Gibbons.
Thank you so much for inviting us.
It's our pleasure.
- How are you doing, Kimberly?
- Good. Yeah.
I had a fun summer.
I don't know, I guess things are pretty much getting back to normal.
Brian, I think you better go check that barbecue.
Hey, careful.
Those things are dangerous.
Trust me.
I think I've been through closer calls.
Yeah, me too. Dad, you should tell them about the news van thing.
What's that?
Brian was almost hit by that news van that day in the field.
And your friend Rory, he pulled him back at the last second.
- Saved his life.
- You never told me that, Peter.
Boy, that was lucky.
Brian!

I can't hold her much longer.
She's taking on too much water.
- What is going on back there?
- Keep your pants on, Murphy.
We blew the starboard engine.
Port engine's way too hot.
MUNDER: Hold on.
- Shorten the tow or cut her loose.
Epps...
...get off my damn tugboat.
We don't have much time.
MURPHY: Move it, Epps. If she sinks, she's taking us with her.
Got a punch in the port floater.
EPPS: Five minutes before she floods.
- Less than that!
Get back here.
We're cutting her loose.
- Cut her loose.
- That's it. Get back here.
Come on! You heard the man!
Took us three months to get her off the bottom. I will not lose her now!
Goddamn it, Epps!
You can't fix everything!
Christ!
- For the last time, get back here!
- She's taking on too much water!
Why do you always have to break my balls? I said get back here!
MURPHY: Do you want me to come down there and kick your ass? I'll do it.
MURPHY: Here's to the best damn salvage crew in the business!
MUNDER: We did it, guys!
SANTOS: Yeah, look at that!
MUNDER:
All right. Nice work.
- Here's to the fucking sea!
- To the sea.
MURPHY:
To a job well done.
Mr. Murphy? I'm Jack Ferriman. I was wondering if I could buy you a drink.
He doesn't drink.
Could I talk to you alone?
You talk to me, you talk to my crew.
That's the way it is.
I fly the Arctic Weather Patrol flights out of Mackenzie Bay.
Last month I was out in the middle of the Strait when I came across this.
Congratulations. You found a boat.
In the middle of the ocean, of all places.
I tried for radio contact and got nothing...
...so I figured she had to be adrift.
MURPHY:
In the Bering Strait?
That's miles from shipping lanes.
Did you alert the Coast Guard?
It's international waters, so they noted it and that's it.
You get a name?
No, I put it out of my head until two days ago when I saw it again.
MURPHY: What are we talking about?
What kind of tonnage?
Big. Huge.
Could be military.
Let's say that we're a little bit interested.
MURPHY:
What's in it for you?
I want 20% finder's fee, whatever she's won'th.
- Have you told anyone else about this?
- Not a living soul.
MURPHY: Give us a minute, will you?
JACK: Okay.
DODGE:
So? What do you think, Murph?
Who knows? Could be full of shit.
I do know one thing. I've seen strange things happen in the Strait.
I know something else:
Sea gives you an opportunity, take it.
That's at least a week out of our way.
We've been out for six months already.
I got a fiancée waiting, remember?
I'm getting married in a month.
Plan was to go back to Anchorage.
Starboard diesel needs an overhaul.
- In our business, the only plan is:
GROUP: There is no plan.
If you don't want to go, that's fine.
Let's tell him we'll get somebody else.
Wait a minute. Let's not be hasty.
What's a ship like that won'th?
Who knows?
Millions? Thousands? Could be nothing.
Depends on a lot of things.
- Mainly, if we have the right to salvage.
- Pretty big "if."
- What's the split?
- We split it even, six ways.
- Even split?
MURPHY: Beats me paying you overtime.
I'm good.
DODGE:
I'm in.
EPPS:
Greer? What do you say?
All right.
MURPHY:
Hey, Ferriman! Can you come over here?
So this is the way it works.
10% instead of your 20% finder's fee.
I can't let you take advantage of me like that.
That's the way it is.
Take it or leave it.
Fine. But I go with you.
Not on my boat, you don't.
Think I'd tell you where a fortune might be without insurance?
There are five other boats that would jump at this.
I come with you.
So you take it or leave it.
Ow! Those things are dull!
She'll love it. What do you think?
Too much off the sides, but I can come up with something she'll love.
- Shave that yourself.
GREER: Don't want to help me out?
Who the fuck are you kidding? Everybody knows you Navy boys take it up the ass.
- Enjoying the ride, Jack?
- No, sir.
Not the same as flying planes over ice sheets, is it?
- What's the appeal?
JACK: I could ask you the same thing.
What's a nice girl doing in a dump like this instead of raising a family?
I own a third of Murphy's operation.
I'm not that nice.
And these monkeys are my family.
SANTOS
Santos to Murphy. Come in.
- Yeah?
- I think you should get up here.
- What is it?
SANTOS: I think you should see this!
It was there a second ago!
Ten miles to the northwest.
Would you turn off that fucking music?
I'm telling you, there must be a glitch.
I saw it with my own eyes.
- Glitch, my ass. There's nothing there.
- Give me a look at this.
There it is! Right in front of you!
Tell me you don't see nothing.
SANTOS: Do you see what I'm saying?
Do you see what I'm saying to you?
- Dodge, could you get on the bow light?
DODGE: All right, Murph.
- It's there, right?
- There's something there.
EPPS:
Hey, Murph, what's up?
MURPHY:
Vessel at position 7-5 north...
...this is Arctic Warrior.
MURPHY:
Come in.
This is tugboat Arctic Warrior.
Do you read me?
This is Arctic Warrior.
Do you read me? Come in.
Shit!
SANTOS: Now do you believe me?
- Holy shit!
DODGE: An ocean liner?
Where did that come from?
It's the Antonia Graza.
Jesus Christ.
MURPHY: This is civilian tugboat Arctic
Warrior. Is there anyone aboard?
This is civilian tugboat ArcticWarrior.
Is there anyone aboard?
This is Arctic Warrior.
Can you read us?
- You know her, Murphy?
- Only in my dreams.
MURPHY:
Christ, she's beautiful.
Italian liners couldn't compete for speed, so they built floating art palaces instead.
She was reported missing May 21,
1962, off the coast of Labrador.
Funny thing is, there was no distress signal. She just disappeared.
Ever since, every captairs been looking for her, hoping she hasn't gone down.
- Do you know what this means?
- What?
Under the law of the sea, she's ours.
Let's not keep a lady waiting.
MURPHY: Santos, bring us alongside.
Fire up the crane. We got business to do.
When we get onboard, stay together. We don't know what kind of shape she's in.
MURPHY: Take us up, Greer.
GREER Aye, captain.
Hey, Murphy, please remember to keep all channels open. Thank you.
They won't let me go.
Safety first.
That's why you go last, Jack.
Can you sit down?
I'm trying to keep this steady.
- I just want...
- Sit down! Get out of the way!
Okay.
She's had some battering over the last 40 years, you can tell.
GREER:
Stand by. Setting you down topside.
She's still a beaut.
Unbelievable.
MURPHY:
You better stay alert. Watch your step.
40 years of rust can turn deck plates into quicksand.
We'll make our way in at the fore, then check the bridge. This way. Careful.
EPPS: Forward mast is history.
- Epps and Murphy, are they a couple?
Hell, no. She's like a daughter to him.
He'd be lost without her.
MUNDER: Superstructure's in decent shape. No sign of damage.
EPPS:
Lifeboats are gone, stern to bow.
MUNDER:
Life preserver lockers are empty.
DODGE: Sure no survivors ever turned up, Murph?
MURPHY: Sure as we're walking on the Graza, Dodge. This way.
Let's go.
Jesus. She's no fiddler's green.
MURPHY:
You're wrong, Munder. She's beautiful.
Whoever was on here originally sure left in a hurry.
Murphy, come in.
MUNDER:
Whoa.
EPPS: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard. I'm Julie.
I'll be your hostess this evening.
Shh!
Have some respect, okay?
Shh!
MUNDER:
Check out all those champagne bottles.
DODGE: Looks like we missed one hell of a party.
EPPS: And one hell of a hangover.
MURPHY: Shut up!
- Shut up!
MURPHY: Let's find the bridge.
EPPS: Such a manly man.
MUNDER: What?
DODGE: You all right?
MUNDER: Shut up!
DODGE:
Come on, Mary, let's go.
EPPS: Murph, how many passengers did she carry?
MURPHY: Over 600. The creme de la creme of society from all over Europe.
Crew of 500 from Italy.
Talk to me. How's everything going?
MURPHY: Good. This companionway should get us to the bridge.
Here, Epps, hold this.
What's going on?
- After you.
- No, after you.
No, no. After me.
DODGE:
Tough guy.
Don't let go!
- Pull! Pull!
- Please, Epps!
Please, Epps, don't let go!
DODGE: Give me your hand.
- Pull us up!
MUNDER:
Oh, God!
MURPHY:
I told you to watch your fucking step!
- Oh, shit. Oh, Jesus.
- From now on, you let me lead. Okay?
MURPHY:
Let's go.
- I think I just shit my pants.
DODGE: No, you always smell that way.
Compass is dead.
Helm's not responding, either.
Fuel tanks are empty. She must've rode on full throttle till she was bone-dry.
Epps!
MURPHY:
Epps!
I'm looking for the ship's log.
Let's get this documentation back...
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
Let's get to it.
DODGE:
Hey, check this out.
- It's a watch. Congratulations, buddy.
- No. Look again, you moron.
It's a digital watch. Do the math. They didn't have digital watches in 1962.
So we're not the first people to board this ship. But she's ours now.
Let's get some sleep, tow her at dawn.
Let's hope there's no more surprises.
Amen to that.
MURPHY:
Oh, God.
Epps, can I get some tea?
Any sign of what might've happened?
How she got here?
That's the $64 million question, isn't it?
- Ever hear of the ship Marie Celeste?
- No.
Twin-masted brigantine out of
Charleston during the Civil War.
MURPHY: She was bound for London with a cargo of cotton.
Thanks.
Two months after she set sail, she was sighted by fishermen off Tripoli.
She was doing 12 knots an hour in a stiff breeze.
Something wasrt quite right. They didn't know what so they went onboard.
You know what they found?
Nothing.
No passengers. No crew. No captain.
No sign of distress.
59 days after the last log entry, it had traveled 4500 miles across the ocean...
...past the Rock of Gibraltar and into the Mediterranean Sea at full sail.
And nobody at the helm.
MURPHY: What do you make of that?
- A ghost ship.
Hey, you smell that?
I smell bullshit.
- Been on the sea a lot longer than you.
- I know.
Seen things that you can't even imagine.
Maritime history is full of
Marie Celestes.
So, what's our plan?
I think we should do what we came to do. Tie her up, tug her in.
You think we can pull this ocean liner?
Yeah.
SANTOS:
Not with the problems we got.
We could set her at anchor and come back with two or three tugs.
No, some Russian trawler will come along.
I've already looked for her anchors, anyway. They're gone.
- What do you think?
- Get the engines working...
...it could take us two weeks minimum to tow a vessel this size.
For my share of what she's won'th,
I'd drag her back to Anchorage myself.
Don't let go!
MUNDER:
Help me! Don't let go!
- Thought you might want a jacket.
- Thanks.
Boy, do I miss that.
You okay? You seem quiet since you came back.
I think I saw something
I couldn't possibly have seen.
- Like what?
- No, it's crazy.
I'm curious. Tell me.
I think I saw a little girl.
On...
On the... The boat?
Yeah. Looking right at me.
And then what happened?
Nothing. She disappeared.
Sometimes, when I'd be flying for hours on end...
...l'd think I'd see stuff too.
It'd be there one second and gone the next. Like a dream.
Thanks.
- See you in the a.m.
- Okay.
Good night.
JACK: See you tomorrow.
EPPS: Yeah.
She's got a big hole.
She's sinking.
- This is where the damage is. See?
- Breach in the hull, about 10 by 20...
...torn to the port collision bulkhead.
- Did it hit an iceberg?
DODGE: No, you don't need an iceberg to rupture a hull.
I don't know.
- She's been hit recently.
- About a week ago, I'd say.
MURPHY:
This is where we are.
The problem's this group of islands.
Nothing spectacular...
...just rocks, a couple thousand seals.
The Antonia Graza's caught here in this strong current loop...
...and slowly she's been pushed towards those rocks. Last time she hit them.
- What about next time?
- Wort be one.
We've got three days to fix it.
That's if the weather holds.
Why can't we tow it like it is?
Lt'd be like towing a car with four flat tires.
- It's a bump in the road. We can fix it.
- Murph, bump in the road?
Look, the breach we can probably patch if we can get to the inside.
We'll weld shut the flooded compartments, pump out the water up to the aft peak.
On top of that, the rudder's jammed.
MUNDER: We jerry-rig it, set a 38-degree current drift to clear the island chain.
What does all that mean?
I just... That's a lot of work for three days.
But with the gear we've got onboard and what's on that ship, we can try.
We can do it, right?
With the gear we've got onboard,
I can't fix our engine.
Quit bitching and overhaul the starboard engine.
- So that's the plan?
- Just do it.
- I'll call it in.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Maritime law states...
- I know.
We just don't want any unexpected guests. Just leave it.
GREER:
Your call, captain.
EPPS: All right, you know the drill.
We do a complete recon.
Make sure we've got no problems before we get to work.
MURPHY: Stay with me. Don't wander.
GREER: Okay.
EPPS: Dodge, Munder, go to the port collision bulkhead.
Jack and I'll work back from the fore.
Call if you need anything.
MUNDER: How about a pizza?
- You're so funny.
The only plan in this business is that there is no plan. What is that?
What these people talking crazy for?
That's not even good English.
That's okay. Hang in there, okay, preciosa?
Because someday he'll find some other genius to fix his boat.
You want to play like that?
It's still sweet, though.
GREER:
Light coming up.
You were right. She is beautiful.
She sure is.
Epps, we're heading for the main engine room. Epps?
Epps?
All right, capitano.
I'm just slipping in the darkness
Oh, shit.
We're gonna have to dive to get to that tear.
Epps, the engine room is totally flooded.
Epps, can you hear me?
Wait!
What happened? You okay?
What are you doing down there?
Did you hurt yourself?
What are you doing?
The whole bottom's riddled with them.
JACK: Looks like someone used it for target practice.
- That's the happy version.
- What's the not-so-happy version?
There were people in there.
I saw that little girl again.
What? Where?
- I must be losing my goddamn mind.
- Well, did she say anything?
Forget it. Come on.
Murphy, come in.
Dodge! Anybody!
Shit.
I think she's fucking with us.
EPPS:
Looks like central laundry.
This vent connects to the forward hold.
We need to see if it's flooded.
- I may need help shutting it.
- You sure we need to...?
Murphy, where the hell are you?
- How long have they been here?
- A month, maybe less.
- What are we gonna do?
- Get off this boat!
- But the ship...
- lf it sinks, it sinks.
You're right.
JACK:
Stinks.
- What the hell?
- We came through there.
No shit!
EPPS:
Come on!
This way. Come on, Jack.
GREER:
What the...?
Wherd you start wearing lipstick, Epps?
Epps?
GREER:
"Francesca."
Nice titties.
Not that you can hold a candle to the future Mrs. Greer, though.
EPPS: Come on, Jack. Stop dragging ass!
What's your problem?
JACK:
What's this?
Forget it. Let's go! Jack!
'58 Jaguar X150. I've dreamt about this car since I was a kid.
We have to get out of here now.
Do you understand? Now.
There's something moving in there.
Fuck!
Oh, my God!
I hate rats!
EPPS:
What?
JACK:
Oh, my God! Look at this!
I have to get Murphy.
Murphy!
JACK:
Murphy!
Is someone trying to call me?
Dodge! Munder!
VOICE:
Maureen...
Who's Maureen?
It's my first name.
VOICE: It's cold...
- He said "cold"?
The galley.
VOICE 1: It's cold.
VOICE 2: Please help us.
Don't go in there.
You fucking assholes!
Fuck you!
Take it easy!
You were fucking with us. We fucked with you. Why aren't you laughing?
Wanna hear something funnier? We found dead guys in the laundry room.
And this in the cargo hold.
Need some help, skipper?
I'm sorry.
MURPHY: Jesus.
GREER: Oh, man.
MUNDER:
Holy shit!
Yeah!
MUNDER:
We're rich!
DODGE: You son of a bitch!
MUNDER: Rich!
MURPHY: Come on. Let's go.
DODGE: Move this shit out!
One. Two. Three...
How much you figure it's won'th, boss?
There's a lot of gold. Hard to know.
Two, 300 million, maybe. Maybe more.
EPPS: Jesus.
GREER: I don't know.
Lock boxes with half of Fort Knox in them? They gotta be insured.
No way somebody will let this much gold float away.
Well, the markings have been filed down.
GREER: What does that mean?
- Someone didn't want this traceable.
It's stolen.
It may have to do with the reason this ship disappeared when it did.
Wait. If the gold's got something to do with 1962...
...what about the bodies? They can't be more than three weeks old.
Somebody's gotta say it, and it might as well be me. This ship is fucked up.
Earlier I could swear I heard a woman singing. It's like she was...
- Like she was coming on to me.
DODGE: Oh, no!
It was the sexiest voice
I ever heard, man.
- She got any backup singers?
- Whatever you're on, get me some!
Maybe you're not quite ready to get married, Greer.
- Fuck you.
EPPS: Okay, guys.
- What about the Coast Guard?
DODGE: No.
You call the Coast Guard... What if the gold did turn out to be stolen?
Under maritime law, anything found in international waters...
...belongs to the finder. Okay?
That is the law.
- Right.
- Finders keepers.
If we're gonna do this,
I say we do it now.
Get our boat going, grab the gold and get the hell out of here.
We leave the boat, take the gold.
Who's with me?
I'm with the gold, man.
Gold.
The gold.
- Epps?
- I just want to get off this boat.
Okay. Let's go to work.
GREER: Warrior is in position, Murph.
Can we please get the hell out of here?
Yeah, precjosa! Smell that money!
100 million. You hear what I'm saying?
100 million!
Greer? Get those engines going.
MURPHY:
I'm bringing the gold down.
Yes, sir, captain, sir.
Hey, Santos. Hurry your ass up, vato. We almost got the gold. Andale!
I wanna see these gauges rocking, because you just had an overhaul.
SANTOS: And you, I want you to give me some too.
Let's do this!
SANTOS:
Hey, yo, Greer! Fire it up!
We're going to haul ass.
Bring it on! We'll be so fucking rich!
GIRL:
Stop!
Stop! You don't know what you're doing!
We're good to go, skipper.
Don't start the boats! He'll...
Shit!
Greer!
What the hell happened?
DODGE:
Jesus Christ! Fire on deck!
EPPS:
Santos! Greer! Munder!
I got you.
JACK: Epps! I got Munder!
- Greer!
Come on!
Santos!
Santos, answer me!
Santos!
I don't know what happened.
The engine room just blew.
Maybe Santos rushed the engines, didn't seal up the gaskets right...
Jack, did you find anything out about this ship before you sent us out here?
No, but I... Look, we've got the gold, and we are still alive.
- Tell that to Santos, asshole!
- Ease up!
This is bullshit!
Santos came here out of free will...
...just like us.
- What does that mean?
- Enough!
DODGE: Santos is dead because of you!
Come on! It's not gonna bring him back.
Murph, it's not your fault.
You know that.
Murph...
DODGE:
How is he?
Here's the plan. We're professional salvors with a fortune onboard.
I say we do what we do best:
Fix this rust bucket.
Control her drift. Clear those islands.
We can survive long enough to get picked up.
Why is this a question?
We have the materials.
Why don't we build a raft and leave?
There is something wrong with this boat!
- Lf we stay here, we may not survive.
- You want to build a raft?
- I want to build a raft.
- Even with the Warrior...
...we were stretching to do this in three days. We can't do this.
You're the best spot-welder I know.
We can do it right now, but I need you.
Fine. But there's no way we're doing a major patch-and-pump in the dark.
Even with the lights we have, it'd be like going in blind.
Okay, fine. We'll chill tonight and go in the a.m.
Greer? What do you say?
Now you want to know what the first mate has to say?
I say go to hell, Epps. You're not qualified to get us off this ship.
Had Murphy let me do it my way, we wouldn't be in this.
- And the Coast Guard...
- So it's everybody else's fault, right?
They'd be here and we'd be on our way home, millionaires.
MUNDER:
That's bullshit.
Grow up, asshole.
Fucking bitch! Keep fucking talking.
Say another word!
Say another word!
EPPS:
Here it is. Katie. B-deck.
You were alone.
DODGE 100-to-1, someone poisoned the passengers to get the gold.
MUNDER: Okay, Sherlock, if they were poisoned, why are these cans safe?
DODGE: They're still sealed.
It's been sealed for 40 years. It's safe.
MUNDER:
Okay, shoot for it. Loser goes first.
- Ah! Paper beats rock.
- Come on, man, best of three.
- Bullshit. You lost.
- Where's your empathy?
Winners do not empathize with losers. Bon appétit.
I screwed up.
I should've called it in.
Damn! I knew better!
I'll make it home to you, baby.
I swear.
What the hell are you looking at?
- That's all right.
- No way.
No, really. It's good.
Look, I'm not kidding.
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious. It's good!
- Oh, wow. You gotta try that!
- That's good!
That's great!
Katie?
EPPS:
Katie?
DODGE: Can I tell you something else?
We get back...
...l'm gonna take my money and I'm gonna buy you a bathtub.
I'll get you a lifetime supply of titty magazines and toilet paper!
I already beat you to it, bro!
There's something on your...
Katie?
Who, me?
Francesca, I know all of this isn't real.
So I'm just gonna go with it, okay?
Can't cheat on your fiancée with a dead girl, right?
Her parents.
KATIE:
Please.
Don't close it.
Havert seen them for years.
They moved to New York.
I was on my way to join them.
But they're dead now.
EPPS: How would you know?
- When you're like this...
...you know these things.
My mother...
...she made me this dress.
Do you like it?
You remind me of her.
I don't think so.
Well, here. You should have this back.
Oh, God, you really are a fucking ghost.
Where are you going?
Santos. Povero Santos.
Santos was my goddamn responsibility.
- The Lorelei.
- She was adrift. We rescued her.
MURPHY:
I've heard the story of the Lorelej.
I didn't know the Graza was involved.
The gold was onboard the Lorelej?
It says here, "May 19, 1962."
That's two days before your ship disappeared.
There were no survivors onboard the Lorelej.
Jesus Christ!
Where you going?
Most spirits are free to be with their families.
So why aren't you with yours?
- We're all trapped here.
- Who?
My shipmates and I.
Even the ones who aren't marked.
Marked?
Katie, what do you mean?
When the boat's full...
What? You can tell me.
When he has all the souls he needs and has filled his quota...
...we'll all be ferried...
...to...
What is it? What's wrong?
- What is it?
- He doesn't want me talking to you.
- He who?
- But I'm not like the others!
You need to tell me.
You must go at once.
Leave the ship while you still can!
Katie, what is it?
Katie! Katie?
MURPHY:
Epps?
Come on!
We have to leave.
Where you going, Murphy? Huh?
What's the matter? It's me.
Santos.
It's no fun lying at the bottom of the ocean.
No lights at the end of the tunnel.
Not for me, Murph.
No 10,000 virgins at the pearly gates. No.
Because of the plan, I'm trapped on this dreamboat of yours.
So you know what?
You're coming along for the ride.
No!
Murphy?
Murph?
You all right, Murph?
You okay?
- What's the matter, Murph?
- It's me!
EPPS: It's me!
- Do it, come on. It'll make you feel good.
Come on!
- Come on!
JACK: Hey!
Oh, God.
Epps, you okay?
JACK: Keep him in the aquarium.
EPPS: No, listen. He was drunk.
He didn't know what he was doing.
Look, he just tried to kill you.
He stays in there.
DODGE:
Let's go find Greer.
EPPS:
Any sign of him?
MUNDER:
No, we looked all over.
DODGE: Mars pissed off.
Seems to happen on this boat.
DODGE: Least we werert around in '62.
- The passengers were poisoned...
...to get to the gold? Isn't that...?
- Extreme? Maybe, but if the shoe fits...
Next thing you know, we'll be trying to kill each other.
- What's with the heart?
- Found it. Belonged to this little girl.
- What girl?
- She told me to get off this boat.
- She's talking to you now?
- What are you talking about?
MUNDER: You're seeing ghosts, Epps?
- Just forget it.
So the ship's got a few kinks.
Let's stick with Munder's specs and try to fix the ship.
No way five people and the gold will fit on any raft.
Murphy's not going anywhere, and we're not leaving him here.
We stick with the plan. Fix the boat.
Let's get going. Come on.
MUNDER
That's the collision bulkhead hatch.
DODGE: Wheel's busted. It won't open.
EPPS: Arming the C4.
EPPS: Dodge?
DODGE: I'm good.
EPPS: Munder?
MUNDER: I'm good.
EPPS:
Contact.
MUNDER: There's the tear, portside.
DODGE: Looks bigger from here.
MUNDER:
I'll shut her up, no problem.
EPPS:
Munder, rudder's fixed. You all right?
MUNDER:
I'm good.
EPPS: What do you think, Dodge?
DODGE: She'll hold.
MUNDER: We're set with the pumps.
- Start them up.
MUNDER: Copy that, Epps.
One and two, kicking in.
DODGE: I give it 12 hours till she's dry.
MUNDER: Both on full.
MUNDER:
Get ready, Epps. Here it comes.
EPPS:
Great work, guys.
EPPS:
Damn. Current's faster than I thought.
If we control her drift, headed in this direction, we should clear those islands.
We'll keep it afloat until we get picked up.
DODGE: Son of a bitch.
We may just get out of this yet.
Kazillionaires.
Check on the bridge when you're done here.
I'll see if I can find Greer down below.
EPPS:
Greer?
Greer?
Katie?
Greer? Jesus!
- Oh, shit.
- Number two's clogged. Who's going?
You go.
Shit. Every single time!
Oh, my God.
KATIE:
Come with me.
I want to show you something.
Murphy.
Murphy!
No!
Come on! No!
Come on!
You can't die on me!
Dodge. Murphy's dead.
- What?
- We have to get off this boat.
There's a reason you, me and Munder are still alive. That's why he came after us.
- To fix his ship.
- I just saw Murphy. What's happening?
I don't know.
I want you and Dodge on the rudder.
- But you just said...
- Listen to me.
I'll get Munder, we'll see if the welds are holding. Stay here till we get back.
I do not want you out of each other's sight. Take this.
Take it.
- Be careful down there.
- I will.
Munder!
- That's it, then. We made it.
- For now.
- I'll check on Epps.
- No, she said to wait here.
- Yeah, but...
- Hey, she said to wait! So wait.
You disgust me.
- What did you say?
- You heard me.
You're a pathetic excuse for a man.
She says, "Jump," and you jump.
You're disgusting.
I don't have time for this.
- Who the hell are you?
- The question is, who are you?
You worship her, yet you've never had the balls to tell her...
...because you're a weak, cowardly child.
However, if you'll kindly step out of my way, I'll make your dream a reality.
You know, Dodge, if you kill somebody, you go to hell.
Well, you live for her.
You willing to die for her?
DODGE:
Epps.
I shot Ferriman. He's dead.
Yeah? Don't be so sure, Dodge.
- What are you doing?
- Trip's over. I'm sinking the boat.
- It's taken its last victim.
- That'll kill us.
- We'll have to take our chances.
- What about the gold?
Fucking kidding? We're not getting the gold off this boat. Nobody ever does.
Wait, wait. Wait!
That gold can give us everything we ever wanted.
We could have our own boat.
The two of us.
We could have a life together.
You and me.
What are you talking about?
Dodge, we gotta get out of here. Now.
Well, I can't let you do that.
So that's it, huh?
All right. Okay.
You win. All right.
Fucking bitch!
All right, you win! Go ahead, do it!
Go ahead. Blow it up!
Kill us all!
Hey, Dodge. Why haven't you asked me where Munder is?
Well, I suppose that's because...
...I already know.
- You won't pull that trigger, Maureen.
- Try me.
Dodge made the same mistake.
He's dead.
Katie told you, didn't she?
Souls without sin can't be marked.
Makes them tough to control.
But as long as I keep the boat afloat, we'll all go down together.
- What the fuck are you?
- I'm a salvager.
Just like you.
You collect ships, I collect souls.
And when I fill my quota,
I send a boatload home.
This will make management happy.
You see, it's a job.
Given to me after a lifetime of sin.
So if I lose this ship, management won't be happy, which is not a good thing.
I'm not getting through to you.
I'm asking for an exchange.
This ship for your life.
I want my crew back.
Sorry. Once a passenger's marked, they're mine.
Then I guess it's over.
All you had to do was fix the ship!
I gave you a great opportunity.
All you had to do was take it.
What are you gonna do, shoot me?
Careful. Hang in there, ma'am.
No!
Puppet, sir.
Only 10 piastres.
They're crap, squirrel.
They fall apart before you're out of the door.
Five then, sir.
It's handmade!
Please.
My sister, she's very, very sick.
I know your sister.
She's peddling in the next bar over.
- Do you know my mother?
- No.
She's very, very sick.
I'll give you two.
That's a bad idea, you know.
Like feeding pigeons.
- Do I know you?
- My name is Semelier.
I work for a private collector of rare antiquities.
- I cabled you last week.
- Yes.
And I didn't answer.
There's been a discovery in East Africa.
A Christian church, circa 5 A.D.
No, it's not possible.
The Byzantine Empire had adopted Christianity at that time... but they never got that far south.
Nevertheless, there it sits.
The British have financed a dig to uncover this church.
We believe a rare object waits inside.
We'd like you to find it and bring it back to us.
So you think I'm a thief?
Now you think I'm a thief and a whore.
No. Simply a man who's lost faith... in everything except himself.
Ah.
You know nothing about me.
You're an Oxford-educated archaeologist... an expert in religious icons.
You were a priest before the war.
So what happened?
This is a leather impression of the artifact we're looking for... a representation of a mythical demon.
It's Sumerian. What makes you think it's in a church in Africa?
A Major Granville in Nairobi is in charge of the dig.
He's been persuaded to let you join it.
You're assuming that I will say yes.
You already have.
March! Left.
Left, right, left. Left.
Left. Left, right, left.
Left. Left. Left, right, left.
Left.
Left, right, left.
Left. Left. Left, right, left.
Mr. Merrin, sir.
The major will see you now.
Beautiful, aren't they?
It's a hobby from school days.
Works wonders for the nerves.
You should try it sometime.
What can you tell me about the dig?
The location is a remote area of the Turkana district... called Derati.
It was discovered several months ago by a detachment of my men... on maneuvers there.
When the powers that be realized its importance, they organized a dig.
What have they learned so far?
That it's a church where no church should be.
This is Father Francis.
He'll be accompanying you to Derati.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you,
Father Merrin.
- I've read all your work at seminary.
- It's Mr. Merrin.
I was especially impressed with your treatise on the Roman rituals.
I'm no longer a part of that. I'm sure you didn't come here to discuss Catholic rituals.
I was actually headed to Kenya to begin missionary work... when Rome learned of the discovery.
They've asked me to make sure the site's religious aspect have the proper consideration.
Hmm.
How come you've opened the site to the Vatican?
We haven't... officially.
You're both my guests.
Tell me, have you any theories on who might have built this church?
Well, not until I've seen it.
Surely the Vatican has some record of its creation.
I'm afraid not.
We're as in the dark about it as you are.
- How long have you been with the dig, Chuma?
- Since the beginning.
The British hired me as an interpreter.
What happened here?
Plague. Ravaged the valley
50 years ago.
- How many died?
- All of them.
I'm Lancaster Merrin.
Major Granville should have contacted you about my joining the dig.
He did.
Is something bothering you, mate?
No.
- I'd like to see the dig site as soon as possible.
- You drink, Merrin?
I shouldn't... but my will is weak.
Then you might just survive this place.
I understand you've uncovered the church dome... but that progress has slowed down.
You could say that.
Right, Doctor?
- I'm Sarah Novak. Very nice to meet you.
- Lancaster- Lancaster Merrin.
You still haven't made it by my room, Doctor.
I've been having this, uh, swelling in the evening.
Thought you might have something I could put on it.
How about a muzzle?
So how are the interior excavations coming along?
- They're not.
- No?
Has the structure collapsed?
No, the church is perfect... but none of the men will enter, those we have left anyway.
Why's that?
I shall be leaving for the dig in five minutes.
Well... pleasant fellow.
What's wrong with his face?
Other than that it's attached to his body?
Could be an allergic reaction or some kind oflocalized infection.
Do you know why the men won't enter the church?
- Evil spirits.
- Oh.
- If you believe the Turkana.
- And do you?
No. I'm a doctor.
But as a priest, surely you must believe in such things.
I'm an archaeologist.
I'm not a priest.
Now, that's funny.
I met Father Francis outside, and he told me you were.
Did he?
Well, he is mistaken.
Father Merrin.
This is Emekwi.
He's donating the use of a room in his hotel for the mission school.
Father, we are so glad that you are here.
These are my sons,
James and Joseph.
- Hello,James,Joseph.
- They are learning the Bible.
- We are, uh, Christians.
- Hmm.
- Emekwi, can you see to Mr. Merrin's bags?
- Oh, of course.
James. Joseph.
Very nice meeting you, Doctor.
There's your goddamn church.
Is this your first assignment, Father?
Before this, I was studying in the archives in the Holy Sea.
The Vatican.
Impressive.
But not really training for missionary work, is it?
This is strange.
It's 1,500 years old.
It should be badly weathered.
It's almost as if it were buried right after it was built.
Chuma.
Where's Jefferies?
I need to go into the church.
Hyenas?
They've been here ever since we started digging.
Even at daytime?
No! No! No!
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know.
The heat?
Joseph?
Are you out here by yourself?
It's dangerous.
- I'm collecting rocks.
- I can see that.
I think you're about ready for this now.
It's a tool for professional diggers.
Wow.
His seizure's stopped.
I wanted to keep him at the hospital for observation... but the Turkana have stopped trusting my medicine.
Well, that must make your job very hard.
You have no idea.
Thank you.
So what is it you hope to find here?
The answer to why a church was built here a thousand years before Christianity arrived.
- You were a priest once, weren't you?
- Yes, I was.
Black bastards!
Bloody savages!
Can't wipe their own ass without instruction.
- I have to get back to town.
- Wait.
I, uh- I found this... and, uh, I want you to have it.
It's a St. Joseph, for luck.
Please, for my behavior.
- Thank you.
- Oi, oi! What the hell are you doing?
- Get the fuck out of here, you little scab!
- Don't!
- Joseph, wait.
- Don't do that.
All right, Merrin.
I didn't know you was a fuzzy lover.
It's okay. Come.
These little buggers, they get in everywhere.
How soon can you have the doors to the church uncovered?
A few days.
- And in the meantime, how do we get in?
- We don't.
Chuma'll take you in through the roof.
Following us, Father?
Is it safe to walk around?
Let's see.
Lucifer.
The Lord's favorite angel.
Cast out after the war in heaven.
Can't even trust angels, can you?
- You ever seen anything like it?
- Not this far from Rome.
It's odd.
Churches were built to exalt heaven... but this, the weapons are pointing downward.
Look behind you, Father.
Desecration of Christ.
Who would do something like this?
The crucifix was broken off from here.
Chuma, is there an inventory of what's been found here?
I wouldn't know.
Who would know?
'Cause this place has been vandalized.
Probably the lead archaeologist,
Monsieur Bession.
So where can I find him?
I need to talk to him.
- It's not possible.
- Why not?
He's gone mad.
No one's been inside Bession's tent since he fell ill?
They are superstitious.
- And you?
- Not superstitious. Smart.
- Chuma.
- Yes?
- Where's Bession now?
- A sanitorium in Nairobi.
- How long has he been gone?
- A few weeks.
- And he can read and write Aramaic?
- Sorry?
The language spoken in Palestine at the time of Christ.
And what does it say?
The fallen shall rise... in a river of blood. "
Do you have a moment?
Of course.
Can I get you some tea?
Or maybe something more substantial?
Yes, that would be very nice.
You dabble in the occult?
I found them here when I arrived.
I wanted to ask you, did you treat Bession?
You should let me clean that before it gets infected.
There was nothing I could do for Monsieur Bession.
He had no medical symptoms... nothing to suggest any kind of disease or infection.
His breakdown was purely mental and extremely severe.
That's why the Turkana fear the church is cursed.
That and the disappearances.
In the past few weeks, we've lost a dozen men.
Runaways?
Or is it those evil spirits?
Yeah.
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have.
- Your curiosity's perfectly natural.
My father was a strong man.
When the Nazis started rounding up theJews in our town... he didn't hesitate.
He hid our neighbors in the crawl space.
But someone turned us in... and we were all sent to the concentration camps.
I'm sorry.
People can't really understand, can they?
If they weren't there... if they didn't see.
No.
And my husband turned out to be one of those people.
I met him after the war, and we came to Africa together, in love.
One night I realized
I- I had to tell him the truth... about... the Nazis... and what they did to me.
After that, he never touched me again.
So... what turns a man of the cloth into an archaeologist?
I don't know.
I suppose I-
I wanted to work with something real, something I could touch with my hands.
Do you miss it?
Being a priest.
No.
There's no point in that.
Sometimes I think the best view of God is from hell.
I should get to bed.
I'm going to Nairobi tomorrow to see Bession.
- Talk to Father Gionetti.
- Gionetti?
He runs the sanitarium.
Well, thank you... for the medical care.
Deliver us from evil... for thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory forever.
Amen.
You, priest.
What is your name?
I'm Father Merrin.
God is not here today, priest.
Want some water?
Hey, what's wrong?
It's late.
You should go back to bed.
Give it to me! It's mine!
- Oh, is it yours?
- Give it to me!
- Mr. Merrin gave it to me.
- Here, take it.
- Take it!
- Oh,just give it to me, you idiot!
Who you calling idiot?
Take it! It's right here.
Give it to me!
It's mine.
- Shorty. Shorty. Shorty.
- Just give it to me!
All right. Okay, okay.
Go back to bed, and I'll give you the stupid thing.
Joseph, look out!
Joseph, get Papa!
Get Papa!
Joseph, help me!
Joseph, please, get Papa quickly.
No! Help me!
Help! Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me! Please!
- What happened?
- Hyenas. They toreJames apart.
Did you see that, Lancaster?
The hyenas ignored Joseph.
They were focused on his brother.
That was a lot more than focused.
They acted as if he wasn't even there.
Can you see?
Can you hear?
Come with me.
Monsieur Bession?
Mr. Bession.
You worked on a dig in Derati.
You drew a picture of an idol.
Where did you see it?
Was it in the church?
Mr. Bession.
- Father Merrin.
- How do you know my name?
I said how do you know my name?
Are you hurt?
No.
I'm free.
God is not here today, priest.
I hope he finds peace.
I'm Father Gionetti.
I've been waiting for you.
How did he know my name?
Have you drifted so far from God, Merrin, that you can't see?
Monsieur Bession was touched by the devil.
Demonic possession?
Forgive me, Father.
I never said he was possessed.
Only touched.
So, "touched. "
What does that mean?
In 1647, the Ursuline Convent in Loudon, France... was plagued by possession.
Thirty-four nuns had been touched by the devil... committing unspeakable acts.
Having orgies including goats doesn't make them possessed.
Simply horny... and inventive.
Four priests were dispatched to exorcise the demons.
Three of them were possessed themselves and subsequently died.
The last one was driven insane by his brush... with evil.
That is what happened to Monsieur Bession.
And that evil remains in Derati.
You must be careful there.
Remember, he is the father of lies.
He will seek to poison your mind.
You will need this against him.
The Roman Rituals.
If you need somebody to perform an exorcism, I'm not your man.
I'm not a priest anymore.
You will always be a priest,
Father Merrin.
Only your faith can save you.
Well, then I'm doomed.
Joseph?
What do you have there?
Can I see?
You threw it away.
- Jefferies, what the hell are you doing in here?
- It was in the dirt outside.
- You threw it away.
- No, I didn't.
- The clasp must have come loose-
- Liar!
Do I repulse you that much?
Maybe if you could cure my fucking face...
I might look as good to you as that archaeologist.
- Joseph?
- He's coming for you.
What?
He's coming for you.
- What happened?
- I had a bad dream.
Ohh.
Don't worry.
You'll be fine.
Where is everybody?
Sebituana's baby is coming, so the village has gathered in welcome.
Oh.
Joseph. Hey.
Joseph.
You're back.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm just a little bit tired.
These lesions- they're not from the shock, are they?
No.
They're completely asymptomatic.
Itjust doesn't make sense.
- He should have recovered by now.
- So what is it?
In this part of the world... it could be a dozen things... but his symptoms don't really match any of them.
So all I can do is just watch and wait.
I have to do some work up at the dig.
- Will you be all right?
- Hmm. Yes.
Come sit with me, Lancaster.
I promise I won't bite.
What is it?
- How was Nairobi?
- Oh, fine.
- Did you see Monsieur Bession?
- He's dead.
- How?
- I don't know.
Some accident.
I just don't understand everything that's happening here.
It seems like I can't help anyone anymore.
Hey.
Easy.
Help me hold him.
Emekwi. I'm doing everything I can for him.
It's this place, Lancaster.
The Turkana are right.
- It's cursed.
- Sarah.
You don't understand.
What they did to me in the camp. They-
There's nothing left to bleed.
There is something here, something evil.
Sarah, it's so much easier to believe in evil as an entity... but it's not.
It's a purely human condition inside all of us.
Did Bession talk about what he found under the church?
There's an ancient temple below, a pagan place... where they used to conduct sacrifices, human sacrifices.
Why would they build a church on top of something like that?
Perhaps to purify the site.
But then why bury it?
No!
Merrin!
You better come with me.
Jefferies didn't show up for the dig this morning.
He wasn't in his room, so they came to the bar and they found-
Chief Sebituana's baby was stillborn last night.
He blames the whites.
You think the Turkana tookJefferies?
I think this place is on the verge of an uprising.
I've contacted Major Granville.
A detachment will be here by this afternoon.
You disagree?
In my experience, bringing soldiers into a situation is always a bad idea.
Who buried them?
Everybody died.
Who buried them?
All right! Halt!
- Major Granville.
- Hello, Peter.
Come on! Out you get!
Move it, Wilkins!
- Any answers on Jefferies?
- I'm afraid not.
Well, you did the right thing calling me, Father.
I've been in these situations before... and you have to stay on top of- on top of these people.
I'm not sure the Turkana are responsible for what's happening here, Major.
Major Granville?
This dig is too important to jeopardize... and until I'm satisfied that the excavation is secure... the British Army will assume complete control.
The Turkana won't like the show of force.
I'm not concerned with what the Turkana like, Mr. Merrin!
If they start any more trouble, they will have to answer... to the might of His Majesty King George.
You cannot be here.
Please tell Sebituana
I'm sorry for his loss.
You are not welcome here.
I want to know about the plague that destroyed this village 50 years ago.
It was not a plague.
So, what was it?
The evil in your church... it has taken Emekwi's youngest son... and it is getting stronger.
You must abandon your work... or we'll be forced to stop you.
So you don't want to tell me?
He says he doesn't have to tell you because it's happening again... right now.
- You don't bury your dead. You cremate them.
- Yes.
Then who's buried in that graveyard?
I'm sorry.
What are you-
- I'm sorry.
- Daddy.
I will shoot 10, priest, and you will choose.
I can't do that.
No! No!
Now you choose... or I will kill them all.
Are you praying... to God?
Shoot me.
God is not here today, priest.
Papa!
- They're empty!
- What?
I dug up three graves.
They were all empty. What happened here?
- I-I don't know.
- Oh, yes, you do.
- You've been lying to me since we got here.
- Let go of me.
Damn it!
There are crosses on the graves!
There are crosses on the coffins!
The church buried them, didn't they?
Didn't they?
Yes.
Why?
What were they hiding?
That this place is damned.
No! You asked the question!
Now you're gonna listen to the answer!
There was a massacre here...
1,500 years ago.
An army from the west, led by two priests... searching for the origin of a powerful evil.
But when they got here that evil consumed them... turning the soldiers against each other in a bloodbath.
Only a single priest survived.
When that priest made it back to the EmperorJustinian... he ordered that a church be built over the site and then buried... to seal the evil inside.
All mention of it was to be stricken from the history texts forever.
But it wasn't?
No.
In 1893... a Vatican researcher found an ancient letter in the archives.
Four priests came to examine the site... enlisting the help of the people of this valley in their search... and they all disappeared.
Where did they go?
No one knows.
The Vatican ordered a cover-up- the false graveyard... the tale of a plague to- to scare people away.
And then the British stumbled across it.
And I was sent here to see if the legend was real.
What legend?
That after the war in heaven... this is the spot where Lucifer fell.
God brought you here, Lancaster.
Leave me alone.
No.
The devil is here... inside that boy.
The Turkana know it.
They came to drive the devil from him, and he almost killed them.
You can't run from this.
You must help me.
I can't.
But you've seen what's going on here.
You have to believe.
I believe in nothing.
Found Jefferies.
- Over there!
- As you were!
Major Granville!
Wait!
Get him down.
Get him down!
You all right, Major?
Savages.
Major! Major!
- Bloody savages.
- Why are you here?
- Granville!
- You have no business to be here!
- You must leave.
- Granville!
- You people have plundered our ancestors.
- Granville!
You must return Turkana to us now.
- Let me through!
- It is time to go.
You have already polluted our lives.
You came here with your evil.
We knew peace before you came.
Granville!
No!
No! No!
No!
They think it's insideJoseph!
They believe the evil is upon us!
Chuma!
Merrin.
They believe it is inside Joseph.
They are going to kill him.
Now, please... go!
You animals!
- Turn this way!
- I don't like it. Come on!
Three boxes of ammunition!
Sir. The Turkana are preparing to attack.
Leave me.
Sir?
I said, leave me.
Yes, sir.
We must leave now.
Why?
- Where's Sarah?
- I don't know.
Take the boy to Nairobi.
Father Gionetti.
Why?
Turkana are coming to kill him.
It's a sandstorm.
It won't let us leave.
We have to hide him.
- The church.
- No!
The Turkana won't go in there.
It's his only chance.
- Aren't you coming?
- I have to find Sarah.
We'll meet you.
Francis!
Now go.
Sarah?
The Lord is coming for you.
Sarah?
Sarah!
In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sanctu.
- Steady now!
- Pick it up, mate!
Sarah?
Sarah!
Oh, my God.
Bession was Sarah's husband?
Yes.
She went into the church with him, didn't she?
It's notJoseph.
It's Sarah.
Sancti Michael Archangel-
Ready yourselves, men!
Fire!
Chuma!
Francis?
Francis.
Francis.
O Lord, forgive my disbelief.
I need you.
These people need you.
This valley needs you.
Hear my cry.
Do not abandon me now.
Forgive my sins.
Joseph.
Come sit with us, Lancaster.
I promise I won't bite!
Joseph, run.
- He's mine.
- Run!
Leave him alone.
It's me you want.
I am a fallen priest.
Lord, have mercy on us.
Christ, have mercy on us.
Lord, have mercy on us.
God, Father in heaven, have mercy on us.
God, the Son, redeemer of the world, have mercy on us.
God, the Holy Spirit, have mercy on us.
Christ, hear us.
Holy Mary, pray for us.
Christ, hear us.
- Lord, have mercy on us.
- What's the matter, Merrin?
Don't you want to fuck me anymore?
All ye holy angels and archangels... pray for us!
All ye holy orders of blessed spirits, pray for us!
Why would he listen to you?
You.
You believe in nothing.
You're all alone.
Without hope.
Almighty Lord... and father ofJesus Christ... grant me, your unworthy servant, pardon for all my sins... and the power to fight this cruel-
Joseph, come on.
Don't be afraid.
No! Father!
Joseph!
Father, help me!
- Help me! Help me!
- Joseph!
Father Merrin!
Merrin!
O Lord, by your name save me.
By your strength defend my cause.
No!
- Father!
- Joseph?
Joseph!Joseph!
Wait!
Joseph.
Father!
I'm coming.
O God, hear my prayer.
The ruthless seek my life.
They do not keep God before them.
Turn back the evil upon my foes.
In your faithfulness destroy them.
Where's your God now, Merrin?
Fucking his only son while you call out his name?
He doesn't care about this whore.
But you do... because you want to shove your rotten cock up her juicy ass.
You can't have her, priest.
The whore is mine.
And I'll kill her before
I let you take her from me.
From the souls made to the image and likeness of God...
I cast you out!
You're a killer, Merrin.
You looked them in the eye, pointed your finger, and they died.
God is not here today, priest.
Oh, yes, he is.
You're going to watch him die, Merrin.
Fail him like you failed all the others.
God, spare this child, for he is innocent... and deserves your blessing.
God, spare this child... for he is innocent... and deserves your blessing.
God, spare this child, for he is innocent and deserves your blessing.
I command you to depart!
It's the power of Christ that compels you!
It is God himself who commands you.
It's the majestic Christ who commands you!
God, the Father, commands you.
God, the Son, commands you.
God, the Holy Spirit, commands you.
The mystery of the cross commands you!
Unclean spirit, I cast you out!
- Lancaster.
- Sarah.
Sarah.
It's over now.
Joseph.
Merrin!
Father!
Don't be afraid.
I need your help,Joseph.
Listen, whatever you hear, whatever you see, it's just his lies.
Don't listen. Don't watch.
You understand?
Don't listen!
It's just lies.
You have to be strong and concentrate.
Can you read this?
I will start there.
Then you will answer.
That's me. That's you.
That's me, and that's you.
You understand?
Good.
Let's start.
O God... by your name save me.
Amen. "
Save your servant.
Who places his trust in thee, my God. "
Be unto her, O Lord, a fortified tower. lln the face of the enemy. "
O Lord, hear my prayer.
And let my cry come unto thee. "
- The Lord be with you.
- And also with you. "
Begone, evil spirit... in the name of the Father and of the Son... and of the Holy Ghost!
By the sign of this holy cross... by our Lord Jesus Christ...
God, the Holy Ghost, commands you!
The blood of the martyrs commands you!
In God's name, demon...
I cast you out!
Sarah?
Sarah.
Okay?
Thank you.
Look, um-
Sarah, what is it?
What is it, Sarah?
Lancaster!
- No!
- Help-
Sarah.
- No!
- Help-
Sarah.
Father?
She's with God now.
She's with God.
I trust your mission was successful.
I couldn't find what you were looking for.
But you found something.
Didn't you?
Good-bye, Mr. Semelier.
Au revoir, Mr. Merrin.
It's Father Merrin.
Give me back my head
Give me back my head
Give me back my head
Get away!
CUT! CUT! CUT!
Hey! Why did you scream?
I was scared so I screamed
Are you OK, Bou? Hard work?
I am fine
Dad said I could earn $500 once I finished the stand-in job
I was scared when he felt down, then I screamed
I was so scared
Do you know what fear is?
Director, this is the most horrible time I have had
You have to present your fear from the bottom of your heart and then express it, don’t you understand?
You had better try
OK
Give me a bottle of water
Have some first
He scolds people on the first day
His nickname is James Cameron
The whole industry knows that he has the worst temper
You are lucky to work for him
Take a break over there, don't block up the others
You are not running madly around
You have to present your fear from the bottom of your heart and express it, do you understand?
Try and let me have a look
That's it!
Are you using your buttocks to think?
You and you, give her the tape
That Fiona acted like shit
It's fine if you say this in front of me, but not the others
Why?
Fiona's godfather is the boss of this movie
Remember. Mind your mouth
Go there and help
CFO, are you paying for the supper?
Egg sandwiches and milk tea
Egg sandwiches are very expensive
Just toast is fine, and don't go to Hing Kei, go to next door Wai Kei
Milk tea there is one dollar cheaper
OK! Quick!
Game boy? Could we play together?
Is Tom Cool your real name or stage name?
Fiona, did you zip up?
Yes. Yes, that's good
What do you want?
Want to take advantage of me?
No, I did ask you before
No wonder everybody called you a pervert
My name is Wong Chou Shui, not pervert
You are so cheap
I am so polite, just kidding
Don't be so small-minded, next time I will hold you really tight
You and you
Director, what's the matter?
Supper is on the way, your sandwiches are baked with extra egg
I don't want to go ahead, let's knock off
Knock off
Director, we only shot one scene today
I have booked so many things, the boss won't be happy about this
Don't worry.
I will take all the responsibility
You and you. What's up, Director?
The haunted house for tomorrow...
No problem, I can manage
OK, make sure everything is done
No problem
May coming
May, we have problems
What about that haunted house?
Don't worry, I will arrange it tomorrow
Knock off now
Knock off
Knock off, let's pack up
Knock off
Knock off
Leo, speed up, how come you are so slow
After checking the spot,
I still need to send out the notice
May, the most important thing for driving is safety
Better late than never
What happened?
Are you OK?
Did you see anything in front?
Nothing, what's wrong? We are in hurry
Let's go
Here is great
Exactly what the Director wants
Wait for me
Here is just great
What kind of movie are you making?
That you need to find a house like this?
Ghost movie. Didn't you pay attention to what we talked about?
Is that really a ghost movie? Yes
Great, this is just the right place for the day after tomorrow
Watch out
Great! Let's go upstairs and have a look
You had better be careful
These things again
This is the right house, and suits what the Director wants
But it's really scary
Let me go over there and have a look
It's so messy around here, nobody has taken care of it
You see! What a place this is
It's so ghastly even in the daytime
Looks like something really has happened here
By the time we fell in love
You always took me to those dark and quiet places
You never said that something exists
Nothing happened at that time
What?
We haven't done that yet
Done what?
Tackle me?
Leo
Are you sleeping naked again?
Nothing special, you have seen that before
I worried that the more I saw, the less interest I would have in you
No interest
I know how to turn you on
I have something to ask you
What?
How long we have known each other?
Let me really think about it
From the university
From the beginning up to year 2000
7 years
7 year itch
7 year itch, which means you had better sleep now
Who let you sleep?
May, May
Slept already
Are you really so tired?
No way, let's sleep
OK, just follow this
Camera, Roll
Rolling
Action
Cut...
You had worn this before
Pull it out, more freedom
What happened?
We lose the Ninagigi feel
Ninagigi, don't tell me these clothes cost twenty thousand dollars one set
Sir, look at him doesn't look like Dicaprio, or Kate Winslet
We are not shooting Titanic
Please pick something from Granville Road
Can't you respect my professionalism?
Be more serious
Then please respect your professionalism and immediately go to
Granville Road and pick some cheap clothes
Granville Road, Tsim Sha Tsui you had better go yourself
Director, should we go ahead?
Let me think
Director, don't you want to make changes again?
You are right, I don't know exactly what I want to shoot
Director, what should we do?
How about you imitate those Hollywood movies
Add a little bit of sex and a little bit of comedy
Hollywood movies are too easy to make
You and you
What's up, Director? get me a prop knife
I will inform you once
I think of anything to shoot
OK, no problem
May
Dazy,
How is your first day work?
Fine, thank you very much
For recommending this job to me
Don't mention it
May, did those extras arrive?
If not, just stop them
I don't think the Director can shoot that scene today
Waste of my money, how should I report this to my boss?
How come we also call the Producer CFO?
Because the CFO Leung Kam Chung is in charge of HK people's money
I am in charge of your money and pay your salary
My post is as important as his
Understand
If you understand, then go ahead with your work
Furthermore, let me tell you a secret
My name is also Leung Kam Chung
Ah Chun, did those extras arrive?
If not, stop them
You are still alive!
Are you OK?
In fact
How come everybody calls you Tom Cool
I know, it must because you always act so cool
That's why they all call you Tom Cool
Fiona
Director said we have to do a ghost make-up on you
What?
We did that yesterday. Again?
I don't know, I just follow orders
Why don't you go and ask the Director?
Of course I will ask him.
Or should I ask you?
Do it later
Gorgeous. Start today?
Yes
Let me give you a riddle
Guess what?
A girl is ready to get married but worries that her husband will find out that she is not a virgin
What happened at the end?
She went to see Dr Black Jack
And Dr Black Jack
Swapped her upper and lower organs
Guess what happens on her wedding day?
What?
What? What did you say, I can't hear
Of course, she can't
He moved her eardrum to the lower part
Did you hear that?
What, you are teasing me
Should we go out tonight?
Let's ask the Director
Director said we have to do a pretty ghost make-up on you
A pretty one
Quick, we hired you to do make-up, not chatting
Don't worry about him, should we go out tonight
Should we go?
Take the lamp there. Yes
You and you, Pervert
Be careful
You had better be careful, don't scratch my bag
Let's talk later
Sorry, we are only here for movie shooting
Hope you don't mind
Don't blame us
Director
Where did you hire that make-up artist?
I looked terrible
I...I only know how to do make up for corpses
So what?
What's matter? Director
Director, look
Great, stand up
Don't move
You and you
Yes, director
Hand held camera.....
Follow her upstairs, come back, turn 360 degrees
Have to show her face and attractive figure
OK, go, go, go
You and you, coming from the side until you see the dead face
You and you Yes
Bring me the props knife and cinerary casket
It's broken
Sorry, borrow it for a while.
Camera, Roll
Speed
Action
Cut, Good take, Yeah!
Leo, what are you doing?
I am waiting for you to pick me up
Please return my call as early as possible
Knock off
May, was your sexual life inharmonious?
Let me give you a riddle?
Get away
OK, but you have to go out with me
What?
What? Of course this is all your fault
Give me one
So high, so happy
Forget it, I don't want to obstruct your flirting around
Don't worry, Fiona, Wah
We are all going
But you have other dates
No matter what
I don't go to those places
Come on! Actor, let's go
It's better to get an early night, see you
Bastard
Wear a raincoat to swim, coke mixed with soya sauce
What are you thinking of? Don't pretend
Are you ready to go, pervert?
Yes, but let's all go home and have a shower first
Get changed and meet at the disco front door
Be quick. OK, what about you?
See you in a moment
What's wrong, out of batteries now?
Leo, what are you doing?
I am waiting for you to pick me up
Please return my call as soon as possible
Oh, No. What a coincidence!
I can't even return her call
Leo, Leo
Leo
It's really late, where did you go?
I love you so much
Could you marry me?
You don't believe that I really love you
I can dig out my heart and show you
I love you so much
Please marry me, come down and live with me
Come down and marry me
What happened? How come?
Hello
Don't be so sad
Leo drives carefully
It can't be an accident with him
It proved to be accident.
It's hard to explain
What about leaving early and going home?
I will inform the CFO accordingly
Director, I think Fiona
Could wear this one at the end and add something golden inside
What's this, a table cloth?
What about this one?
This lampshade is quite pretty
Lampshade?
It's the latest PKNY phantom style
There are only two available in Hong Kong
How much?
Three thousand something
Three thousand something
That's already a bargain
That YOYO shop asked for six thousand something
Because of second line, that's cheaper
OK, don't worry, you can buy me 9 Line
Granville Road 9 Line is OK
Second Line!
You and you, where is May?
Don't you go with her?
Director, her boyfriend
Just died in a traffic accident, she went home for a rest
My God!
Was that the Producer who wore a cap?
This case was really strange
Not exceeding the speed limit, but the car crushed like an organ
He was trapped inside and his head exploded
All brains spat out
Then he died
You are really the world's most exaggerating person
If it didn't exceed the speed limit, how could the car be crushed like an organ?
This is really true, Director
Both Chou Shui and I feel really strange
But just not dare to tell May
It's not strange, but peculiar
Why peculiar?
That day when we stepped into that haunted house
I had already felt that thing existed
And then I saw May
She had a bad complexion
Cannot believed that something now happened on her boyfriend
No bullshitting.
There are no ghosts in the world
I didn't say that I saw a ghost
I just said I saw something dirty
Come on
You studied Fine Art in New York
You have met so many westerners
Those subways are really dirty
They even have urine, are there any ghosts?
If you don't believe in the existence of ghosts, why do you make a ghost movie?
I am not gay
But I shot the movie
Very Happy Together
And won awards
At least I need to do as the Romans do while I am in Rome
We prayed and burnt joss sticks before we started shooting
OK, you follow me. I am a Christian, you find an exorcist and spread holy water
Both of you have truth in what you said
None of your business
None of your business
In conclusion, this case is not simple
You had better be careful, excuse me
Director
Where did you find this designer?
Such a bad temper
Why should I tell you?
What is their relationship?
Why do you want to know?
Watch out, it's hot
I bought something for you to try
Try what?
Guess?
Red Wine
No. No.
No. Try it first
Try it first
You try it first
What do you want?
What do you want? Very bitter
Was that bad, why don't you try the stuff I cooked?
Nothing
Who?
Are you scared of me?
I bought it for you specially, new stock
It's you, my wife
What, don't you think I'm someone else?
Of course not
But you suddenly rein me so tight
Ghost, Are you scared now?
Stand up, turn around and have a look
Am I scared?
There are no ghosts in the world
But you had better not to look at those spirits web sites all the time
Do you think you are a Taoist?
You had better shut up
Bi Bi
Honey
You always give me a hard time
Scold me in front of all those people
Thinking you are such a great Director and pretending you are an artist.
Disguising
I didn't and there is really no ghost in the studio
I just chat and can't I even say that?
Can't I say anything?
Bi Bi, stop
Why do you have to be ruthless to me?
I never play tricks on you
I really didn't
Don't move.....
Why do you have to be ruthless to me?
Let me burn you some joss sticks
Why?
No, we didn't
Amitabha! Amitabha!
Bi Bi, Bi Bi
Dear, why did you kick me down, it's freezing
Bi Bi
Don't threaten me
Your gang spent so much on the lunch boxes
Such a waste
CFO
May, are you feeling better?
Are you getting better after a few days off?
Slept for a few days and getting much better
I feel that you look much better and know how to dress up.
You look different now
I don't want you to tease me all the time in saying that I look like a boy
You know how to kid which means you've recovered
I was so worried about you that you can't forget that thing
Don't worry! I'm fine now
That's good, help me to sort out those figures immediately
I am so busy without you.
No problem
May
Bou's computer seems out of order
Can you help him?
OK, I haven't seen him for a long time
Bou, how come you kick so hard?
Catch it
May
Did you finish you homework?
All done
We have something extra tonight
May, my computer was out of order
Let me have a look later on
Since her mother left
Did she ever come back to visit him?
If she missed him, she won’t just leave like this
Let me get you some drink
Bou, what's wrong with the computer?
I don't know why, sometimes the whole screen is frozen
Let me see
Good
You do something else and
I will let you know after I fixed it.
Have some water first, no time to make tea
CFO
Don't you think that relationships between people is very strange
They could go together easily and then separate for no reasons
You are talking about yourself or myself?
I am talking about myself
I feel that there is something unusual about Leo's death
I have told you not to think too much
I have many strange hallucinations
I suspected that there was something ghastly in my house
How come, don't think too much
You eat here tonight and let me cook you dinner
Bou, I have already removed all those unnecessary files
Thank you, May
Let's play ball
OK Let's go
Now I see you are OK, I feel much better
Sorry to make you worry about me
I don't know what I should say
Don't' mention it. We are good friends
Because we are good friends
I will tell you everything
If I don't talk to you who else can I really talk to?
Do you know why I treat you so good so far?
Why?
Because you are pretty, and become more and more attractive
Don't tease me again
I touch your waist, you are so sexy!
I touch your tits, you are so annoying!
I touch you feet, you are....
How dare you talk like this, where did you learn this?
Pervert taught me
Pervert, pervert
Sorry!
I've told you not to play in the office
I don't want to do this.
I have to go first
Bye Bye
How come the drinks were so expensive?
Unless someone is going to pay. Crazy
Even the machine was out of order
Tomorrow you have two scenes to play
Tomorrow? I can't make it
What about the day after tomorrow?
I have given you all my schedules
Why didn't you check with me?
I can't make it either
You never gave them to me
Why don't you ask, how could you be an Associate Producer
CFO
You had better teach them
I have given her all my available schedules
She made everything a mess
OK, no problem. Any questions?
I will sort it out
What?
You cried because someone just blamed you
I didn't. People said distilled water helps skin care
In fact you knew how many movies
I have made
People here are like that
Strange temper, you knew that
Just like our Director
Never able to remember my name
Only call me you and you...
How do we know who did he call
That pervert
Sweet mouth and already took advantages on others
And that Fiona, thinks she is the most beautiful woman in the world
In fact, they are all big mouths
Only talk. They are nice people.
I know
That's good
And one more that Tom Cool
Always try to be cool, no fans like him
Always pretends he is very busy
Sometimes says he can make it, sometimes says no
He even treated me unjustly
Life is not easy
They are all big stars and need respect
So what, want them to apologise?
Just take this as a bonus
You can learn and earn money
Don't get upset, you know
I know, let me go out and issue the notices
Ding Dong Taoism
What do you want? It's so late. Stupid
Don't do these stupid things again.
Leo!
Hey
May, CFO
How come your mobile phone is always engaged?
CFO, I’m glad to hear you voice
Tomorrow has changed to 7 o'clock
Be on time, some big news is going to be announced
That's all, bye bye. OK
Don't you know what time is it now?
It's 7 o'clock. 5 o'clock notice but nobody show up until 7.
I have told you not to be late
What can we shoot for nobody?
Everyone is waiting for you
Director is really angry, what can I do?
They are on the way, where are they?
Almost here
Where did you go, you are 2 hours late
Where are those actors?
You didn't ask me to pick them up
Do I need to remind you of this?
This is your job
Do you want me to teach you everything all over again?
You go and find me one actor immediately
Sorry
Sorry?
You only know how to say sorry
It's no use to say sorry
What happened?
How come there is no car to pick me up?
I have spent a hundred something in taking a taxi, then what?
Sorry Fiona.
You do make up immediately.
Director is waiting.
Sorry. You have to pay me back
OK, no problem
Dazy, do make up immediately. Yes
Everybody has been waiting for 2 hours.
Do you know how much that costs?
If we cannot finish today, are you going to compensate?
Those actors either have to leave early or have no schedules available
You teach me how to do it
You always go out
I didn't
No. You go and explain to the Director later
You had better fix it.
Bou, what happened?
Dad went mad upstairs
You go and save him now
CFO
CFO
CFO
CFO
CFO, are you OK? Bou...
What do I have?
I am 40 years old but have accomplished nothing
My wife ran away because she hated that I am poor. What else do I have?
You have Bou
He is a good boy and always behaved so well
Bou
He will show his devotion and obedience to you in the future
Future, I don't have any future.
I am hopeless
I am the worst producer
Can't even earn much money
Don’t you think I don't want to go home after work?
Don't you think I don't want to treat my wife more nicely?
But we worked in unstable times
We have to pay for Bou's education fees
My wife said I am useless and poor and ran away with another man
CFO, please, how come you are useless?
All of you said I am useless
I know you all talked behind my back
Saying that I am brown nosing to the Director and irresponsible
Saying I know nothing
I only want my wife to respect me and treat me well
I will buy her anything she likes
I work so hard because
I wanted to buy her as much as I could
Why did she treat me like that?
Why did she run away with another man?
Don't think of the past
You will find a good wife for sure
You promise not to leave me
And marry me
CFO, I have to go first
You have to stay with me forever
Don't leave me
CFO
Marry me. Marry me please
You are the only person that treats me well in the world
Marry me. Marry me please
May, are you OK?
It's so dirty on the floor.
You wake up first
Why did you sit on the floor?
Did you issue the notice yet?
Tomorrow at 6 o'clock.
Are you able to wake up on time?
Tomorrow at 6 o'clock.
Are you able to wake up on time?
Did you give the notice to Director?
Dad, Dad, Dad
Bou, why didn't you bring the keys?
You went out and came back so late without taking your keys
I have cooked dinner for you, don't you know?
Where are we up to?
6 o'clock notice.
Are you able to wake up on time?
Remember on time
CFO
CFO
So painful, so painful
Are you OK?
May, how come I slept on the floor?
Let me bring you a glass of water
What happened?
Dad went mad upstairs
Please go and save him now
Please marry me and come down to stay with me
You are the only person who treats me well in this world
Nobody can take you away
Am I dreaming?
Hey!
Dazy, May
Could you come out now?
Are you OK? You sound terrible
I have something very important to tell you
OK, see you in the old place
May
Dazy, Dazy
Watch out
Dazy, are you OK?
I am fine
It's just like... someone pushed me out into the road
What happened?
I suspected that I ran across spirits
No. Ran across spirits
It's so true,
I don't know what I should say
I didn't go to the Disco
But the feeling is so real, just like having a dream
You had better think clearly
You said there was a mark on your arm when you woke up
It's here now
It's here
How come there's none?
I didn't lie
Calm down
When I used to wake up from a dream
Sometimes I’d think it was so real
But you just almost knocked down by a car
How do you explain this?
You said you felt that someone was pushing your back
That was really my feeling
Someone was pushing me from my back
Do I really run across spirits?
Why did that ghost keep bothering me?
Don't be so timid
You said you ran across those spirits when you shoot a ghost movie
Do you really need to be pregnant if you want to shoot a birth movie?
You have such good imagination, why don't you work as a scriptwriter?
We are chatting and this is none of your business
It's really none of my business
But you two keep chatting about ghosts and that is so annoying
Furthermore, there are so many notices
Can't you tell the difference?
You check for me
Sorry and I will give you the others immediately
If you don't want to do it, fine.
But don't pretend you are scared of ghosts
If you are really so scared, why don't you go to the church and be a nun?
There will be no ghosts for sure
No need.
Just stick your picture on the door
All ghosts will get scared and run away
What are you talking about?
Do you still want to be alive?
Forget it
I wish the ghost would come and sleep with you tonight
I'm so sorry
I will go to Lan Kwai Fong tonight, there are so many white ghosts
But it is not necessary to sleep with them
How come?
Don't talk behind people’s backs in the daytime and don’t mention ghosts at night
See, he is here
He is coming. We had better go
Understand?
I was terribly frightened by you.
And I am still very scared.
You are so scared, why don't we go to see ghost controller?
He goes to Thailand all the time and that place is famous for ghosts
Maybe he has some way to sort this out.
Let's go
That's too much
All over my house
It's not
You said there was something ghastly in your house and makes you house a mess
Don't look down on this talisman
The Thai boy and I begging the "White Dragon King" very hard
The more you stick, the more you are safe
Does it work?
Of course, Fung Shui Man might cheat you 10 years
I could say that once you put these talismans on
You don't have to worry for the rest of your life
Your milk
Thank you
Last time you mentioned about that Ding Dong Taoist
Did you get in touch with him yet?
Don't panic,
I will see that Thai boy later on
He will tell me
How and where to find this
Ding Dong Taoist
Really, just a minute and let me get changed first
Are you OK?
Let's go to the disco
Disco
Let's go to the disco
What do you want to do?
What are you doing here?
Whatever I like
How come, how come? Help
Help.
Don't go
Director
The knife we used last time was missing
How come and how did you do the job?
I have mentioned to CFO many times that those props are very important
But the CFO is not here
Forget it
You and you
Take the camera here and set up
Yes
What about you?
We can start
I asked you to get the camera, not the lighting
What are you talking about?
What lighting?
You are all crazy
Your hand held
Is it hand held, director
What? You hurt me
Hand held
Not bad
What's wrong?
All these clothes cannot be matched
This is not the updated one
I have faxed you the new one yesterday
I didn't go home yesterday
It's no use to fax to my home
But you asked me to fax it to your home
What should we do, continue or not?
Anyway, you go immediately and get me the clothes which are the same as last time
Obviously he didn't bring the clothes but blamed it on the others
Die or no compensation
Die or no compensation
Die or no compensation
He has to go down and get married to me
I want him to stay with me forever
Let me go
I want you to come down and get married to me
I want you to come down and get married to me
I want you to come down and get married to me!
Ding Dong, what's wrong with him?
I suspect that spirits possessed him.
Come and help to hold him
It's all right now
I have already driven away that spirit
You are really the most ridiculous man in the world
Never heard of spirit possession
He must take too many pills
And has become so mad now
You are mad
I have mentioned that before but you just don't believe
How could I believe that, as I never met them?
May be you have met them but just you don't know
If I meet them
I will ask them the result of the 3
I will tell them it involves billions of dollars
Such a waste to talk to you
It doesn't matter
Director, we started work so far but haven't done any worship ceremony
The whole team seems to act quite strange these days
How about we do a small ceremony?
Forget it. What if I worship you?
But we are really shooting a ghost movie
Of course we need to worship the Buddha
Although you don't want to worship the
Buddha, you need to worship those spirits
If not, they might keep bothering us
Well
There are so many ghosts in Lan Kwai Fong
Do we need to worship each one?
Don't be stupid!
There are no ghosts in the world
If not for the money,
I wouldn't shoot a ghost movie
Ghost! Director
What?
Are you going to worship Buddha?
I don't care about you any more
I only have one month left
If you cannot finish, you have to pay me extra
OK, no problem
Our Super Director, I have told you but you don't believe. But if you insist not to doing any worship ceremony
I won't blame you. But you want the movie to be able to finish and those actors to be fine
You can use all these talismans
Don't be so superstitious
Let's give these out
Spirit avoider, free of charge Hey
You have one and you have one too
Thank you
May, what about the future?
I have to hand over this important job to you
OK!
Spirit avoider.
Anybody want a spirit avoider?
No matter how much make up she puts on she still looks terrible better than some others only allow to make up as a ghost
Wish you meet those ghosts tonight
Open the door. What happened, don't mess me around
It's peculiar! They want to threaten me
I am not scared at all
Running so quick, where can you hide?
It's so dark!
Do you need to be so stingy?
Heavy rain.
We will get wet even when we have umbrella
Yes, I will come back soon.
Very quick, just a moment
Really heavy rain
May, can you lend me an umbrella?
Wait and I will come and fetch you
OK
Tom Cool will come to fetch me
May
May, Catherine
Do you know the Ding Dong Taoist you are looking for is me
Catherine
You are that Ding Dong Taoist
It's all my fault
I didn't tell anybody but my name is Ding Dong
But I saw you in CFO's house the other day
Why did you deny it?
Were you at CFO's house on that day?
No, I just walked past that house and suddenly noticed that house was very ghastly
I see
In fact I should have been able to see you earlier
But at the time Pervert wanted to take me to see you
Something already happened to him.
It's not only Pervert
I think including me
You all met the same ghost
Really?
I think it must because by the time you picked up that cinerary casket
You met that ghost.
He is not only bothering you but also fell in love with you
What should I do?
In fact, after we die our spirit will leave our body so that he can go to another world
But I think this ghost must love something here
That's why he refuses to leave
We call these spirits
I have checked the house you shot the movie in
The ghost who keeps bothering you never felt love before
I think he wants to find someone he loves in order to fulfill his wish
And you, there were so many accidents already happened to the people around you
You will be the next one for sure
No, I won't let him do that
You must have a way to drive him away, right?
Me, I don't know
But you said that you are a Taoist
But I never mentioned that
I am a Ghostbuster
But you know so many things
You know there was something ghastly in the house
I just saw it accidentally
All the information
I know was from the web sites and reading books
Maybe I could check what exactly happened in your house
I will die for sure this time
It's all from your heart. If you don't believe in the existence of ghosts
Then you might able to drive them away
Don't worry
I might have a clue which can help you
I want May to come down to marry me
I want May to come down to marry me
I want May to come down to marry me
I want May to come down to marry me
I want May to come down to marry me
I want May to come down to marry me
I want May to come down to marry me
Nobody can stop me
I want to marry May
Nobody can stop me
Hey!
May, I'm Ding Dong
I finally found out
What Pervert said after that ghost possessed him
You come to my office immediately
I will come over straight away
Don't leave me
I really love you. If you don't believe,
I could show you my heart
You see, it's so real
I love you so much
I love you so much
I love you so much
Please come down and marry me
Come down and marry me
Nobody can stop me
I love you so much
You come down and marry me
Nobody can stop me
Nobody can stop me
How could we finish? Such a mess!
Did you see May?
No
What's wrong with you?
Looks like you met the ghost
Ghost. Not me
This is really horrifying
Not only horrifying, but also superstitious
It's such a terrible and superstitious story
This is a true story
That ghost has tried to possess you before
You said many times
Then you do not trust your wife now?
Of course I believe you, honey
But you are asking me to believe that ghosts do exist
That's even worse than being possessed by the spirits
What do I have to say to make you believe me?
Unless I see the ghost with my own eyes
There's no time
If we can't find May before 12 midnight
That ghost will have killed her
Why would that ghost want to hurt May?
Because he loves her and wants to marry her
Marry her, right?
It's a trend nowadays for foreigners to marry Chinese
Yes, right
Hey, I'm not kidding. I'm serious
You know I don't believe in ghosts.
How could I help you?
It's exactly why I found you because you don't believe in ghosts
Did you ever hear that is all from your heart
I need someone who doesn't believe in ghosts to get rid of the ghost
All right, honey. I will help you
But how do we find May?
Then you'll have to go with me, OK?
I’d rather not
Dazy! Now what?
Wedding at the studio
Bi Bi
Come on! Be quick!
Where are we going, anyway?
Be quick. I wondered if she was all right
Wow! It's so dark!
Dazy, make up?
Which way? Left
This way, this way
No. That way. Go into the studio
Go into the studio. Go through it
No, it's so dark there
Go back out. Be quick! No
Where?
I don't know. Don't ask me
There's light
That way, be quick
How come cannot open it, it's locked
Help! Help!
I'm very scared. What should we do now?
Hey. Go that way
Don't push me. I can't see the way
Nobody can stop me
I must marry May
I will marry May tonight
Nobody can stop me
One, Two, Three
Run, honey, ghost
Let's go. Quick! Come this way, quick
Help
Honey, let's go, honey
Nobody can stop me
There are no ghosts in this world
Why me again
Bi Bi, Bi Bi
Bi Bi, what are you doing?
Bi Bi. Let's go, quick!
Why do you have to stop us?
Bi Bi, it's me. Piggie
I really love May
I even dug out my heart and showed her
Why don't you trust me?
I do, I do trust you
But leave her alone
You want women
I will burn you some hot chicks
Those in Miss Universe.
Those in the beauty pageants
No
Bi Bi. Piggie
Piggie
Piggie
Now, in there
There's one thing inside.
You have to drive him away
Don't let him control you
You have to drive him away from your mind
Piggie
Drive him away, OK?
Why do you have to drive me away?
I'll choke you to death
Piggie, Go quickly. Bi Bi
I'll kill you
What are you saying?
Leave my Bi Bi alone
If not, I will break your cinerary casket
No, put it down, quick
Give the cinerary casket back to me
You're nuts. Give it back to you?
Don't think you can blackmail me like this
I'll kill myself right before you
I'll kill myself right before you
Bi Bi, Bi Bi, don't die
Bi Bi
The ghost is gone
Come on, you scared me. Are you OK?
It's not real
Lucky that I found that props knife to cheat that ghost
Everything is fine now
You just scared me to death
I was so terrified
He deserved it
What should we do now?
Have a big meal of course.
But you are the boss
No problem. We will claim it back from the company, right?
Breaker, breaker one-nine.
Smokey report. We got a bear...
Breaker one-nine.
Any takers. Breaker.
I-40. His 20, mile marker 2-4-3.
Anybody out there? Copy. Over.
Hello?
Lewis.
No!
For the first time I see myself through somebody else's eyes.
Yeah. Yeah.
It's completely claustrophobic.
Big surprise.
And we're like, "Okay..."
Aren't we supposed to get a hell of a downpour?
- Two hundred mile slipper-slide.
- Anybody out there?
Yeah, they had a speed trap set up.
No one ever said freshman year'd go by so fast.
At least Colorado has seasons.
Berkeley's like summer all year.
Yeah. It's late. I'm not keeping you on the phone, am I?
No. No, not at all.
So, what's... You know, what's David doing this summer?
- I don't know. Who cares?
- What?
Sorry. I didn't tell you before.
I just felt a little strange, you know?
You what... I don't understand.
We broke up. He...
He's been acting serious and weird.
Serious and weird, how?
He was getting all serious and weird?
I mean I told you what he was like, and...
- Wait, hold on.
- Lewis, it's 3:00 in the morning.
- I got a final tomorrow.
- I'm sorry.
I'll be quieter.
Lewis?
I'm sorry. So, what happened?
He kept looking at me, as if, you know, he totally thought that he knew me, which he so obviously didn't.
And he started crying.
Which sort of sealed the deal, you know?
- You made him cry?
- I broke up with him.
Wouldn't you cry?
Listen, Venna, you're cute, but you're not that cute.
I was kidding.
Well, I'm not in the mood to go home.
Wish I had a car, then I could just get there gradually.
Decompress a little bit, you know?
If you had a car, you could stop by Colorado and pick me up.
We could have an adventure.
The two of us and a windshield.
- I have a car.
- No, you don't.
Yeah. Didn't I tell you?
- No!
- Yeah, well, like, I got one.
- Sexy choice. Yeah.
- Yeah?
Vintage 1971 Chrysler Newport.
I've changed my plans.
I'm no longer flying back.
- I bought a car, so I'm driving.
- By yourself?
No. Actually, I was thinkin' about picking up Venna.
Mom?
Sorry. It's... Sorry.
That's great, Lewis.
- What's the matter?
- Your brother just called.
He was arrested again.
Drunk and disorderly.
- Where, in San Diego?
- Salt Lake City.
Don't worry. It's not your problem.
- What did Dad say?
- You know your dad.
He didn't even want to talk to Fuller.
Said if he hadn't grown up yet, it was never going to happen.
- Fuller!
- I know.
I miss him, too.
Listen, before you start writing anything...
- License, please. Registration.
- My brother's in jail.
And I haven't seen him in almost five years.
So, I'm like driving 200 miles out of my way just to help him out.
That U-turn, it was based on a whole, like, good deed scenario.
I'm also writing you up for a broken taillight.
I have one of those?
Look, I'm aware of how frustrating the prison system in this country must be for you.
Repeat offenders, the unrehabilitated...
I watch American Justice, with your host, Bill Kurtis.
But I'm different.
I'm reformed.
You know, I'm strong. I'm...
Officer Wilkins, this is my...
Listen, this is my pledge to you.
You will not be seeing me again.
Two strikes are enough for Fuller Thomas.
Hey.
You look tall. Taller than me.
How's it goin'?
Well, a lot better now.
Kid. Hey.
You came all the way to Salt Lake just for me?
Well, technically, you are still my brother.
Hey, this is my brother.
I can't get...
Look at you, man!
- Mr. Thomas!
- Thank you for coming.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- Sign out, please.
- You're welcome.
Listen, I'm supposed to be picking up a friend.
And I'm running kind of late, so...
I just, well, I just wanted to see how you're doin' and take you wherever it was you needed to go because I sort of need to hit the road.
- Yeah, where are you goin'?
- Boulder, Colorado
- and then I'm goin' home.
- Oh, perfect.
- Yeah, that's great!
- Wait, what?
With the exception of the seat spring piercin' my ass, this ride's excellent.
So, who's this friend you're pickin' up?
Her name is Venna. She's a friend of mine from back home.
Wait, the blinker?
That girl from the Heights?
The one who was like all day long?
No, she's not like that all day.
You haven't seen her in years.
Okay. You're fuckin' her?
Well, what question's more legit than that?
- We're just friends, okay?
- Okay, you're not fucking her.
- But you want to.
- You don't know what you're talking about.
I don't?
I don't know what I'm talking about?
All right, here's how it is.
She's always dated guys from the right side of the 'burbs.
You were always left on the sidelines.
You get your scholarship to Berkeley.
She's off to the University of Colorado. Right?
You don't understand.
You guys have been talking on the phone a lot and now she realizes that you have the warm fuzzies for each other.
You're not lettin' on, even though you scrambled and bought this car just to pick her up.
No, you're still playing the neutered boy "friend" who's like, always there for her because you're nice...
What are you doing?
So, you're still good, or need me to drive, or...
No more bullshit small talk.
About me, my relationships, or my car.
Okay.
No, I swear. I'm barely slowing the car in Denver.
I'll give him a seven-mile-an-hour chance to jump and roll.
You did your mom a big favor, and she's happy now.
And this time tomorrow, you'll be here with me, and it'll be a whole new level of stress to deal with.
Okay, well, I'm gonna get goin'.
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Downsizing?
Gas company just lets a talented man like you go?
- Just like that?
- Yep.
Well, that sucks.
But this job kicks ass?
Got your trailer here, and now you're workin' kind of outside.
You got a view.
- What is this?
- C.B. Radio. Olive branch.
- Check it out.
- You put a hole in my car.
I talked him down to 40 bucks.
Breaker one-nine, breaker one-nine.
We need a westbound, come on.
You got Black Sheep here ridin' front door with,
Mama's Boy.
We're barrelin' down on ol'
Eye-8-Eastaway, just wonderin' if you could see any bears from your rockin' chair, over.
Roger, you got a 40-mile clear shot, 'cept for Jamestown.
Got yourself a Kojak with a Kodak at 1-8-5.
All right, no cops till Jamestown.
Free to speed like a motherfucker for like the next 40 miles or so.
Aren't we supposed to get a hell of a downpour?
We got a 200-mile slipper-slide.
Come on?
Doesn't matter, not from this rocking chair.
Some people like it when it rains.
It's gonna rain hard tonight.
- Keeps everybody inside, you know.
- What the hell's with this guy?
Howdy!
You got Black Sheep here, with Mama's Boy. Who we got? Over.
Could I please get a better handle than Mama's Boy?
No.
Yo, Rain Man, what's your 20?
- Hey, can you do a woman's voice?
- What?
Do a girl. Say...
"Hey, Black Sheep, this is Miss..."
- No. Forget it.
- Come on, man.
You did a girl when we pranked...
- Oh, yeah, Mr. Schramm.
- Yeah.
- That was good.
- No, I was nine.
That was what I sounded like then.
This is like a prehistoric Internet, or something.
Come on! You fuck with someone in a chat room.
- It's the same thing.
- No, forget it.
Come on, man!
Say, "Hey, Black Sheep, this is Candy Cane."
Just say it. You'll be amazing.
Hey, Black Sheep, this is Candy Cane.
I been lookin' for ya all day.
That was horrible.
Howdy there, Candy Cane.
This is Black Sheep.
I'm right on schedule.
Now, say, "I'll see ya later on tonight, honey."
Go, go, go!
So I guess I'll be seein' ya later on tonight, that right?
You got it. I'm pullin' over right now and I'll see your beautiful ass in the P.M.
- So, what was that about?
- Just wait.
Candy Cane, come on.
I knew it!
These guys are so fuckin' horny.
Get him goin'. Get him all worked up, and then in the middle of it, say, "Hey, guess what?
I'm a dude."
No way. I can't do that.
Come on, man! Come on.
Come on, man, it'll be fun.
Come on, just do it.
Do it.
Hey there, who's this?
- Rusty Nail.
- Nice. Nice.
Well, Rusty Nail, I hope you're doin' better than I am.
Man, this drive, it seems like it's takin' forever.
- Roger that, Candy Cane.
- You got him. You got him!
You know what makes it easier sometimes, is pretendin' the person that I'm talkin' to is right next to me.
So, why don't you pretend that I'm sittin' there with you just the two of us and the windshield?
All right.
Go, go! Tell him what you look like.
So, I'm 5'10", I got dirty-blond hair down to my shoulders.
I got blue eyes, really soft skin.
Man. This is turning me on.
And if I were there, Rusty Nail, you know what I'd do?
- Tell me.
- Awesome!
I'd make you feel good.
You would?
If I were there and I asked you to, would you unbutton my blouse?
Sure.
Well, then I'd just take it off, so now what?
What do you want to do with me?
- I've never really done this before.
- This is so classic!
I'd take off your bra.
Okay. You take that off.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
We can't lose this guy! Go.
I couldn't hear that,
Rusty Nail.
Rusty Nail? Sweetheart?
That was almost so good!
- Damn!
- What, did we lose him?
Yeah. Shit!
Hey, man, you're a gifted C.B.
Prank caller when you commit to it.
"I'd take off your bra."
Hey. Hey, don't park in a handicapped space.
There's spaces all over the place.
Yeah, I know. That's my point.
Dude, I'm gonna gimp it.
I'm not just gonna run in there.
God! Just sit here.
I'll work us a deal, okay?
One more goddamn maid knocks on my door askin' about towels...
Sorry, Mr. Ellinghouse.
That won't happen again.
Sorry, my ass!
Where's your boss?
I want the real manager.
The white one.
The one whose first language is fuckin' English?
- Can you understand that?
- Hi. Could I get a room for the night?
You can disturb me all you want.
I love towels.
- Not done here, friend.
- I know that, amigo. I'm just...
I haven't slept in two days.
You'd best not mess with me.
- You just take care of your own shit.
- Peace.
Tomorrow mornin', you mark my words, asshole... a long talk with your manager.
Your brown ass is gone.
Fuckin' punk.
What a dick.
Candy Cane.
Candy Cane.
Hello? Candy Cane?
- Did you see that fat fucking guy?
- Listen.
Hello, Candy Cane. Are you there?
- You are kidding me.
- Can you believe that?
- Have you talked to him yet?
- No.
I haven't said anything.
Anybody out there know Candy Cane? Come on.
What?
Tell him you want to meet up.
Tell him you want to get together.
You're turnin' in for the night.
You want to see him later at the Lone Star Motel in Table Rock, Room 17.
Do you just love prison so much?
We're in 18.
I mean, you saw that prick, right?
What, the giant?
The prick is in Room 17!
Nah, I can't do that.
Come on! That guy sucks, okay?
He body-checked me on the way out.
- Yeah, I know. I saw that.
- What? You saw that?
And you're not jumping at this extraordinary opportunity to exact some much-deserved revenge?
Are you crazy?
Come on! Do it!
- Calm down.
- This is amazing!
Rusty Nail. Hey, there.
Candy Cane. I thought I'd lost ya.
Well, I guess fate wouldn't allow that.
Glad to know you're thinkin' about me.
Listen, I'm pullin' over for the night.
You wouldn't be interested in gettin' together later, would ya?
I thought you were meeting with Black Sheep.
Well, that was the plan, but how about I blow him off and take a chance with you?
- God.
- I love you, man. This is so great!
Relax.
But I'm not sure that
I'd be what you'd expect.
Please.
Well, you are a man, aren't you, with a soul and a heart?
- That's all I'd expect.
- Great.
Listen, I'll be at the Lone Star Motel in Table Rock, if you're interested.
Pink champagne.
Tell him that you like pink champagne.
And if there's any way you could bring some pink champagne, it's my favorite.
That was good.
What room?
Room 17. Midnight.
You got that, baby?
I got it.
I can't wait.
- That was mean.
- I know! I know! This is awesome!
That guy sucks, okay? He totally body-checked me on the way out.
- All you do is put...
- Do you miss home?
Yeah. I miss
Mom's chocolate chip cookies.
Playin' football with Dad, Sundays.
Goin' to... Oh, wait. That's somebody else's childhood.
What I meant was, "No."
You should call sometimes.
You know, when you don't need bail money.
Yeah, but how often is that?
- I'm serious.
- I call.
Yeah, I know exactly what he says every time he hangs up the phone.
That I'm the world's biggest loser.
That's comin' from a plumber.
That's comin' from a guy who wears a full-length lime green jumpsuit to work every day.
They don't need me.
I don't need them.
It works like a charm if you repeat it enough.
Listen.
Hit the TV.
It's Rusty Nail! It's him!
Who the hell is it?
I brought the drink.
This is amazing!
I brought the pink champagne.
Is this a goddamn joke?
I swear to fucking God.
What are you...
Are you Black Sheep?
Why don't you come over here?
Are you fuckin' with me, standing in the dark?
This prick is such an asshole!
Show me your face. What was that?
That was weird.
Hey, you know what I think?
I think someone might have gotten hurt.
No. No, we would have heard that.
We did. That was a gasp.
Bet that Rusty Nail guy got hurt.
No, it wasn't a gasp.
That was a laugh.
Hey, where are you going?
What, are you calling Mom?
- Front desk.
- Hi, we just...
We just heard some disturbance from the room next door, in Room 17.
"Yeah, hi, this is the drama queen from Room 18."
That's hard to say.
It was like a thud.
What are you...
No, we think someone might have been hurt.
And we thought you'd want to check that out, maybe.
All right. Thank you.
You know what's gonna happen now, right?
Prick's gonna kill the night manager.
Hello?
Guy said everything's fine.
All right. Thank you.
The guy said everything's fine.
What'd I tell ya?
- Good mornin'.
- How are you today?
Pretty good. How are you?
- Where are you boys from?
- Originally, New Jersey.
- What are you doin' here?
- We're drivin' cross-country.
- My brother... Yeah, Lewis.
- Your brother?
- Where is he?
- In the room. I don't know.
We had a little incident here last night. Did you hear anything?
Any sounds, or anything out of the ordinary?
Yeah, actually, next door
I heard some sounds.
- Next door?
- Yeah.
- Could you describe those sounds?
- Yeah, sure.
They were like...
No, wait.
Like that.
- What's goin' on?
- All right, this is Lewis.
There was a "sitchy-ashun" last night. That's all I know.
So after you heard these sounds, did you look out your window?
- Did you open your door?
- No, sir.
- What happened?
- After you closed your door, around 10:15 p.m., you didn't see anybody else until
I knocked on your door this morning?
That's right. Well, we did call the night manager, because we were, concerned, right?
- Right.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah. He mentioned that.
And he also said that one of you had an altercation with the victim.
- Which of you was that?
- Wait. The night manager said what?
Apparently one of you had words with the victim, in the motel office
- when you were checkin' in?
- No, no. We never met...
- What?
- Ellinghouse.
Ronald Ellinghouse.
He was staying in Room 17.
The huge guy? Yeah, I met him.
- But he's... He's not the one...
- What happened to him?
It wasn't comely.
I'm sorry. I don't know what that means.
He was found early this mornin' lyin' face down on the highway median.
So, you're saying that the...
The huge guy is the victim.
You have no idea who might have visited
Mr. Ellinghouse's room last night?
No, sir.
I wish... I wish we could be more helpful, but I...
- Is he dead?
- Coma.
You know what I'm thinkin'?
I'm thinkin' that a little look-see might "refreshify" your memory.
Takin' a look-see at what?
Ripped his jaw, clean off.
That is the pain in my ass.
My own personal file of ongoing shit that I got to deal with.
And now, guess what?
Now, I got me another one.
Mr. Ronald Ellinghouse, layin' two inches from dead in my jurisdiction.
Why? Because you sorry-ass punks thought you'd have some fun.
Fuck!
I'd keep you retards in custody if I thought it would help answer one of the hundreds of new questions I got.
But, no. All you know is his damn C.B. Handle.
And maybe he drives a truck.
Do you understand the kinds of shit I got to grapple with now because of what you assholes did? You!
You got out of jail when?
Yesterday?
I want you outta here.
This is like an old-fashioned western.
I want you out of Wyoming before the sun goes down.
I can't believe it.
I can't believe you told them that we invited Rusty Nail back.
They could have thrown me back in jail.
A man is half dead because of what we did.
Oh, bullshit.
Bullshit!
What, you order 10 pizzas for your neighbor, a delivery guy gets there and your neighbor opens up with an AK-47.
- Is that your fault?
- Yeah, maybe it is.
Fine.
Be the martyr all you want.
No, that's not what I'm doin'.
I'm trying to figure how I'm gonna drive away after what we've done.
Do what I do.
Just remind yourself that in 100 years, you're gonna be dead.
It's the closest thing
I've got to a philosophy.
No, you know what? I'm taking you to Denver, and that's it.
Great.
Eastbound, looking for a westbound for a bear report?
Not a soul.
Never any Smokeys on that...
Candy Cane...
Candy Cane.
- Hello.
- Hey!
- Candy Cane.
- Hey!
- I'm asleep.
- Hey, Candy Cane!
Candy Cane?
Jesus.
Anybody out there know
Candy Cane?
Or Mama's Boy?
Baa, baa, Black Sheep.
- What are you gonna say?
- Hey, Russell.
This is Black Sheep. Go to 23.
Hey, Black Sheep.
Do you know where I can find Candy Cane?
Hey, what is your deal?
I mean, seriously.
I'm looking for Candy Cane.
So, you've been driving around all day looking for a voice?
I think that you can tell me where to find her.
- Tell him it was a joke.
- I talked to Candy Cane about last night.
And she said that she's not interested.
- No!
- She's not interested in you...
- Don't do this.
- Or your pink champagne.
I need to find Candy Cane.
You need to find a highly-qualified psychiatrist, not a psychologist.
You're gonna need some drugs.
You're gonna have to find a damn good lawyer because the cops are all over your ass.
- Goddamn!
- Give it to me.
Hey, there,
Rusty Nail, you hear this?
That was me, all right? I'm a guy.
It was just a joke.
Apologize.
- Right.
- No, just do it.
- Apologize to him?
- Yeah.
- I'll do it.
- No.
Listen, you sick fuck, you pathetic, lonely walkie-talkie, freak show motherfucker, you're not getting anything from me.
Know why? I have something more powerful than your psychosis.
It's called a volume knob.
And the only thing I need to make you go away is to turn it counterclockwise.
Got that? You copy that?
You know, Black Sheep, you really ought to get that fixed.
Get what fixed?
Your taillight.
- Do you see anything?
- Yeah. Cars and trucks.
- Just drive. Just be cool.
- Oh, my God.
- Did he follow us from the motel?
- I don't know. I don't know.
- As long as we keep drivin', we're safe.
- Oh, God.
- What?
- Look.
- Oh, come on, come on!
- I know. But it's okay.
I saw a sign. "Gas at Laramie."
There'll be a phone there, and I'll call Sheriff Ritter.
Oh, good.
- Laramie. That'll be good.
- We'll be all right.
- Oh, my God. Oh, God.
- Okay, just stay cool.
- Oh, shit!
- Keep cool.
Will you stop telling me to be cool?
You're makin' me like, crazy.
Get the map.
- Okay. All right.
- Fuck! We're not gonna make it to Laramie.
Wait, take the next exit.
I think there's a town there.
- How far is it?
- I don't know.
How far is it?
My cuticle to my knuckle.
I don't know. Twelve miles.
- We might not make it twelve miles.
- Take this exit right here.
Yes! Yes, you're a genius!
I'll pay, you pump. Or do you want to pay? I don't care.
- I'll pump.
- Okay. Okay.
Table Rock, please. Rawlins County
Sheriff Department. Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Hey.
Hey. Hey.
Hey. Hey!
Sheriff Ritter is not available.
At the tone, please record your message.
When you have finished recording, you may hang up or press one for more options.
Please wait for the tone.
You just got the gas?
Oh, right.
Come on, come on, come on! Come on.
Come on. Get in the car, get in the car! Come on.
- What?
- Go, go, go, go!
- He's in there, man.
- Was that him?
Did you see him?
Keep driving, keep driving.
Go! Yeah!
Oh, my God!
- Can you see an on-ramp?
- No!
Okay. Damn it!
The guy's comin' after us.
- Oh, no.
- Okay, we're not gonna panic.
- We got a full tank of gas.
- Shit!
- Right.
- We missed the on-ramp, man!
Mailbox.
No, no, no, no!
Shit!
No.
Lewis! Lewis!
- He said Lewis!
- Stay the fuck back, man! We got a gun!
And I got a MasterCard.
- Thanks, man. We thought...
- You really scared us.
- Yeah.
- It wasn't the mustache, was it?
My old lady keeps telling me to shave the thing.
No, no. It wasn't the mustache, man.
What the... We're not hip...
What is that thing, your club?
- My tire thumper?
- Yeah.
Shit. Just checkin' pressure.
Yeah, pressure.
Yeah, the pressure thing.
Are you boys all right to get back to the main road?
Yeah, we're fine.
Now that we're not murdered.
Thanks a lot for this, man.
That was nice of you.
- Y'all have a good night.
- Sorry about that.
Fuckin' Fu Manchu.
I've never felt like more of a pussy in my whole life.
Oh, my God.
Hey, what kind of range is there on a C.B?
I don't know. Maybe five miles?
Well, hey, you know,
I think we should get to a phone.
Call the cops in Table Rock, leave a message and let 'em know that Rusty Nail's in the area.
What the hell is that?
Go!
Go, go!
He's right on us!
Oh, man, he's right on our ass!
- No, don't use that!
We need some help. Please!
Is anyone out there?
Goddamn it!
Come on! Fuck!
Yeah! Yeah!
Tree! Tree!
- You okay?
- Yeah.
I'm okay. Let's go. Come on.
Yeah, come on, come on.
Come on, let's go!
- Let's go, let's go.
- Shit!
It's not goin' anywhere!
- Come on! Come on!
- Shit!
Shit!
All right! Come on! Go, go!
Come on! Go, go, go, go!
Shit!
Oh, no! No!
Come on! Don't kill us, man!
We apologize!
Don't kill us, man!
We were just playin' with you, man.
Why?
Just... Just for a laugh.
A laugh?
Just for fun.
Well, I was just playin' with you, man.
So, where are you now?
We're about
10 miles outside of Laramie.
We had some car trouble, and we're gonna be a little late.
That's all right.
Is everything okay?
Yeah. No, I mean, it's been a long drive.
- All right. See you then.
- All right.
They fixed the taillight.
So, why don't you just come home with me?
Blow off Denver and come home with me.
No, I'm okay.
Listen, I don't want to tell Venna what happened.
I don't want to ruin things.
Freak her out, you know?
Hey.
The color's not great, but it's spacious. It's a big car, you know?
I love it.
- When did you get it?
- I've had it for a while.
- It doesn't look too beat up.
- No.
No, actually, I think the dents add some character.
Actually, I was talking about Fuller.
- Hey!
- Hey.
- So, it's been a while.
- Yeah.
So. Well, have you named it yet?
Well, we were thinkin' either Tad or "Lewis' Shitty Newport."
Hey! She's hot!
- Hey.
- Have a good summer, Vee.
Guys? My friend Charlotte.
She'll be my roommate next year.
- These are the infamous Thomas boys.
- Oh, Lewis, right?
Yeah. Nice to finally meet you.
And, look, I'm Fuller. I'm Lewis's older, somewhat troubled brother.
And you're definitely goin' with us, right?
I kind of have to go back to San Antonio.
Isn't San Antonio on the way to New Jersey?
- It was nice to meet you.
- You're breakin' my heart, leaving like this.
- I'm gonna miss you.
- Me, too. Miss you.
- I love you. Be safe.
- I love you, too.
That's so Charlotte.
Wavin' and drivin' off like that.
So, are you guys ready for an adventure or what?
Completely.
Yeah! Yeah, sure.
Shotgun? You want it, you gotta call it.
Shotgun.
Hey. Welcome to Nebraska.
See this hat I got you?
So.
I want to tell you how much
I appreciate you doing this.
Picking me up.
It's pretty much the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.
This is the part where you kiss the girl.
Well, historically.
Hey, Lewis. You're blushing.
Thank you.
- Hey, the room's this way.
- Yeah, but the bar's this way.
- Here's to...
- Nebraska!
To states? All right.
Look what Uncle Fuller found.
Three tequilas.
All right.
Well, I can tie a knot in a cherry stem with my tongue.
Shut up!
All right, choose your weapon.
Let's see what you're made of.
And... Go.
Done.
Still medaled.
- Bronze.
- Not even close.
It's straight. It wasn't even bent.
May I have three more shots of tequila,
- and some matches, please?
- What's your name, sweetheart?
Come on, what's your name?
What's your name, sweet thing?
I'm just here to buy drinks.
You can call me whatever you want.
How 'bout I call you Peaches?
Do you like Peaches?
- No, not really.
- You don't like Peaches?
- Hey, what's goin' on?
- What?
- Is this your bitch?
- Excuse me?
Excuse me, I said, is this your bitch?
'Cause if it is, you better shut your bitch up.
Hey, look at me, campus boy.
Did you hear what I said?
Look me in the face.
You better shut your bitch up.
Bitch, shut up!
Are you mouthin' off again? God!
Damn it! You can't turn your back for one minute, you know.
I owe you one. Now, come on!
Back on the truck with you, Daisy!
Drunk in the bar! Now, come on!
Goddamn it!
Gentlemen.
Careful, those are expensive.
What?
Hey.
Hey!
Hey.
I got a plan.
- And what's your plan?
- Let's never go back there again.
I can't wait to never go back there.
Yeah.
I'll be in my presidential suite.
Excellent.
We're gonna head to our...
- Our spinning hotel room.
- Okay. See you later.
Good night.
I get the orange one!
This one.
Hey! See, I told you this was a good place.
Adult channels.
Good. Hey, are you in the mood for a story, or, like, a collection of scenes?
She isn't a Navy SEAL.
God! Takes me right out.
Hey, Venna's great, man.
She's got...
I mean, you guys...
You guys are just friends, right?
I mean, that's what you said.
Right? You're just hangin' out, and...
'Cause if you're anything more than that, you tell me right now, and I'm gonna just... I'll... off.
You know?
Great.
We never got those last drinks.
Yeah...
You know, if we're gonna get an early start, we should probably just crash and go to bed.
Yeah. But, hey...
I'm a licensed bartender.
Yeah, I'd show you my license, but my hands are full, so...
Where's your better half?
He's busy. Snoring.
Well, you know, I really don't think that I can drink anymore.
I disagree.
And I'm a professional.
You know what's amazing?
Nobody knows where we are right now.
Just kind of out there.
Floating.
If anybody wanted to find us for some strange reason, they couldn't.
What am I talking about?
I have no idea. Here, try this.
That's good.
- Yeah!
- Yeah.
Is Lewis okay?
He doesn't normally drink so much.
Yeah, he's totally fine.
Fuller, get the phone.
Hello.
Now I thought you said there was no girl.
- What?
- You said there was no girl.
Fuller.
Listen, there...
There isn't any girl.
Then, what's she doing in the other room with your brother?
He's out there!
- He's watching us!
- Rusty Nail?
- He just called me.
- Who's Rusty Nail?
He called you on the phone?
Yeah, just now. He knew you were in here. He's watching us!
- There's somebody watching us?
- He just called.
What did he say?
He said, "I thought there was no girl."
And what you were doing in the room with her, which is an excellent question.
We're gettin' out of here, so put on your shoes.
I already paid for this room.
- Just do it!
- How scared am I supposed to be?
Much more than usual.
Okay, there's nobody behind us.
Can somebody please talk to me?
He knows we're brothers.
How does that happen?
All right, we're goin' to the police, we're gettin' off the highway,
- then we're goin' home!
- Lewis, goddamn it!
Something weird happened to us before we picked you up.
I didn't wanna tell you 'cause
I didn't wanna freak you out.
Tell me what?
- You want the short version?
- Talk to me.
There's this sick guy.
- He put this guy in a coma.
- Sick how?
This Rusty Nail guy did something?
- Because of something that we did.
- What did you do?
Hey, man, what the hell are you doing?
He wants us to look in the trunk.
There were signs spray painted back there,
"Look in the trunk."
Signs? What makes you think they're for us?
Look.
What's going on here?
That's a pretty elaborate thing to do, paint those signs.
- No, no, no! No!
- What? God!
- Don't open it!
- Why?
What if there's a head or a body in there, man?
Oh, man, could be a bomb.
Think a bomb's a reason not to open the trunk?
He's in the trunk!
I say we don't open the trunk!
I'm not getting back into the car till I know what's in the trunk.
What are you doing?
Oh, shit.
Okay, we plug it in, and we don't talk on it.
We just listen.
And whatever he says, we just...
We just go straight to the police.
I'm not going to go anywhere until somebody tells me why
I should be afraid of a radio.
Candy Cane, are you there?
That's right.
I don't mean my Candy Cane.
I mean yours.
Venna?
- How does he know my name?
- We're not getting into it with this guy.
Let him talk all he wants.
Just tell me where we're going.
You know when a corpse can't be identified?
No next of kin.
No one to claim the body.
What they do is, they cut off all the fingers.
All 10 of them.
And then they cut off the jaw.
They cut off the person's jaw and they put it all in a jar.
They put it in a jar with some number on it.
Oh, my God, that's Charlotte.
- What?
- That's Charlotte.
- That girl? Your roommate?
- Yeah, yeah.
Hey, what the hell do you want?
I want you to go to the State Line
Truck Stop parking lot.
- I'll find you there.
- Venna, please help me!
And if you go to the police,
I will take her apart piece by piece.
Good morning.
Hey, he's back. We're here.
Okay, here's what I want.
Fuller, Lewis.
I want you two to head inside.
Take a seat at the counter.
Order six cheeseburgers each.
What about Venna?
She stays put.
But you two are going in naked.
Naked?
If we go in there dicks hangin', they're just gonna call the police.
Come on. It's just for fun.
Bullshit, I'm staying here.
Just stay up front.
I want you to keep the car running.
And if you see anything, honk the horn and drive.
God, I can't fucking believe we're doing this.
Billy, come on. Get in the car.
Sissy.
Now they know what it feels like to be the brunt of the joke.
Your heart pounding.
Face burning hot.
Now they know what it feels like to be the fucking punch line.
They told me what they did to you, and I'm very, very sorry.
Well, it's a little late for that, isn't it?
I bet your friends had a really good laugh seeing me standing there in the rain, holding my bottle.
I think sometimes people don't know what they're doing, you know?
They don't think what they say or how they act can really affect anyone.
Well, that's a lesson your friends are gonna have to learn the hard way.
You wanna see Charlotte alive again?
Here's what you're gonna have to do.
Twelve cheeseburgers, please.
You want fries with that?
Is this a fraternity stunt?
Because if this wasn't my restaurant...
A man's gonna kill our friend if we don't come in here like this.
I'd say it was a pretty good one.
- We're not joking, man.
- Oh, shit!
Man, we should be going to the cops.
We're not going anywhere till we find out what he wants.
Right up here.
This is where we turn.
That's what he said.
You out there?
We're here.
Something special's waiting for you.
I'd say it's about
100 feet up the road.
So, get out of the car.
Wait. I'm not walkin' one foot out of this...
We don't have a choice.
We're doing what he says.
- What?
- He's got Charlotte. Get out of the car.
- Wait! Goddamn it!
- Get out of the car!
What the hell is this?
Wait, how many feet did he say?
A hundred. A hundred.
Do you hear or see anything?
This is it.
Hi.
- He's not slowing down.
- He's not gonna stop.
- What's he doing?
- He's not gonna stop. He's not gonna stop!
- He's not slowing down!
- Run! Car! Go!
Run! Run!
Wait.
What the hell is he doing?
He's coming.
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! Come on! Let's go!
Run! Run! Run!
Run!
Turn left!
Keep going!
That way!
Get down! Get down!
Let's go! Go! Go! Go!
Let's go! Come on!
Come on!
Go! Run!
Turn, quick!
Venna?
Lewis!
Venna?
Lewis.
Lewis.
Lewis!
Venna.
Fuller!
- Venna?
- Lewis?
Fuller?
- Lewis!
- Venna?
- You guys okay? Oh, man.
- What?
- Hey, Venna.
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.
- I was sitting back there.
- Venna. You can come out. He's leaving.
- He tried to back up.
- Venna?
- You let her out of your sight?
- Venna?
- Lewis, goddamn it!
- You let her out of your sight?
- Where the hell were you?
I was over there, man!
Back there!
- Venna! Venna, come out here!
- Lewis!
Lewis, help me, please!
Lewis!
Stop, you gotta leave her alone! Please.
- We'll do whatever you want.
- Lewis!
You don't feel like meeting me at a motel later, do you?
We'll do whatever you want!
Meet me at the next town.
Medford. Room 17. Midnight.
Do not be one minute late.
Lewis, gas tank! Come on!
And if there's any way that you could bring a bottle of pink champagne...
What are you doing?
- Come on, goddamn it!
- That's my favorite.
Venna.
Seven miles. Hey!
Come on!
Hey! Hey!
He said not to call the cops!
Keep a lookout.
Don't worry. I've done this before.
What?
Hey, man, we're runnin' out of time.
God damn, thing won't start.
Hello.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Need some help?
No, I think we're fine.
Damn Ford won't start.
- And he wonders why I drive a Chevy.
- No shit.
Come on. Come on.
I got some jumper cables.
I'll hook you up.
No, no, really.
I think we're all right.
It's just flooded, right?
You'll get it started.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just take it and turn it all the way off...
- Right.
- Then on.
Want me to show you?
You gotta hesitate it for two seconds.
- There it is.
- All right, perfect.
Hey, you're the man.
Thanks a lot.
Where the hell you goin'?
That's my truck!
Everything's going to be all right.
We're gonna get Venna.
And we're gonna find Charlotte.
Everything's...
Everything's gonna be okay.
Don't you think?
Okay, motel. Motel.
- Which one?
- He didn't say. Shit!
Venna?
Hold on.
- Venna!
- I said hold on!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Help you?
- Is this your room?
- Yeah. What of it?
What's the problem here?
- Shit!
- What did we miss?
Hello, police.
Yeah. I'd like to report some dead bodies.
Your name, sir?
Hello?
Hello?
Come on.
Hello?
- It's unlocked.
- Comin' in.
- Hey, we're comin' in.
- We're comin' in.
Venna? Hello?
- Venna?
- Hey.
The switch.
- Hello?
- Nice, isn't it, being on the receiving end?
- Where the hell's Venna?
- Who?
Look, I'm not kidding.
Where's Venna?
You see, you might not be kidding, but I am.
- What did he say?
- That's the point.
- Get it?
- No, believe me, you made your point, all right?
And we're sorry.
We told you that.
Hey, Lewis, you know what
I think is a real kick?
Pretending the person that
I'm talking to is right next to me.
- Right next to me.
- What?
What the fuck is he talking...
Not what you expected, is it?
That's not what I expected when I came to room 17, neither.
You guys sittin' right next door listening through the wall.
That's what you did, right?
You listened through the wall.
What do you want?
I just want to enjoy this for a second.
We gotta call the cops.
No. If we call the cops, he'll kill her.
- Well, what the fuck, man?
- You...
I think you should go outside.
- See if you can see in his room.
- Are you crazy?
Just do it! I'll keep him on the phone.
Go out there now. Go.
Shit!
- You still there?
- Oh, yeah, I'm here.
Why don't you come on over?
Your Candy Cane's waiting.
Listen. We learned our lesson, all right?
- Is that right?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
So, this is what we're gonna do, okay?
You're gonna give us back Venna, then Charlotte and we're gonna walk away from this whole thing.
And we're not gonna tell anybody, all right?
And we sure as hell won't tell the cops.
Watch this.
It's gonna be hilarious.
Don't!
Don't open the door!
Don't open the door!
Don't open the door! Don't open the door!
Come on!
Wait! Shit!
Lewis!
Fuller, where are you?
Fuller?
Fuller, come on.
Let's get you off this.
- Don't!
- What?
Pipe! Jesus, there's a pipe in my leg!
We've got a body in here!
We've got a possible 839!
Search every room!
Oh, jeez! What is he doing?
Come on, come on, come on!
Sheriff's Department!
Open up! Kick it open!
Clear the door!
Twenty-four, clear!
Move! On the ground! Now!
- Watch it!
- Twenty-three, clear!
All right, let's go!
Police!
- Come on, come on, come on, come on!
- Twenty-two's clear!
Come on, put your foot...
Put your feet on this!
Twenty-one, clear.
Oh, jeez! Jeez!
- Twenty, clear!
- Come on, get out!
Sheriff's Department! Open up!
Nineteen, clear!
- Venna.
- What?
You gotta stop 'em from opening the door!
Go!
Go!
Sheriff's Department! Open up!
Show me your hands!
Help, Lewis!
Don't move! Don't move!
- Lewis!
- Just freeze right there!
- Lewis!
- That's my brother in the back.
Get back on the ground!
Get on the ground!
Don't you shoot!
- Don't shoot!
- Stay with the girl!
Hey!
Pull!
- No! No, no, no, no!
- Freeze!
Shoot the truck!
Shoot the truck!
It's not gonna stop!
Run!
Jeez!
Oh, God!
I'll be all right.
I'll be all right.
Yes, sir.
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.
Did you figure out who that guy was?
He's just some trucker named Jones.
Looks like he drove for some ice company in Wyoming.
Ice company?
What's goin' on?
Breaker one-nine, come on.
Breaker, breaker.
Lookin' for a break.
Westbound I-80.
How's that storm lookin'?
Is it rainin' out there?
Hello?
I'm lookin' forward to this storm.
Keeps everyone inside.
Washes everything clean.
[Instrumental music plays]
[Propellers whirring]
This is almost a day behind us.
Well, who are they?
Americans? Brits? Italians?
It doesn't even say.
Well, I think we can assume they're friendly, Mr. Loomis.
Besides, it doesn't appear to be a suggestion, does it?
What the hell?
Might get a Silver Star out of this patrol yet.
Just have Coors plot it out.
[Indistinct conversation in distance]
[Exhales deeply]
Gunners mate standing by, sir.
Stow the weapons.
They're British.
- You can tell that from here?
- It's the sail.
The krauts use white on their lifeboats. The Brits use red.
Don't they teach you that in OCS, ensign?
Afraid not, but I can recite the submariners' motto in Latin.
MAN: Radar contact... starboard beam, seven miles out, sir.
God damn it!
What if they see us?
Well, they're pouring on the coal for somebody.
[Indistinct shouting in distance]
All ahead... emergency.
Rudder to midship.
Crew to battle stations.
All ahead... emergency.
Rudder to midship.
All crew to battle stations.
All right, do this at flank speed!
I want you to grab what's breathing on that boat and you leave everything else behind!
Stand by to board survivors.
I got him! I got him!
Wounded coming down.
Next man, let's go.
MAN: Come on!
There's a warship approaching, guys.
Let's move! Move!
Introductions later!
[British accent]
Ow! Ow! I'm going, okay?!
Next man. Next m...
[Panting]
What have we here?
Let's pull the plug.
- [Klaxon blaring]
- Periscope depth.
Periscope depth, make your depth 65 feet.
Make depth 6-5 feet.

MAN: Bleed air in the boat.
Bleed air in the boat.
All hatches indicate closed.
All vents indicate open.
Pressure in the boat.
Pressure in the boat.
It's a two-stacker... about 3,000 tons.
It's not a friendly.
Possible Z-class.
If it is, rear recs, no side throwers, four 5-inch guns, grapple hooks.
Fast screws, Mr. Brice.
30 knots or better.
2-5-0 feet.
Make it 2-5-0 feet.

Hard left rudder.
Live to fight another day.
Smart move.
[Big band music playing]
Three survivors... Brits... and get this... one's a woman.
[Spits]
[Indistinct conversations]
Three Brits... one's a skirt.
Three limeys... one's a female.
Hey.
Three Brits... one female.
[Laughs]
[Clicking]
Guys, listen up.
We've got three survivors... all Brits.
One's a woman, eh?
Hey, look lively.
Woman onboard.
Hey, Hoag, spread the news... three tea bags, and I hear one's, uh, bazooma.
We got ourselves a filly?
[Clicks tongue]
Ohh!
Sweet holy Jesus.
You're gonna wanna hear this.
Hey, boys... here's the news.
Front page... we got three redcoats, and guess what.
One of them's a bleeder.
Aw, great.
That's all this boat needs... another piece of rotten luck.
Yeah, well, if it means you guys finally wash the butt squirt outta your shorts,
I'm all for it.
[Groaning]
So what exactly happened to your shi...
Um... your ship?
[British accent]
Hospital ship.
We were attacked two nights ago.
Two nights?
I'm... I'm sorry.
My brain's a bit foggy.
Although I'm reasonably sure my name's Claire Page.
The rest of the details will emerge, I'm sure.
[Howling]
That's just a whale.
It's okay, really.
The sounds down here still get to me, too.
MAN: Make a hole.
Comin' through. Make a hole.
Yow.
Mind your pretty toes.
Best-lookin' bad luck
I ever saw.
[Laughs]
Doesn't look good, sir.
Why don't you get those clothes off of him and see if you can get a better look at the wounds?
I can dress the wounds.
Other than that, I think it's best to leave him be.
Okay. All right.
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.
I saw it.
It crossed the moon's reflection just before the explosion.
Yes, it was dark, but I...
I did see it.
It wasn't a mine.
I... It was a U-boat.
[Indistinct voice on P.A.]
What class?
Type 7?
Was it an older boat or one of their newer ones?
Um...
Like this?
Clean at the bow?
- You know...
- No net cutter?
It was just a couple of seconds.
I really couldn't say for...
So you were... you were on lookout that night, mister...
Kingsley... second mate, merchant navy.
Uh, no.
I was on the starboard deck grabbing a gasper.
Having a cigarette.
And how many aboard your ship?
About 300 patients.
At least that many.
Out of North Africa.
Yeah, plus over 70 hands crew.
So, um...
You said they fired only one torpedo?
O'Dell... you better tell sonar we've got an enemy sub in the area.
Yes, sir.
Just let me finish...
Now. Do it now.
Yes, sir.
I'm... I'm sorry that we couldn't save more. I...
Now this... the third member of your party, he's...
One of my patients.
Well, under normal circumstances,
I'd be able to drop you at the nearest port in England, but, uh, it's a 300-mile detour for us.
So I'm sorry.
It seems as though we're stuck with each other.
Oh, uh, last thing.
Just try not to fraternize with the men.
Most of the men are fine, but some of them get a little strange about having...
[Chuckles] "Strange" as in "superstitious"?
As in "strange."
"Suddenly, his heart rolled over backwards in his chest,
"and he saw this huge, wretched thing before him.
"Instantly, its mouth widened
"into a terrible and hungry menace.
Now the malediction uttered a deep-throated sound."
- Malediction?
- Look it up.
"And its breath stank gloriously
"of rotted carp and matted gorilla skins.
"Now... it slouched toward him...
"not fast, but slowly...
"slowly... so very slowly."
[Thud]
Silly boy.
Just the bulkhead shifting.
What'd you think it was?
The malediction?
Wahh!
[Laughter]
What exactly bothers you,
O'Dell?
Well, you have a ship that's sinking slow enough to get a few lifeboats off, but the submarine only fires one torpedo.
I mean, that's not textbook tactics.
You fire upon the target until the target is sunk.
So it was their last torpedo.
Yeah, but... why not use a deck gun?
O'Dell, isn't this your first patrol?
My second.
Yeah.
And your first was a little shakedown run off the coast of Florida in one of those old school boats, right?
I'm just wondering if the story didn't seem a little off.
I wouldn't worry about it, champ.
They got here somehow.
- You want coffee?
- Sure.
I take it black.
Tell Broadway make sure it's hot.
[Page speaking indistinctly]
[Man groaning]
PAGE: Try to sleep.
I know you're in pain, but you must try.
Please.
Be quiet.
[Loud snapping]
Sonar contact.
[Ticking]
220 turns per minute,
Mr. Brice.
Maybe the Z-class.
Maybe we didn't shake him after all.

Boat stands at full stop.

- Flood negative.
O'Dell, get on the thermograph.
Find us some cold.

Scared you, didn't it, kid?
[Chuckles]
- [Light bulb shatters]
- [Both scream]
[Sighs]
Damage reports.
[Indistinct conversations]
Well, maybe that Z-class just happened to be there.
And maybe the phonograph wasn't secured.
But God damn.
And maybe someone doesn't want us to make it home.
Miss Page claims she was in the control room the whole time.
Yeah, that's right.
- So what about the other guy?
- Kingsley?
Hmph!
If that's his name.
Where was he when it all happened?
I'm not sure.
Maybe he stepped out.
Stepped out... or slipped out?
[Scoffs]
You know, maybe we're spending more time watching that broad than watching our backs.
Who, me?
I've talked to her twice.
I heard you were bird-dogging her, O'Dell.
Been running your mouth, ensign, about boat matters?
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
As for the record player going off, well, yeah, that's strange.
But I don't think it calls for a lynching party.
I think we should all just take a deep breath.
- [Telephone rings]
- Conn, Brice.
[Man speaking indistinctly]
[Indistinct conversation]
Where'd you find it?
Make a hole!
Lieutenant, I was all set to toss these pants, then I noticed this, sir.
And these came from...
The half-dead guy, sir.
MAN: Must've been him done that record player.
Wake him up.
I... I'm sorry.
I'm not quite sure...
Wake the German up.
[German accent]
Hello, mein Kapitan.
Jesus.
It was me.
It was my idea.
I was the one who told him not to speak.
She had him under our noses the whole goddamn time.
Aah!
- Wait!
- I'll tell you.
I'll tell you everything.
His name is Ben Archerlift.
He's a downed aviator.
He's a patient of mine.
He's a prisoner of war, and under the Geneva Convention, he's entitled to humane treatment!
He has a wife and family.
He wants to get home just like you or me.
O'DELL:
Everything will be all right.
[Gunshot]
You should've told me.
Maybe I was afraid you'd do exactly what you've just done!
You should've told me no matter what,
'cause your little secret nearly cost every man here his life.
You had no cause.
Mr. O'Dell, the woman is confined to quarters for the duration of the patrol.
If she asks to use the toilet, you are to bring her a bucket.
Stumbo, clean up that fuckin' mess.
Fucking A-1, sir.
I'll be in my berth... sleeping.
[Spits]
I just wanted to save one.
[Sighs]
Just... one of my patients.

[Music slows]
[Music stops]
Aaaahh!
[Footsteps depart]
Look, it's happened twice now.
I don't think that's an accident.
Somebody is up to something.
Well, just so you know, I've walked in the wardroom before and found a steward listening to the record player while he was cleaning up.
- Now, I wouldn't blame him...
- Unless he's...
- Hey, Champ.
- Hey.
How are those hydrogen levels?
It's almost 3%.
Chief says we need to vent before long.
All right. We'll ride surface tonight... 2100.
[Sighs]
Is there something else?
Yeah.
I just can't believe it's one of our own hands doing this.
I've been on the boat seven weeks now, and I know most of the guys.
I just don't believe it's one of them.
- Who are you suggesting?
- I'm not suggesting anybody.
You know, it's been a rough patrol.
Some men do strange things under duress.
So just keep your eyes open.
Yes, sir.
[Footsteps depart]
Bright kid, O'Dell.
[Sighs]
MAN: [Ghostly voice]
Get off.
Get off before it's too late.
Down here.
[Gasps]
[Screams]
PAGE: I... I was awake.
I wasn't dreaming.
I know I was awake.
KINGSLEY:
Don't let them get to you.
PAGE:
I heard a voice. I heard it.
KINGSLEY: It's nothing.
Just ignore them, all right?
Claire, are you listening?
- I thought he spoke to me.
- Claire...
It wasn't his voice, but he spoke to me.
Claire!
[Snickering]
- Is this your idea of a joke?
- Claire, don't.
Have you got nothing better to do at a time of war than play games with dead bodies?!
You are on thin ice... real thin ice.
Wrap it back up... for the last time.
We'll dump him when we surface.
A bit more respect for the dead might be in order, Mr. Brice... from everybody onboard this ship.
This is a boat you're a guest on, not a ship.
[Sighs]
[Both laughing quietly]
[Ghostly voice] Get off before it's too late!
[Both shuddering]
[Screaming quietly]
[Grunting]
[Exhales sharply]
Hoag, are you pushing him up or feeling him up?
I've got a dead kraut dick in my face, and you're complaining?
Come on, Stumbo!
[Grunting]
[Squeaking]
[Chuckles]
[Ghostly voice]
You need to turn around.
[Chuckles]
Oh, nice try.
Hoag told you, right?
Turn around.
So many left behind.
I want...
[P.A. Blares indistinctly, crashing]
God damn it!
What the hell are you doing, Stumbo?
- Stumbo.
- [Panting]
I'm telling you, there's some bad hoodoo on this boat.
That might've worked on the female, Stumbo, but not me.
Look, fuck the brillo pad.
This ain't about her.
He talked to me.
- HOAG: Oh, wow.
- The dead guy?
- The dead kraut talked to me.
- Yeah, right.
Wow.
Did he talk to you in English or German?
I guess it was English.
Case closed.
[Klaxon blaring]
Prepare to surface.
Prepare to surface.
Be ready on all four engines.
Stand by to charge batteries.
Let's go. Come on.
Move it, move it.
Okay, okay.
The chief's gonna skin us alive.
I don't care what he said.
I've just got to get out of that room.
Well... make it quick, all right?

Yeah, it's good skies, though.

Well done.

Very well.
KINGSLEY: Is it possible to see the...
COORS:
Uh, talk to me later.
Mr. Coors, are we going to be surfacing soon, take on some fresh air?
- We're trying to.
- Any idea when that might be?
What are you doing here?
I... I wasn't comfortable in my cabin, what with the blood on the walls.
You shouldn't be in the skipper's cabin without permission.
Well, I'll gladly ask him.
Mr. Brice is the skipper, isn't he?
Lieutenant Brice is the current C.O. of the boat.
You need his permission to be anywhere besides your assigned quarters.
Now...
Sorry.

I'm sorry.
I regret not telling you about Schillings... because... well,
I... I should have realized that a submarine isn't a good place to keep secrets.
Is it?
We'd been stalking a German sub tender for a while.
We finally got our shot in, cracked its back with one torpedo.
We went topside to survey the damage, and the ship was gone.
But there's a lot of debris in the water, and Captain Winters decides to go down and haul some in.
It was the middle of the Atlantic.
He wants to do some souvenir hunting, get something for his... I don't know... his mantle piece.
I try to talk him out of it, and... but he's al...
Anyway, he... the boat hit an underwater obstruction, and he fell... he hit his head.
And he was... he went under before we could get to him.
I heard you were asking.
So he drowned.
We already radioed Connecticut with news of the accident.
[Sighs]
[Chuckles]
You know, we really, really got off on the wrong foot, and I...
So j-just feel free to move about the forward sections of...
[Electricity crackles]
Sorry, sir... humidity builds up, drips out the power bus.
I'll get right on it.
So... would you reconsider
England... finding a port there?
I'm sorry.
[Grunts]
Sorry for what?
Uh, she was... asking about Winters.
What did you tell her?
The story.
Well, it's coming up astern, but...
[Rumbling]
I don't know what that is.
[Rumbling continues, clanking]
[Loud thud]
[Rumbling, creaking]
[Rumbling, thudding continue]
Hooks!
They're using their hooks!
[Clanking]
Mr. Loomis, what do we do?
What are your orders,
Mr. Brice?
Mr. Loomis, the helm is waiting!
The men are waiting for your orders, Mr. Brice!
Aah!
Get out! Get out!
Everybody, out!
Move it out!
[Indistinct shouting]
Go! Go! Go!
Everybody, out!
- Come on!
- Get out!
[Echoing]
Get out! Get out!
Get down there, Harry!
Move!
[Creaks]
[Clicking]
Get out.
O'Dell, make sure everybody's out!
- Everybody's out, sir!
- Then close the goddamn hatch!
- Blow safety!
- Blow safety!
What heading, sir?!
Any goddamn heading!
Just get us out of here!
[Whirring, engines roar]
[Poles squeak]
[Shivering]
You'll do better at the board of inquiry.
[Clicking, hatch opens]
[Clicking, whirring]
We're sloughing oil, and it's bad.
I don't know exactly where it is, but it's somewhere between the pressure hull and the sea hull.
And if it's leaking here or here, then it's dumping oil under the main ballast, which means that every time we surface or dive...
We leave an oil slick.
Well, that's how... that's how he's been riding us.
This boat is cursed.
Figure of speech.
So how do we fix it?
Well, there's only one way... from the outside in.
[Thudding]
They'll be lining up for this job.
Okay, so let's make ready some dive gear.
All right.
O'Dell, pick two volunteers...
Yes, sir.
...besides yourself.
WALLY: You want someone to free-dive outside with you into the cold, black water, make our way below the boat, locate the floodboards, and slither in between the two hulls?
That's right.
Find the leak and fix it.
- At night.
- Hang on.
We're still submerged.
That means the main tanks are full of water.
This is in the dark, Dell.
Yeah, well, chief thinks that with the tower flooded, it gives the boat enough weight to stay down while we blow some air into the main tank.
Oh, well [Scoffs] if that's what the chief thinks.
So... you're gonna go out there.
You're gonna go outside.
Yes, that's right.
With all these... happenings happening.
Look alive.
All right.
Who are the lucky bastards?
[Scoffs] Fuck, no.
Set.
I asked him to go.
Buddy system.
[Hatch opens, creaking]
[Loud thud]
- [Muffled] Ooh!
- Oh, shit!
[Gasping]
[Gasping]
[Gasping]
[Gasping]
[All breathing heavily]
[Clanging]
[Clanging continues in distance]
[Sighs]
You and me, O'Dell.
Forward.
You guys take aft.
[All breathing heavily]
[Grunts]
[Panting]
Shit!
BRICE: 2330 hours.
To confirm sinking of German ship, four officers go topside...
Commander Winters, myself,
Lieutenant Loomis, and Lieutenant
J.G. Stephen Coors.
The night we lost
Old Man Winters...
Odd time to bring that up.
It's an odd place.
So, how'd he bang his head before he went over?
You heard.
I heard that the boat hit something, but I never felt it down below.
[Thudding]
What?!
I didn't say anything.
I know, but what were you thinking?
Well...
I used to hear about these dock workers.
They would get welded up in these kind of places.
And then... they were never heard from again.
Wally?
You are so fucking out-of-bounds with that shit!
Let's keep moving.
Forward trim tank, it looks like.
Better drive some wedges.
Yeah.
[Grunts, exhales sharply]
So anything I say... stays here... this side of the hull.
[Breathlessly]
Yeah. Yeah.
There were survivors from the sinking.
- [Indistinct shouting]
- Brice and Loomis even, uh... even tried to fish a few out, but... Winters had other ideas, and, uh... he ordered a gunnery party topside.
Well, three of us had a problem with machine-gunning those men right in the water,
I mean, even if they were German.
There was an argument.
It got kind of heated.
Well, why didn't you tell us?!
I guess, uh...
I guess we were trying to protect him... felt Winters was a pretty good C.O., even if he could be a tough son of a bitch sometimes.
For his reputation... you know, his family's sake.
Yeah, yeah, okay, but...
I still don't see how he hit his head.
Slippery metal.
Bad footing.
Accidents happen, right?
[Gasps]
[Screaming in distance]
[Both gasping]
Where the hell did that come from?!
Near or aft?
Crew, sound off!
Get them out of there!
Get them out!!
O'Dell!
[Clanking]
Sound off, O'Dell!
- Oh!
- Sir!
Fuck, was that you?
The light!
[All scream]
[Shuddering]
We gotta get him out.
Come on, guys.
- How are we gonna...
- [Thudding]
Did you see that?
What happened, guys?! Come on!
What happened out there?!
[All talking]
- Talk to me.
- Don't touch me.
Did you fix it?
Which one of you boys was screaming out there?
- Are we a man down?
- Don't touch me!
- Are we a man down?!
- Shut up!
Who was screaming?!
Come on, grow some dicks and shut up!
[Choking]
Now, where is Mr. O...
[Thudding]
Coors... where's Coors?
You tell me that's him.
That's gotta be Coors.
He's still alive, right?
Sir... that is the one person
I can guarantee it's not.
[Thudding continues]
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me!
- Don't! Don't!
- Hey, easy.
Easy, Stumbo.
Easy, easy.
- Easy, easy.
- Was that a "B"... dash, dot, dot, dot?
I didn't hear a "B."
[Thudding continues]
Dot, dash..."A"... thought I heard an "A."
No, that's not morse.
It's just some shit got caught up on the bow planes.
Now it's smacking up against...
"C"... you hear a "C"?
Dash, dot, dash, dot... definitely a "C."
It's hull sounds.
You guys are getting lathered up about hull sounds.
Now, would somebody please tell us what happened to Mr. Coors?
"Back"... B-A-C-K.
He's back.
And where'd you get the "K" from?
Dash, dot, dash... while you were talking.
Hey, champ, you can stay the hell out of this.
- And the rest of you...
- Enough, already, enough!
In the wardroom, 5 minutes.
Keep your mouths shut till we debrief.
LOOMIS:
Did you finish the job?
Yes, sir, absolutely.
Right, Wally? Wally?
Oh, yeah, I'm finished.
All right, so, look, if the weather is good, we surface tonight, we recharge the batteries.
We pour on the diesel, keep pushing for the barn.
O'DELL: Our barn?
Mr. Brice, southern English port's gonna be more than two days away.
Two days away, Mr. Brice!
[Indistinct conversations]
Kingsley here is a navigational officer. He knows the way.
I know all the ports, the depths, where the submarine nets are, the mine fields.
Yeah, and have the R.A.F. bomb us because they mistake us for a hostile boat... okay.
There are safety corridors that we can use...
Considered and rejected, thank you.
Mr. Brice, both our periscopes are down, our sonar is gone.
We are blind and nearly deaf.
Our men are in a bad way, and now we've lost two of our senior officers.
Welcome to the war, O'Dell.
This has nothing to do with the war.
Just how much longer can we not say what we're all thinking?
No one wants to be the first?
Fine. Allow me.
This submarine is haun...
When I want your opinion,
Miss Page, I'll give it to you.
I am not one of your men that you can just dismiss, Mr. Brice!
I don't believe we're alone down here, and I know some of you think the same way.
Unless we find a safe harbor soon, we're all going to end up like your friend Mr. Coors.
The loss of Lieutenant Coors is unfortunate.
It fails to affect our plans.
[Clicks, static]
Attention all hands... it's daylight now.
I expect to surface... at 1900, recharge the batteries, and proceed on base course back to Connecticut.
- That is all.
- [Switch clicks]
You're 10 seconds away from finding out what the penalty is for mutiny at sea,
'cause that's how long it's gonna take me to open the armory and reload that sidearm.
Now, do either of you care to say anything else that might further agitate this crew or me?
Mr. O'Dell?
Yeah, I didn't think so.
[Sighs]
We just knock the nose around a little bit, we're back on base, so make it 2-8-5.
Make it 2-8-5 true.
2-8-5 true, sir.
[Engines rumbling]
Heading home, boys.
Sound good?
- Yes, sir.
- Sounds good, sir.
[Clanking]
Hey, you're oversteering.
Mind your rudder.
She's getting some resistance, sir.
[Creaking, rumbling]
[Grunting]
[Rattling]
Chief of boat to control.
Chief of boat to control room.
[Rumbling continues]
[Rumbling continues]
All right, belay that.
Belay that.
I said belay that!
[Explosion]
- Oh!
- Oh!
[Rumbling stops]
[Squeaking]
Rudder at midship, sir.
Um, some... kind of hydraulic failure.
Oh, Christ.
Must have overshot our heading by...
170 degrees.
Oh, good. A gun.
Yeah, I needed a gun.
I'll put that with the prizes.
Okay, I got feathers, crosses, and strip-show icons...
Rudder malfunction.
When we tried to shut down the props, no dice.
Wouldn't respond.
We're on a runaway boat, fellas.
Now, can any of you top that?
[Spits] Well...
I had a strange thought.
Take a number.
Yeah, but this one's real creep-show stuff.
What if, when we took on that kraut ship...
...we didn't sink 'em?
What if... they sank us?
Oh, that's a good twist.
I don't get it.
Might explain how that dead kraut talked to Stumbo.
I don't get it.
And the controls... that they froze up.
No, they... they rusted up.
That's because we're at the... the bottom of the ocean.
Flooded out.
Of course, I'm not sure what all that pounding was about.
Those are rescue divers... pounding on the hull.
Only it's too late.
Shit, I get it.
Hydrogen from the batteries...
CO2, ozone from the electrical shorts... that's what we're breathing right now.
Like those deep-sea divers that don't get enough oxygen... head starts playing tricks on 'em.
We got mechanical problems, that's all, okay?
We always got mechanical problems.
Now, please... will you pinch this shit off?
- Unless...
- Oh...
It happened during the depth charging.
Remember that one?
Rolled right down our deck.
[Creaking]
[Clicks]
So exactly how far from England are we?
Can I ask why you're asking?
No.
Right.
Uh, what's our heading?
Right. Uh...
[Muttering indistinctly]
May I ask why you're asking?
Just in case the boat can't make it back home... for whatever reason.
LOOMIS: What do you suggest we do about it, chief?
[Indistinct voice]
Come on.
Enough of the guessing games.
- Pressure blinding the shafts.
- No, I don't think that's it.
Just lay it out for us, chief.
What about the I.M.O. pumps?
I.M.O. pumps check out.
I don't think it's that either.
The rudder has a dedicated line from here to the stern.
If we tap into there somewhere aft,
I think we should regain our steering.
But where are you gonna tap in?
That's the thing.
The line goes right through the battery room.
That's a little dicey, isn't it, without venting first?
Just threading up new hydraulics, no welding.
Well, where are we at, anyway?
13 percent down.
- 13 percent hydrogen?
- Keep your voice down.
Look, I don't know any other way to regain control...
[Rumbling]
[Screeching]
Fuck if I know.
All right, but you gotta make sure you're sealed off,
'cause we don't want a repeat of the Hindenburg here.
Let's keep this quiet.
As if it's a bloody mechanical problem.
[Hinges creak, hatch slams]
[Whirring, clicking]
Fore door sealed.
After door sealed.
[Sighs]
What's happened here, hmm?
What is this?
Go to the galley.
Get a cup of coffee.
Oh, no, I'm fine, sir.
Really.
You're falling asleep, champ.
- I'll watch your bubble.
- Yes, sir.
Lieutenant, a word?
- Not now.
- No, Mr. Loomis.
We need to speak right now.
[Grunts]
[Rumbling]
That is a whale, right?
[Sighs]
What else would it be?
Come on.
Let's get that rudder working.
Now, maybe this is just a coincidence.
I know Lieutenant Coors wasn't too sure about the last star fix.
But it sure seems like we're going right back to where we sunk that German ship.
Clear the compartment.
Everybody, give us 5 minutes.
Go!
All right.
We're almost all set.
Just repressurizing the line, see if we can't put the brakes on this little joyride.
[Rumbling, thudding]
[Powers down, silence]
I'll reset the bus.
Shit!
[Whirring]
[Hatch hinges creak]
Hey, guys, we lost power up here.
Shut that goddamn door before I shut it with your goddamn face!
What are you saying, O'Dell?
It's not a coincidence?
Somebody put us on this course?
I'm just asking a question.
Let me ask one.
Where were you when the rudder went over?
Huh?
This course heads back to England, and I've noticed you've had a hard-on for anything English.
So where were you, O'Dell?
Back of the boat... messing with the rudder assembly?
Or did you get some motormac...
That is the craziest thing
I have ever heard!
Not as crazy as what you're saying!
I'm tired of this hoodoo horseshit!
It is not what you think it is!
It is not even remotely
fucking possible!
Okay?!

Try to stop me.
You're gonna pull through.

Come on. One more.
Come on, Stumbo.
STUMBO:
It's like it's welded.
[Sighs]
All I know is what Coors told me.
And apparently...
Captain Winters wanted to shoot the German survivors.
Mr. Brice and Mr. Loomis and Mr... Mr. Coors... wanted to help.
Apparently Captain Winters lost the argument.
Well, that's interesting.
[Breathes deeply]
But it's not what I heard... from Mr. Brice.
[Breathlessly]
Lieutenant?
Are you sure he came back here?
BRICE: Looking for me?
[Gasps]
I, uh...
Just... reporting, sir, that the heating is down.
And, uh... the bow's levers are stuck.
Stumbo's working on it right now.
And that we show
90 pounds of compressed air still left in the system, and I... wasn't sure if you wanted to use that when we tried to surface or use it now so we can breathe.
Shinola.
Sir?
Running out of shinola, too.
We also wanted to ask you about Captain Winters... whether there was anything you could tell us about what happened that night that might help us to understand...
Don't pretend you don't know.
Just don't pretend anymore.
Well, wasn't that awkward?
STUMBO: Maybe Hoag was right.
Maybe we already bought it.
If not the depth charge, then... the hydrogen.
If not the hydrogen, then...
[Shudders]
Maybe the cold.
And if not that, then we got a big evil spirit batting cleanup.
- Jesus Christ.
- Come on, Stumbo.
There should only be so many ways a guy can die.
Listen to me.
CO2 hangs low.
It starts from the floor up, and I need you right now...
- No, no.
- To get up on your feet.
- Maybe I just need to...
- Stumbo. Stumbo!
- Let me try.
- We already bought it.
Come on, Stumbo. Head up.
- Over and over...
- I need you to sit up.
- Over and over again.
- Look at me.
Now look at me.
Look at me.
- [Panting]
- Good.
Feel that?
Well, you're alive, then, aren't you?
You fuckin'...
- Stumbo...
- Whoa, hey, hey, hey! Hey!
- Take it easy! Hey!
- Relax, man!
Stumbo!
Isn't there a winch or a pulley or maybe a come-along in a bowsman's locker?
- Yeah.
- Can't we use that?
You know what he's talking about, Stumbo?
- Yeah.
- Well, come on.
Come... we need it. Come on.
Show... show me, Stumbo.
We've got to get it.
Okay, come on. Come on.
[Panting]
So, tell me why three officers would conspire to kill their captain and cover it up.
That's what you're thinking, isn't it?
[Panting]
What if I am?
I can see I'm not the only one.
Loomis was up for a major citation.
And Brice was ready for his own command.
He was from a naval family.
He went to Annapolis.
Coors had this beautiful girl waiting for him back in Boston that he was always talking about, Claire.
These guys had everything to live for.
By that reasoning... they had everything to lose.
[Soft rumbling]
Are we missing somebody?
[Rumbling continues]
Wallace...
Wallace?
- No!
- [Gasps]
- No! No!
- Shh!
- No-o-o!
- It's just us.
It's just... us.
- [All panting]
- Now, listen...
We're running out of plays in the playbook.
Do you have... any idea why the boat is going back or how we can get control of it?
[Panting]
I've been checking the literature on this subject.
And the thing we know about maledictions is...
Maledictions?
Look it up.
Maledictions don't issue from Heaven or Hell but from some unresolved place in between.
In fact, there's a great...
Wallace... we're running out of air.
[Breathes deeply]
Suffice to say... the malediction needs satisfaction in order to escape its netherworld.
And if you had to guess... what would satisfy our malediction?
Old Man Winters never got a chance to go down with the ship, did he?
[Creaking]
[Labored breathing]
[Grunts]
Wallace, leave yours here.
We gotta dig up some more light.
Okay, listen, uh...
Just... Just promise me you'll stay on your feet, okay?

So what you're saying is... that the submarine
Kingsley saw... the one he thought was German...
Wasn't.
So it was an accident?
Not when he left us in the water to die.
Not when he heard the cries for help in English.
You actually believe that Captain Winters would just leave...
PAGE: Help! Help me!
O'DELL: No.
Captain Winters wanted to pick up the survivors.
That means...
PAGE: Help!
Who mis-I.D.'d the ship?
Who had everything to lose?

Either the battery has finally crapped out, or...

Stumbo, see if you can crack this hatch. Use a crowbar.
Drain the tower.
See if we can get out that way.
If not, we gotta go out the forward...
[Shuddering]
Oh, God.
Hey, fellas... we have contact.
On SJ radar...
4,000 yards, starboard beam.
It's the same one?
It's the same kraut ship?
- Are we being choosy?
- All right.
Uh, Wallace, raise the antenna.
Issue a radio challenge on the Ariel-6.
Get the ship I.D.'d as of right now.
BRICE:
Well done, Mr. O'Dell.
But I'm feeling much better now.
You were saying?
We have a contact.
That may be an opportunity.
An opportunity?
To abandon ship.
Well, I don't know that that's a friendly out there.
Well, neither do I.
But it seems better to scuttle now and take our chances with a surface vessel, even if it is German.
Scuttle and tell Connecticut what?
We sunk one of their finest fleet submarines because we lost a few men carrying out our mission?
A few men, sir?
[Creaking]
Contact at 2,500 yards.
Might cross the stern.
We'll wait... right here.
Wallace... no matter what
Mr. Brice says,
I want you to go to the radio shack and establish a voice contact with that ship immediately.
You are not the skipper of this ship, Mr. O'Dell!

If that's your plan... get on with it, you fucking coward!
[Keys jingling, door hinges creak]
[Gunshot]
Stumbo, man the ports.
Get ready to scuttle this boat!
Just leave!
They'll blame it on a U-boat!
Just get out of here!
They'll never fuckin' know!
Any more advice for me, champ?
[Gunshots]
[Gunshot]
[Thunder rumbling]
500 yards and closing!
Looks like we're definitely gonna lose some paint on this one, sir!
I kept looking for some way just... just to... take it back, to make it end right... some way without dishonoring Winters.
[Chuckles]
I was gonna wear this uniform back to port.
Now...
What should I do, Miss Page?
You give me the light so that I can signal for help.
I don't...
God, I don't know!
[Thunder crashes]
[Thunder crashes]
[Thunder rumbling]
I just figured out why he didn't kill me, too.
He didn't have to.
[Gasps]
[Gunshot, thunder crashes]
[Gunshot]
Aah!
[Thunder crashes]
Hey! Over here!
Come back!
[Voice breaking]
Come back.
[Thunder crashes]
[Panting]
[Panting]
[Exhales sharply]
[Rattling]
[Exhales deeply]
Well, you weren't the first woman that ever slapped me, and you won't be the last.
But that was a good thing you done for me back there.
Well done, Miss Page.
Well done, Mr. Stumbo.
Dead but not buried, I see.
Pardon me?
Your vessel.
[Creaking, rumbling]
[Water splashing]
So, what would you say if you had to explain it all?
Does seem rather unlikely now, doesn't it?
Have you thought that... that maybe when Captain Winters died, he just... died, and that was it?
And the rest...
[Exhales deeply]
And the rest...
I don't know.
You say whatever you have to say, ensign.
I'll always believe we were brought back here for a reason.
[Rumbling]
[Suspenseful instrumental music plays]
[Music ends]

 In New York City's war on crime,<br>
<SYNC Start=5046><P Class=ENCC> the worst criminal offenders are pursued<br> by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.<br>
<SYNC Start=10106><P Class=ENCC>
These are their stories.<br>
<SYNC Start=13026><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=15822><P Class=ENCC>
Not this again.<br>
<SYNC Start=17583><P Class=ENCC>
What do you think you're gonna find?<br>
<SYNC Start=18773><P Class=ENCC>
Motel receipts? Love letters?<br>
<SYNC Start=21539><P Class=ENCC>
Lyz, why are you doing this?<br>
<SYNC Start=24539><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=27272><P Class=ENCC>
Why are you, Henry?<br>
<SYNC Start=30272><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=31008><P Class=ENCC>
I think she's having me followed.<br>
<SYNC Start=34008><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=35274><P Class=ENCC>
I don't know what's wrong with her.<br>
<SYNC Start=36995><P Class=ENCC>
Yesterday she left me nine messages,<br>
<SYNC Start=38836><P Class=ENCC> telling me to be careful.<br>
<SYNC Start=41836><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=42654><P Class=ENCC>
I gave the cook the night off.<br>
<SYNC Start=44149><P Class=ENCC>
I thought we could all<br> have dinner at Mr. Chow's.<br>
<SYNC Start=46990><P Class=ENCC>
Uh, sorry, Mom.<br>
I have to work.<br>
<SYNC Start=48753><P Class=ENCC>
I can't make it either.<br>
I have to fly to Miami.<br>
<SYNC Start=51033><P Class=ENCC>
I won't be back till after midnight.<br>
<SYNC Start=53384><P Class=ENCC>
I can do an early lunch,<br> around 11:00.<br>
<SYNC Start=55762><P Class=ENCC>
 I can swing that.<br>
<SYNC Start=57156><P Class=ENCC>
I'm busy.<br>
<SYNC Start=58286><P Class=ENCC>
Never mind.<br>
<SYNC Start=60125><P Class=ENCC>
I just wanted us all to have dinner.<br>
<SYNC Start=63125><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=67986><P Class=ENCC>
If I were less trusting,<br>
<SYNC Start=68925><P Class=ENCC>
I'd think she's the one having the affair.<br>
<SYNC Start=71925><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=77309><P Class=ENCC>
I told you I'm gonna prove<br> how wrong you are, and I will.<br>
<SYNC Start=80437><P Class=ENCC>
Stay out of it, Clayton.<br>
<SYNC Start=81791><P Class=ENCC>
Please?<br>
<SYNC Start=83262><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=84313><P Class=ENCC>
You and Dad are<br> not splitting up over this bull.<br>
<SYNC Start=87313><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=91941><P Class=ENCC>
Big hands, great ass, ponytail...<br>
<SYNC Start=93906><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, what was his name?<br>
<SYNC Start=95176><P Class=ENCC>
Lyz, you remember that<br>
Welsh masseur at Bliss?<br>
<SYNC Start=97444><P Class=ENCC>
No.<br>
<SYNC Start=98368><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=99334><P Class=ENCC>
It's gonna be a boy.<br>
<SYNC Start=100540><P Class=ENCC>
What?<br>
<SYNC Start=101769><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, you mean Livvy...<br> my sister-in-law.<br>
<SYNC Start=104697><P Class=ENCC>
We just found out<br>
Monday she's pregnant again.<br>
<SYNC Start=107171><P Class=ENCC>
But how did you know?<br>
<SYNC Start=110256><P Class=ENCC>
Did she go off her Xanax?<br>
<SYNC Start=112444><P Class=ENCC>
Clayton, it's Mom again.<br>
<SYNC Start=113738><P Class=ENCC>
Would you please, please,<br> give me a call.<br>
<SYNC Start=115288><P Class=ENCC>
I just want to make sure you're okay.<br>
<SYNC Start=117414><P Class=ENCC>
I'll try you at work again.<br>
<SYNC Start=120414><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=130217><P Class=ENCC>
Clayton?<br>
<SYNC Start=132415><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, I thought...<br>
<SYNC Start=134690><P Class=ENCC>
No, he still hasn't called.<br>
<SYNC Start=137133><P Class=ENCC>
I just have this terrible...<br>
<SYNC Start=139282><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=141431><P Class=ENCC>
Yes, it would help.<br>
Are you sure?<br>
<SYNC Start=146137><P Class=ENCC>
Thank you.<br>
<SYNC Start=148488><P Class=ENCC>
Yes, I'm... I'm sitting down.<br>
<SYNC Start=151255><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, man, I can't believe<br> how much that girl drank.<br>
<SYNC Start=155586><P Class=ENCC>
It looks like she helped<br> this guy park his car.<br>
<SYNC Start=158586><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=160052><P Class=ENCC>
Hey, wait.<br>
What's that? A little TV?<br>
<SYNC Start=163184><P Class=ENCC>
It's a video monitor.<br>
<SYNC Start=164435><P Class=ENCC>
Somebody left it on.<br>
<SYNC Start=166014><P Class=ENCC>
It's a live transmission from a camera.<br>
<SYNC Start=168467><P Class=ENCC>
It's got to be close.<br>

We called you as soon as<br> we found his press credentials.<br>
<SYNC Start=231672><P Class=ENCC>
Clayton Webster:<br>
He's a cameraman for Newstime.<br>
<SYNC Start=234307><P Class=ENCC>
His cell phone was in the car.<br>
<SYNC Start=235637><P Class=ENCC>
He's got messages.<br>
<SYNC Start=236992><P Class=ENCC>
We're getting his password<br> from the phone company.<br>
<SYNC Start=238832><P Class=ENCC>
Thanks.<br>
<SYNC Start=240943><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=242478><P Class=ENCC>
Wallet's loaded.<br>
<SYNC Start=243927><P Class=ENCC>
Plastic's all accounted for.<br>
<SYNC Start=246438><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe one day we'll get lucky<br> and robbery will be the motive.<br>
<SYNC Start=249807><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=251567><P Class=ENCC>
Now, the light doesn't work,<br> but, uh,<br>
<SYNC Start=255190><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=256116><P Class=ENCC> the bulb...<br>
<SYNC Start=258101><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=259740><P Class=ENCC>
It looks new.<br>
<SYNC Start=261580><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=264083><P Class=ENCC>
Webster?<br>
Yeah. His throat's been cut.<br>
<SYNC Start=267040><P Class=ENCC>
There's hardly any blood in the trunk.<br>
<SYNC Start=268431><P Class=ENCC>
There's no blood on the ground.<br>
<SYNC Start=270660><P Class=ENCC>
He was killed somewhere else.<br>
<SYNC Start=272094><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, they put his body<br> in the trunk, and his camera...<br>
<SYNC Start=275445><P Class=ENCC> they didn't realize<br> the camera was still running...<br>
<SYNC Start=278385><P Class=ENCC> and then drove the car here.<br>
<SYNC Start=280477><P Class=ENCC>
The tape's missing.<br>
<SYNC Start=282413><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe he was working<br> and pointed his camera at the wrong news.<br>
<SYNC Start=285782><P Class=ENCC>
Of all places to ditch a car,<br>
<SYNC Start=287441><P Class=ENCC>
Long Island City would<br> not be my first choice.<br>

Newstime Offices 52 East 10th Street<br>
Wednesday, April 30<br>
<SYNC Start=307491><P Class=ENCC>
We were doing a story on a doorman strike,<br>
<SYNC Start=310001><P Class=ENCC> another on gypsy cabs.<br>
<SYNC Start=311700><P Class=ENCC>
Nothing more dangerous than that.<br>
<SYNC Start=312848><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe he was working on a story of his own.<br>
<SYNC Start=314852><P Class=ENCC>
Uh, no. He was my cameraman.<br>
<SYNC Start=316758><P Class=ENCC>
If we could look at his computer...<br>
<SYNC Start=318518><P Class=ENCC>
It's not his computer.<br>
<SYNC Start=319809><P Class=ENCC>
It's the company's.<br>
<SYNC Start=321020><P Class=ENCC>
There could be names of sources,<br> all kinds of protected information.<br>
<SYNC Start=324318><P Class=ENCC>
"If your pictures aren't good enough,<br> you aren't close enough."<br>
<SYNC Start=326901><P Class=ENCC>
The war photographer, Robert Capa.<br>
<SYNC Start=328492><P Class=ENCC>
Webster's motto?<br>
<SYNC Start=330287><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, I guess.<br>
<SYNC Start=331662><P Class=ENCC>
Is this Webster here?<br>
<SYNC Start=332931><P Class=ENCC>
Look. He was in the war on Iraq.<br>
<SYNC Start=336790><P Class=ENCC>
Was he embedded?<br>
<SYNC Start=338775><P Class=ENCC>
I don't think the kid<br> actually saw any action.<br>
<SYNC Start=341247><P Class=ENCC>
Eh, just, you know...<br>
<SYNC Start=342603><P Class=ENCC>
I can see he has some messages here<br>
<SYNC Start=344459><P Class=ENCC> from his mom last night.<br>
<SYNC Start=346315><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, last night.<br>
Every night.<br>
<SYNC Start=347810><P Class=ENCC>
The kid lived with his parents.<br>
<SYNC Start=349142><P Class=ENCC>
Do you mind if we keep these messages?<br>
<SYNC Start=350802><P Class=ENCC>
I'm sure his mom wasn't, uh,<br>
<SYNC Start=352926><P Class=ENCC> one of his sources.<br>
<SYNC Start=354136><P Class=ENCC>
And if you find anything on that computer,<br>
<SYNC Start=356552><P Class=ENCC> you let us know.<br>
<SYNC Start=358657><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=364311><P Class=ENCC>
- Christine Roberts?<br>
- Uh, she's not here, and I have to go out.<br>
<SYNC Start=367014><P Class=ENCC>
I'm a reporter for the...<br>
<SYNC Start=368049><P Class=ENCC>
You were going so fast,<br> we almost lost you.<br>
<SYNC Start=370429><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, look, a download off Webster's<br> computer from the property tax rolls.<br>
<SYNC Start=373887><P Class=ENCC>
Must be for the story<br> he wasn't doing on his own.<br>
<SYNC Start=376950><P Class=ENCC>
We'll take over from here, Jerry.<br>
<SYNC Start=378417><P Class=ENCC>
Mmm.<br>
<SYNC Start=379282><P Class=ENCC>
Can we come in?<br>
<SYNC Start=380575><P Class=ENCC>
The police. What choice do I have?<br>
<SYNC Start=383108><P Class=ENCC>
I'm Detective Goren.<br>
<SYNC Start=384564><P Class=ENCC>
This is Detective Eames.<br>
Uh...<br>
<SYNC Start=386028><P Class=ENCC>
- And you are?<br>
- Octavia Ruiz.<br>
<SYNC Start=387627><P Class=ENCC>
I rent this place from Christine.<br>
<SYNC Start=389079><P Class=ENCC>
I moved in three weeks ago.<br>
<SYNC Start=390186><P Class=ENCC>
Do you want to see my green card?<br>
<SYNC Start=391846><P Class=ENCC>
It's not necessary.<br>
<SYNC Start=393278><P Class=ENCC>
You are in the art business.<br>
<SYNC Start=394624><P Class=ENCC>
I am a lawyer.<br>
<SYNC Start=396670><P Class=ENCC>
I am representing the estate of<br> a great collector in Santiago.<br>
<SYNC Start=400264><P Class=ENCC>
I found a buyer in New York.<br>
<SYNC Start=402107><P Class=ENCC>
The Webster Gallery.<br>
<SYNC Start=402954><P Class=ENCC>
These are going to the Webster Gallery?<br>
<SYNC Start=405682><P Class=ENCC>
He is my buyer.<br>
<SYNC Start=407379><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Henry Webster.<br>
<SYNC Start=408488><P Class=ENCC>
Does he have a brother<br> or a son named Clayton?<br>
<SYNC Start=413179><P Class=ENCC>
A son, yes.<br>
A funny name like that.<br>
<SYNC Start=414956><P Class=ENCC>
What's funny is Clayton looked up<br>
<SYNC Start=416464><P Class=ENCC> who was paying the tax on this condo.<br>
<SYNC Start=419464><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=420283><P Class=ENCC>
Why would he do that?<br>
<SYNC Start=421514><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe he thought his father was paying.<br>
<SYNC Start=424272><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, I see, because Henry<br> and I are having an affair?<br>
<SYNC Start=428020><P Class=ENCC>
Now that is ridiculous.<br>
<SYNC Start=429858><P Class=ENCC>
Uh, i-is there a reason<br>
<SYNC Start=430782><P Class=ENCC> why you haven't sent these to him yet?<br>
<SYNC Start=432225><P Class=ENCC>
I mean, the shipping label<br>
<SYNC Start=434238><P Class=ENCC> still has a date from a month ago.<br>
<SYNC Start=437429><P Class=ENCC>
I'm waiting for Henry to pay me.<br>
<SYNC Start=441301><P Class=ENCC>
How much does he owe you?<br>
<SYNC Start=442816><P Class=ENCC>
Two million dollars.<br>
<SYNC Start=444862><P Class=ENCC>
Well, there you go right there.<br>
<SYNC Start=446253><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe that's why his son is suspicious.<br>
<SYNC Start=448381><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, St. Peter's.<br>
<SYNC Start=449776><P Class=ENCC>
Right across from where<br>
Clayton was found this morning,<br>
<SYNC Start=452943><P Class=ENCC> dead.<br>
<SYNC Start=454438><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=456525><P Class=ENCC>
L-I'll bet you're gonna say<br> it was a coincidence.<br>
<SYNC Start=459328><P Class=ENCC>
- No. L-l...<br>
- No?<br>
<SYNC Start=460734><P Class=ENCC>
- I mean, yes.<br>
- Yes?<br>
<SYNC Start=463807><P Class=ENCC>
I don't understand.<br>
<SYNC Start=465060><P Class=ENCC>
There is nothing between Henry and me.<br>
<SYNC Start=469392><P Class=ENCC>
Nothing.<br>
<SYNC Start=471144><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=473848><P Class=ENCC>
Two million bucks worth of art is nothing?<br>
<SYNC Start=478625><P Class=ENCC>

The Webster Gallery 130 Spring Street<br>
Wednesday, April 30<br>
<SYNC Start=480633><P Class=ENCC>
I was in Miami most of the day.<br>
<SYNC Start=482720><P Class=ENCC>
I got back just after 1:30.<br>
<SYNC Start=485579><P Class=ENCC>
Clayton was supposed to be working.<br>
<SYNC Start=487075><P Class=ENCC>
I'm... I'm sure the people<br> in his office would know.<br>
<SYNC Start=488608><P Class=ENCC>
They don't. Do you know where<br> we found your son, Mr. Webster?<br>
<SYNC Start=492934><P Class=ENCC>
In Long Island City,<br> in an alley off Steinway Street.<br>
<SYNC Start=497177><P Class=ENCC>
Do you know someone from that neighborhood?<br>
<SYNC Start=499546><P Class=ENCC>
A young woman, Octavia Ruiz?<br>
<SYNC Start=502546><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=504038><P Class=ENCC>
Uh, yes. Yes, her.<br>
L... I know...<br>
<SYNC Start=506974><P Class=ENCC>
That has nothing to do with Clayton.<br>
<SYNC Start=508469><P Class=ENCC>
Well, we're trying to sort that out.<br>
<SYNC Start=511085><P Class=ENCC>
So far we've come up with two million dollars<br>
<SYNC Start=513241><P Class=ENCC> that you've given to Ms. Ruiz.<br>
<SYNC Start=514939><P Class=ENCC>
That's coming from your wife, right?<br>
<SYNC Start=516616><P Class=ENCC>
I'm paying for a collection of prints.<br>
<SYNC Start=518356><P Class=ENCC>
As for the source of the money,<br> that's none of your business.<br>
<SYNC Start=520494><P Class=ENCC>
We checked your wife's pedigree.<br>
<SYNC Start=522359><P Class=ENCC>
It's amazing what one<br> copper mine can do for a family.<br>
<SYNC Start=525537><P Class=ENCC>
Yes. All right.<br>
<SYNC Start=527217><P Class=ENCC>
Lyz is advancing me the money.<br>
<SYNC Start=528878><P Class=ENCC>
It's a good investment.<br>
<SYNC Start=529989><P Class=ENCC>
It'll put the gallery on the map.<br>
<SYNC Start=532646><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, but she's having second thoughts,<br>
<SYNC Start=534100><P Class=ENCC> because she thinks that<br> there's something going on<br>
<SYNC Start=535762><P Class=ENCC> between you and Ms. Ruiz.<br>
<SYNC Start=538152><P Class=ENCC>
My wife is very insecure.<br>
<SYNC Start=540850><P Class=ENCC>
What does it have to do with my son?<br>
<SYNC Start=543628><P Class=ENCC>
Well, she tried to get in<br> touch with your son last night.<br>
<SYNC Start=545815><P Class=ENCC>
She left messages.<br>
<SYNC Start=547353><P Class=ENCC>
That's just Lyz worrying.<br>
<SYNC Start=548622><P Class=ENCC>
She didn't like him working nights.<br>
<SYNC Start=549955><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe she had reason to worry.<br>
<SYNC Start=551178><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe she asked him to confirm<br>
<SYNC Start=552821><P Class=ENCC> her suspicions, to follow Ms. Ruiz.<br>
<SYNC Start=556047><P Class=ENCC>
In the first place,<br> there is nothing to confirm.<br>
<SYNC Start=557676><P Class=ENCC>
In the second place, my son<br>
<SYNC Start=559336><P Class=ENCC> would never humor my wife's paranoid fugues!<br>
<SYNC Start=561463><P Class=ENCC>
This time he did.<br>
<SYNC Start=563670><P Class=ENCC>
He checked the tax records on Ms. Ruiz's condo<br>
<SYNC Start=566414><P Class=ENCC> to see who the owner was.<br>
<SYNC Start=568033><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe he thought it was you.<br>
<SYNC Start=571033><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=575681><P Class=ENCC>
My son was not killed because of this.<br>
<SYNC Start=579703><P Class=ENCC>
I don't believe it.<br>
<SYNC Start=581971><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=584873><P Class=ENCC>
I almost told Henry everything.<br>
<SYNC Start=587123><P Class=ENCC>
L... l... I can't. I know.<br>
<SYNC Start=591133><P Class=ENCC>
It's a terrible burden.<br>
<SYNC Start=592258><P Class=ENCC>
I don't... I don't know how you live with it.<br>
<SYNC Start=593981><P Class=ENCC>
You have to believe that there is a purpose,<br>
<SYNC Start=596697><P Class=ENCC> that it's a blessing.<br>
<SYNC Start=598274><P Class=ENCC>
And... And know that Clayton will be all right.<br>
<SYNC Start=601806><P Class=ENCC>
He... He died near the three churches.<br>
<SYNC Start=604199><P Class=ENCC>
Three churches.<br>
<SYNC Start=605673><P Class=ENCC>
It's a sign.<br>
<SYNC Start=607250><P Class=ENCC>
Surrounded by angels and saints.<br>
<SYNC Start=610591><P Class=ENCC>
He's at peace.<br>
<SYNC Start=612067><P Class=ENCC>
And he wants you to know that.<br>
<SYNC Start=615838><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=619853><P Class=ENCC>
The airline confirmed the dad<br> was on the flight back from Miami.<br>
<SYNC Start=622555><P Class=ENCC>
Ms. Ruiz, on the other hand,<br> was at a gallery opening downtown.<br>
<SYNC Start=627139><P Class=ENCC>
A neighbor saw her come home<br> alone around 11:00.<br>
<SYNC Start=630203><P Class=ENCC>
Ruiz had anything to do with this murder,<br>
<SYNC Start=631798><P Class=ENCC> you think she'd make sure the body<br>
<SYNC Start=632998><P Class=ENCC> didn't end up on her doorstep.<br>
<SYNC Start=634639><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, that's not the only thing<br> that doesn't add up.<br>
<SYNC Start=636867><P Class=ENCC>
Uh, the lab found traces of animal blood...<br>
<SYNC Start=640318><P Class=ENCC> in the wound on the kid's neck,<br>
<SYNC Start=641550><P Class=ENCC> probably from the knife.<br>
<SYNC Start=642802><P Class=ENCC>
And then there's the bulb in the trunk.<br>
<SYNC Start=646639><P Class=ENCC>
The repair record on the car...<br>
<SYNC Start=649202><P Class=ENCC> shows it was replaced six months ago.<br>
<SYNC Start=653716><P Class=ENCC>
They last longer than that.<br>
<SYNC Start=656370><P Class=ENCC>
Well, unless it stays on all night.<br>
<SYNC Start=660111><P Class=ENCC>
It's the pass code<br>
<SYNC Start=661679><P Class=ENCC> for the voice mail on Clayton's cell phone.<br>
<SYNC Start=664679><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=666721><P Class=ENCC>
First message.<br>
<SYNC Start=668033><P Class=ENCC>
Where are you, sweetheart?<br>
<SYNC Start=669570><P Class=ENCC>
I wish you'd call me.<br>
<SYNC Start=671290><P Class=ENCC>
Next message.<br>
<SYNC Start=672706><P Class=ENCC>
Clayton, it's Mom again.<br>
<SYNC Start=673892><P Class=ENCC>
Would you please, please, give me a call.<br>
<SYNC Start=675515><P Class=ENCC>
I just want to make sure you're okay.<br>
<SYNC Start=677332><P Class=ENCC>
End of messages.<br>
<SYNC Start=679072><P Class=ENCC>
That was at 11:35.<br>
<SYNC Start=682552><P Class=ENCC>
Just about the same time<br>
<SYNC Start=683598><P Class=ENCC> as the last message she left at his work.<br>
<SYNC Start=686766><P Class=ENCC>
This lady's sick with worry,<br>
<SYNC Start=688161><P Class=ENCC> and she just stopped calling?<br>
<SYNC Start=691161><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=691385><P Class=ENCC>
I went to bed.<br>
<SYNC Start=692435><P Class=ENCC>
That's why I stopped.<br>
<SYNC Start=694297><P Class=ENCC>
Please be careful.<br>
<SYNC Start=697622><P Class=ENCC>
We will.<br>
<SYNC Start=700735><P Class=ENCC>
Is there a particular reason<br> why you were calling him?<br>
<SYNC Start=704977><P Class=ENCC>
We were very close.<br>
We talked often.<br>
<SYNC Start=707258><P Class=ENCC>
Uh, about your husband.<br>
<SYNC Start=710425><P Class=ENCC>
Your husband told us<br> you suspect him of having an affair.<br>
<SYNC Start=714254><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=717524><P Class=ENCC>
Did you ask your son to check up<br> on a woman, Octavia Ruiz,<br>
<SYNC Start=721634><P Class=ENCC> maybe watch her apartment,<br>
<SYNC Start=724922><P Class=ENCC> catch your husband there?<br>
<SYNC Start=726967><P Class=ENCC>
No. I would never ask him to go up there.<br>
<SYNC Start=729013><P Class=ENCC>
It's too dangerous.<br>
<SYNC Start=732013><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=732292><P Class=ENCC>
Um, up there?<br>
<SYNC Start=734467><P Class=ENCC>
The Bronx.<br>
<SYNC Start=735239><P Class=ENCC>
I found a woman's address<br> in my husband's wallet.<br>
<SYNC Start=739348><P Class=ENCC>
Mrs. Webster,<br> she moved three weeks ago,<br>
<SYNC Start=743539><P Class=ENCC> to Long Island City,<br>
<SYNC Start=745733><P Class=ENCC> near where we found your son.<br>
<SYNC Start=748733><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=754947><P Class=ENCC>
I'm sorry.<br>
I'm very upset.<br>
<SYNC Start=758274><P Class=ENCC>
You'll have to come back.<br>
<SYNC Start=761274><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=764499><P Class=ENCC>
You have a night-light.<br>
<SYNC Start=767499><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=769681><P Class=ENCC>
You had this a long time,<br> since Clayton was little?<br>
<SYNC Start=773015><P Class=ENCC>
Yes. He was afraid of the dark,<br>
<SYNC Start=776674><P Class=ENCC> and he just got used to having it on.<br>
<SYNC Start=780819><P Class=ENCC>
Yes. You didn't want him<br> lying alone in the dark.<br>
<SYNC Start=786157><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=792309><P Class=ENCC>
She's the one...<br>
<SYNC Start=794847><P Class=ENCC> who opened the trunk to leave the light on.<br>
<SYNC Start=797729><P Class=ENCC>
She found the body.<br>
<SYNC Start=801350><P Class=ENCC>
Even though she didn't know<br>
Ruiz lived down the street.<br>
<SYNC Start=803782><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah. She couldn't know that.<br>
<SYNC Start=806731><P Class=ENCC>
But somehow she knew where to look for her son.<br>
<SYNC Start=811440><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=813480><P Class=ENCC>
Her only outgoing calls were to her<br>
<SYNC Start=815059><P Class=ENCC> son's cell phone and to his work.<br>
<SYNC Start=817349><P Class=ENCC>
She got a call from a no-name,<br>
<SYNC Start=819068><P Class=ENCC> pay-as-you-go cell phone...<br>
<SYNC Start=820622><P Class=ENCC>
A 20-minute call,<br>
<SYNC Start=821608><P Class=ENCC> maybe to tell her where her son was.<br>
<SYNC Start=824046><P Class=ENCC>
A mother finds her son dead,<br>
<SYNC Start=825335><P Class=ENCC> she calls 911, she tells her husband.<br>
<SYNC Start=827175><P Class=ENCC>
She doesn't just go home<br> and wait for all hell to break loose.<br>
<SYNC Start=829855><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, well, she somehow feels responsible.<br>
<SYNC Start=831756><P Class=ENCC>
Because of her suspicions, her worries.<br>
<SYNC Start=833763><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah. I'm starting to think...<br>
<SYNC Start=836681><P Class=ENCC> that this death was staged for her benefit.<br>
<SYNC Start=840784><P Class=ENCC>
To make her believe that<br>
<SYNC Start=842088><P Class=ENCC> it had something to do with<br> an alleged affair.<br>
<SYNC Start=845193><P Class=ENCC>
You find the perps,<br> you can always ask them.<br>
<SYNC Start=846937><P Class=ENCC>
Well, luckily,<br> they left a calling card.<br>
<SYNC Start=849820><P Class=ENCC>
The lab identified the animal<br> blood on the knife...<br>
<SYNC Start=852984><P Class=ENCC> being mixed chicken,<br> sheep and goat blood.<br>
<SYNC Start=857009><P Class=ENCC>
And this.<br>
<SYNC Start=859712><P Class=ENCC>
This is where the car was abandoned.<br>
<SYNC Start=861273><P Class=ENCC>
On the northeast corner...<br>
<SYNC Start=862807><P Class=ENCC> of a square being framed by St. Peter's Church,<br>
<SYNC Start=866054><P Class=ENCC>
St. Anthony's and St. Francis.<br>
<SYNC Start=868671><P Class=ENCC>
Now these are three saints<br> that correspond with orisha...<br>
<SYNC Start=873881><P Class=ENCC> spirits worshipped by people<br> who practice Santeria.<br>
<SYNC Start=879295><P Class=ENCC>
Some Santeria followers,<br>
<SYNC Start=881301><P Class=ENCC> they believe that this square...<br>
<SYNC Start=883124><P Class=ENCC> has mystical properties.<br>
<SYNC Start=885311><P Class=ENCC>
The killers might've thought<br> placing the body there...<br>
<SYNC Start=888721><P Class=ENCC> would protect them.<br>
<SYNC Start=891632><P Class=ENCC>
You think Santeria,<br> you think South America.<br>
<SYNC Start=894532><P Class=ENCC>
We think cutthroat art business.<br>
<SYNC Start=896480><P Class=ENCC>
You're on the verge of an important deal.<br>
<SYNC Start=898255><P Class=ENCC>
Somebody wants to stop it.<br>
<SYNC Start=899976><P Class=ENCC>
And since Ms. Ruiz wouldn't<br> torpedo her own deal...<br>
<SYNC Start=903243><P Class=ENCC>
That leaves someone<br> connected to you or your wife.<br>
<SYNC Start=905351><P Class=ENCC>
Someone that knows about<br> your wife's insecurities.<br>
<SYNC Start=907944><P Class=ENCC>
Well, that could be any of my friends.<br>
<SYNC Start=910744><P Class=ENCC>
She's got these moods where she thinks that<br>
<SYNC Start=912704><P Class=ENCC> money is the only reason<br> that anybody cares about her.<br>
<SYNC Start=916133><P Class=ENCC>
That's why this was so important,<br>
<SYNC Start=918485><P Class=ENCC> why I needed this t-t-to work,<br>
<SYNC Start=920469><P Class=ENCC> to be a success.<br>
<SYNC Start=922046><P Class=ENCC>
'Cause once you're financially independent,<br>
<SYNC Start=924072><P Class=ENCC> she would know that you love her for herself.<br>
<SYNC Start=926707><P Class=ENCC>
But it's only driven us further apart.<br>
<SYNC Start=929688><P Class=ENCC>
Well, maybe that's the point...<br> to drive you apart.<br>
<SYNC Start=932330><P Class=ENCC>
Well, now you got me thinking<br> that I should've had her followed.<br>
<SYNC Start=935698><P Class=ENCC>
Why?<br>
<SYNC Start=936969><P Class=ENCC>
Did she have you followed?<br>
<SYNC Start=940318><P Class=ENCC>
When I borrowed Clayton's car<br> one night two weeks ago,<br>
<SYNC Start=943038><P Class=ENCC>
I thought Lyz was having me followed.<br>
<SYNC Start=946791><P Class=ENCC>
I noticed them right after<br>
I picked up the car.<br>
<SYNC Start=948675><P Class=ENCC>
Two Hispanic men in a gray car. Um,<br>
<SYNC Start=951652><P Class=ENCC>
I let them pull up next to me at a light.<br>
<SYNC Start=953698><P Class=ENCC>
When they saw me looking at them, they...<br>
<SYNC Start=956698><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=957554><P Class=ENCC> they were surprised.<br>
<SYNC Start=958951><P Class=ENCC>
And they took off.<br>
<SYNC Start=961431><P Class=ENCC>
Where'd you pick up your son's car?<br>
<SYNC Start=963370><P Class=ENCC>
At the parking garage at his work.<br>
<SYNC Start=966194><P Class=ENCC>
<font color=FF3366>
Parking Garage 63 East 68th Street<br>
Monday, May 5<br>
<SYNC Start=968734><P Class=ENCC>
They parked over there.<br>
<SYNC Start=970149><P Class=ENCC>
You remember their license?<br>
<SYNC Start=972376><P Class=ENCC>
Uh...<br>
<SYNC Start=973953><P Class=ENCC>
No, l... I don't remember.<br>
<SYNC Start=976086><P Class=ENCC>
Did they smoke?<br>
<SYNC Start=978046><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah. The tall one did.<br>
<SYNC Start=980275><P Class=ENCC>
Back here?<br>
<SYNC Start=982083><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, the short one wouldn't let him,<br> uh, smoke in the car.<br>
<SYNC Start=986007><P Class=ENCC>
Thanks.<br>
<SYNC Start=988053><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=990505><P Class=ENCC>
This print here...<br>
<SYNC Start=992449><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=994881><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah. It repeats itself.<br>
<SYNC Start=998651><P Class=ENCC>
It's always parallel to the column.<br>
<SYNC Start=1002287><P Class=ENCC>
And it always has more compression on the instep.<br>
<SYNC Start=1006242><P Class=ENCC>
He was leaning against the column.<br>
<SYNC Start=1010659><P Class=ENCC>
So, the guy stood on his left foot,<br>
<SYNC Start=1014525><P Class=ENCC> crossed his right foot over his left,<br>
<SYNC Start=1016632><P Class=ENCC> held a cigarette in his left hand...<br>
<SYNC Start=1019390><P Class=ENCC> and leaned towards the column.<br>
<SYNC Start=1022680><P Class=ENCC>
Held onto the column with his right hand...<br>
<SYNC Start=1025008><P Class=ENCC> right about here.<br>
<SYNC Start=1028569><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe the orishas will be good<br>
<SYNC Start=1030364><P Class=ENCC> to us and give us a set of prints.<br>
<SYNC Start=1034198><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1036728><P Class=ENCC>
The threat is gone.<br>
<SYNC Start=1039749><P Class=ENCC>
You're safe, Eduardo.<br>
<SYNC Start=1042263><P Class=ENCC>
But remember the promise you made.<br>
<SYNC Start=1044799><P Class=ENCC>
Their protection is not guaranteed for life.<br>
<SYNC Start=1048158><P Class=ENCC>
You have to keep earning it.<br>
<SYNC Start=1050486><P Class=ENCC>
I know.<br>
<SYNC Start=1052950><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1059909><P Class=ENCC>
If your men fail,<br>
<SYNC Start=1062321><P Class=ENCC> if they talk, Eduardo,<br>
<SYNC Start=1064653><P Class=ENCC> the orishas will be very angry.<br>
<SYNC Start=1068641><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1075916><P Class=ENCC>
They're bringing in<br> one of the guys from the garage,<br>
<SYNC Start=1077676><P Class=ENCC>
Nestor Reyes. The other one,<br>
Omar Sanchez, is still missing.<br>
<SYNC Start=1082468><P Class=ENCC>
What's that?<br>
<SYNC Start=1083859><P Class=ENCC>
Looks like a little crutch.<br>
<SYNC Start=1085031><P Class=ENCC>
It's for St. Lazarus.<br>
<SYNC Start=1086833><P Class=ENCC>
The followers of Santeria,<br> they wear it for protection...<br>
<SYNC Start=1089352><P Class=ENCC> against disease or death.<br>
<SYNC Start=1092712><P Class=ENCC>
What're you gonna do with it?<br>
<SYNC Start=1095712><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1099594><P Class=ENCC>
I don't know this guy.<br>
<SYNC Start=1102086><P Class=ENCC>
What about your cousin Omar?<br>
<SYNC Start=1103927><P Class=ENCC>
I don't got a cousin Omar.<br>
<SYNC Start=1105588><P Class=ENCC>
Little Omar?<br>
<SYNC Start=1106674><P Class=ENCC>
The one we found in your jacket,<br>
<SYNC Start=1108130><P Class=ENCC> under "known associates."<br>
<SYNC Start=1110673><P Class=ENCC>
He told us he knows you.<br>
<SYNC Start=1113673><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1114876><P Class=ENCC>
You don't got Little Omar.<br>
<SYNC Start=1117202><P Class=ENCC>
He told us why you parked the car<br>
<SYNC Start=1118426><P Class=ENCC> next to the three churches.<br>
<SYNC Start=1120655><P Class=ENCC>
To be protected, right, Nestor?<br>
<SYNC Start=1123293><P Class=ENCC>
Somebody's telling you stories.<br>
<SYNC Start=1125054><P Class=ENCC>
That's Santeria stuff... that's crap.<br>
<SYNC Start=1127301><P Class=ENCC>
Little Omar doesn't think so.<br>
<SYNC Start=1130179><P Class=ENCC>
You should've seen him when we showed him...<br>
<SYNC Start=1131456><P Class=ENCC> what the guy you killed had in his pocket.<br>
<SYNC Start=1135100><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1139628><P Class=ENCC>
There's no way you could<br> kill him and get away with it.<br>
<SYNC Start=1142404><P Class=ENCC>
Not with St. Lazarus watching over him.<br>
<SYNC Start=1145306><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, man. Oh, man.<br>
<SYNC Start=1147953><P Class=ENCC>
We're dead men!<br>
<SYNC Start=1150021><P Class=ENCC>
Not if you confess.<br>
<SYNC Start=1152859><P Class=ENCC>
This killing wasn't your idea, was it?<br>
<SYNC Start=1155604><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1158734><P Class=ENCC>
The person who gave you the order...<br>
<SYNC Start=1161141><P Class=ENCC> that guy is gonna have to answer to orisha.<br>
<SYNC Start=1164226><P Class=ENCC>
Not you.<br>
<SYNC Start=1166509><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1170432><P Class=ENCC>
Okay. I tell you.<br>
<SYNC Start=1173527><P Class=ENCC>
It's Eduardo Mendez.<br>
<SYNC Start=1175285><P Class=ENCC>
Omar visited him up in Rikers.<br>
<SYNC Start=1177289><P Class=ENCC>
He told Omar what to do<br>
<SYNC Start=1178655><P Class=ENCC> and to leave the body next to the three churches.<br>
<SYNC Start=1181992><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1184470><P Class=ENCC>
Far as I can tell, Mr. Carver,<br>
<SYNC Start=1186478><P Class=ENCC> the only card you're holding is the uncooperated<br>
<SYNC Start=1188794><P Class=ENCC> hearsay testimony of an admitted killer.<br>
<SYNC Start=1192628><P Class=ENCC>
I wouldn't wait for us<br> to cooperate it before making a deal.<br>
<SYNC Start=1195971><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Mendez is already<br> facing drug and murder charges.<br>
<SYNC Start=1199910><P Class=ENCC>
I never talked to a Nestor.<br>
<SYNC Start=1202654><P Class=ENCC>
And Omar...<br>
<SYNC Start=1203972><P Class=ENCC> nobody seems to worry about Omar anymore.<br>
<SYNC Start=1207322><P Class=ENCC>
Because you had him killed.<br>
<SYNC Start=1210322><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1211568><P Class=ENCC>
Things take care of themselves.<br>
<SYNC Start=1213593><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, well, the orisha doesn't<br> seem to be taking care of you anymore.<br>
<SYNC Start=1216727><P Class=ENCC>
I mean, otherwise we wouldn't be here<br> putting another murder on you.<br>
<SYNC Start=1222174><P Class=ENCC>
You killed someone under their protection.<br>
<SYNC Start=1225324><P Class=ENCC>
Nestor and Omar didn't take the time to<br>
<SYNC Start=1229120><P Class=ENCC> look through Clayton Webster's<br> pockets before they cut his throat.<br>
<SYNC Start=1234694><P Class=ENCC>
You're in prison.<br>
<SYNC Start=1237543><P Class=ENCC>
You're... You're looking down at a life sentence.<br>
<SYNC Start=1242919><P Class=ENCC>
But you're not afraid.<br>
<SYNC Start=1245430><P Class=ENCC>
And you feel safe from the laws of this world...<br>
<SYNC Start=1249800><P Class=ENCC> and the next.<br>
<SYNC Start=1253581><P Class=ENCC>
There's someone watching over you, isn't there?<br>
<SYNC Start=1257910><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1265497><P Class=ENCC>
You sure there's no connection with Clayton Webster?<br>
<SYNC Start=1269303><P Class=ENCC>
None.<br>
<SYNC Start=1270999><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1272380><P Class=ENCC>
Then Mendez just picked<br>
<SYNC Start=1274920><P Class=ENCC>
Webster's name out of a hat?<br>
<SYNC Start=1276292><P Class=ENCC>
Or someone picked him for him.<br>
<SYNC Start=1279273><P Class=ENCC>
Someone that could convince him that<br>
<SYNC Start=1280559><P Class=ENCC>
Clayton Webster was a threat to him.<br>
<SYNC Start=1285342><P Class=ENCC>
And who would that be?<br>
<SYNC Start=1288415><P Class=ENCC>
Someone who could guarantee his safety,<br>
<SYNC Start=1290967><P Class=ENCC> who has the authority in this<br>
<SYNC Start=1293166><P Class=ENCC> other world that he believes in.<br>
<SYNC Start=1297014><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1298958><P Class=ENCC>
His priest.<br>
<SYNC Start=1301153><P Class=ENCC>
His Santeria priest.<br>
<SYNC Start=1304157><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1306355><P Class=ENCC>
I signed the visitors sheet at the prison...<br>
<SYNC Start=1308164><P Class=ENCC> with the understanding that Mr. Mendez's<br> religious beliefs wouldn't be scrutinized.<br>
<SYNC Start=1311736><P Class=ENCC>
Actually, it's you we're scrutinizing, Mr. Bello.<br>
<SYNC Start=1314904><P Class=ENCC>
So far, we've found out<br> you did time in Texas for fraud...<br>
<SYNC Start=1318853><P Class=ENCC> in association with revival meetings.<br>
<SYNC Start=1321269><P Class=ENCC>
That was when you were under your legal name,<br>
<SYNC Start=1323369><P Class=ENCC>
Julian Bellonte.<br>
<SYNC Start=1324866><P Class=ENCC>
So you went from Bible thumping to Santeria.<br>
<SYNC Start=1327525><P Class=ENCC>
I came to Santeria a long time ago,<br> through an aunt.<br>
<SYNC Start=1331383><P Class=ENCC>
But I had to find my own path<br> before I could embrace it.<br>
<SYNC Start=1334774><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, so you're on a spiritual quest.<br>
<SYNC Start=1337308><P Class=ENCC>
I'm more interested in your quest.<br>
<SYNC Start=1339017><P Class=ENCC>
It has to do with the guidance<br> you give Eduardo Mendez.<br>
<SYNC Start=1342678><P Class=ENCC>
It's advice of a religious nature.<br>
<SYNC Start=1345049><P Class=ENCC>
Morning sickness.<br>
Still getting used to it.<br>
<SYNC Start=1347282><P Class=ENCC>
Santeria has commandments, huh?<br>
<SYNC Start=1349098><P Class=ENCC>
Don't kill. Don't steal.<br>
<SYNC Start=1352098><P Class=ENCC>
I guess Eduardo was a recent convert.<br>
<SYNC Start=1355303><P Class=ENCC>
Now that he has more time on his hands,<br>
<SYNC Start=1357124><P Class=ENCC> he's paying more attention to his soul.<br>
<SYNC Start=1360961><P Class=ENCC>
These colors are for Elegba,<br>
<SYNC Start=1363352><P Class=ENCC>
St. Anthony.<br>
<SYNC Start=1365294><P Class=ENCC>
Do you know a Clayton Webster,<br>
<SYNC Start=1367291><P Class=ENCC> the news cameraman?<br>
<SYNC Start=1369140><P Class=ENCC>
I try to stay away from newspeople.<br>
<SYNC Start=1371265><P Class=ENCC>
Well, don't worry.<br>
Eduardo had him killed last week.<br>
<SYNC Start=1374249><P Class=ENCC>
And this is an Ogun,<br>
St. Peter.<br>
<SYNC Start=1376417><P Class=ENCC>
Eduardo doesn't discuss his business with me.<br>
<SYNC Start=1378663><P Class=ENCC>
Clayton Webster's throat was cut.<br>
<SYNC Start=1381218><P Class=ENCC>
Knife left traces of animal blood.<br>
<SYNC Start=1383568><P Class=ENCC>
His body was found under<br> the shadow of three churches.<br>
<SYNC Start=1387681><P Class=ENCC>
The murder had ritualistic touches,<br>
<SYNC Start=1389501><P Class=ENCC>
Santeria touches.<br>
<SYNC Start=1391199><P Class=ENCC>
I'm sorry. I can't help you.<br>
<SYNC Start=1392938><P Class=ENCC>
W-W-We're sorry that we've stressed you out.<br>
<SYNC Start=1394918><P Class=ENCC>
- You know, your neck...<br>
- It was a fender bender last year.<br>
<SYNC Start=1398238><P Class=ENCC> that's all.<br>
<SYNC Start=1399142><P Class=ENCC>
Someone rear-ended me.<br>
<SYNC Start=1402142><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1402446><P Class=ENCC>
Well, i-it's funny you didn't see him comin'.<br>
<SYNC Start=1407510><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1411649><P Class=ENCC>
Julian Bello has a hack license.<br>
<SYNC Start=1413719><P Class=ENCC>
He got his accident driving for a limo company.<br>
<SYNC Start=1416186><P Class=ENCC>
They house their cars in Long Island City.<br>
<SYNC Start=1418761><P Class=ENCC>
That would explain why<br> he's familiar with the neighborhood.<br>
<SYNC Start=1420501><P Class=ENCC>
Might explain a lot if he drove the Websters.<br>
<SYNC Start=1422642><P Class=ENCC>
I'm not finding them on Bello's receipts.<br>
<SYNC Start=1425642><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1427152><P Class=ENCC>
Even if he was their chauffeur,<br>
<SYNC Start=1429644><P Class=ENCC> you see them getting mixed up with Bello's hoodoo?<br>
<SYNC Start=1431833><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, we're just observing phenomena,<br>
<SYNC Start=1433612><P Class=ENCC> not explaining it.<br>
<SYNC Start=1436968><P Class=ENCC>
Here we go.<br>
<SYNC Start=1438522><P Class=ENCC>
Bello made a drop-off at the Websters' last year.<br>
<SYNC Start=1445079><P Class=ENCC>
Passenger's an Ilene Maxwell.<br>
<SYNC Start=1449405><P Class=ENCC>
Well, looks like Bello was<br>
Ms. Maxwell's regular driver until...<br>
<SYNC Start=1456081><P Class=ENCC>
Looks like four months ago.<br>
<SYNC Start=1459264><P Class=ENCC>

Apartment of Ilene Maxwell<br>
1094 Fifth Avenue, Tuesday, May 6<br>
<SYNC Start=1460922><P Class=ENCC>
He never talked to me about animal sacrifices.<br>
<SYNC Start=1463844><P Class=ENCC>
My God, I don't even wear fur.<br>
<SYNC Start=1465663><P Class=ENCC>
Did Lyz Webster ever meet him?<br>
<SYNC Start=1467688><P Class=ENCC>
No. Lyz has her own adviser.<br>
<SYNC Start=1469960><P Class=ENCC>
Very reliable person.<br>
<SYNC Start=1471273><P Class=ENCC>
Very in tune with people like us.<br>
<SYNC Start=1473023><P Class=ENCC>
She's a psychic.<br>
She advises you too?<br>
<SYNC Start=1475321><P Class=ENCC>
I don't use Sylvia anymore.<br>
<SYNC Start=1476959><P Class=ENCC>
I have an astrologer now.<br>
<SYNC Start=1478922><P Class=ENCC>
When did you meet Sylvia?<br>
<SYNC Start=1480644><P Class=ENCC>
My son was in the hospital last year,<br> having his tonsils out.<br>
<SYNC Start=1484066><P Class=ENCC>
And the clotting factor in his blood makes even<br>
<SYNC Start=1486334><P Class=ENCC> minor surgery life-threatening.<br>
<SYNC Start=1488403><P Class=ENCC>
- You must have been very worried.<br>
- Yes.<br>
<SYNC Start=1490559><P Class=ENCC>
I was across the street from<br> the hospital having lunch,<br>
<SYNC Start=1492813><P Class=ENCC> and a woman came up to me,<br>
<SYNC Start=1494207><P Class=ENCC> introduced herself...<br> and said my son was going to be fine.<br>
<SYNC Start=1497578><P Class=ENCC>
That was Sylvia,<br> and she was right.<br>
<SYNC Start=1499930><P Class=ENCC>
And this was when Julian was driving you...<br>
<SYNC Start=1501262><P Class=ENCC>
- to the hospital and back.<br>
- Yes.<br>
<SYNC Start=1504462><P Class=ENCC>
And you were probably on the phone<br>
<SYNC Start=1506443><P Class=ENCC> talking about your son's condition, and...<br>
<SYNC Start=1508344><P Class=ENCC>
Yes, I imagine I was.<br>
<SYNC Start=1511572><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, you're not suggesting that...<br>
<SYNC Start=1514572><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1517364><P Class=ENCC>
I have a strong feeling about this, Susan.<br>
<SYNC Start=1520366><P Class=ENCC>
It's very...<br>
<SYNC Start=1523130><P Class=ENCC>
Sylvia? Are you there?<br>
<SYNC Start=1525360><P Class=ENCC>
Susan, Sylvia will have to call you back.<br>
<SYNC Start=1526876><P Class=ENCC>
No, no. It's not your fault.<br>
<SYNC Start=1528695><P Class=ENCC>
She'll call you in a few minutes.<br>
<SYNC Start=1530481><P Class=ENCC>
Okay. Bye-bye.<br>
<SYNC Start=1533769><P Class=ENCC>
What did you see?<br>
<SYNC Start=1535268><P Class=ENCC>
Two people, a... a couple.<br>
<SYNC Start=1538330><P Class=ENCC>
The sky was red.<br>
I smelled sulfur.<br>
<SYNC Start=1541198><P Class=ENCC>
Okay.<br>
Sulfur... Red sky...<br>
<SYNC Start=1545209><P Class=ENCC>
That's lava. A volcano.<br>
<SYNC Start=1548548><P Class=ENCC>
You saw us in the South Seas.<br>
<SYNC Start=1552320><P Class=ENCC>
W-We have to leave now, Julian.<br>
<SYNC Start=1555540><P Class=ENCC>
Lyz can't handle it.<br>
I have to take it away from her,<br>
<SYNC Start=1558374><P Class=ENCC> and then we have to leave.<br>
<SYNC Start=1559450><P Class=ENCC>
Hey, she'll grow into it.<br>
<SYNC Start=1562517><P Class=ENCC>
Remember how long it took you?<br>
<SYNC Start=1565048><P Class=ENCC>
Now she got what you promised her.<br>
<SYNC Start=1567952><P Class=ENCC>
And as soon as she fulfills her promise to you,<br>
<SYNC Start=1571337><P Class=ENCC> then we can leave.<br>
<SYNC Start=1573809><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1575962><P Class=ENCC>
My relationship with Sylvia<br> doesn't concern anyone but me.<br>
<SYNC Start=1580332><P Class=ENCC>
Didn't she convince you<br> your husband was having an affair?<br>
<SYNC Start=1582747><P Class=ENCC>
Is that what Henry told you?<br>
<SYNC Start=1584114><P Class=ENCC>
Ms. Webster, this woman is feeding off your fears.<br>
<SYNC Start=1586225><P Class=ENCC>
It's how she makes a living.<br>
<SYNC Start=1588110><P Class=ENCC>
You don't understand.<br>
<SYNC Start=1589256><P Class=ENCC>
Sylvia has an accomplice with ties to a drug gang.<br>
<SYNC Start=1593224><P Class=ENCC>
He had your son killed.<br>
<SYNC Start=1594974><P Class=ENCC>
Julian?<br>
<SYNC Start=1596688><P Class=ENCC>
I don't believe that.<br>
<SYNC Start=1597961><P Class=ENCC>
Didn't Sylvia call you the night that Clayton died?<br>
<SYNC Start=1600617><P Class=ENCC>
No.<br>
<SYNC Start=1601806><P Class=ENCC>
We know you got a call.<br>
<SYNC Start=1603465><P Class=ENCC>
We know you found the body.<br>
<SYNC Start=1605801><P Class=ENCC>
We know you left the trunk open,<br>
<SYNC Start=1607437><P Class=ENCC> so he wouldn't lay in the dark all night.<br>
<SYNC Start=1610714><P Class=ENCC>
Now didn't she call you and tell you...<br>
<SYNC Start=1611982><P Class=ENCC> that she had a vision of<br> where you could find his body?<br>
<SYNC Start=1617229><P Class=ENCC>
Nobody told me.<br>
<SYNC Start=1620267><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1622643><P Class=ENCC>
It was you?<br>
<SYNC Start=1624445><P Class=ENCC>
It was your vision.<br>
<SYNC Start=1627445><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1629056><P Class=ENCC>
I've been given a very powerful gift.<br>
<SYNC Start=1632525><P Class=ENCC>
I don't talk about it<br> with skeptics and nonbelievers.<br>
<SYNC Start=1636733><P Class=ENCC>
Now please leave.<br>
<SYNC Start=1638996><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1647273><P Class=ENCC>
I can't believe this.<br>
<SYNC Start=1648912><P Class=ENCC>
Why not?<br>
A premonition about her family came true.<br>
<SYNC Start=1651912><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1651977><P Class=ENCC>
Her son was killed.<br>
<SYNC Start=1653474><P Class=ENCC>
Her husband's alleged mistress was implicated.<br>
<SYNC Start=1656822><P Class=ENCC>
All thanks to Julian.<br>
<SYNC Start=1658483><P Class=ENCC>
He convinced Eduardo<br>
<SYNC Start=1660323><P Class=ENCC> that Clayton was a threat to him.<br>
<SYNC Start=1661524><P Class=ENCC>
He told him to leave the body<br> near the three churches for protection.<br>
<SYNC Start=1664098><P Class=ENCC>
But his main agenda was to convince Lyz Webster<br>
<SYNC Start=1667920><P Class=ENCC> she really was psychic.<br>
<SYNC Start=1669379><P Class=ENCC>
That she would even believe in psychic powers,<br>
<SYNC Start=1671320><P Class=ENCC> let alone pay someone<br> to turn her into a clairvoyant<br>
<SYNC Start=1675317><P Class=ENCC>
People look for an edge in an uncertain world.<br>
<SYNC Start=1677587><P Class=ENCC>
Even people like Lyz Webster.<br>
Hmm.<br>
<SYNC Start=1679493><P Class=ENCC>
And people like Sylvia Campbell<br> and Julian Bello are waiting for them.<br>
<SYNC Start=1682455><P Class=ENCC>
They're pros.<br>
<SYNC Start=1683401><P Class=ENCC>
Their first appearance as<br> a duet was 14 years ago.<br>
<SYNC Start=1686115><P Class=ENCC>
They were arrested for fraud in connection<br>
<SYNC Start=1688067><P Class=ENCC> with a church they ran in San Francisco.<br>
<SYNC Start=1690071><P Class=ENCC>
"The Church of the Open Mind."<br>
<SYNC Start=1692583><P Class=ENCC>
Julian served six months.<br>
<SYNC Start=1694098><P Class=ENCC>
Sylvia got probation.<br>
<SYNC Start=1695392><P Class=ENCC>
They were arrested on another fraud charge.<br>
<SYNC Start=1697314><P Class=ENCC>
He got jail. She got probation.<br>
<SYNC Start=1699379><P Class=ENCC>
In New Orleans,<br> they opened a voodoo store...<br>
<SYNC Start=1701570><P Class=ENCC> where they promised to cast demons<br>
<SYNC Start=1703174><P Class=ENCC> out of a Mrs. Thelma Busfield for 20 grand.<br>
<SYNC Start=1706726><P Class=ENCC>
Julian got a year,<br> and again Sylvia got probation.<br>
<SYNC Start=1709415><P Class=ENCC>
He takes a plea,<br> so she can take a walk.<br>
<SYNC Start=1711767><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Bello seems to be the one<br> to do the heavy lifting in the relationship.<br>
<SYNC Start=1716284><P Class=ENCC>
I would love to see the two of them in action.<br>
<SYNC Start=1719743><P Class=ENCC>

Apartment Of Julian Bello And Sylvia Campbell<br>
557 West 49th Street, Thursday, May 8<br>
<SYNC Start=1721863><P Class=ENCC>
She was his mother.<br>
<SYNC Start=1723889><P Class=ENCC>
He was her son.<br>
Of course she found him.<br>
<SYNC Start=1727150><P Class=ENCC>
We thought you might have helped her.<br>
<SYNC Start=1728604><P Class=ENCC>
The police department uses psychics<br> all the time to find people.<br>
<SYNC Start=1731551><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, l... I don't do work like that.<br>
<SYNC Start=1733637><P Class=ENCC>
L-l-It's too disturbing.<br>
<SYNC Start=1736637><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1738028><P Class=ENCC>
Well, if you had a vision of her son's death,<br>
<SYNC Start=1740601><P Class=ENCC> you wouldn't tell Lyz?<br>
<SYNC Start=1743236><P Class=ENCC>
Lyz knew there was a shadow on Clayton,<br>
<SYNC Start=1746667><P Class=ENCC> but she didn't know what it was.<br>
<SYNC Start=1749138><P Class=ENCC>
Well, did you make her aware of this shadow, or<br>
<SYNC Start=1754956><P Class=ENCC> did she sense it herself?<br>
<SYNC Start=1757184><P Class=ENCC>
Well, maybe it's the same shadow<br>
<SYNC Start=1758577><P Class=ENCC> that's been following you since Texas.<br>
<SYNC Start=1761387><P Class=ENCC>
Speak of the devil.<br>
<SYNC Start=1762578><P Class=ENCC>
The doorman told me you were here.<br>
<SYNC Start=1764310><P Class=ENCC>
They're asking about Lyz Webster and her son.<br>
<SYNC Start=1768001><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah. And we were about to tell Sylvia...<br>
<SYNC Start=1770109><P Class=ENCC> about the connection to one of your Santeria clients,<br>
<SYNC Start=1773109><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1773212><P Class=ENCC>
Eduardo Mendez.<br>
<SYNC Start=1774489><P Class=ENCC>
It so happens, he ordered the hit on Clayton.<br>
<SYNC Start=1777078><P Class=ENCC>
Julian, what are they saying?<br>
<SYNC Start=1779347><P Class=ENCC>
It's the one I visit in prison.<br>
<SYNC Start=1781046><P Class=ENCC>
They're harassing everyone who...<br>
<SYNC Start=1784428><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1788352><P Class=ENCC>
What is it?<br>
<SYNC Start=1789877><P Class=ENCC>
Sylvia, I'm here.<br>
<SYNC Start=1791730><P Class=ENCC>
Is she okay?<br>
<SYNC Start=1793020><P Class=ENCC>
She's fine.<br>
<SYNC Start=1794438><P Class=ENCC>
What is it?<br>
<SYNC Start=1796585><P Class=ENCC>
I saw water...<br>
<SYNC Start=1798386><P Class=ENCC> rushing water.<br>
<SYNC Start=1799725><P Class=ENCC>
A life sign.<br>
<SYNC Start=1802290><P Class=ENCC>
- What else?<br>
- I smelled fresh earth.<br>
<SYNC Start=1806320><P Class=ENCC>
It's new life.<br>
<SYNC Start=1809218><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1810467><P Class=ENCC>
Do you feel new life in this room?<br>
<SYNC Start=1813467><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1815144><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, are you having a baby?<br>
<SYNC Start=1817938><P Class=ENCC>
Yes. How about that?<br>
<SYNC Start=1820331><P Class=ENCC>
You'll have a brave child.<br>
<SYNC Start=1823579><P Class=ENCC>
Her clairvoyance...<br>
<SYNC Start=1825459><P Class=ENCC>
It's not just sights.<br>
She can also smell things.<br>
<SYNC Start=1829301><P Class=ENCC>
Yes. And the next time<br> you want to drop in, call ahead.<br>
<SYNC Start=1833114><P Class=ENCC>
I'll have a lawyer waiting.<br>
<SYNC Start=1834682><P Class=ENCC>
Come on. Let's go.<br>
<SYNC Start=1837195><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1838837><P Class=ENCC>
That's a neat trick.<br>
<SYNC Start=1840715><P Class=ENCC>
He knew I was pregnant from the store.<br>
<SYNC Start=1844002><P Class=ENCC>
If she had said "crab cakes,"<br>
<SYNC Start=1845669><P Class=ENCC> he would've said "crawling babies."<br>
<SYNC Start=1848958><P Class=ENCC>
Well, maybe it is a trick.<br>
<SYNC Start=1851407><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe the trick's on her.<br>
<SYNC Start=1854407><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1856468><P Class=ENCC>
This can't be the Sylvia I know.<br>
<SYNC Start=1859387><P Class=ENCC>
Ms. Webster,<br>
<SYNC Start=1860943><P Class=ENCC>
I think that Sylvia believes that<br> she's clairvoyant,<br>
<SYNC Start=1863943><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1864827><P Class=ENCC> just as she believes that she can<br> heal with crystals and potions and faith.<br>
<SYNC Start=1868139><P Class=ENCC>
And she's sincere in her beliefs.<br>
<SYNC Start=1870472><P Class=ENCC>
And that she absolutely believes that<br> she can share this gift with you.<br>
<SYNC Start=1874734><P Class=ENCC>
She said she'd... she'd help me<br> develop my natural powers,<br>
<SYNC Start=1878395><P Class=ENCC> like Julian had helped her.<br>
<SYNC Start=1880217><P Class=ENCC>
She expected you to pay for this gift?<br>
<SYNC Start=1882362><P Class=ENCC>
Julian did.<br>
<SYNC Start=1884287><P Class=ENCC>
There was a consideration every month... $20,000.<br>
<SYNC Start=1887470><P Class=ENCC>
And a larger sum later.<br>
<SYNC Start=1890848><P Class=ENCC>
When you had proof you were clairvoyant.<br>
<SYNC Start=1892861><P Class=ENCC>
Yes.<br>
$500,000.<br>
<SYNC Start=1897993><P Class=ENCC>
But it went longer than you anticipated...<br>
<SYNC Start=1900873><P Class=ENCC> because you had doubts.<br>
<SYNC Start=1902935><P Class=ENCC>
And because Clayton...<br>
<SYNC Start=1906579><P Class=ENCC> was pressing you to stop seeing Sylvia.<br>
<SYNC Start=1909275><P Class=ENCC>
He thought I was being exploited.<br>
<SYNC Start=1911829><P Class=ENCC>
You told Sylvia and Julian?<br>
<SYNC Start=1913895><P Class=ENCC>
Yes. Julian said I should be more patient.<br>
<SYNC Start=1917819><P Class=ENCC>
And then you'd have the proof.<br>
<SYNC Start=1920819><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1923188><P Class=ENCC>
The night that...<br> that Clayton died,<br>
<SYNC Start=1928068><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1928702><P Class=ENCC>
I know it...<br>
<SYNC Start=1929973><P Class=ENCC> it wasn't Sylvia who called you.<br>
<SYNC Start=1932831><P Class=ENCC>
But it was Julian.<br>
<SYNC Start=1935831><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1937116><P Class=ENCC>
He said Sylvia had told him<br> to lead me in a guided meditation...<br>
<SYNC Start=1942306><P Class=ENCC> to try and find Clayton.<br>
<SYNC Start=1944472><P Class=ENCC>
He interpreted what you saw...<br>
<SYNC Start=1948248><P Class=ENCC> until you were convinced.<br>
<SYNC Start=1950760><P Class=ENCC>
No, no, no. If... If it's all pretend,<br>
<SYNC Start=1952503><P Class=ENCC> how did Sylvia know about the three churches?<br>
<SYNC Start=1954628><P Class=ENCC>
When did she know?<br>
<SYNC Start=1955923><P Class=ENCC>
The next day.<br>
<SYNC Start=1957795><P Class=ENCC>
She had to have seen it in a vision.<br>
<SYNC Start=1960795><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1962852><P Class=ENCC>
Or Julian told her.<br>
<SYNC Start=1965852><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1973023><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, God.<br>
<SYNC Start=1976166><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, God.<br>
Clayton... it's all my fault.<br>
<SYNC Start=1980204><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1983536><P Class=ENCC>
They caught you when you were vulnerable.<br>
<SYNC Start=1987301><P Class=ENCC>
Now they're vulnerable.<br>
<SYNC Start=1990301><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1992584><P Class=ENCC>
Help us catch them.<br>
<SYNC Start=1995955><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2000209><P Class=ENCC>
I'm so glad you called me.<br>
<SYNC Start=2001519><P Class=ENCC>
L... I was sending good thoughts to you.<br>
<SYNC Start=2004519><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2004707><P Class=ENCC>
I see things clearly now, Sylvia.<br>
<SYNC Start=2006486><P Class=ENCC>
Like photographs.<br>
<SYNC Start=2008350><P Class=ENCC>
Just like you said.<br>
<SYNC Start=2010393><P Class=ENCC>
I, uh, I made a promise to you.<br>
<SYNC Start=2013644><P Class=ENCC>
And a promise is a promise.<br>
<SYNC Start=2016644><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2019257><P Class=ENCC>
It's too much, Lyz.<br>
L... I can't.<br>
<SYNC Start=2022744><P Class=ENCC>
No, no.<br>
L... I want you to have it.<br>
<SYNC Start=2026843><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2028407><P Class=ENCC>
Are you all right?<br>
<SYNC Start=2031407><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2033180><P Class=ENCC>
This morning, when I wrote your name on the check,<br>
<SYNC Start=2035042><P Class=ENCC>
I saw something...<br>
<SYNC Start=2037432><P Class=ENCC>
You and Julian in a room with gray stones.<br>
<SYNC Start=2040432><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2040658><P Class=ENCC>
There was a... a sheet of water,<br>
<SYNC Start=2042969><P Class=ENCC> a mirror and a man with a broken neck.<br>
<SYNC Start=2049033><P Class=ENCC>
He was asking a question about three churches.<br>
<SYNC Start=2052750><P Class=ENCC>
And the answer was wrong.<br>
<SYNC Start=2054629><P Class=ENCC>
It was a lie.<br>
<SYNC Start=2057122><P Class=ENCC>
The floor fell away.<br>
<SYNC Start=2060086><P Class=ENCC>
I saw you and Julian falling,<br> both of you falling through space.<br>
<SYNC Start=2066144><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2068032><P Class=ENCC>
Please, Sylvia, be careful.<br>
Please.<br>
<SYNC Start=2070636><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, no, no. Thank you.<br>
<SYNC Start=2073808><P Class=ENCC>
Thank you.<br>
<SYNC Start=2076808><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2078545><P Class=ENCC>
All here.<br>
Next stop, airport. Huh?<br>
<SYNC Start=2082329><P Class=ENCC>
Next stop, downtown.<br>
<SYNC Start=2083985><P Class=ENCC>
I bet you know this one by heart:<br>
<SYNC Start=2085540><P Class=ENCC>
"Julian Bellonte and Sylvia Campbell,<br>
<SYNC Start=2088096><P Class=ENCC>
- you're under arrest for fraud."<br>
- Julian.<br>
<SYNC Start=2092335><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2094903><P Class=ENCC>
You'll sit here.<br>
<SYNC Start=2097133><P Class=ENCC>
And if you need something to drink,<br>
<SYNC Start=2099848><P Class=ENCC> you just ask the officer.<br>
<SYNC Start=2102848><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2123618><P Class=ENCC>
Let's put you, uh...<br>
Let's see, right here.<br>
<SYNC Start=2128337><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2130708><P Class=ENCC>
Everybody comfy?<br>
<SYNC Start=2132898><P Class=ENCC>
In case you're wondering,<br>
<SYNC Start=2134169><P Class=ENCC> when you exchanged Lyz's check<br> for the cashier check,<br>
<SYNC Start=2137004><P Class=ENCC> the bank notified Mr. Webster<br> because of the amount,<br>
<SYNC Start=2141046><P Class=ENCC> and he called us.<br>
<SYNC Start=2143720><P Class=ENCC>
And here we all are.<br>
<SYNC Start=2145850><P Class=ENCC>
That's a big number.<br>
Why'd she give you this money?<br>
<SYNC Start=2149555><P Class=ENCC>
It was a token of appreciation<br> for Sylvia's guidance and advice.<br>
<SYNC Start=2153293><P Class=ENCC>
We talked to Lyz after<br> we brought you in this afternoon.<br>
<SYNC Start=2157148><P Class=ENCC>
You know, l... l-It's...<br>
<SYNC Start=2160203><P Class=ENCC>
It's extraordinary.<br>
<SYNC Start=2162984><P Class=ENCC>
Y-You... Uh, what? What you... <br>
What you gave her..<br>
<SYNC Start=2165171><P Class=ENCC> what to call it.<br>
Second sight?<br>
<SYNC Start=2167393><P Class=ENCC>
Third eye? Sixth sense?<br>
<SYNC Start=2169376><P Class=ENCC>
- The gift.<br>
- Gift.<br>
<SYNC Start=2174280><P Class=ENCC>
And Lyz said it didn't come to her overnight.<br>
<SYNC Start=2177749><P Class=ENCC>
For months,<br> she couldn't predict a sunrise.<br>
<SYNC Start=2179775><P Class=ENCC>
And then all of a sudden it fell into place.<br>
<SYNC Start=2182370><P Class=ENCC>
She had a premonition of her son's<br> death that was bang on the money!<br>
<SYNC Start=2185949><P Class=ENCC>
She even had a vision of where the body was.<br>
<SYNC Start=2190091><P Class=ENCC>
But there's something she can't figure out.<br>
<SYNC Start=2192956><P Class=ENCC>
She only saw one church.<br>
<SYNC Start=2195015><P Class=ENCC>
Then the next day,<br> you told her there were three churches.<br>
<SYNC Start=2199446><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2201278><P Class=ENCC>
How'd you know about the three churches?<br>
<SYNC Start=2205911><P Class=ENCC>
It's okay.<br>
<SYNC Start=2208586><P Class=ENCC>
How'd you know about the three churches?<br>
<SYNC Start=2212604><P Class=ENCC>
Sylvia, I asked you a question.<br>
<SYNC Start=2214245><P Class=ENCC>
She doesn't have to answer.<br>
<SYNC Start=2215696><P Class=ENCC>
I have to tell the truth.<br>
<SYNC Start=2218171><P Class=ENCC>
Julian told me.<br>
<SYNC Start=2219469><P Class=ENCC>
That night after he talked with Lyz,<br>
<SYNC Start=2222165><P Class=ENCC> he told me there were three churches.<br>
<SYNC Start=2225655><P Class=ENCC>
Julian told you.<br>
<SYNC Start=2228655><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2230613><P Class=ENCC>
So, how'd you know about the three churches?<br>
<SYNC Start=2235007><P Class=ENCC>
- Lyz told m...<br>
- No, you have to tell the truth.<br>
<SYNC Start=2238254><P Class=ENCC>
- Sylvia.<br>
- Julian, you have to tell them.<br>
<SYNC Start=2240880><P Class=ENCC>
Lyz had a vision.<br>
<SYNC Start=2242479><P Class=ENCC>
She saw us in a room...<br>
<SYNC Start=2244338><P Class=ENCC> w-with gray walls made of stone.<br>
<SYNC Start=2247490><P Class=ENCC>
Sh-She saw a mirror and<br> a man with a broken neck. Him.<br>
<SYNC Start=2252351><P Class=ENCC>
And... And she said that one of us lied,<br>
<SYNC Start=2255195><P Class=ENCC> and then she saw us falling through space.<br>
<SYNC Start=2257750><P Class=ENCC>
Julian, w-we have to tell them the truth.<br>
<SYNC Start=2261657><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2264230><P Class=ENCC>
Whoa. R-R-R...<br>
She really saw that?<br>
<SYNC Start=2267530><P Class=ENCC>
I gave her the gift.<br>
<SYNC Start=2269638><P Class=ENCC>
And-And you have the gift too.<br>
<SYNC Start=2273596><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2277083><P Class=ENCC>
Well, uh,<br>
<SYNC Start=2279130><P Class=ENCC> th-that means that Lyz's vision<br> must be the real thing, huh, Julian?<br>
<SYNC Start=2284116><P Class=ENCC>
Julian, sweetheart,<br> you just have to tell them the truth.<br>
<SYNC Start=2289634><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2295357><P Class=ENCC>
Come on, Sylvia.<br>
<SYNC Start=2297487><P Class=ENCC>
Let's get you out of this gray room,<br>
<SYNC Start=2300139><P Class=ENCC> give you a chance to catch your breath.<br>
<SYNC Start=2303139><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2306172><P Class=ENCC>
J-Julian, tell them, or we're lost.<br>
<SYNC Start=2312868><P Class=ENCC>
Lyz saw it.<br>
<SYNC Start=2315034><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2319904><P Class=ENCC>
Lyz saw it.<br>
<SYNC Start=2322565><P Class=ENCC>
So, if you lie to us, that means...<br>
<SYNC Start=2325293><P Class=ENCC> you don't believe that Lyz has the gift.<br>
<SYNC Start=2327644><P Class=ENCC>
And you don't believe that<br>
Sylvia has the gift either.<br>
<SYNC Start=2333122><P Class=ENCC>
You know, l-I'll bet that...<br>
<SYNC Start=2335395><P Class=ENCC> that you can't let on for one<br> second with Sylvia...<br>
<SYNC Start=2339012><P Class=ENCC> that you don't have faith in her gift,<br>
<SYNC Start=2342270><P Class=ENCC> that you don't believe it.<br>
<SYNC Start=2345231><P Class=ENCC>
Because she'd be lost.<br>
<SYNC Start=2348821><P Class=ENCC>
Because in her heart and i-in her soul,<br>
<SYNC Start=2352687><P Class=ENCC> she believes in her own clairvoyance.<br>
<SYNC Start=2356748><P Class=ENCC>
And why shouldn't she?<br>
<SYNC Start=2359016><P Class=ENCC>
Because when she's in these trances,<br>
<SYNC Start=2362387><P Class=ENCC> she sees these things...<br> she actually sees them.<br>
<SYNC Start=2365421><P Class=ENCC>
And when she smells them,<br> she actually smells them.<br>
<SYNC Start=2369293><P Class=ENCC>
Isn't that right, Julian?<br>
<SYNC Start=2372293><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2384669><P Class=ENCC>
Partial epileptic seizures...<br>
<SYNC Start=2387774><P Class=ENCC> caused by a dysfunction...<br> in the anteromedial<br>
<SYNC Start=2390882><P Class=ENCC> and posterior temporal lobes of the brain...<br>
<SYNC Start=2394668><P Class=ENCC> and characterized by visual<br> and olfactory hallucinations.<br>
<SYNC Start=2399592><P Class=ENCC>
Sights...<br> and smells.<br>
<SYNC Start=2404535><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2411709><P Class=ENCC>
Julian, how long have you known?<br>
<SYNC Start=2414709><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2417399><P Class=ENCC>
Eight years.<br>
<SYNC Start=2419157><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2421410><P Class=ENCC>
They weren't that frequent at first.<br>
<SYNC Start=2424288><P Class=ENCC>
She thought it was a psychic trance.<br>
<SYNC Start=2426822><P Class=ENCC>
You thought you'd put her in the act,<br>
<SYNC Start=2429542><P Class=ENCC> puff her up until she believed...<br>
<SYNC Start=2432286><P Class=ENCC> that she could bestow this gift onto other people.<br>
<SYNC Start=2435546><P Class=ENCC>
She was convinced that it was a gift from God.<br>
<SYNC Start=2438445><P Class=ENCC>
It gave her life purpose.<br>
<SYNC Start=2440960><P Class=ENCC>
It made her happy.<br>
<SYNC Start=2443960><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2446464><P Class=ENCC>
Julian, this is Mr. Carver<br> from the D.A. 's office.<br>
<SYNC Start=2450393><P Class=ENCC>
What are we going to tell Sylvia?<br>
<SYNC Start=2454288><P Class=ENCC>
Are we gonna tell her that you told the truth...<br>
<SYNC Start=2458369><P Class=ENCC> and that you have faith in her gift?<br>
<SYNC Start=2461943><P Class=ENCC>
Or are we gonna tell her that you lied,<br>
<SYNC Start=2464720><P Class=ENCC> because you know that...<br>
<SYNC Start=2466909><P Class=ENCC> her gift is nothing but a haphazard firing of a...<br>
<SYNC Start=2471889><P Class=ENCC> defective brain synapse?<br>
<SYNC Start=2476367><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2478433><P Class=ENCC>
If I testify...<br>
<SYNC Start=2480700><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2482176><P Class=ENCC>
If I testify against Eduardo Mendez,<br>
<SYNC Start=2485341><P Class=ENCC> and I cop to this murder,<br>
<SYNC Start=2487987><P Class=ENCC> what are you gonna do for her?<br>
<SYNC Start=2490927><P Class=ENCC>
Last time I got out of jail,<br> it took me six months to find her.<br>
<SYNC Start=2494670><P Class=ENCC>
She was sleeping under an overpass...<br>
<SYNC Start=2497101><P Class=ENCC> on a pee-soaked mattress.<br>
<SYNC Start=2500167><P Class=ENCC>
She can't hold a job.<br>
<SYNC Start=2502495><P Class=ENCC>
She can't hack the drugs.<br>
<SYNC Start=2505726><P Class=ENCC>
She needs someone to take care of her.<br>
<SYNC Start=2510396><P Class=ENCC>
If you cooperate fully,<br>
<SYNC Start=2512683><P Class=ENCC> we'll see about getting her into a group home...<br>
<SYNC Start=2514662><P Class=ENCC> near where you'll be incarcerated.<br>
<SYNC Start=2518811><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2519920><P Class=ENCC>
No. But...<br>
<SYNC Start=2521130><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2522563><P Class=ENCC>
No, w-w-we'll make sure she gets in.<br>
<SYNC Start=2527158><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2531394><P Class=ENCC>
Okay.<br>
I'll tell you...<br>
<SYNC Start=2535582><P Class=ENCC>
I'll tell you everything you want to know.<br>
<SYNC Start=2538582><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2548913><P Class=ENCC>
You love her.<br>
<SYNC Start=2550670><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2551643><P Class=ENCC>
We don't do very well without each other.<br>
<SYNC Start=2554643><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2562564><P Class=ENCC>
He told us the truth. He told us<br> everything we need to know.<br>
<SYNC Start=2564809><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, thank God.<br>
<SYNC Start=2566084><P Class=ENCC>
- So we can go now.<br>
- I can't. I'm sorry.<br>
<SYNC Start=2569084><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2569562><P Class=ENCC>
But, Julian, Lyz said we're not supposed to fall.<br>
<SYNC Start=2573750><P Class=ENCC>
It's all right, baby. There'll be<br> someone there to catch you this time.<br>
<SYNC Start=2577957><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2581361><P Class=ENCC>
Julian.<br>
<SYNC Start=2583765><P Class=ENCC>
Julian.<br>
<SYNC Start=2585644><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2586936><P Class=ENCC>
True love. Probably<br> his only redeeming quality.<br>

</BODY>
</SAMI>
Tonight was your first time at the club, wasn't it?
No, I've been there a few times before.
Really? How come
I haven't seen you?
I noticed you the first night I walked in.
You always stand out.
Well, thank you.
How come it took you till tonight to talk to me?
You're not shy, are you?
Maybe a little.
Are you okay with this?
Just taking off with someone you hardly know?
I trust myself.
What do you mean?
Well, I believe in human nature.
You know, that
people are basically good.
You're right, most people are.
Tracie. You spell that with a "Y" or an "I-E"?
"I-E Guys are always assuming I'm a "T-R-A-C-Y. "
How I hate guys who assume.
Me, too.
- You look like a James.
- Nope, just Jim.
- How about Jimmy?
- No, just Jim.
Oh, come on, you are shy.
Look, uh, there's something
I have been meaning to tell you.
I think you have beautiful hair.
- Oh, you think so?
- Yeah.
Brown Bag, this is Brown
Bird, we have audio-visual.
Do you think it's sexy?
Brown Bag, close into one click.
Oh, yeah. There's nothing sexier than short hair on a beautiful woman.
What is it about big hair that turns men on?
What is it about big hair that turns guys on, anyway?
Bad taste.
Look at me. I want to see your eyes.
Innocent, just the way I like them.
That's him. That's our man.
Car is registered to a Jim Gelway.
Brown Bird, this is
Brown Bag. Move in.
He's testing, Tracie. Tell him he's got the Midas touch.
You got the Midas touch.
That's 'cause I'm
God's gift to women.
And you know what I think you are?
I think you're a natural-born cocksucker and I think it's time you did what you were born to do.
No.
What is this?
- What the fuck is this?
- Oh, shit!
- Fucking bitch!
- Bust him!
Brown Bird, Brown Bag, move in!
Take him! Take him now! Now!
Pull your vehicle to the side of the road and keep your hands
- where I can see them.
- Fuck!
Police! Pull over, now!
I got him, Alex.
Call for help, now!
Tracie! Hold on! Don't move!
Stay where you are! Stay still!
Tracie, hold on, we're going to get you!
- Come on, guys!
- There's nothing to hook on to!
- Give me a hand!
- Hold on!
Alex?
Tracie!
- Hey, Hannah.
- Hi, Megan.
I hope we don't have that big math test.
- Jezzie.
- Hey, Megan.
Jezzie, guess who called me again last night?
Oh, let's see, um...
Ah! Good morning, Dimitri.
Hey, Megan, I downloaded some really cool GIFs. You want to see them?
Yeah, sure. What are they?
We'll see inside.
Agent Flannigan.
Control, check in
Starodubov and Rose.
Check!
Hey, Jezz, what do we call the Ruskies these days?
Russians, former Soviets? I forget.
New World Order, Devine.
Get used to it.
Charles Lindbergh, Lucky Lindy, or The Lone Eagle, as he was called, is our subject today because he was the first man to what?
- Megan?
- Fly over the Atlantic?
Very good. First man to fly solo, non-stop from New York City to Paris, and that was 1927. An astonishing accomplishment.
Which brings us to today's assignment.
Let's see which of you can navigate, or fly, if you will, from our home base to our hero's website here in the fewest number of links.
All right, and you're off.
That's very clever, Dimitri.
Megan, might I have a word with you?
- Save me a seat, okay?
- Okay.
Come to my office.
Take a seat.
Now, Megan, you know I understand the particular pressures of your life.
Your father being who he is.
The enormous expectations, all adds up to rather a lot, doesn't it?
- Yes, sir.
- Mmm.
But none of that excuses your breaking the honour code.
What?
I know all about you and Dimitri, Megan.
We don't tolerate cheating, now, do we?
Cheating? Mr Soneji, there's been a mistake.
We only pass notes, you know, jokes and stuff.
Megan, before you go any further, best have a look at that.
Mr Soneji?
Yes?
This essay, it isn't mine.
Beg your pardon?
What do you mean?
Oh, my...
Oh, dear girl, I'm...
Oh, dear, dear...
Gary, why is the door locked?
Oh, my God! What happened?
She's collapsed. She's just collapsed. I'll tell you what, you stay with her,
I'll get some help.
Okay. Megan? Hey, sweetheart, can you hear me? Megan?
- Hey, Jezzie.
- Hi, Kila.
- Hey, Hannah, where's Megan?
- She's with Mr Soneji.
Control, I'm en route to Soneji's classroom.
I'm sure it's just a meeting that went long.
Well, it's against procedure.
Mr Soneji should know better.
His office.
Mr Soneji? Secret Service, open up.
Mr Soneji?
Do you have a key?
I'm sorry, there seems to be something stuck in here.
Stand back.
Control, shut down. Stop all vehicles. Lock on Soneji and Rose.
So, how many of these boats you have to make before you become shipshape?
I have never seen a man work so hard at looking busy.
Alex, it's been eight months.
It's time you forgave yourself.
Vickie, you know that forgiving yourself is the one thing a person cannot do.
Choose to make contact.
We are currently trying to put the pieces together
as to how and why this man would murder a teacher
and kidnap a young student.
Here's a photograph of the missing student.
Megan Ann Rose is 12 years old.
Blonde hair with hazel eyes.
She's 3'5" tall, and weighs about 52 pounds.
She was last seen inside the school, with the suspect, around noon today.
We have just received information that senior FBI and Secret Service officials
have arrived at the family home of Senator Rose.
We will go there live as soon as we have our satellite feed.
Technicians are setting up extra telephone lines at the Rose home,
all in preparation, should the kidnapper...
Mom...
Please.
I want to go home.
The FBI and police are on the lookout for this man, Gary Soneji.
This is a recent school photograph...
We only know that he has disappeared
with the 12-year-old daughter of Senator Hank Rose,
how and why is on the mind of...
Police are trying to find out who this man really is,
his motives for killing teacher Amy Masterson
and the kidnapping of Megan Rose.
We go back live to join reporter Alison Peretsky,
who has been at the scene since law enforcement officials arrived.
Thank you, Jamie.
It's now approximately four hours since this tragic story unfolded...
Yes?
Mom...
Please.
I want to go home.
Hello?
You tuned into me, Dr Cross?
That sounds like Alison
Peretsky at WNKW Action News.
Gary Soneji?
That'll do for now.
How did you get this number?
Unlisted numbers? Come on,
Alex, there's no such thing.
It's all out there in the air, you just have to know how to grab it.
Hey, how do you feel about my kidnapping being bigger news
than your little tragedy there with Jim Gelway?
You know, you really ought to give an interview about what happened that night.
You know what they say about sharing your pain, it's
very cathartic.
Thanks, but I'm doing okay.
Well, see, now, that's good to hear. That's very good.
I thought for a while there you wouldn't be able to get your act back together and that would be a great shame.
I have been planning for a long, long time
to involve you in the fate of our Little Miss Muffet.
Megan.
Do you have trouble saying her name?
First name rapport? Is that
Hostage Negotiations 101?
Now, come on, Alex, you can do better than that, can't you?
Do you think you're going to dissect me in three blinks of an eye?
I'm not that easy.
But with a little patience and a little help, you just might profile me to a T.
What makes you think
I'm interested?
They say that when
I die, the case will die.
They say it will be like a book that I closed.
But the book, it will never close.
Very poetic. What the hell is it?
Uh, I have left you something for your visit with the Roses tonight.
You'll find it in your cold,
corrugated
mailbox.
It's time to get back to work, Dr Cross.
I have been planning for a long, long time
to involve you in the fate of our Little Miss Muffet.
Megan.
Do you have trouble saying her name?
Sorry, Detective, this is a federal case.
I've been invited.
Bobby. Sir, we have a detective down here who may have a piece of evidence pertinent to the case.
Alex?
Special Agent Craig. Well, I'll be.
Dare I ask?
In my mailbox.
Anything else?
That'll get you inside.
Terry.
Get this to McArthur.
- Who's in charge?
- Ollie McArthur.
Pedigree FeBe, made his bones busting wackos in the Seattle office.
Soneji. Clean?
Clean? Squeaky. Fibres look generic, fingerprints, nada.
The whole school's a goddamn forensic vacuum.
All he left us was one very neatly strangled teacher.
Heads are gonna roll at the Secret Service.
Oh...
Jezzie Flannigan, Alex Cross.
Agent Flannigan was in charge of the
Secret Service detail at Cathedral.
- Dr Cross.
- Agent Flannigan.
I've read your books on profiling.
Obviously not close enough, but...
Kyle, this shoe was IDed by the Roses. It's Megan's.
Dr Alex Cross, Special
Agent in Charge...
- Oliver McArthur.
- How do you do, sir?
Alex, I'll catch you later.
- Forensics.
- Yes, sir.
The Senator and Mrs
Rose are through here.
But before we talk to them, have you any idea why
Soneji is involving you?
Not at all.
This way.
Excuse me, shouldn't Agent
Flannigan be in the room with us?
Not a good idea.
Miss Flannigan is not welcome.
But she's a material witness.
She failed the Roses and she failed the Service.
I think Agent McArthur has a point.
No, he's missing the point.
You saw Soneji every day, five days a week for how long?
Two years.
You have no idea how much you know about this case.
Agent Flannigan...
They say that when I die, the case will die.
They say it will be like a book that I closed.
But the book, it will never close.
Very poetic. What the hell is it?
I have left you something for your visit with the Roses tonight.
You'll find it in your cold, corrugated mailbox.
Well, for what it's worth, that's Soneji.
His speech pattern's the same.
Is he, um...
Are we dealing with a sex maniac?
Someone who might, you know...
No, sir.
This man has no such interest in your daughter.
She's merely a means to an end.
What do you mean?
I see no standard procedure in anything he's done.
I disagree.
This is a professional kidnapping.
It's going to be about money.
Which is good.
But you're saying it isn't about money?
I think he wants to draw this out.
From what he's said, whatever his motives, it's very unusual.
What did he mean about the book?
That it will never close?
I honestly don't know.
Well, I think I do.
Let me tell you what this
Gary Soneji is up to.
The last thing he wants is good crisis management.
What he wants is to confuse.
Rancour, mixed signals, disorientation, those are his tools.
So he calls a local cop.
A damaged cop shouldering some heavy baggage.
He's using Dr Cross as his messenger.
Excuse me, the man that kidnapped our daughter didn't call you, so your agenda is what, to insult the man he did call?
- Mrs Rose, I never intended...
- No, you wait a second.
A mad man has our daughter and for some reason he contacted this man.
Do you know why?
No, ma'am, not yet.
Hello.
You okay?
You, uh, got any tips for helpless situations?
Well, you could smoke a carton a day... or you could bounce back.
Yeah, well, I don't see anywhere to bounce to.
Like to get out of here?
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
What did McArthur mean when he referred to you as damaged?
Last summer I let a sting operation get out of control.
My partner was killed.
Hey, Megan. How are you?
Lovely to see you.
Do you recognise my voice?
It's me.
Mr Soneji.
Mmm-hmm.
I brought you that.
A lovely cup of tea with honey.
I know your throat is sore.
It'll make you feel better.
There you go.
It's all right.
You have nothing to be scared of, Megan.
I'm not scared.
Good.
But you're wondering what's going on.
I know what's going on, you're a kidnapper and you're a sick weirdo.
Megan, you're the most opinionated girl in my class.
- Think you got that from your mom?
- I want to go home.
You Will.
Just promise me you're going to behave yourself, okay?
That's all.
Now, listen, if you need to use the bathroom, or anything at all, just press that, okay?
I want to go home! Now!
Look, I brought you some fresh clothes.
Please! Mr Soneji, please!
This is a fine gun.
It's Turkish.
Handmade, 1924.
That is nice.
My daddy won it in a game of poker. Aces and Eights.
Dead man's hand.
That's about as much as
I know about my father.
Have a seat.
Do you know of any relationship between Amy Masterson and Soneji?
Amy? No way.
Why do you ask?
He strangled her.
It's an act of passion.
That's a demonstration of will.
A message.
Take me seriously. What do you see?
- Dr Cross...
- Alex.
Alex, women's intuition, third eye, sixth sense, whatever it is, I don't have it.
Sure you do, you just don't look at it right.
Every face has two aspects.
Now try looking at it down the middle one side at a time.
Would you say this man was confident?
Yeah.
- Narcissistic?
- I wouldn't know.
- You ever see any flashes of hatred?
- No.
- Anger?
- No.
- Hostility?
- No.
Look, everything about him was right.
He was always patient.
He was pleasant.
He had a sense of humour.
I mean, he was the perfect teacher.
What do you see?
I see...
No, I mean about me.
What do you see about me?
And that's why you're here, isn't it?
To size me up?
Evaluate your primary material witness?
I see that you're about to start an argument.
I need to help get her back.
What makes you think
I want a partner?
- You don't.
- That's right.
- I can understand that.
- No, you can't.
Can I tell you why I don't care?
Shoot
Look.
When I was assigned to Cathedral, it was a job I didn't want.
It's a far cry from working rope-lines or flying Air Force One but I have been there for three years.
I have been responsible for
Megan for three years.
And that little girl means more to me than even a partner.
Can you understand that?
I suppose so.
But even if I say no anyway, you'll probably just follow me around wherever I go.
So, if it's a choice between having you as a partner or as a stalker,
I guess I'll take my chances with a partner.
Thank you.
The student drop-off is there.
That's my morning post.
Student sign-in.
Cameras are there, there, there and there.
Motion sensors all around the periphery.
Foolproof way to keep the kooks out.
Exactly, we were always looking in the wrong direction.
Which door did he go out?
Uh, that one there. It's a straight shot to his parking space.
Let's go in.
- His classroom.
- Mmm-hmm.
He was teaching the kids how everything on the Internet is connected.
- Alex, you got a sec?
- Sure.
Listen, I think turf wars are a total waste of time.
If I was out of line last night, I apologise.
Don't. I've been there.
- Anything you need, you let me know.
- Sure, Mac.
Doctor Cross, you might want to see this.
- This is Megan's desk?
- Yes.
What are you doing?
Scoping GIFs. Graphic
Interchange Formats.
They're all stego-encrypted.
Somewhere among the billions of zeros and ones making up this image is a string of text.
I know about this, it's the cutting-edge method of passing notes in class.
It's driving the teachers nuts.
How long before you can access it?
Oh, try never.
You don't crack stego without a password.
Would you take me to his office?
Oh, when you find Soneji, ask him for the password.
He planted a monitoring virus on the girl's hard drive.
Every keystroke Megan hit,
Soneji was recording it.
Good move, Jezz.
Angling for a position with the DCPD. I like that.
Dr Cross, Agent Ben Devine.
Agent Devine is security systems supervisor.
Well, for now.
We are going to be thrown to the wolves as soon as they find Megan
Rose dead in a ditch.
Now what makes you so sure that's what's going to happen?
Me getting fired or the girl in a ditch?
Sorry, I'm having a pessimistic day.
Tell me, Soneji, did he...
Did he ever show any interest in what you do? How you do it?
The man never talked to me.
I never talked to him.
Well, thanks for your time.
Hello.
What?
What do you think that is?
- An empty frame.
- Mmm-hmm.
Otherwise known as...
A missing picture.
You onto something?
- A missing picture.
- Mmm-hmm.
Our Mr Soneji has a sense of humour.
He didn't just kidnap a little girl, he turned it into a game.
Okay.
Let's see what you know, Mr Lindbergh.
- My, my.
- What did he get?
Dr Cross isn't in cyberspace any more, you're at a live site looking through a video camera.
Those arrows down there move it.
Where are we?
I would guess we're in Soneji's home.
Now we're supposed to find out where that is.
Oliver McArthur's office.
Yeah, it's me. Hold on.
How about the files?
There.
- On the wall.
- There's a...
Can you zoom in there?
Yeah.
Jonathan...
- "M"...
- "E".
- Hold on. Hold on.
- "L"?
You can't move that around, can you? It's stationary.
Go back.
No, there's something somewhere else. I'll guarantee it.
- Right there.
- There.
- What?
- You can zoom.
Focus. There.
Bingo.
- M-E-R...
- Mere?
Mercusio.
M-E-R-C-U-S-I-O.
- Granville.
- Granville.
Gary Soneji is also known as
Mercusio, Jonathan,
1435 Granville Street.
Well done, Alex.
In! In!
Cover up. Zoom in! Left!
Eyes open!
There.
Not until we get the go-ahead.
Turn it out to the roof.
Yeah, he's still dusting.
His surveillance was better than ours.
He's been at this for years.
Imagine the patience.
The dedication.
You sound like an admirer.
Well, he's...
He's like a spider.
And I happen to like spiders.
He's got an elaborate setup, here, boss.
You want to see how he stayed clean at school?
It laminates a plastic veneer over your hands.
Look at this.
Foam rubber. Looks like he was wearing prosthetic appliances.
I understand the Secret Service
are being cautious tonight.
Th ere is speculation that a full investigation is underway
into how Gary Soneji was able to kidnap a student
from right under their cameras.
Yes, Kevin. One of the
Secret Service agents...
Evening. What's the problem?
Help! Help me!
You've got a Rule 21 problem, no running lights.
Again? I just replaced the fuses yesterday.
Help! Help!
Sir, no running lights. You're going to have to follow us in.
Help! Please, help me!
Well, let me see what I can do with the fuse box. Hold on. Hold on.
I'm in here, help me!
I've been kidnapped, help!
Help!
How's that?
Thanks a lot, fellas.
Help!
Help me, please!
Help me, please!
Help me!
"...and before the hood was pulled over his head,
"he bragged to his executioner,
"'They think that when I die,
"'the case will die.
"'They think it will be like a book I close.
"'But the book,
"'it will never close."'
Soneji was quoting the final words of Richard Bruno Hauptmann.
I'm sorry, I don't follow.
1932. The infant son of Charles Lindbergh,
America's greatest hero, was kidnapped.
When Bruno Hauptmann was arrested, what followed became known as
"The Crime of the Century."
I believe that Soneji wants to do the same thing.
You think we're dealing with a copycat?
Something like that.
Dr Cross.
What does he want from you?
He's brought me in and left this trail because he wants me to make sure that he's properly appreciated.
And in order for him to achieve this, he has to kill Megan?
No, no. Not necessarily.
The death of the Lindbergh baby was accidental.
Nevertheless, it's critical that we pull his strings.
The more we make him a living legend, the more likely he is to keep Megan alive.
Dr Cross, you've been brought into this case, what can you tell us about Gary Soneji?
I can tell you that Soneji is very determined,
obviously highly capable
and we consider him a serious adversary.
What about Megan Rose?
Megan Rose is Gary Soneji's ace.
As long as he has her, he's in control.
Sir, would you assign as many agents to this case
if she wasn't a Senator's daughter?
The size of our task force is a reflection of who Gary Soneji is, not Megan Rose.
Mr Soneji?
You can parse the words if you'd like.
Hello.
I need to go to the bathroom.
All right. Be right there.
No, not at this time.
Come on.
Come on.
Hey!
Help!
Please, help!
Help!
Please, help!
Help!
Help me, please!
Help!
Help!
Help me!
Help, please!
Please, help me!
I'm coming!
Hold on!
Help! Help me!
Hold on!
No!
No! Please!
Please!
Please!
No! Help me! Please!
No! Please!
Here. Here.
This'll keep you warm.
There you go.
Megan, you promised me you were going to behave yourself.
Because of you, what you've done, that man is dead.
Now, promise me...
Promise me you're going to be a good little girl, okay?
Say, "Yes, Mr Soneji."
Say, "Yes, Mr Soneji."
Yes, Mr Soneji.
Okay.
Now let's go have that cup of tea.
I'd say eight hours.
About 9:00 a.m.
Slugs are large calibre.
Shots hit him here, here.
Kill shot tapped him, crown of the head.
This here is Thomas
Mathias, he found all this.
This way.
She's not in the water, Jezzie.
Soneji still has her.
- There is no way of knowing that.
- Well, think about it.
Megan is precious cargo.
Soneji is not going to let some twist of fate bring her harm.
Right?
But why Megan? Why her?
Come on.
- Where are you going?
- Back to the city. We'll talk in the car.
You asked, "Why Megan?"
And that's the question we should have been asking right from the start.
Why Megan?
Who is Senator Hank Rose?
- He's...
- Nobody.
Most people don't even know who he is.
Never heard of him. Couldn't pick him out of a line-up.
This case is front-page news now, where will it be in two months?
A Year?
Oblivion. Know why?
Because Senator Hank Rose is no Charles Lindbergh.
- Well, okay, then, who is?
- Ah...
There is the troublesome question.
Come on, Jezzie.
Two years, five days a week. You know Soneji.
Who's a bigger fish than Megan Rose?
Dr Cross, Agent Flannigan, we appreciate your concern, but Dimitri is fine, and our security services are most capable of protecting the son of the Russian president.
Can we at least talk to him?
Nothing would please us more than to be of help.
But speaking to Dimitri right now would be inappropriate.
Thanks for your time.
What?
Well, McArthur is drag netting the bay, right?
And, I mean, he's not really missing us, so I was thinking maybe we could just stick around and, you know, scope out the place a bit.
Agent Flannigan, are you...
Are you suggesting a stakeout here?
Yeah, you know, stale coffee, some doughnuts.
No, no, no. That's a first-class stakeout, Agent Flannigan.
What you are talking about here would be no frills.
You'd only get to think about stale coffee and doughnuts.
Well, I can handle it if you can.
I get the feeling you've done this a lot.
Oh, yeah.
Every chance I get.
Especially when it's cold and wet.
No parking here.
We are on the clock, Officer.
Everything okay?
Everything is all right.
What's the problem?
Go ahead, Jezzie.
What?
Have one.
Thank you.
Alex, that's Dimitri.
Jezzie, it's him. It's him!
Soneji!
Hold it right there!
Jezzie, shoot the tyres!
Jezzie!
Jezzie!
Police! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Jezzie!
Jezzie, you're going to get Megan back, right?
Yes, we are. I promise.
Use this to get Mr Soneji.
I will.
Thank you.
You talk to Hal, I want you to bring him up to speed.
Well done, guys.
Avert an international crisis and paint Soneji into a corner.
Not bad for a night's work.
Incoming, Soneji ditched the patrol car near Reno Park.
Hijacked a tan Sierra. Put one bullet in the driver's head.
Last seen heading toward Route 50.
Annapolis. I knew it. 75,000 boats.
- Other marinas?
- We're here, dead fisherman here.
These, all the marinas, all locked down, patrol boats in each of them.
All right, listen up.
We got to move fast.
Roadblock Route 50 and triple the surveillance in the harbours.
I want two choppers on the pad in five minutes. Let's go.
Son of a bitch.
What's wrong?
I blew it, that's what's wrong.
I had a shot right before he hit the hydrant.
But instead of pulling the trigger,
I was thinking. I was thinking!
Yeah, you were thinking of the possibility of your shot going astray and blowing Soneji's head off, in which case...
We would never find
Megan. I know that.
Well, then, don't beat yourself up for being prudent.
Alex, you don't get it. I was trained to shoot first and think later,
- and I...
- Jezzie, for heaven's sake.
If you hadn't convinced me to stay there,
Soneji would have two victims instead of one.
Plus we'd have an international incident on our hands. You did good.
- Yes, but still...
- You did good.
- Anything?
- No, not yet.
We're sitting on the area.
Chief, Soneji's on the phone.
- Soneji?
- Detective Cross?
I want to explain how the agenda's changed.
You're going to bring me
$10 million in diamonds.
Point five carat, colour D, clarity
SI2 in a thermos in nine hours.
If the stones are rigged, laser tagged, irradiated, the girl dies.
Does that penetrate?
It does.
I'll call back. 4:00 p.m. sharp.
He beat the trace.
The clock's ticking, people, let's move this downtown. Let's go.
Dr Cross?
I'm here.
The Watergate. 20 minutes.
There's a package for Mr Antwerp.
Okay, people, let's move.
Don't lose me, kiddo.
You won't even see me.
I'm on police business.
Keep it here, please.
Eddy, this way.
Hi, how are you?
Do you have a package for Mr Antwerp?
Yes.
Yes, sir.
Over there. That one.
Cross.
Leave the phone. Leave the car.
Pennsylvania and 6th. The fountain.
Fourteen minutes. Run.
Thanks.
Mac, you there?
- Alex.
- He made me ditch the car.
Looks like it's a running game.
I'm on my way to
6th and Pennsylvania.
I'm left and behind you, Alex.
Bearing onto Pennsylvania.
- Cross.
- 12th and Madison.
Twelve minutes will get you there. Go.
Unit 3, loop on 23rd Street. Unit 6, take K Street and double back.
You've got four units on top, Alex.
Cross.
Four minutes. Union
Station. Main entrance.
Jezzie.
Union Station, main entrance.
It's rush hour. He's drawing him into a crowd.
Hey! Hey!
Don't answer that!
I think it's for me.
Cross.
- Cross.
- Keep this phone. Take the Metro.
Platform A. You got two minutes. Go.
Jezzie, Metro, downstairs, platform A.
Cross.
Go to the centre of the platform.
Track 15. Go.
Go to the first car.
You there yet?
Yeah, I'm there.
Go to the left side.
Open the window.
These windows don't open.
You're smart, Detective.
Improvise. Quickly.
Police officer, everybody down!
Get down, everybody down.
Come on, out of the way.
We're ready. All right. Now, throw.
We can neither confirm nor deny that Gary Soneji was involved in the incident on the MTA train this morning.
We've heard rumours that a ransom was paid.
Can you comment on this?
I can't comment on any of that.
What about Megan Rose?
I'm not going to go into any details at this time.
What do we know about
Soneji's state of mind?
I'm not going to comment on his mental stability.
You can draw your own conclusions.
Now, Senator Rose has agreed to make a statement, but he's not...
- What's up?
- ...going to answer any questions.
The file on Soneji, is it still on your kitchen table?
Yeah, why?
I'm going to have another look at it.
This business about the diamonds, money,
I didn't see it coming.
And the feelings of absolute helplessness.
I am grateful that the FBI is here with the objective expertise required
to find out where my daughter is. Secondly, I now...
This is worse than killing time.
Yeah, but you'd be amazed at how often the small, neglected things become the most important.
I've just got the feeling we are missing something.
Maybe I'm in the wrong line of work.
Maybe I should take on something less challenging.
You do what you are, Jezzie.
You mean, "You are what you do."
No, I mean, you do what you are.
You're born with a gift.
If not that, then you get good at something along the way.
And what you're good at, you don't take for granted.
You don't betray it.
What if you do betray your gift?
Then you betray yourself.
That's a sad thing.
- Who is it?
- Police.
Gary Soneji.
Hi, Alex.
Now, right hand, thumb and forefinger.
Just give me the gun.
Alex, you can't shoot me.
You'll never find Megan.
Sit down, Alex.
I'm a little concerned,
Alex. I'm a little...
I'm a little worried that you...
You don't really care to understand me any more.
That you won't paint an accurate portrait.
And I need you to convince me that I'm wrong.
Well, in order to do that, we're going to have to talk about Megan Rose.
No. No, no bargaining, Alex.
No cheap interrogation techniques.
It's transparent and it's clumsy.
This is between me and you.
I want you to see.
I want you to look inside here and tell me what the fuck you see.
I'm a gift to you, Alex.
I'm a gift to you.
And you are beyond pitiful if you cannot understand that.
I'm living proof that a mind...
The mind is a terrible thing.
I see you've got your sense of humour back.
Yeah.
I wondered what happened to it during the ransom drop.
The ransom drop.
That was a well-earned $12 million.
Twelve million.
Senator Rose says he can pull strings.
Says he can fix it so you keep the $12 million and walk.
All you have to do is return the child.
Where is Megan?
Where's Megan?
Where's Megan?
Where's Megan? Where's
Megan? Where's Megan?
She's trapped on my boat,
Alex, isn't that right?
Or maybe she's stuck in a warehouse somewhere or floating in a river.
Swinging from the end of a rope. Buried alive.
I envy her.
What would life have been like with parents like that?
Come on, Gary. Blaming your parents for what you are?
I'm not blaming them, Alex.
They've been punished already.
Oh?
I burned down the house while they slept.
I was 15 years old.
Was it what you expected?
Not really. It was a new experience.
What, killing?
No.
Being in the newspapers.
So, in your opinion, Doctor, were my actions triggered by nature or nurture?
If you want me to be brutally honest,
I think you just have a morbid desire to burn in hell.
We're done for today.
I'm taking her with me.
You're not taking her anywhere.
I'll send her back to you.
You just tell me which piece you want first.
Oh, shit!
Damn it!
Alex!
What...
What have you done?
What have you done?
Residents of this normally quiet suburb are still in shock as news of the shooting of Gary Soneji, who is America's most wanted man, filter through their community.
Apparently Soneji attempted to confront or even harm members of the kidnapping taskforce hunting him.
So he came after Jezzie as payback for Dimitri.
Ostensibly, yeah.
That's how you want it on record?
Yeah, for now.
Here they come.
Dr Cross, tell me you have at least an idea of where my little girl is.
I'm sorry, sir, I can't.
You kill the one man that has the answers, and you're telling me you haven't a clue?
Not one clue?
The man walked in the fucking room
- and you shot him!
- Senator.
Standing in his shoes, I'd have done the same thing, sir.
Well, that's your job, not his.
He's supposed to find my little girl, not shoot the man who knows where she is.
Senator.
It's not over.
The book is not closed.
Alex.
Thank you for saving my life.
Goodbye, Jezz.
You want to hear something funny, Mac?
Sure, cheer me up.
I congratulated Soneji on scoring $12 million.
You mean $10 million.
Exactly.
He had no idea what
I was talking about.
I know you. You work at my school.
Eat your food, Megan.
Alex, where is this going?
We've been through these tapes backwards and forwards.
I can't see how this is helping us find Megan.
Do you know what I see, Mac?
Someone was onto Soneji long before we ever heard of him.
Look at this. What do you see?
Agent Devine hauling ass out to the front gate.
Mac, he could have shut this whole place down from right there.
Now you want to tell me why he didn't?
Good God!
Devine was in on it with him.
Then when Soneji hit the embassy, he pulled a double-cross.
He ran his own ransom.
No.
Soneji was a loner.
An accomplice would have been beneath him.
I'll tell you what happened.
Soneji was hoodwinked, and so were we.
Details are still emerging, but this much is clear,
the manhunt that began over a week ago in the nation's capital
came to a violent end late yesterday...
with the death of kidnapper,
Gary Soneji. In this...
Don't move.
Turn around, hands on the wall, feet apart.
Hi, Jezz, where did you come from?
You know something, Devine?
You're pretty stupid.
Your car in the driveway, the TV so loud you wouldn't be able to hear a SWAT team come in.
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!
Where's Megan?
She's in the barn.
She was so doped up,
I don't think she even knew
I took her off the boat.
She's still alive?
You were supposed to dump her in the river after you got the diamonds.
Yeah, well...
Maybe killing a kid is something
I'm not prepared to do on my own.
Anyway, today, tomorrow, it's still going to look like Soneji killed her.
She can't die after
Soneji, you idiot!
It doesn't make any difference, you know why?
They're never going to find the body.
Okay. I'll go do it now, will that make you happy?
Yeah, it would.
Wait.
Can I see them?
Hey, do you realise that we spent an entire year following Soneji's every move?
I think we deserve these.
That beats the hell out of a
Secret Service pension, huh?
Hmm.
Profiling the profiler.
Kidnap from the kidnapper, that's brilliant.
You are a genius, Jezz.
Genius has nothing to do with it, I'm just good at what I do.
Well, it didn't hurt that everyone else involved was a complete half-wit.
You think Alex Cross is a half-wit?
You really believe that he shot Soneji to save my life?
Cross pulled the trigger because he knew Soneji didn't have Megan any more.
What are you saying?
I'm saying that sooner or later he's going to figure it out.
He already knows Soneji didn't run the ransom.
He is onto us already, isn't he?
No, he's not onto us.
But I think he's onto you.
It's Turkish.
My daddy won it in a game of poker.
It's about as much as I know about my father.
Megan?
Megan, it's me, honey.
Jezzie?
Jezzie! Jezzie,
I'm in here! Jezzie!
Open up, honey. I'm gonna take you home. It's all over.
Yeah, sure, just hold on a second!
Jezzie?
Yeah, honey?
What happened to that other guy?
He's dead, Megan.
You're safe now.
Open up.
Jezzie?
Yeah, honey?
Why isn't there anyone else with you?
Megan, it's me.
Now don't be scared of me.
Open the door.
Megan, I'm going to ask you one more time to open the door.
Right now! Open the door!
Megan, open the door, honey!
Listen to me! Open the door!
Megan, open the fucking door!
Open it! Bitch!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Very clever, Megan.
Come on.
Jezzie?
It's over.
Drop the gun.
Alex.
How did you, um...
Aces and Eights, Jezzie.
Plus your timing was a little off.
I watched the tapes.
You and Devine could have stopped Soneji at the school.
Just like you could have stopped him at the Russian embassy.
But you had a different agenda.
You know something, Alex?
When you said you do what you are, you were right.
I'm living proof.
Put the gun down, Jezzie.
Would you kill another partner?
You're not my partner.
You all right?
You are a very brave girl, Megan.
Who are you?
I'm a policeman.
My name is Alex Cross.
I'm a friend of your parents.
Can you take me to them?
Nothing would give me greater pleasure.
Could you...
Thanks.
—before the end of the season last year… and then re-injured it in spring training… on a terrific game-saving play.
You know, I was talking with….
–What time is this going on?
-7:30 is the pre-game.
–Who'd you say was pitching tonight?
–Tiant's pitching.
–Goddamn Cuban, man. He can hurl it.
–I'd hate to be facing him.
–Who are they playing tonight, Yankees?
–Yankees.
Imagine a 92-mile-an-hour fastball coming at you. You don't have time to think.
What kind of night you think Fisk will have?
He's been hot lately.
He gets on base twice tonight, gets on base twice, I'll paint your porch.
Save.
The sewer.
Hold on, I'll get it.
Sorry, guys, I guess I don't know my own strength.
You know what, Dave? That must be it.
Hey… you guys know what would be really cool?
–What?
–Driving a car.
You know, just around the block.
Yeah?
Anyone on this street keep their keys in their car?
I steal a car, my dad will kill me.
Just around the block. Who said steal?
Your dad kill you for writing your name too?
See, now it'll be there forever.
Me too.
Forever.
Let me ask you something.
You brats think it's okay to destroy municipal property?
Huh?
Come here.
Get over here.
Well, do you?
–No, sir.
–No, sir.
–No.
–No, what?
Sir.
You're the hard case of the group, huh?
A pack of punks, huh?
You live around here?
Right there.
You?
Right over there.
How about you?
Where do you live, son?
–Rester Street.
–Is your mother home?
We're gonna go have a talk with her.
Tell her what her punk kid's been up to.
Get in.
Get the fuck inside.
In.
You kids go tell your mothers what you've been up to.
And don't let me catch you shits ruining my sidewalks again.
What do you mean?
Who put Dave in a car?
The cop. He had a gold badge.
How do you know it was a cop?
See anything on the badge?
–No, no writing.
–He had a uniform on?
Like a regular police uniform?
–He was a cop.
–He took Davey.
–So, what were you guys doing?
–We wrote our names in the cement, but—
You were writing in cement and playing hockey, but they took Dave?
–That doesn't make sense. Come on.
–Is there something wrong, Dad?
Please.
No more.
Please.
No more, please.
–Have you seen him?
–Looks like damaged goods to me.
Jesus.
You took some good swings today.
Dad, I struck out.
Good swings, though. That's what counts.
I'll never be a good ballplayer.
You're my son. Me, Dave Boyle.
Star shortstop, Trinity High School,
1978 to '82.
You're gonna be a great ballplayer.
–Hey, see that gutter drain over there?
–Yeah.
I used to play on this street when I was a kid.
That drain swallowed every ball we had.
Baseballs, street-hockey balls, Pinkys.
If we could get that manhole cover up… could be 1000 balls down there.
Really? Let's try.
Get in.
Come on, Dad, come help me hunt for balls.
Maybe tomorrow. Let's get home before Mom starts to worry.
Jimmy. Jimmy.
Earth to Mr Markum.
–What do you want now, Pete?
–Like I'm Mr Needy all of a sudden?
We're out of the Marlboros and the Winstons are looking grim.
–So?
–So that means less profit… and more profit means I get a raise.
So why don't you order more.
All right, but if the surgeon general calls, you're my alibi.
–Hey, you.
–Hey, there.
I'm going out tonight with Eve and Diane, at 7:30.
Don't stay out too late. You got your sister's First Communion tomorrow.
–Christ, I sound like….
–Someone's father?
Yeah, somebody's. Not mine.
–Later, Daddy.
–Later.
Have fun.
–Later.
–Later.
Brendan.
–You scared the shit out of me.
–I'm sorry, I didn't want your dad to see me.
He sees you sneaking into my car, he'll shoot you.
What will he do if he sees this?
Shoot you and then kill you.
It's been six hours.
I had to see you.
I'm gonna be late for Eve and Diane.
Tomorrow?
Like we planned?
Tomorrow.
Drop me around the corner.
–Take it easy.
–He kept cutting me off!
He kept cutting me off!
He kept cutting me off!
He followed me all the way from goddamn
Lynnfield. He was trying to kill me!
That son of a bitch!
Can you believe this guy keeps confessing?
I don't know. Maybe we ought to grab a lawyer out of one of these BMWs up here.
Hey, Devine?
–What you looking at?
–The old neighborhood.
–We're done, Sean, but I can stick around.
–No, I think we're good, thanks.
A few of us are going to the Cantab after.
No, I don't think so, Jen.
Thanks. Thanks anyway.
Yeah.
–So the wife left you six months ago?
–So?
So Jenny Coughlin there with the body, voice and the cuffs….
This girl, she makes gay guys rethink their orientation.
So, what's your point?
The girl just wants to bed you, not wed you. You don't even blink?
She wants to worship at the temple of Devine.
–I'm married, Whitey.
–So was Bill Clinton, didn't stop him.
–You haven't talked to Lauren in six months.
–She calls all the time.
And says absolutely nothing.
Weirdest thing I ever heard of.
One of these days, the phone's gonna ring and she'll tell me why she left.
Yeah? Maybe she's waiting for you to say something.
Come on, come on, come on.
The pitch. A swing and a line drive into right field. A base hit.
I just don't feel like they're gonna win this one.
Could we please have three beers?
Yeah, come on.
You believe those chicks?
–Come on.
–Oh, yeah, baby.
Ain't that Jimmy Markum's girl?
–We've got you right over here, boys.
–Yeah.
Yeah.
I've known her since she was a kid.
A ball and two strikes. Two on, two out.
Dave.
It's 3 in the morning.
Where have you been?
Oh, my God.
I fucked up.
What happened?
This guy tried to mug me, and I swung on him and he sliced me.
But look at your hand.
We gotta go to the hospital.
No, no, it's not that bad.
It's not that deep.
–It bled like hell. I can't go to the hospital.
–Oh, my God, Dave.
Come on. Come here.
So I'm walking to my car, and this guy comes up to me and asks for a light.
I say I don't smoke.
He says neither does he.
My heart starts clocking a buck fifty because there's no one around.
–Oh, God.
–That's when I see the knife.
Says, “Your wallet or your life.
I'm leaving with one of them.”
–That's what he said?
–Yeah.
So I try to brush past him.
That's when he slices me.
–You said you swung on him first.
–Jesus, Celeste, can I tell the fucking story?
I'm sorry, babe.
I went fucking nuts on him, baby. I….
I went off.
I bashed his head on the parking lot.
There was blood everywhere.
I might have killed him.
Killed him?
It makes you feel… alone, you know, hurting somebody.
Yeah, but you had to, right?
It makes you feel… alien.
Okay.
Babe, you hop in the shower.
And I'll take care of your clothes.
–Yeah?
–Yeah.
Here.
911, police services.
What's the nature of your emergency?
There's, like, this car with blood in it, and the door's open.
–What's the location of the car?
–Sydney Street.
It's in the Flats by Pen Park.
Me and my friend just found it.
–Son, what's your name?
–He wants to know her name.
Your name, what's your name?
We're so fucking out of here.
Good luck, man.
Dispatch, this is Unit 33.
We're gonna need a crime-scene tech, and you might want to notify Homicide.
Thirty-three, have you found a body yet? Over.
No, but by the looks of this car, we'll find one sooner or later.
–Yeah?
–I'm in the weeds here at the store… and I need some help.
You and Katie can't handle 6, how you gonna handle the church crowd?
–That's the thing, Katie ain't here.
–Hold on.
I'll be there in 10 minutes.
Just call Sal, make sure he can get there at 8 instead of 10.
No-shows at work, what if she no-shows at church?
She'll be there.
You know, she's gonna screw up this day too.
Oh, what other day has she screwed up lately?
You got two other daughters, don't forget.
I'll be at the church before anybody else, don't worry about that.
What the fuck's going on here?
–Pete, anybody show?
–No.
Katie didn't call?
No.
–Hello?
–Drew, Jimmy.
Sorry to wake you.
I'm looking for Katie.
Yeah, she's here, I think.
Hang on a second, let me go check.
Have a nice day.
No, it was Diane Cestra who slept over. No Katie.
Eve said she dropped her off at around
1:00. Didn't say where she was going.
Don't worry, I'll track her down.
–She seeing anybody maybe?
-19-year-old girls, who can keep a tally?
–That's the cold truth, bud.
–I'll talk to you later.
I'll take hookers over old ladies any day.
–Mind if I go grab a smoke?
–You can smoke the whole pack.
Can I help you, Brendan?
No, Mr Markum, I'm looking for some of that tea that my ma likes.
–That's Barry's. Next aisle.
–Thanks.
–When's Sal getting here?
–Anytime now.
–That it, Bren?
–A Globe.
I thought Katie worked on Sundays.
Are you sweet on my man's daughter, Bren?
No, I just see her here sometimes.
Her little sister's making her First Communion today.
Thanks. Come on, Ray.
Can I ask you something, Jimmy?
Shoot.
Why do you hate that kid so bad?
It's not hate. Doesn't that little mute fucker spook you out sometimes?
No, not Silent Ray, Brendan.
He's nice. Does sign language with his brother even though he doesn't have to.
He doesn't want him to feel alone.
But you look at Brendan like you're two steps away… from slicing off his nose and feeding it to him.
–No. Really?
–Straight up.
Here's Sal. About fucking time.
–Hey, there, bad boy.
–Sarge.
This should be the city's, but the park's state jurisdiction.
So if the body's in there, the case is ours.
How much evidence do you think they've destroyed?
Let's go find out.
Parker Hill vic walks into the ER on his own, steak knife sticking out of his collarbone.
He asks the nurse, “Hey, where they keep the Coke machine?”
–Did she tell him?
–Tom, what do we got on the car so far?
We found the registration in the glove box.
Owner is Katherine Markum.
–Oh, shit.
–You know her?
Maybe. Might be the daughter of a guy I know.
We found a wallet and a license in a backpack. She's 19.
–Oh, fuck, that's her.
–Is it a problem? You close with the guy?
When we were kids. Now it's just a “hello” around the neighborhood.
Nineteen.
Fuck, man.
He's in for a world of hurt.
Do not make her laugh.
Door was ajar when we found it, headlights on.
Blood on the driver's door, speaker, more blood on top of the steering wheel… around this bullet hole. Punched through the driver's seatback, shoulder level.
Okay, perp stood outside the car… girl slams him with the door, perp gets a round off… hits her in the shoulder, maybe the bicep.
She runs for it through the trampled weeds….
–What do you think?
–Yeah, I dig that.
Body of Christ.
–Body of Christ.
–Amen.
My God, Jimmy, our baby.
Body of Christ.
Body of Christ.
Body of Christ.
So I'm thinking she hid out here for a little bit.
The killer shows, she bolts.
She goes to the other side, she takes off running again.
Well, we better call in some divers while we're at it.
Body of Christ.
Body of Christ.
So you haven't seen him in a long time or what?
No, I haven't seen him since we were kids.
Once in a while, I run into him.
Sure looked cute, though, didn't he?
–Daddy, Daddy!
–Hey, darling. Good day, huh?
This dress itches.
Yeah, I'm not even wearing it, and it's itching me.
We are so proud of you.
Morning, honey.
Dave, there's nothing about it in the papers. I checked three times.
It was late, real late.
–Morning, Mikey.
–Morning, Dad.
–You up for hitting some Wiffle Balls?
–Yeah, come on, let's go.
Come on.
Put your coat on, Mike.
Thanks, Mom.
–Hey, Jimmy.
–What's up, Ed?
They got Sydney blocked off,
Crescent to Dunboy.
Boo Bear Durkin saw frogmen going into the Pen. Why you all decked out?
–Nadine's First Communion.
–What are you doing here?
Just curious, I guess.
That's my daughter's car.
That's my daughter's car.
The dog's sniffing something by the old bear cage.
–Want to take a walk over?
–Yeah.
–Trooper Devine?
–Yeah, go ahead.
We got a guy on Sydney says he's the father.
Oh, shit.
–Got a psychologist on the scene yet?
–En route.
Just keep him calm till the shrink gets here.
Asking for you. Says he knows you.
Not taking no for an answer.
And he's got some guys with him.
–What guys?
–Crazy-looking guys.
–The Savage brothers.
–Just a “hi” around the neighborhood, huh?
All right, I'm on my way.
–Hey, guys.
–That's our niece in there.
–Let us in.
–We're doing our job.
–Let us in.
–Fuck you!
The doughnut shop's that way!
–Nick, Val, ease up.
–Fucking dickhead.
–Enough.
–Nick.
Go to Drew Pigeon's house, talk to his daughter. Katie was with them last night.
–Kevin, let's go.
–And, guys?
These girls are friends, so don't be hard on them.
–But get answers.
–You got it.
Yeah, that's what I believe. Yeah.
Hey, Jimmy. Hey, man.
–Is she in there?
–All we're doing is looking.
–Quit blowing sunshine up his ass.
–That's my daughter's car.
–I understand.
–And it's got blood in it.
You got fucking dogs all over. Why do you got dogs looking for my daughter, Sean?
Because we're looking, Jimmy, okay?
Right now all she is is missing, okay?
–Trooper Devine?
–Yeah, say again.
Sergeant Powers says you need to get in here A SAP.
–Your location?
–The old bear cage. It's a fucking mess.
All right.
Make sure he doesn't get through.
You got those bolt cutters in your car?
I'll get us right through that Sydney Street fence.
Go.
There's a massive search underway for a woman missing in Buckingham Flats.
All we know now is there are signs of foul play… in a car found abandoned outside of Pen Park.
Now, police officers have moved in quickly and cordoned off the area… but even as we speak, a crowd of spectators has gathered.
We don't know more than that, but we will stay on the story.
Until later, this is Jim Smith reporting for WB 56, 10:00 news.
Ready? Bat back.
All the way back.
I never saw anything like that before.
What do we got?
Oh, Christ.
Is that her?
Yeah.
We'll have the father do a positive ID at the morgue.
Blood's from a split in the crown of her head.
She was beaten with a stick, but that didn't kill her.
She was shot a second time.
Looks like a.38.
What the fuck am I gonna tell him?
“Hey, Jimmy…
God said you owed another marker.
He came to collect.”
–Hey.
–Hold on!
–Grab him. Stop that guy.
–Hey, you!
–I'm fucking going in there!
–Take it easy!
–Get his arms.
–Hold him. Come on.
–Let me in, you motherfuckers!
–Take it easy.
–Let me in!
–Is she in there⁈
–Sean, is my daughter in there⁈
–Let me in! You motherfuckers!
Is my daughter in there⁈ Is she in there⁈
Is she in there⁈
Hey, take it easy! That's the father.
Is my daughter in there⁈ Motherfuckers!
Is that my daughter in there⁈
Look into my eyes! Is she in there⁈
–Get off me!
–Sean, is that my daughter in there⁈
Is that my daughter in there?
No! No!
Oh, no!
No, God!
Oh, God, no!
No one's said anything, right?
What do you mean?
You haven't seen her yet, right?
It might not be her, right?
Jimmy?
–Jimmy, please….
–Please what?
–Please—
–Please what, baby? Please what?
That's her.
That's Katie.
That's my daughter.
Fresh-brewed.
So we need to work a time line.
It's details, little things that make a case.
You know, things that you could forget about after a day or two.
Did you ever think about how one little choice could change a whole life?
I heard Hitler's mother wanted to abort him.
At the last minute, she changed her mind.
See what I mean?
What do you mean, Jimmy?
What if you or I had gotten into that car instead of Dave Boyle?
–What car?
–You're losing me here.
If I'd gotten into that car that day, my life would have been a different thing.
My first wife, Marita, Katie's mother… she was a beautiful woman.
Regal.
As a lot of Latin women are, and she knew it.
You had to have balls to go near her, and I did.
Eighteen years old, the two of us.
She was carrying Katie.
Now, here's the thing, Sean.
If I'd gotten into that car,
I'd be a basket case.
I never would have had the juice to go near her.
And Katie never would have been born.
And she never would have been murdered. You know?
–You ever see Dave around?
–He married my cousin Celeste.
What time did Katie get home from work yesterday?
Around 7:30.
Anything unusual, out of the way about her?
No. She sat with us, with me and the girls, while we ate.
She was having dinner with her friends.
–Eve Pigeon and Diane Cestra?
–Yeah.
She talked to Nadine about her Communion… and then she was on the phone in her room for a bit.
And then around 8, she left.
–Do you know who she talked to?
–No.
Do you mind if we have the phone company subpoenaed for records?
–No, go ahead.
–Good.
You say you spent most of the day Saturday with your daughter in the store, correct?
Yes and no. I was mostly in back.
Anything odd? A confrontation with a customer, anything?
No, she was herself, she was happy. She—
She what?
It's nothing.
Listen, the littlest thing could be something right now.
It's just that when she was little, right after her mother died…
I had just gotten out of prison, she couldn't be by herself.
Whether she was crying or not, it didn't matter… but she gave a look sometimes, like she was preparing to never see you again.
For a couple of seconds on Saturday, she looked at me that way.
–Okay.
–It was just a look.
It's information. We collect it, put it together, see what fits. Little things.
You were in prison?
–Oh, Jesus.
–Here we go.
–Whitey.
–I'm just asking.
Sixteen years ago, I did a two-year bit for robbery at Deer Island.
Is that gonna find my daughter's killer? Just asking.
Let's forget about that.
Let's get back to the point.
–Sorry.
–It's all right. It's all right.
Okay, Mr Markum.
–Okay.
–Okay. All right. So, Jimmy… outside of the look Katie gave you, was there anything else?
There was this kid.
What am I talking about?
That was this morning.
What? Remember, it's the little things.
This kid Brendan Harris come in the store, like he was expecting to see her.
–Barely knew each other.
–Could they have been dating?
–No.
–What makes you so sure?
Sean, are you gonna grill me?
A father knows.
Mrs Markum, was Katie seeing anyone?
No one right now, as far as we know.
–I mean, knew.
–I'll give you whatever you need tomorrow.
We got girls at home wanting to know where their sister is.
All right, there will be a trooper downstairs to take you home.
And if you think of anything… anything at all, give us a call.
He said you almost got into a car when you were kids?
Shit. Me, Jimmy and a kid named Boyle were playing in front of my house.
This car came up and took Dave away.
–Abduction?
–Yeah, guys pretending to be cops.
Convinced Dave to get in the car, kept him for four days before he escaped.
–They catch these guys?
–One died.
The other got busted, went the noose route in his cell.
Your pal Markum, the moment I laid eyes on him, I could tell he'd done time.
They never lose that tension, it settles in their shoulders.
He lost his daughter.
That's what's in his shoulders.
No, that's in his stomach.
The tension in his shoulders, that's prison.
Cause of death: the gunshot wound to the head, not the trauma from the beating.
–What else?
–Her and her friends were barhopping.
We're interviewing anyone who might have seen them.
One other thing, the backpack in her car… had pamphlets on Las Vegas and a list of Vegas hotels.
It doesn't sound like much.
What do you say, Devine?
We'll get the guy, sir.
That's right. All right, let's do it.
–That's the best you can come up with?
–It made him happy, didn't it?
This is Sean.
–Hello?
–Is it Lauren?
You're in Manhattan.
I can tell by the traffic sounds.
Is he with you?
Is that the baby?
Lauren, at least tell me her name.
Yeah, nice talking to you too.
Hey.
Would it surprise you?
Wouldn't be the first time.
Did you see that girl?
Did you see that—?
Did you see her?
–I heard a car hit something.
–Hit what? Another car?
–Oh, no, not loud like that.
–Like hitting the curb?
Yes, maybe.
Then it stalled, and someone said, “Hi.”
–Someone said, “Hi”?
–“Hi.”
Then there was a loud crack.
–Could it have been a gunshot?
–Yes, maybe.
–Did you look out your window, Mrs Prior?
–Oh, no.
I was in my dressing gown by then.
I don't look out the window in my dressing gown.
The voice you heard, was that a male or a female?
Female.
I think.
–It sounds like the girl knew the shooter.
–Yeah.
Sorry to trouble you.
–Jimmy.
–Theo.
How's my daughter?
How's Annabeth holding up?
–She's trying.
–Let's get these on ice.
You got a couple of coolers?
Right here's fine.
So how are you handling all this so far?
–It hasn't really sunk in, Theo.
–Yeah?
It's gonna hurt like hell when it does.
When my Janey died,
I was no good for six months… but my kids were all grown up. I had that luxury.
You, you got domestic responsibilities.
Domestic responsibilities?
Yeah, you gotta take care of my daughter and those girls. That's your first priority.
Oh, you figured that might have slipped my mind?
It just needed to be said, that's all.
You'll come through because you're a man.
Like I said to Annabeth, your wedding day.
I said, “You got yourself a real old-school man there.”
–Like they put her in a bag.
–What?
That's what Katie looked like when I saw her in the morgue.
Like they put her in a bag and then they beat the bag with pipes.
–Well—
–Janey died in her sleep, all due respect.
She went to sleep, she never woke up. Peaceful.
–You don't need to talk about Janey.
–My daughter was murdered.
They put a gun to her. As we stand here, she's on an autopsy slab… getting cut open by scalpels and chest spreaders… and you're talking to me about domestic fucking responsibility?
Good to see you, Theo.
Eve, just tell them what they want to know.
–Who was she dating?
–We already told the Savages.
–The Savage brothers?
–They were here yesterday.
Good, now try us out.
Who was she dating?
No one special.
You guys were having a goodbye dinner, right?
–What?
–She was leaving town, wasn't she?
–Going to Las Vegas?
–How do you know?
She closed her bank account, she had hotel phone numbers.
She wanted out of this dump.
She wanted to start a new life.
Well, a 19-year-old girl doesn't go to Las Vegas alone.
So who was she going with?
Come on, girls.
Who was she going with?
Brendan.
Excuse me?
–Brendan.
–Brendan Harris?
Brendan Harris, yeah.
You got an address?
Hey, Dave.
Hey, Jimmy.
Sorry, I came out for a smoke.
Go ahead, sit down. Sit down.
I haven't had a chance to talk to you all day.
How you doing?
How you doing?
What happened to your hand?
This?
I was helping a buddy move a couch.
I slammed it in the doorjamb.
Ways you can manage to hurt yourself, right?
It's good to see you.
Yeah?
How are our girls holding up?
They're doing okay, I guess.
That Celeste, she's a godsend.
You thank her for me, will you?
It's nice, isn't it? Just to sit out here.
Yeah.
I couldn't stand looking through the fridge to find room for all that food… we're gonna throw away in the next few days.
–Lot of waste, huh?
–Yeah.
I just can't let anything get fucked up in these next few days.
Because it's all anybody will remember about her.
One thing you could say about Katie, even when she was little… that girl was neat.
When I got out of the joint… you know, after Marita died…
I remember, I was more afraid of my little daughter… than I ever was of being in prison.
I loved her… most… because when we were sitting in that kitchen that night… it was like we were the last two people on Earth. You know, forgotten.
Unwanted.
And it's really starting to piss me off, Dave, because I can't cry for her.
My own little daughter, and I can't even cry for her.
Jimmy.
You're crying now.
Yeah, damn.
I just want to hug her one more time.
She was 19 fucking years old.
Do you want me to leave you alone?
No, just stay here for a minute, if that's cool.
Yeah, sure. Jimmy, it's cool.
When was the last time you saw Katie Markum?
–You don't think I'd hurt her do you?
–She isn't hurt. She's dead.
–I didn't kill her.
–Again, when's the last time you saw her?
About 8—
Saturday night, about 8:00.
About like 8, Brendan, or at 8?
It was about 8.
We had a couple slices at Hi-Fi, and she had to go meet Eve and Diane.
Yeah. Why doesn't Jimmy Markum like you?
I don't know.
But he told Katie he never wanted her to see me or any other Harris.
What? That thief thinks he's better than our family?
–He's not a thief.
–He's a thief! A scumbag burglar.
Daughter probably had the same bad gene.
You count yourself lucky, Bren.
So Katie had some brochures for Vegas.
We heard she was going there with you.
We were gonna leave Sunday.
We were gonna get married when we got there.
Well, that was the plan, right?
You were gonna leave me?
Without a word?
–Ma, I was gonna tell you.
–Just like your father, huh?
That's my brother, Ray, and his friend John.
–Hey, boys.
–Hey.
He don't speak.
Father couldn't shut up, but his son's a mute. Oh, yeah, life's fucking fair.
They're here about Katie. Why don't you go watch TV or something.
So where were you between 12:30 and 2 a.m on Sunday morning, Brendan?
I was asleep.
Can you confirm that, Mrs Harris?
I can confirm that he closed his door at 10:00.
He came down for breakfast at 9.
I can't confirm that he didn't open his window and go down the fire escape.
Okay, we're gonna ask you to take a polygraph. You think you'd be up for that?
I loved her so much.
I'm never gonna feel that again.
It doesn't happen twice.
Doesn't happen once most times.
Celeste.
–Sorry, Jimmy. You surprised me.
–What are you still doing here?
I don't know.
I don't know, I just….
Did Annabeth get to sleep?
Yeah, I convinced her to take a pill.
–Could I get one of those?
–Yeah.
One for the road and then home.
Jimmy, I can stay over if you want.
Sit up with Annabeth.
You've done enough.
To you and Dave for being here for this.
Okay, Jimmy. I'll be back.
I'll be by first thing tomorrow.
See you first thing.
Good night.
–Good night.
–Yeah, good night.
Hello?
Christ. Lauren, say something.
“Okay. Hey, Sean, how was your day?”
Oh, me? I'm tired of wishing things made sense.
I'm tired of caring about some dead girl, and there's just gonna be another one after her.
Sending killers to jail is sending them where they've been heading all their lives.
The dead are still dead.
Jesus, I… can't do this tonight.
I just….
I can't do it.
Bye, baby.
Because… sometimes the man wasn't a man at all.
He was the boy.
The boy who escaped from wolves.
An animal of the dusk.
Invisible.
Silent.
Living in a world… the others never saw.
World of fireflies.
Unseen except as a flare in the corner of your eye.
Vanished by the time you turn your head toward it.
I just gotta get my head right.
Catch a nice, long sleep.
And the boy will go back to his forest.
Back to his fireflies.
Is he asleep?
How's Jimmy and everybody?
Okay.
It's weird.
Took something like this for me and him to become friends again.
Dave? Dave.
There's still nothing in the paper.
About what?
About what?
I don't know, honey. Maybe I didn't hurt him as bad as I thought.
He's a mugger. He's not going to the hospital.
Yeah.
Right.
Anyhow, it doesn't matter, does it?
I mean, Katie Markum is dead.
That seems more important right now.
I know in my soul I contributed to your death.
But I don't know how.
Brendan Harris aced his polygraph.
Good. I didn't like him for it, nor want him for it.
Yeah. Poor fucking kid.
Ballistics will be back in a while.
Meantime, we got a list of bar patrons.
All people who, I'm certain, are dying to cooperate.
Considering the crime, maybe.
Dave Boyle?
Hey, is that the guy you were friends with as a kid? The car guy?
Could be.
He's a guy to talk to. He knows you.
He won't treat us like cops.
–Clam up for no reason, huh?
–We'll see.
Hey, Boyle!
–What's it been, seven, eight years?
–Yeah.
Yeah. How you doing?
This is my son, Michael.
Hey, Michael. How you doing?
My name's Sean.
I'm an old buddy of your dad's. Hi.
–So you still with the staties?
–Homicide. This is my partner.
–Sergeant Powers. How are you?
–So you got a minute?
–We'd love to ask some quick questions.
–I was just gonna walk Michael to school.
–I can be back in a few minutes.
–Tell you what, we'll walk with you, okay?
Sure.
So you look good.
–I hear rents are rising.
–Yeah, the yuppies are coming.
They're cutting my dad's old house up into condos.
We walked by there the other day.
Must be something we could do to stop them.
A friend of mine says the other day, he says:
“Neighborhood needs a fucking crime wave.
Get property values where they belong.”
Young girls keep getting murdered up in Pen
Park, Mr Boyle, you might get your wish.
Dave. Call me Dave.
You said the F-word, Dad.
Yeah, I know. Walk on up ahead, Michael.
Us guys need to talk. Go on.
–So, what's up, Sean?
–Yeah, you heard about Katie Markum?
Yeah, I was at Jimmy's yesterday.
Celeste is there now.
–Who's Celeste?
–My wife.
–How's Jimmy doing?
–It's hard to tell. You know him.
–Yeah, so the reason we came by—
–Listen, I saw her.
Katie. I don't know if you know that.
At McGill's, the night she died.
That's what we wanted to talk about.
They were at a couple of bars that night.
Your name turned up for McGill's.
They put on quite a show dancing on the bar.
–Pretty drunk, huh?
–But it was harmless.
They weren't stripping or nothing.
They were just 19.
What time did they leave?
I left at 1. They must've left
15 minutes before me.
–So we'll say 12:45?
–Sounds about right.
You see anything unusual or anyone—?
Michael.
–Like what?
–I don't know.
A guy watching the girls?
A guy with hate in his eyes?
A woman-hater?
No. No, if they hadn't danced on the bar, it would've been business as usual.
–See you later, Dad.
–You got your milk money?
Fuck, I hated school.
What?
Yeah, me too, Sean.
Just one more thing, Mr Boyle.
Where did you go after you left McGill's?
–Home.
–Home by 1:15, would you say?
–Roughly. Sure.
–All right.
Yeah, well, thanks a lot, Dave.
We'll grab a beer sometime?
–Yeah, I'd like that, Sean.
–All right.
What?
What happened to him in that car?
Can you believe this?
Man, it's the same as Dunkin' Donuts.
It costs 15 times the price.
You know, you take away love, money or hate as motives… you're not left with a whole lot.
Well, if this Markum thing's random,
I mean, shit.
Yeah, tell me about it. But the old lady,
Prior, she doesn't hear a scream.
Hears a gunshot, before that a “hi”… which tells me the girl is either friendly or she knew him.
She turns into the curb, not too fast or she hops it. Foot's off the clutch. She stalls.
–She says, “Hi.” He shoots her.
–She slams the door into him, takes off.
What makes her swerve without hitting the brakes?
–I don't know. Something in the street.
–Maybe.
This Markum girl couldn't have weighed more than what, 110?
–She hit hard enough to get a jump on him?
–Maybe he's knocked back on his heels.
Your pal Dave strikes me as a guy permanently back on his heels.
Wait a second, how did we get to
Dave Boyle all of a sudden?
–We just got to him.
–He's a guy who was in the bar.
The last place, Seany, the last place she was at.
The guy is wrong. You saw his hand.
Yeah, I saw his hand. You seriously want to take a look at Dave Boyle?
Just a little one.
I'd recommend two sets of visiting hours, from 3 to 5, and 7 to 9.
–Sure.
–Good.
–Have you thought about flowers?
–I'll call Knopfler's this afternoon.
Good.
And the notice?
Notice?
Yes, the obituary. We can take care of it if you give us her basic information.
Or if you prefer donations in lieu of flowers?
Where's my daughter?
Downstairs, in the basement.
I wanna see her.
I'm gonna find him, Katie.
I'm gonna find him before the police do.
I'm gonna find the man, and I'm gonna kill him.
Did you say something, Mr Markum?
The notice.
It should read: “Katherine Markum… beloved daughter of James and Marita, deceased… stepdaughter of Annabeth, sister to—”
“Sister to Sara and Nadine.”
–You guys again?
–Yeah. We're like two bad pennies.
–You dropping in on Jimmy?
–Yeah.
Do you have some kind of, what, break in the case?
No, just paying our respects.
Where you off to?
Annabeth got a craving for cigarettes. I'm gonna go get some. See you in a minute.
By the way, Mr Boyle, what happened to your hand there?
Garbage disposal. It jammed, I stuck my hand in, it started again.
–Stupid.
–Painful.
Garbage disposal. Bullshit.
Yeah. Well, it doesn't mean he killed anybody either. Come on.
–Heard you could use one.
–Thanks.
–I quit 10 years ago, you believe this?
–Whatever you need right now.
Come on in, I'll get Jimmy.
I got a couple errands I gotta run.
I'll be back in an hour.
You don't have to come back, Celeste.
I'll be fine.
–Sure?
–Celeste Boyle?
Yeah.
I'm Sean Devine, an old friend of Dave's.
This is Whitey Powers.
–Mrs Boyle.
–Nice to meet you.
Look, I gotta go.
Oh, damn it.
I left my report pad in the cruiser.
–You better go get it.
–Yeah.
Come on.
Hey, Celeste, could I ask you a quick question?
–Me?
–What time did Dave get home on Saturday?
–What?
–It's a little thing.
We're running a time line on everything involving Katie. I'm sure…
Dave told you he saw her at McGill's.
You think Dave killed Katie?
Oh, no. God. I didn't say that.
Why would I even think that?
–I don't know.
–No, no. It's just that we could figure out… what time she was on the road if we knew what time Dave got home.
See, it's 5 minutes from your place to McGill's… and Katie left 15 minutes before Dave did. You see what I mean.
I was asleep.
Saturday night, when Dave came in,
I was asleep.
Okay. Well, thanks.
Bullshit.
No, he was dating Katie, Jim.
They were gonna elope to Vegas.
We found tickets under their names.
Brendan Harris confirmed it.
Remember what you said?
How she looked at you on Saturday like she was preparing to never see you again?
–Did Brendan Harris kill my daughter?
–No.
You're 100 percent sure?
Passed his poly with flying colors, plus it seemed to me like he really loved her.
Jimmy, I'm just curious, man.
Why are you so dead set against that kid?
He said Katie told him you'd disowned her if she ever dated a Harris.
I knew his father. They called him
“Just Ray” Harris.
Why is that?
There were so many Rays in the neighborhood.
You had “Crazy Ray” Bucheck,
“Psycho Ray” Dorian.
The cool names were taken, so he got stuck with “Just Ray.”
We never got along.
I flat out didn't like him.
And he cut out on his wife when she was pregnant with that little mute of hers.
I don't know.
I just figure the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
I didn't want Brendan or any other Harris dating Katie or any other daughter of mine.
I can't believe we're talking about
Just Ray Harris.
How about this? We've interviewed witnesses… canvassed people who were in the bar.
We've run into more than a few of them who were questioned… before us by one or more of the Savage brothers.
–So?
–So the Savages are not policemen, Jim.
–Some people don't talk to policemen, Sean.
–With all due respect… and just so we're clear, this is our case.
–How long?
–How long what?
How long before you catch my daughter's killer?
You bargaining with us?
Bargaining?
You giving us a deadline?
We'll speak for Katie, Mr Markum.
If that's okay with you.
Just find my daughter's killer, sergeant.
I'm not standing in your way.
The last thing we need is Markum and the Savages putting the fear of God… into the neighborhood.
–We grew up terrified of them.
Eleven months apart, like their mother ran a loose-cannon factory.
Fucking knuckleheads.
Ballistics are in on the Markum murder.
–Yeah, you got a match?
–You're gonna love it.
It's a perfect match.
Gun was a.38 Smith.
Part of a lot stolen from a gun dealer in New Hampshire in 1982.
The same gun that killed Katherine Markum was used in a liquor-store holdup in 1984.
–In Buckingham.
–The Flats?
Rome Basin. Place called Looney Liquors.
I pulled the file.
It was a two-man job.
They fired a warning shot into a wall.
–That's where the bullet got pulled.
–Nice work.
Thought you'd like that.
It's okay, Ray.
Don't worry about it.
Ma said that?
That I'm better off?
I loved her! You know what that's like?
Huh?
I'm sorry.
No, you're wrong.
I won't ever feel that again.
Right there. Went in through a bottle of Jack and stuck in the wall right there.
–Scary, huh?
–Scarier than a glass of milk, right?
So take me through it.
These two guys come in….
In rubber masks.
They came in through here.
That's the storeroom.
There's a door back there that leads to a loading dock.
I always keep that door locked.
So they must have had a key.
A key? So, what you're saying is that it was an inside job?
It had to be. One of them, at least, worked for me at some point.
The only reason they fired that goddamn warning shot was they must have known…
I kept this under the counter.
–And you told the police that at the time.
–Yeah.
Sure, they went through my employment records.
Questioned everybody who used to work for me.
–Never made an arrest.
–Still have a copy of those records?
Yeah, it's in a box in the office there.
But I know who did it.
Oh, yeah?
This guy I fired a couple of weeks before.
Son of a bitch came in here a few days after the robbery.
He had this fucking goddamn grin on his face.
And I just knew.
Go tell a grin to a jury, right?
You remember his name?
Do I look senile to you?
–No, sir.
–Name… was Ray Harris.
We used to call him “Just Ray.”
You say they used the same gun for another crime?
–That's correct, sir.
–Thanks for your help, Mr Looney.
Where you been?
Out.
What you watching?
Some vampire movie.
Guy just got his head torn off.
Where'd you go, Celeste?
I was sitting in my car… down by the channel.
You know… thinking about things.
–What'd you think about?
–Oh, you know….
No, actually, I don't know.
Things. You know, the day.
About Katie being dead.
And poor Annabeth and Jimmy, you know… those things.
Those things.
Know what I was thinking about, huh?
Vampires.
What about them?
They're undead… but I think maybe there's something beautiful about it.
Maybe one day you wake up and you forget what it's like… to be human.
Maybe then it's okay.
What the fuck you talking about, Dave?
Vampires, sweetie. Werewolves.
You're not making any sense.
You think I killed Katie?
–Celeste.
–What—?
–Is that the sense we're making these days?
–Where'd you come up with that?
You've barely looked at me since you found out Katie was dead.
In fact, you seem repulsed by me.
–Dave!
–What?
I don't think anything.
I'm confused, okay?
Even your friend Sean asked about—
He's not my friend, if you didn't know.
He asked me about you.
What time you came home.
–What'd you tell him?
–I said I was asleep.
–That's good thinking, baby.
–Jesus Christ, Dave!
–Why don't you tell them about the mugger?
–The mugger?
The mugger! I see how your mind's working. I do.
I come home with blood on me the same night Katie's murdered.
I must have killed her, right?
Fuck!
Henry….
What? Henry?
Henry and George.
I never told anyone that before.
Those were their names.
Isn't that fucking hilarious?
At least that's what they called themselves, but… they were wolves, and Dave… was the boy who escaped from wolves.
What are you talking about, Dave?
I'm talking Henry and George.
They took me on a four-day ride.
They buried me in this ratty old cellar with a sleeping bag.
And, man, Celeste… did they have their fun.
And no one came to help old Dave then.
Dave had to pretend to be somebody else.
You mean, all those years ago… when you were a little boy?
Dave….
Dave's dead.
I don't know who came out of that cellar, but it sure as shit wasn't Dave!
You see, honey—
Fuck!
It's like vampires.
Once it's in you… it stays.
What stays?
Did you know there were child prostitutes in Rome Basin?
What?
Fuck!
I can't trust my mind anymore, Celeste.
I'm warning you…
I can't trust my mind.
I gotta go out, try to get my head around it.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
–The gun sends us in a different direction.
–I don't see it that way.
What does Just Ray's gun have to do with Dave?
These things get passed around.
Just Ray may have blown town, but his gun never did.
I say we talk with Brendan Harris in the morning.
And I say Dave Boyle. The hand story.
The wife, she's definitely scared.
They're hiding something, but Dave Boyle's as much a killer as Brendan Harris.
Boyle fits the profile, a fucking T.
Mid-30s, white, marginally employed… sexually abused as a kid.
On paper, this guy should be in jail already.
Katie Markum was not sexually abused, see?
In that equation, sexual emission is part of the deal.
You were friends when you were kids.
This makes you a fucking liability.
He's not my friend.
Turns out you're right, I'll have my cuffs off my hip faster than yours.
Hey, Jimmy.
You're out late.
Yeah, you too.
It's cold, huh?
Yeah, I guess.
You know, I….
I been sitting out here… over the last few years… waiting on Katie to get back from someplace.
About midnight, I'd say to Annabeth,
“I'm gonna go sit on the porch for a while.”
Weird thing is… it seemed to bring her back.
I saw her, you know.
Saw who?
Katie. I was at McGill's Saturday night.
–You saw Katie Saturday night?
–Never got around to telling you.
Did you talk to her?
Just nodded hello at one point.
Next time I looked up, she was gone.
But…
Jimmy… she looked… happy.
I got more walking to do.
Good night.
–You stole his car.
–His car was officially towed.
–From the front of his house.
–No! It was abandoned in Rome Basin… adjacent to the parkway.
Lucky for us, the parkway's state jurisdiction. Some kids jacked the car… they took it for a joy ride….
–What? Why'd you do it?
After I left you last night, I decided to talk to Boyle myself, put some fear into him.
I get to his house, I decide to look in his car, see what he's got. I find blood.
–Blood?
–Front seat of Dave's car. B-negative.
–How much?
–A bit. Found more in the trunk. A lot more.
Type O, same type as Katie Markum.
Wait, Katie Markum never got in anybody's trunk.
She was chased through the park where she died.
–It's enough to ask questions.
–Your search is gonna get tossed out.
No, found and abandoned in state jurisdiction, for insurance purposes.
–In the best interest of the owner.
–Get a physical search, file the report.
Bingo.
You wanna talk to him, or should I send him home?
–Dave's here?
–I've had him in the box for an hour.
Sent two of my biggest, ugliest troopers to pick him up.
Come on, Mr Boyle!
We know you didn't get that swollen hand sticking it in the garbage disposal.
–Oh, yeah? How do you know that?
–Why's your wife afraid of you?
She know what really happened to your hand?
How about a Sprite or something?
How about you tell us what really happened
Saturday night, Mr Boyle?
You lied.
That's your opinion, which you're entitled to.
–Hey, you think this is funny?
–No, I don't. I'm tired, I'm hung-over.
Not only was my car stolen last night, but now you won't release it to me.
Okay.
All right.
Tell us, Mr Boyle, how did you get the blood in your car?
–What blood?
–Let's start with the front seat.
What are you looking at him for?
Hey, you think I could get that Sprite, Sean?
Sure.
Oh, I get it.
You're the good cop.
How about a meatball sub while you're at it?
I ain't your bitch, Dave.
Looks like you'll have to wait.
Yeah, but you're someone's bitch, aren't you, Sean?
The blood on your front seat, Dave.
Answer the sergeant.
We got a chainlink fence in our back yard.
Me and my kid play Wiffle Ball every afternoon after school.
He's getting good, so most of the balls are on the other side of the fence.
So I climb it.
Except I slip… slice myself where the links curl in, right here.
Bled like hell.
Ten minutes later,
I gotta pick up Michael at school.
Probably was still bleeding when I got in the front seat.
What blood type are you?
B-negative.
Yeah? That's the match we got.
–Well, there you go.
–Not quite.
Blood in the trunk of the car wasn't B-negative.
I don't know anything about any blood in the trunk.
No idea how half a pint of blood got in the trunk?
–None.
–This is not the way you wanna go, Dave.
How will that look in court?
You not knowing how someone else's blood got in the trunk of your car?
Gonna look fine, I suppose.
You filed the report.
What report?
The stolen-car report.
The car wasn't in my possession last night.
So whatever the thieves used it for, you should find out… because it sounds like they were up to no good.
Things looking any better on the Sprite, Sean?
Well, you just got too fucking smart.
The car is inadmissible.
Anything there, his lawyers say was put by thieves.
–I can break him.
–He just kicked our asses!
You still think Dave wouldn't hurt a fly—
–Is that the point? No.
–What is the point?
We can break this open on the gun.
It's the gun.
Okay. Maybe.
So, what do we do with Dave?
Fuck it. Kick him loose.
Maybe a Celtic cross.
That's always a popular choice.
Or this lovely red marble here.
Or a figural.
That one.
Very good. Nice and simple.
Hey, Jimmy!
Annabeth said you were here.
We been asking around, like you said to.
–Yeah?
–Yeah.
Jimmy, this ain't about the two-year bit you did for me.
And it ain't about me missing your brains running things.
Katie was my niece. Not by birth, but she was part of our family, we loved her.
I don't question you, Val.
What's up?
Cops are all over this. Doing their job for once. Bars, street trade, everything.
Every hooker we talked to, bartender, already been questioned.
–The fucking law has descended, Jimmy.
–What about Just Ray's kid?
Quiet as a mouse.
Kid's no trouble to anyone.
I talked to Diane and Eve.
They said he loved her.
Jimmy, they said that she loved him.
–Want us to take a run at him?
–No.
Hold off for now.
Anything else?
What?
Val, you wanna spit something, spit it.
Tell him.
Sean Devine and his partner went by and saw Dave Boyle.
Dave was at McGill's. Probably questioning him like everybody else.
I heard something else this morning too.
–Two staties came by in uniform.
–Maybe they forgot to ask him something.
No. When they left, they took him with them.
They put him in the back seat, if you know what I mean.
“Raymond Matthew Harris, born 9-6, 1957.
First child, Brendan Seamus, born 1983.”
Same year that Just Ray is indicted in a scam to embezzle subway tokens.
Charges are dropped, and he's fired.
Does odd jobs after that, including clerking at Looney Liquors.
Questioned in that robbery. Questioned in another, same year, Blanchard Liquors… released on lack of evidence again.
–Beginning to become known, though.
–He's getting popular.
“A known associate, one Edmund Reese, fingers Raymond… in the 1985 heist of a rare comic-book collection.”
Comic books? You go, Ray.
Hey, excuse me,
$150,000 worth of comic books.
Oh, excuse me.
“Raymond returned said literature unharmed.” Does a year solid inside.
Comes out with a chemical-dependency problem.
Gets honest work to support the habit, though?
Evidently not.
Picked up in a joint
MCU-FBl sting operation… trafficking stolen goods across state lines. Stole a truckload of cigarettes.
–The boy's got style.
–Got a boatload of grief too.
Stole the truck in Rhode Island, drove it into Massachusetts.
–Hence, the federal interstate rap.
–Hence, they got him by the balls, but… he does no time.
–He rolled on someone.
–Looks that way. After that, he's clean.
–August 1989, he disappears.
–One, he's dead, two, in Witness Protection.
Three, he goes deep underground, then pops back up… to murder his son's 19-year-old girlfriend?
We got nothing.
A prime suspect in a robbery 18 years ago, during which the murder weapon was used.
The guy's son dated the victim.
I say we got a lot.
Anything about Just Ray's known associates?
Let's take a look.
“Known criminal associates:
Reginald “Dukie” Neil, Kevin
“Whackjob” Sirraci, Nicholas Savage…
Anthony Waxman.”
And one James Markum.
And the hits just keep on coming.
–You looking for me?
–I'm Sean Devine. This is Whitey Powers.
I already gotta get back.
So you worked a task force with Major Crimes in the '80s?
–Bunch of them.
–You took down a smalltimer, Ray Harris.
He stole a truckload of cigarettes from a rest stop in Cranston, Rhode Island.
Trucker went to take a piss,
Harris guy jacks the truck.
–Think we pulled him over in New Bedford.
–But Harris walked.
He didn't walk, he rolled.
Boston Police Anti-Gang Unit stepped in for info on another case. He rolled.
On who?
What the fuck was the name?
Him and three other guys knocked over the MBTA counting room, 60 grand.
Jimmy Markum.
Kid was 19, 20. Slick as hell, man.
Ran a crew, never got arrested.
So did Harris ever testify in open court?
Never went. Markum dummied up on the guys he was working with…
DA was afraid he wouldn't be able to convict. So he cut a deal.
Two years inside, couple more suspended.
So Jimmy Markum never knew that Ray Harris ratted him out?
Ray Harris disappeared about two months… after Markum rotated back into the free world.
What's that tell you?
Hey, Jimmy. Hey, Val.
–Hey, coz, how you doing?
–I'm good.
Okay. Hey.
–Hey, Celeste.
–Hey, Jimmy. Hey.
–Can I talk to you for a sec?
–I'll catch up with you in a minute.
Step into my office.
Beautiful day, huh?
Whatever it is, Celeste, it's okay.
I took Michael last night… and I went to a motel.
Okay.
I don't know, Jim.
I might have left Dave for good.
You left Dave?
Yeah.
Well… he's been acting kind of nuts lately.
I'm almost afraid of him.
Do you know something?
I know he was taken in by the cops this morning.
He saw Katie the night she was murdered.
Didn't tell me… till after the cops questioned him.
I know he's got a hand that looks like it's been punching a fucking wall.
Is there anything else I should know?
Come here.
Okay.
At 3 in the morning… on Sunday, Dave came back to the apartment covered in someone else's blood.
What did he say happened?
That he was mugged.
That he….
He bashed the mugger's head in the street.
That….
That he might have killed him.
But there was nothing in the paper.
–Celeste?
–Yeah?
–Celeste?
–Yeah?
Celeste?
Do you think Dave killed my Katie?
Okay. All right.
Okay.
Oh, God.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
–Tell me about your father, Brendan.
–What?
Your father, Ray Sr.
You remember him.
–I was 6 when he left us.
–So you don't remember the guy?
I remember little things.
He smelled like Schlitz and Dentyne.
He….
He what?
He carried a lot of change in his pocket.
It jingled when he walked.
You could always hear him coming home.
And if I guessed how much he had, even if I was close, he'd give it to me.
You remember your father having a gun?
No.
Well, you seem awfully sure for somebody who was 6 when he left.
What's up?
–What's that?
–This is what you asked for.
CSS reports, ballistics, fingerprint analysis, the 911 tape. Bunch of stuff.
All right, thanks.
We were talking about your father's gun.
–I told you, my father didn't have a gun.
–Oh, well, I guess we were misinformed.
–When was the last time you talked to him?
–Never.
Never?
He went out for a drink and never came back.
But your mother never filed a missing person's report. Why not?
Because he's not missing.
–He sends money every month.
–Sends money?
Five hundred bucks every month.
Like clockwork.
–From where?
–Postmark says Brooklyn.
–How do you know it's him?
–Who else would it be?
Who else would send it?
My ma says that's the way he was.
Do something shitty, then he'd try to make up for it.
Why do you keep asking me if my father had a gun?
You know why, kid.
No, I don't.
Gun that killed your girlfriend… was the same gun your father used in a robbery 18 years ago.
So… you wanna tell me about it?
My father didn't have a gun.
You are fucking lying!
Can I go now?
Or are you gonna charge me with Katie's murder?
Hey! Dandy Dave Boyle, how's it hanging?
Hey, Val.
Nick. How you guys holding up?
–All right.
–It's fucked up.
Katie.
A fucking tragedy.
Yeah.
We're gonna get a couple of beers and a bite to eat.
Yeah?
Yeah. What do you say, man?
How about a boys' night out in the middle of the day?
–I gotta get home after a while.
–Don't we all? Hop in.
–Come on, get in.
–All right.
Well, the first round's on me.
Now you're talking.
–I think the kid is lying about the gun.
–Absolutely. I told you three times already.
–What about the father?
–I don't know. Maybe Just Ray is still alive.
Eighty grand. I mean… who else is gonna send that kind of money if not the father?
Listen, go home, have a drink.
–Let it go for a while.
–Yeah.
Hey, anything good on the 911?
–I thought you listened to it.
–I thought you listened to it.
911, police services.
What's the nature of your emergency?
There's, like, this car with blood in it, and the door's open.
–What's the location of the car?
–Sydney Street.
It's in the Flats by Pen Park.
Me and my friend, we just found it.
–Son, what's your name?
–He wants to know her name.
–Your name, what's your name?
–We're so fucking out of here.
Good luck, man.
That about cracks the case, don't it?
Let's get a burger or something.
Her.
–What?
–The kid on the tape.
–Son, what's your name?
–He wants to know her name.
–He said, “Her name.”
–She's a dead girl, you refer to her as a she.
How does the kid know?
Girl's dead in the park.
How does he know the blood in the car came from a woman?
Play it again.
This one time, we're going to take down this stamp collector.
–Tie him up, rob him, we're out.
–Here.
It was me, Nicky and this kid
Carson Leverett.
Fucking Carson.
I swear, this kid couldn't tie his own fucking shoe if you didn't show him.
We all wear suits because we want to fit in.
We're in the elevator, it stops, this old lady gets on. She starts fucking screaming!
Now Val turns to me, but I'm looking at Carson.
I'm thinking, “What the fuck?”
Because that fucking bonehead's still got his Ronald Reagan mask on!
Fucking smiley mask!
Idiot!
And you guys didn't notice till then?
Shit like that happened all the time on jobs.
That's why Jimmy was so missed.
He saw shit happen before it even went down.
Why do you think he went straight?
One word, pure and simple. Katie.
What about you guys?
What? Us? Going straight?
That's pretty fucking funny!
We're like bats, we like the night too much.
Days are just good for sleeping through.
Want another shot?
–You know, I should slow down till we eat.
–Come on, don't go fucking pussy on us!
Come on, get up.
Live a little, huh?
Slide over, Dave.
–Dave.
–All right, Val! Now you're talking.
–How you doing?
–I'm a little drunk.
To our children.
–I always liked this bar.
–Yeah.
Yeah, nobody bothers you.
The way it should be, nobody to bother you in this life.
No one fucking with you or your loved ones. Right, Dave?
–Absolutely.
–Absolutely.
This guy's a hoot.
He can really get you going.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, my man Dave.
Kevin, will you bring us a bottle?
–Drink up, Dave.
–Come on.
Thanks, Kevin.
Remember we took Ray Harris here that time?
Everybody called this guy “Just Ray,” but Val here called him “Ray Jingles.”
This guy walked around with 10 bucks in change… in case he had to make a call to Iraq or something.
Are you all right, Dave? Dave?
–You all right?
–Shit. I'm gonna be sick.
Come on. Come on, now.
Dave, use the back door. Huey don't like cleaning it off the toilet rims.
Hey, Ray.
You guys come to make sure
I didn't fall in?
Come here a second.
Sit down.
Let me tell you about Ray Harris.
He was a buddy of mine.
He used to visit me in prison.
He checked in on Marita and Katie, my mother, if they needed anything.
He's also the one who put me in.
He ratted me out.
–That's terrible.
–My wife had cancer at the time.
–I remember.
–Ray robbed me of being with her… when she was dying.
The death part you do alone, but I could have helped her with the dying.
Why are you telling me this?
I knelt Ray down over there and
I shot him twice, in his throat and chest.
–We were both crying when I did it.
–Jimmy—
He was begging.
You know, pregnant wife, little Brendan.
He said he knew me.
He said I was a good man.
What do you think, Dave?
You think I'm a good man?
Who do you hate?
Come on, who?
No one.
–What is it you think I did?
–As I was holding him under the water…
I could feel God watching me, shaking his head. Not angry… but like if a puppy shit on a rug.
Who do you love?
You love me.
What about Ma?
You love me so much,
I wanna hear you say it.
–You think I killed Katie, don't you?
–Don't talk, Dave. Don't talk.
No, I killed someone, but I didn't kill Katie.
This is the mugger story.
He wasn't a mugger, a child molester.
He was having sex with this kid in his car.
He was a fucking wolf!
He was a vampire!
Get out of here.
Run!
Dave, run!
–You killed a child molester.
–Yeah. Well, me and the boy.
–The molested boy helped you.
–Oh, no. No—
–You just said you and the boy!
–No, forget that!
–My head gets fucked up sometimes.
–Your wife thinks you killed my daughter.
Rather have her think that than you killed a child molester?
People don't care if a child molester dies.
Why not tell the truth?
I don't know. Maybe I thought
I was turning into him.
I didn't kill Katie.
I don't remember hearing anything about any guy's body being found.
–I put him in the trunk of my car.
–Letting this piece of shit explain himself?
–Fuck him. Fuck him! Do him!
–I didn't kill her!
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
Everybody shut up!
This is my daughter I'm talking about!
Shut up!
–Fuck!
–Shut up!
Nineteen years old.
–I didn't kill Katie!
–Nineteen years old!
–Look at me, Jimmy!
–I'm looking at you, Dave.
I'm looking at you.
Why'd you do it?
Me and my son. Me and Celeste. There's so many things we gotta make right.
Make it right now. Start now.
Admit what you did.
No more lies, no more secrets.
I wanna go home to Celeste.
I wanna feel Celeste.
Right after you do your time. I did mine, you do yours. Admit what you did.
–The boy….
–One more time about the boy… and I will open you the fuck up.
I thought I was finished with all this.
I mean, killing people and dumping them in the river.
You admit what you did, Dave, and I'm gonna let you live.
Just say it out loud, and I'll let you breathe.
Admit what you did, and I will give you your life.
Admit what you did, Dave.
Admit what you did.
Admit what you did.
Admit what you did.
I know you can speak.
So say it. Say you love me.
Don't look at him, look at me.
Now, you say it. You say you love me.
–He never does anything without you!
–No, let me go! Stop!
I'm coming back!
You love me so much, you gotta kill my fucking girlfriend, huh?
Speak, you fucking freak, or I will fucking kill you!
Say her name. Say it.
Say it! Katie!
Say it or you die!
Kid, you want to point that toward the floor, okay?
That's a Sig, right?
Don't you want to draw it on me?
No, I don't want to hurt a kid.
Plus, it looks like somebody else beat me to it.
Brendan, man, he fucking punched me.
–He broke my nose.
–We'll arrest him.
–Haul his ass to jail if you like.
–I don't want him arrested.
I want him fucking dead!
Motherfucker.
Motherfucker.
Admit what you did, Dave… and I'll let you live.
Just say it out loud, and I'll let you breathe.
You'll go to prison… but I'll give you your life.
Admit it, Dave.
Admit what you did. Admit it.
Yeah.
Yeah, I did it.
Why?
Why?
That night in McGill's… she reminded me of a dream I had.
What dream?
A dream of youth.
I don't remember having one.
So it was the dream?
The dream, yeah.
You'd know what I mean if you'd got in that car instead of me.
But I didn't get in that car, Dave.
Hang on. Come here. You did.
We bury our sins here, Dave.
We wash them clean.
–Look, his fucking lips are still moving.
–I got eyes, Val.
I wasn't ready.
It's like I said, Dave.
This part, you do alone.
Tough night?
Yeah, me too.
Saw a bullet with my name on it.
We got them, Jim.
Got who?
Katie's killers. Got them cold.
Killers, plural.
Yeah, kids, actually. Ray Harris' son
Ray Jr and another kid, John O'Shea.
They just confessed a couple hours ago.
No doubt?
None.
Why?
They don't know.
They were playing with a gun, saw a car coming… one of the kids lies down in the street, car swerves, clutch kicks out. Katie.
O'Shea says they just meant to scare her and the gun went off.
But she hit him with her door, ran… and they chased her so she wouldn't tell anyone.
And the beating they gave her?
Ray Jr had a hockey stick.
All right. Go easy.
Take a breath.
Look at me.
Look at me, Jimmy.
I got a call from Celeste Boyle.
She was hysterical. Says Dave's missing, says you might know where he is.
We need to talk to him.
Boston PD found the body of a guy in the woods behind McGill's.
A body? The body of a guy?
Yeah, a pedophile with three priors.
They want to talk to Dave about it.
So, Jimmy… when was the last time you saw Dave?
The last time I saw Dave.
Yeah. Dave Boyle.
–Dave Boyle.
–Yeah, Jimmy. Dave Boyle.
That was 25 years ago, going up this street in the back of that car.
Jimmy, what did you do?
Thanks for finding my daughter's killers, Sean.
If only you'd been a little faster.
Are you gonna send Celeste Boyle
500 a month too?
Sometimes I think….
I think all three of us got in that car.
And all of this is just a dream, you know?
A dream, sure.
In reality… we're still 11-year-old boys locked in a cellar… imagining what our lives would have been if we'd escaped.
Maybe you're right.
Who the fuck knows?
Yeah, this is Sean.
I'm sorry. I need you to know that.
I pushed you away.
I'm sorry too.
Things have been so messed up.
Loving you, hating you.
Come home?
You change the locks or anything?
No.
No, everything is just the way you left it.
–Nora.
–What's that?
Nora. That's our daughter's name, Sean.
Nora, huh?
Well, I like that. Nora.
I killed Dave.
I killed him, and I threw him in the Mystic.
But I killed the wrong man.
That's what I've done.
And I can't undo it.
Jimmy.
I wanna feel your heart.
Last night… when I put the girls to bed,
I told them how big your heart was.
–I told them how much you loved Katie…
–Annabeth. because you created her.
And sometimes, your love for her was so big… felt like your heart was gonna explode—
–Please stop.
I told them their daddy loved them that much too.
That he had four hearts, and they were all filled up… and aching with a love that meant we would never have to worry.
And that their daddy would do whatever he had to for those he loved.
And that is never wrong.
That can never be wrong, no matter what their daddy had to do.
And those girls fell asleep at peace.
You said, “Last night.” You knew?
Celeste called, looking for you.
She was worried something might happen.
She told me about Dave.
Told me what she told you.
What kind of wife… says that about her husband?
And why'd she run to you?
–Why didn't you call?
–Because it's like I told the girls.
Their daddy's a king.
And a king knows what to do and does it.
Even when it's hard.
And their daddy will do whatever he has to for those he loves.
And that's all that matters.
Because everyone is weak, Jimmy.
Everyone but us.
We will never be weak.
And you….
You could rule this town.
And after, Jimmy… let's take the girls down to the parade.
Katie would have liked that.
Michael!
Michael! Michael!
Michael!
Michael!
THE CRIMSON RIVERS
We'll touch base in two hours.
- Which way do we go?
- There.
Okay? See you later, guys.
Can I help you?
Got a light?
Who let you through?
Your men. Commissioner Pierre Niemans.
Just you? Paris said they'd send a unit.
What the hell?
I'm the unit.
Captain...
...I didn't drive all night to wage war with cops.
What's the low-down?
Follow me.
Two days ago, the college dean reported Remy Callois missing.
Thirty-two years old, single.
Remy lectured at the college.
He was also the librarian.
An upper-echelon job there.
According to the Dean,
Remy was punctual and hardworking.
He never showed up late.
Yesterday afternoon...
...a young mountain climber found his body.
Why call in the homicide squad?
We're not used to this kind of stuff.
Why?
His body was strung up there.
At 50 meters.
GUERNON - University, 500 meters
You're from the homicide unit, but not really, is that it?
That's it.
We never dealt with you before.
You're lucky.
HAPPY IS HE WHO PENETRATES
THE HIDDEN CAUSES OF THINGS
What's this college doing here?
It's no ordinary college.
It provides its own electricity, its own water.
It even has a hospital.
1,200 students.
100 professors and researchers.
One of Europe's oldest universities.
In case of a snowstorm, it can survive for a month.
The Dean is like the mayor of the valley.
He runs most of the region.
Here's where they form future Bill Gates.
Future what?
Future Bill Gates.
The hospital's attached to the college?
It's open to everyone in the region.
We all get free health care.
We work a lot with them.
There's even a maternity wing.
This is Commissioner Niemans.
He'll be helping out on this case.
I was in your Criminology class in 1987.
Did you start yet?
I haven't cut the cord.
Can we see?
I figured you'd want to see him intact.
It's incredible.
The work of a real madman.
He strove for the foetal position.
What position?
The foetal.
Like a foetus in its mother's belly.
He's been dead for 48 hours.
Examination reveals traces of incisions...
...on the shoulders, arms, elbows and thighs...
...made by a sharp instrument.
A carpet cutter.
Can you cut the cord?
Four broken ribs.
Arms broken at the shoulders and elbows.
Multiple fractures: Tibia, hip...
I'll put it all in a detailed report.
The hands were amputated before he died, with an axe...
...the stumps cauterised to avoid his bleeding to death.
The killer obviously wanted to keep his victim alive.
I wouldn't do that...
He carved out the eyes like a surgeon.
Operating on a live patient.
What the fuck is this shit?
The sockets were filled with rain.
It's being analysed.
There's a good eye doctor in Guernon.
He may shed some light on this.
How long did it take him to die?
I'd have to cut him open, but I'd say five hours.
The size and precision of the wounds...
...indicate that he wanted his victim conscious...
...but in the greatest possible state of pain.
Check every prison, every loony bin and sect.
Every trail, refuge and ski slope.
Run random identity checks on drivers in a 160 kilometre radius.
Dig up evidence of similar mutilations in the past 20 years.
Talk to possible witnesses and Callois's colleagues.
Anyone who knew his itinerary.
Find out where it rained in the past two days.
Find anything: Witnesses, clues...
You have two hours.
Doctor CHERNEZE - OPHTHALMOLOGIST
Who's there?
Who's there?
Who is it?
Why won't you talk?
Doctor!
- Who are you?
- What's going on?
Get the dog out of here.
It's nothing. Go home.
Everything's all right.
See you on Tuesday.
Who are you?
Commissioner Niemans.
Sorry, dogs scare me shitless.
Dogs are not to fear. Just their masters.
How can I help you?
I'm investigating Remy Callois's death.
I heard about it.
How awful.
Did you know him?
I knew his father.
We went to college together.
Did you teach at the college?
For 20 years.
But I stopped teaching in 1982.
Why?
Difference of opinion.
With the Dean?
I don't understand.
What's the link between me and Remy?
I have some pictures
I'd like your opinion of.
He was tortured?
For several hours.
How horrible...
I didn't know.
No hands?
Nor eyes.
That's why I'm here.
To understand these mutilations.
How would I know?
What exactly do you treat?
Genetic afflictions concerning the eyes.
Hereditary diseases transmitted from one generation to the next.
They strike isolated areas and with the college...
What about the college?
Teachers have been marrying among themselves for ages.
The bloodlines are weak, worn out.
Genetic problems keep popping up.
The ransom of the elite.
I thought the professors' kids were prodigies.
They are.
I don't get it.
Over the past two generations...
...the situation has reversed.
The native mountain children are getting sick.
Like the boy you just saw.
Could there be a connection between the mutilations and the diseases?
Hands and eyes are the body parts that belong to us alone.
They're different from anyone else's, like with DNA.
They're our biological identity.
Your killer is giving you hints as to his motive.
And he starts stabbing away.
He stabs the dog, stabs the guy...
...grabs the bag and throws the knife under the car!
Seriously, Paris is full of psychos!
The subway! The cops!
RoboCops!
"Hand over your ticket, please!"
What the hell? I'm happy with my cows!
I'm happy here! Fresh air!
It's amazing here.
Take a look at my cows!
Paris sucks.
Kids doing this shit!
- It's the County Mounties!
- Hi, kids.
- How's it hanging?
- What's up?
Cool it...
Can we go now?
Happy squirrel hunting!
You want the roach?
You smoke?
- I always have.
- You didn't before!
Now I do.
You're smoking on duty.
He does.
You're lower on the totem pole.
Where does that put you?
Harry and Sally!
Why did you come for me?
The cemetery got robbed last night.
The word is "desecrated."
The elementary school got desecrated, too.
The word is "robbed", dick wad.
Two in a day!
We're back in business, guys!
Let's start with the cemetery.
I'm riding high today.
Pass the joint.
- What now?
- Nothing!
- You're sulking.
- Because you're smoking!
Do I sulk when you drink?
Cut the crap!
You sound like two old hookers.
You're here for the desecration.
Follow me.
I'm okay.
It's the girl's mausoleum.
The only mausoleum in the cemetery.
When I got here this morning...
...this is what I found.
It's those skinheads.
They're always hanging around here!
- We have skinheads?
- Not skinheads. Just kids.
- Kiddie skinheads?
- Just kid kids.
Did this ever happen before?
The first time.
She didn't make it too far.
Stop that! You have no right.
You need her parents' say-so.
I know the law!
Relax. No problem.
Where can I find the parents?
Her mother was crazy.
She said the devil killed her kid.
The devil?
You heard me.
Judith HERAULT
14 April 1972 - 23 September 1982
Where are your skinheads?
A warehouse in town.
Let's pay them a little visit.
First the school.
The principal's expecting us.
What's she missing?
Nothing's missing.
That's what's so strange.
I've never seen you. Are you new here?
Is it that obvious?
What did you do to end up here?
Cops are like teachers.
We can't always choose our school.
Tell me about it! For 14 years,
I've asked to be transferred!
Now it's too late.
They broke in here, where we keep school records.
They went about it extremely carefully.
Are you sure nothing's missing?
Nothing at all. I checked this morning.
It's so weird!
I don't understand.
Okay.
File a complaint at the station this afternoon.
So the investigation's over?
What can I say? No theft, no investigation.
Have a nice day. Goodbye.
Goodbye, Detective.
"Detective" is passé.
It's "Lieutenant" now.
Just a second!
How long have you been here?
Not as long as you seem to think.
If I say a name, could it ring a bell?
Try me.
Judith Herault.
Was she one of my students?
She died in 1982.
- Should I check?
- I'd appreciate it.
You think there's a connection?
You tell me.
I wonder if she's the one who got run over.
Run over?
Killed in a highway accident.
It was terrible.
What else?
It was a truck. The mother was there.
She became insane.
How can I find the mother?
What's wrong?
The pages are torn out.
The pages from '81 and '82.
Bingo!
Any pictures?
Class photos, stuff like that.
The pictures are missing, too.
I'll be right back.
What's the problem?
Any highway patrolmen here?
Not one. They're all out to lunch.
What for?
I need some info. I'm a cop myself.
Information about what?
An accident that happened around here 20 years ago.
It's your lucky day.
They call me "gravedigger".
Over the past 27 years,
I've seen 248, no, wait...
...249 accidents entailing deaths.
On our part of the highway alone.
30 kilometres!
Cops and firemen get all the attention.
But we're the first guys on the scene.
It's all in here.
What do you want to know?
- You can use that?
- What do you think?
I'm looking for the parents of a girl killed in '82. Judith Herault.
That sounds familiar.
- Judith Herault...
- H-E-R-A-U-L-T.
Search by victim's name - Judith Herault
Here we go...
"Judith Herault...
"Kilometre marker 98. September '82."
She was that kid?
That's right.
Just a sec.
1982. It's coming back now.
She was run over by a semi...
That's it.
What a goddamned mess!
Here she is.
Here's her file, with the policemen's statements...
...pictures and all.
I'm warning you. The pictures are...
Don't worry.
I warned you.
Jesus! What happened?
A 38-ton truck going 120 kilometres an hour.
How did you identify her?
When we got there, the mother was at the side of the road.
- She was holding...
- What?
A finger.
The only piece of her daughter still intact.
She said her kid ran away and tried running across the highway.
God knows what happened.
You don't have the mother's number?
Are you kidding? It's been 20 years!
The insurance company sent us an address...
...in case we came across any new leads.
This is too crazy!
UNIVERSITY OF GUERNON
The Dean's office?
That way, on your left.
I want to see the Dean.
I'm his assistant. How can I help?
By getting me the Dean, now.
Who shall I say is here?
Commissioner Niemans.
Commissioner Niemans for you.
Have a seat. I'll just be a minute.
I'm a slave to this university.
I never have enough time.
What can I do?
I'm investigating Callois's death.
I spoke to Captain Dahmane.
Tell me about Remy's private life.
Do you work with Dahmane?
Neither with nor without.
I lead a special unit.
It's you.
I don't understand what happened.
Remy never posed the slightest problem.
He was kind, hardworking.
His parents were close friends.
He took over his father's job in the library.
He went to school here?
Like most of us.
Many students are born and grow up here.
Some become professors like their parents.
It's sort of the tradition.
It was the case with Remy.
He didn't have a police record.
Maybe there's something we missed, that may be of help.
Like what?
Someone who hated him.
Drug use, some religious conviction...
I think you misunderstood me.
This university is a community, a temple of knowledge.
Everyone lives and works here in perfect harmony.
To accuse one of us is to accuse all of us, including me.
I want to visit his apartment.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
The police sealed it off.
I'd like to see it all the same.
Hubert, come here, please.
Unfortunately, I can't join you.
I hope you don't mind if my son shows you the way.
As I told you, traditions are a way of life here.
We've been voted "Best College" three years in a row.
We even helped raise the national average.
Just for fun, we calculated the average IQ here. Guess how much.
Twenty-four.
Excuse me?
Callois had room 24. Do you have the key?
No.
Do you have permission to go in?
What did he do at the library?
He was in charge of books and seating arrangements.
Seating arrangements?
Our tradition is to be seated in the same place every year.
It's beneficial and makes seating easier.
"Dominissimus. Simus serve.
"Ubicum que..."
"We are the masters. We are the slaves.
"We are everywhere. We are nowhere.
"We control the crimson rivers."
It was his Ph.D. Thesis.
He'd been working on it for years.
- Fanny Ferreira?
- Up there.
- I've got to go.
- See you tomorrow.
Fanny Ferreira?
You discovered Remy Callois's corpse?
Who are you?
Pierre Niemans.
I came from Paris to investigate.
Paris exports cops now?
Depends on the case.
Too bad. I like the local yokels.
Their seriousness cracks me up.
Me, too.
You can make a difference?
I've been trying to for 25 years.
Maybe you can help.
I doubt it.
I didn't see much. I scaled the cliff twice before noticing him.
Didn't you read my statement?
Did...
Did the killer have to be strong to get the body up there?
Not necessarily.
With know-how and good equipment, you can lift anything, anywhere.
What was he like?
A pretentious asshole.
Like most students here.
I agree. It seems pretty...
- Uptight?
- Exactly.
A closed-circuit race course for high-performance cars.
If you've been around once...
I read that you're a glaciologist.
What do you do?
I control avalanches.
The school's in a valley, so I try to steer them away.
You protect the school.
I do my job.
- Like Remy Callois.
- What?
You went to, and work for the school, like Remy Callois.
- So?
- You're part of the clan.
What clan?
The elite composed of professors' kids.
I have a busy day and I don't like uniforms.
Your colleagues have my number.
It"s the pathologist.
I got the results of the water in his eyes.
It"s rain water. Acid rain.
- What?
- It"s pretty common.
But we haven"t had any acid rain since the 1970s.
And it hasn"t rained recently.
I don"t get it.
- It's ice cold.
- Freezing.
Hello, Sister.
I'm a police officer.
Does a certain Mrs. Herault reside here?
May I ask why?
I'm sorry. I'm afraid not. I can't say.
Sister Andrée has been here for 17 years.
This concerns a relatively old incident.
Could I possibly see her?
I'll see.
Come in.
Wait here.
Take off your cap...
Where do you think you are?
My son!
Wait here.
Sister Andrée will see you.
- But I should warn you...
- About what?
You can speak to her, but you cannot see her.
You can listen, but you cannot go near.
Why not?
The Shadows, my son.
What about the shadows?
Sister Andrée took the Vow of the Shadows.
We haven't seen her for 15 years.
Sister...
Sister Andrée?
Sister?
I'm a police officer from Sarzac, just nearby.
Your daughter is buried there, right?
Judith was your daughter, wasn't she?
I'm here because last night someone tried to open her tomb.
They're coming back.
Who?
They're coming back to complete their mission.
Who are you talking about?
The demons.
They want to make sure Judith won't cause them any more trouble.
So it's these demons who killed your daughter?
Could you try being a little more explicit?
For 18 years I've been trying to forget.
Last night...
...your demons...
...broke into the school and stole Judith's class picture.
I need your help to understand why.
In order to erase every trace of my child.
What for?
To protect their secret.
What secret?
Judith's face is a threat to them.
Please, Sister. I'm sorry, but...
Can you tell me the circumstances of your daughter's death?
My daughter fell ill.
We went to the hospital she was born in.
Then the demons attacked us.
They chased us.
I wanted to run away, to disappear with my daughter.
But they found us.
No one can escape their clutches.
Where did you live before Sarzac?
The nightmare began in Guernon.
Did you try calling the police for help?
I speak of demons...
...and you speak of police.
There's nothing you can do for my child.
Save your soul while you still can.
Leave me now.
I want to stop remembering.
Forgive me.
Glaciers are formed from years of compacted snow.
The snow is compressed into ice.
Each season has a corresponding stratum.
This glacier is 200 metres deep.
It"s a huge source of water and energy.
The water composing it dates back centuries.
What"s the point of studying glaciers?
The college power plant has a research lab.
This glacier is sliding.
We study the risk factor it represents.
Here.
How far down do we have to go?
At least 30 metres.
Why did you choose me?
There are great guides in the area.
They say you're the best.
And you were available.
You enlist civilians to find murderers?
Let's say I'm picking you up.
Put this on. Don't step on the rope.
Welcome to the time machine,
Commissioner.
I'll compare this ice to the acid rain you had analysed.
We're at the right depth.
He must have brought us here for a reason.
There must be a clue...
A trace.
Niemans, that's dangerous!
We can't stay here.
Water can come gushing in at any second.
What's back there?
Natural water canals.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
Where are we?
An intra-glacial canal...
...dug out by the water that feeds the power plant.
We can't stay here. It's dangerous.
Let's go.
What's wrong?
The Light Brigade! What'll it be, guys?
Nothing today.
The Chief wants to see your tenants.
In the back.
- What's up?
- I'm coming.
Stay here. I'll have a word with them.
A glass of red?
ONLY THROUGH FORCE
Hello, gentlemen.
I'd like to speak to the manager.
The head honcho.
The leader of your little group.
What for?
Police. I'm new in the neighbourhood.
Lieutenant Max Kerkerian.
I have some questions.
Don't bother. We know you.
We don't talk to cops.
I'll do the talking.
What can we do for you?
Tell me about your whereabouts last night.
What's the problem?
Some kids sprayed swastikas on a mausoleum.
Why ask us?
Skinheads, swastikas...
Swastikas, skinheads...
No swastikas here. See any swastikas?
- What stickers?
- Swastikas.
Hey, Kojak!
You're not skinheads?
So what?
- You didn't do the school?
- What school?
You didn't hear me.
We don't talk to cops. So get lost.
- No school for you.
- And you? What school?
Sheriff school? You think you're cool?
- Relax.
- Hands off!
Policeman is doing his job.
I'm just doing my job.
What's his job? To piss us off?
Yeah. My job is to piss off your type.
What's our type?
- What's our type?
- I hate fascists.
Did you figure that out all by yourself?
Cool it!
What's he after?
Don't play his game!
This is private property.
You better get out. I know the law.
Yeah, get lost!
Thanks for your help.
Cops think they're so cool!
A gun and badge and you rule!
Son of a bitch!
Watch this, greaseball.
No gun. No badge. What did he say?
What? I'm not a cop now.
Not a cop now? The cowboy rode off?
Hands off. What did he say?
- What was it?
- Son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch.
Kill the motherfucker! Get him!
What happened? Max Kerkerian wins!
Warmed up?
Come and fight me, motherfucker.
Come on!
Fucking pig!
Take this!
Watch out, he's getting his gun!
Freeze!
Did you stick a gun at me?
Stop, it wasn't us!
What wasn't you?
Last night at the cemetery.
We saw a guy in a white Lada.
Why didn't you say so?
You didn't ask!
Next time you point a gun, check for bullets.
Asshole.
- Great vino.
- Very tasty.
Excellent bouquet. Really stunning.
- What happened?
- It wasn't them.
We never had a problem with them.
We do now.
What the hell?
Son of a bitch! Come here!
You'll be sorry!
Asshole!
Asshole!
What's going on?
The keys!
A list of every white Lada in the area.
Every single one!
In one hour. Call me on the radio.
Every white Lada.
- White what?
- Lada.
How do you spell it?
- Beats me.
- Just take a guess.
L-A-D-A?
Here.
How are you doing?
Okay.
Sorry I got you into this.
You think it's a serial killer?
No, a serial killer kills in order to exist.
I'd say we're dealing with a pointer.
A pointer?
We go where he points.
What for?
What for?
Either he's pointing us in a direction I don't understand...
Or?
Or he's playing with us.
Commissioner.
We've identified the body.
Excuse me.
Are you out there, Chief?
Find anything?
We found all the Ladas.
There are 132 in the region.
What do we do?
Anything in a town called Guernon, with a "G"?
Guernon?
Guernon, yeah. Ne white Lada.
Give me the name.
It belongs to Philip Sertys.
Good job. We'll talk later.
Don't do this to me, motherfucker!
Fucking...
Shit!
Fuck!
His name is Philip Sertys.
He graduated from here.
29 years old, single.
Became a doctor at 25.
He worked in the maternity wing.
- Did he live on campus?
- No, in town.
Do you have his address?
What exactly do you want?
To understand.
Thanks.
Get to work!
Stand up, nice and slow.
- Don't move!
- I'm a cop.
I said I'm a cop!
Keep it slow.
- Give me my gun, asshole!
- Don't move!
You're under arrest. I'm a cop!
Give me my gun.
They teach lock-picking at the Academy?
Real funny.
Commissioner Niemans.
- Pierre Niemans?
- Yeah.
Sorry. Couldn't you say so?
- Why are you here?
- To see a suspect.
What's his name?
Philip Sertys.
Why?
Pierre Niemans?
Great technique!
What are you looking for?
Don't touch anything.
Chill out. Can I breathe at least?
The guy's a real dog lover.
Judith...
We're talking total dog freak.
Wait!
What's the problem? Come on!
I can't believe it!
Mega-Cop is scared of pooches!
Don't worry. Come on.
Come here, sonny.
Careful!
That one may bite!
- You ever stop blabbing?
- Just joking.
Motherfuckers!
You know what this place is?
The lab of a guy who experiments on dogs.
Using genetics to make a perfect fight dog.
He has all the equipment.
Look...
This is really gross.
Did you see?
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
To see your suspect.
You know where he is?
So where are we going?
What do you want Sertys for?
Desecration. And you?
Where?
In Sarzac, about 200 kilometres from here.
Why do you want him?
Sarzac.
Where's the lighter?
Do you never answer questions or is it me?
Take a left.
Okay, Chief. I'll take a left.
This will be a barrel of laughs.
- Sir?
- He's with me.
So?
Same method of strangulation.
Same killer. I'm sure.
But this guy wasn't tortured.
The hands aren't torture?
They were cut off after he died.
I don't get a thing.
What I don't get is why he still has his eyes.
- Did you start the autopsy?
- Not yet.
There are no wounds.
There must be some clue.
What kind of clue?
I'm not sure. But I'm sure it's here.
We have to look.
Hold on...
Tweezers, please.
You won't believe this.
Glass eyes. Like in an eye doctor's office...
...or at medical school.
Get your men and meet me at Cherneze's office.
Tell me what's going on!
You're asking me?
Can I know where you're going?
Butt out. Wait for me at the station.
You're kidding!
He's as much my witness as yours!
I didn't make it this far to go back empty-handed.
This isn't child's play.
I can't be your teacher.
Stop acting like some kind of living legend!
I can teach you, too.
- I work alone!
- That makes two of us!
Where are we?
- Did you ever shoot someone?
- I never had to.
Good. I want him alive.
Who? Who, goddammit?
What the fuck is this?
What are we looking for?
Can you tell me?
If you talk to me, maybe I can help.
The other stairway!
Don't move!
Run!
What's happening?
"I will track the source of the crimson rivers."
Would it kill you to tell me what's going on?
I have no idea!
- That's an answer.
- So?
So I'm comparing the fingerprints.
There's no match.
No criminal on our files.
Shit.
- Can you scan this print?
- No problem.
What's that?
A girl who died 20 years ago.
She led me here.
What?
If she died 20 years ago, we got a problem.
She's the one who shot at you.
These prints are a perfect match with the ones on the gun...
...except for the age difference.
We need to talk.
So we talk now?
Last night, Sertys went to a cemetery.
Into the vault of Judith Herault, who died in 1982.
He couldn't open the coffin, so he tried misleading us with swastikas.
That night, someone broke into the elementary school...
...and stole pictures and documents from '81 and '82...
...the two years Judith Herault attended that school.
She's one of these kids.
How did she die?
Run over by a truck.
They called it an accident.
But the mother told me something completely different.
According to her...
...her daughter was killed by demons.
Demons...
She has a major screw loose.
She's in a convent since.
But I got the impression she wasn't telling me all...
Did you grill her or have tea?
I was investigating a misdemeanour.
I couldn't punch her to get her to talk.
She's a nun.
Your turn.
Tell me what's going on.
It's a treasure hunt.
Each corpse leads to the next one.
Let's say that...
...Sertys, Callois and Cherneze are linked by an incident...
...that happened 20 years ago.
Two days ago they learn Callois is dead.
We find the body.
They panic. The past resurfaces.
They go to the cemetery and the school...
...to check...
To find something...
But what?
- If Judith is really dead.
- Why?
She's seeking revenge.
The nun probably faked her death.
And the prints?
Fingers can be cut off.
The guy who shot at me had five fingers.
Why did he let you live?
So I'd understand his vengeance.
What links the three victims?
Callois was head librarian.
Sertys worked in the maternity ward.
Cherneze worked with the dean.
It all leads to the university.
I better get back.
What about me?
See if Judith is dead.
I knew you'd say that.
I get the fun stuff.
Call me with any news.
What are you doing here?
Your colleagues held me for four hours.
Sorry. Everyone's on edge.
Want a ride?
Sure.
So Cherneze is dead, too?
Did you know him?
One of the college's last dinosaurs.
You don't seem to appreciate the geniuses you live among.
I don't respect intellectuals much.
Weren't your parents professors?
I don't respect my parents much.
Take a left here.
Is anyone expecting you?
You're a lousy Don Juan.
- Thanks.
- No problem.
JUDITH HERAULT
Nice place.
I like it. It's far from everything.
No TV, no radio...
...even cell phones don't work.
A grenade?
Thanks.
I use them to trigger avalanches.
Are all the locals like you?
Battling mountains helps forge your character.
Same goes for cops.
Have you been one for long?
Too long.
Buy lighter fluid.
I should.
But I'm trying to quit. It was a gift.
From your ex?
I never got married. How about you?
Almost. With the Dean's son.
That could never work.
It sure was intended to.
After three years face to face in a reading room...
...you get close.
Why do you hate the school so much?
Why do you suspect me?
You climb mountains.
You found the first body, helped me find the second.
You're the perfect suspect.
Except for one thing.
What?
You're incapable...
...of strangling someone for 10 minutes, eye to eye.
I have to go.
Thanks for the tea.
Hello.
Tell me about Remy Callois's thesis.
He talks about the myth of Olympus...
...Greek athletes who combined mind and body.
He refers a lot to the Berlin Olympic games of 1936...
...when German athletes fuelled Nazi propaganda.
And "crimson rivers"?
Flow with the blood of perfect men.
Blood?
Veins...
Commissioner.
You want my opinion?
Seriously, his thesis is a potpourri of Nazi crap.
At the end, it's like
"How To Be a Perfect Fascist."
He explains how to create the perfect man today.
How?
By combining brawny kids with brainy ones.
By selecting them and marrying them.
It's called...
Eugenics.
Eugenics, that's it.
Like Nazis tried in some villages during the war.
Like at this school. Healthy minds...
...in healthy bodies.
What are you doing?
You have no business here!
What role did Callois play exactly?
Excuse me?
Callois. Sertys. Cherneze.
It all leads here.
What are you after?
You suspect us, don't you?
Victims can be guilty, too.
Watch what you say, Niemans.
I inquired about you.
You're on the razor's edge...
I'd gladly put you first on the list.
All that's stopping me is the desire to prove you're behind it all.
Am I wrong? Am I?
Stop it!
Are you crazy?
You'll be hearing from me!
Can't I leave you alone for a minute?
What did you find in the tomb?
I don't know if it'll be any help.
It's not her.
You know her?
- She helped with the case.
- She helped you?
To understand the meaning of the "crimson rivers."
They've lived in a closed circuit here for ages.
Inbreeding led the professors to start having degenerate kids.
So they needed new blood.
New blood?
In the maternity wing, they replace professors' kids...
...with healthy newborn mountain babies.
Sertys's father exchanged Fanny with Judith?
And plenty of others.
What for?
To create a superior race.
Nazis?
- A freaking Nazi college?
- Not a college.
A breeding ground.
Who the fuck is it?
Shoot!
Shoot!
It's bullet-proof.
Aim for the same spot.
Go on, shoot!
Shoot!
Watch out!
Are you okay?
- Who's this bastard?
- The Dean's son.
What did he want?
To stop us from knowing what they did to Fanny.
What could he do to Fanny?
He was 10 back then.
He was exchanged.
He was seated with Fanny at the library.
He should have married her.
That was the plan.
So then why is she killing them all off?
She refuses to play by their rules.
You think she's innocent?
My coat!
Hold on. A la Niemans.
Who is this babe of yours?
Lady Cliff-hanger?
Shit!
Are you still not sure?
To think she brought me here!
I could have seen it all.
She could have operated on you, too!
She didn't want to kill me.
She left me alive.
What are you talking about?
She left you alive, but three other guys didn't make it.
Your girlfriend's hobby is to cut up her boyfriends.
Why the treasure hunt?
What are you talking about?
She's a schizoid! A psycho-killer!
She wants us to understand.
- What's to understand?
- She wants to get caught.
Good news. That's our job, right?
Now we just have to find her.
That's our job.
What now?
She took the grenades.
What grenades?
Closed up like a fucking clam...
Did you evacuate the college?
I need an explanation first!
It's not the time for explanations.
Evacuate.
This can't go on. Who's up there?
- I go alone.
- It's everyone or no one!
I'm going alone.
Everyone, freeze!
Calm down...
No one is coming.
Have you gone berserk?
Give me that.
Trust me.
Lower your guns.
We have to go all the way now.
Leave her to me.
Down there!
Fanny, turn around.
Come down.
This is the end. It's over now.
I know who you are.
You know nothing!
Stop it! I know what they did to you.
Exchanging newborn babies.
Killing kids. I know.
It's too late. You can't help. Go away!
You led me here. I can't turn back.
- Neither can I!
- Don't do that!
They'll close down the college.
They're all dead now.
- You'll kill innocent people.
- They're all guilty!
No one is innocent!
Judith?
Twins!
They exchanged twins!
Just one.
That's why her face was a threat to them.
Take care of her.
So who died in the car accident?
What about the fingerprint?
Mommy prepared it all.
The other girl was already dead.
Mommy planned everything.
Except your going haywire.
You thought you'd make it?
I don't intend to make it.
Freeze, or you really won't make it.
Stop!
Leave her alone!
I'll trigger an avalanche.
Listen to me.
Stay away!
The men who hurt you are all dead.
If you do this, they'll win.
Only you can stop her, Fanny.
You're not a monster like her.
Stop before it's too late.
- I have no choice.
- You do.
Stop!
Kill him.
For our lives. For those of our parents.
For the lives they stole from us.
Kill him.
- Not him. He's innocent.
- Kill him!
Do it for me. For the life I never had.
A life in your shadow.
They created you.
And they rejected me. Do it.
Kill him, Fanny.
Do it!
You wanted him to understand.
You can't do that.
It's you and me.
You and me.
Go on.
Go on!
Don't.
You're not like her.
But I am.
Kill him!
Do it!
You had to understand, so no one could forget.
I know.
Hurry!
Take her feet!
That's enough. I'm fine.
Thanks, doggy. That's enough.
I've had it!
Can I ask a question?
What do you have against dogs?
It was a long time ago...
As I was going up the stair
I met a man who wasn't there
I met a man who wasn't there
He wasn't there again today
I wish
I wish he'd go away
Where did you learn that?
Where did you learn that poem?
I made it up.
When I was a kid, I made it up.
What else do you remember from back then?
Don't beat around the bush, doc.
Don't beat around the bush.
Don't beat around the bush.
Don't beat around the bush, doc!
Tell me what you remember about your mother.
I remember my mom.
I remember my mom.
I remember my mom was a whore.
How long would she keep you there?
As long as she was busy.
Do you understand why you're talking with me now?
You're supposed to be good with...
...headaches.
I need something more than aspirin.
Know what I mean?
Do you remember the murders?
I remember...
...that Columbia is the capital of South Carolina.
I remember that...
Are you the person who murdered six residents...
...of the Lakeworth Apartments on May 10, 1998?
That's my birthday.
Who am I speaking to right now?
What should I call you?
Call me whatever you want.
Gary?
Gary?
Gary, you awake?
Yes, Greg, as a matter of fact,
I am awake.
I'm sorry to bother you at home...
...but there's gonna be a midnight hearing in the Rivers case.
The defense found a notebook misfiled in evidence, a diary.
They argued to the state Supremes that it was suppressed.
What are you talking about?
There's no media.
This all happened under the radar.
The prisoner transport left an hour ago from Ely.
Left Ely? What do you mean?
What transport?
The diary gave them an opening to argue insanity again.
They need Rivers present, so they drugged him, put him on a transport.
They're taking this scumbag to a hearing...
...the night before his execution.
How the fuck did you let that happen?
Would anyone like to play another round?
Let's get another puzzle,
Vanna. What do we have?
- "Around the House" is the category.
- Buy a vowel.
- Buy a vowel.
- Pick up that trip.
- Buy a vowel, you idiot.
- I'd like to buy a vowel. An E.
One E.
- All right, 350 left.
- N.
- Buy a vowel.
- Buy another vowel.
- Yes!
- An I.
- I'd like to solve.
- Sure.
"Kibbles 'n Bits."
She won't stop bleeding.
She won't stop bleeding.
- Jesus. What happened?
- An accident. We had an accident.
Rain and lightning is moving into Elko.
Doppler Radar has picked up a severe thunderstorm with lightning...
...on its way from Pershing and Lander counties.
- We could get damaging winds...
- Four times 10 equals...
Four times 10...
Timothy, could you not do that now?
We're trying to hear about the storm.
- Sure you don't want me to drive?
- No.
I'll get us to Anderson, then you can take over after we eat.
Turn into spin.
Apply brakes with short, firm pumps.
Check mirror and gauge indicator and roll...
...to a slow, smooth stop.
You okay, honey? Timothy?
Seat belts, seat belts, seat belts.
- It's a shoe.
- What?
It's a shoe!
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny
Shit!
- Why didn't we get a better spare?
- Do you know what radials cost, Alice?
Honey, don't get defensive.
Well, if the point is to put him,
Timothy, into the right school...
...it's absurd to focus...
- George? George?
...on replacement tires.
- What can I do to help?
Nothing. I'm fine, but...
...thank you.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Alice?
Oh, my God! Alice?
What have you done?
What have you done?
What have you done?
Hi, Harry.
Where do I begin?
I have walked off the set, okay?
I know they'll say that I am in breach...
...but they clearly did not read my deal.
They had me at a Ramada...
Oh, Jesus.
I think I have a spare battery in my bag.
Excuse me?
I have a spare battery in my bag up front, next to you.
- Any idea which one, Miss Suzanne?
- The Louis Vuitton duffel, right on top.
I don't see anything...
Just use your fucking eyes!
It's in the side pocket! Just look!
Jesus!
What have you done?
What have you done?
No, fool! If you help him, you assume responsibility.
It is my responsibility.
Let go of me.
Alice? Alice?
What have you done?
What have you done?
Let me take a look.
The driver of every motor vehicle involved in any manner of accident...
...originating from the operation of a vehicle shall, within 10 days...
You got a towel or something in the car?
Okay. Come help me look.
- Within 10 days of the accident...
...if you are operating a vehicle and it should, at any time, involve...
- Stay here. Keep her dry.
- It's okay. It's okay, honey.
- Open the door! We need the phone.
- No!
Sweetheart, it's okay.
Honey, it's okay.
- Give me the goddamn phone!
- The phone is dead, all right?
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be okay.
No!
- She won't stop bleeding.
- Jesus. What happened?
There was an accident.
May I please use your phone?
- Please use your phone?
- Yeah, sure.
Shit. I'm not getting a line.
It happens in the rain.
The phone doesn't work.
St. Jude's has 24-hour emergency,
30 miles east.
Okay.
You sit here, okay?
Keep pressure on the wound.
I'll be back with an ambulance.
What are you doing?
Sorry. It's a step down from the Ramada, but it'll have to do.
I am not staying here.
Are you out of your mind?
This is my car. You work for me.
Get those bags back in this car now!
I understand the bleeding person has a medical condition, but so do I.
My lung walls have depleted cilia.
If I stay here, I could asphyxiate!
No, please, please, please, please, please, please.
Please!
Hey!
Stop. Please, please.
Hi. I'm sorry, my car is stuck.
Can I get a ride?
Okay.
You know you're going east.
Hospital's this way.
It's flooded.
I mean, it's a dead end.
Yeah, well, if you don't mind,
I gotta try.
Okay, that will be $30 cash, please.
Didn't you use to be that actress?
Yes.
- Wow.
- Now, is that a nice room?
Because though I am leaving soon,
I still would prefer a nice room.
Your nicest...
...if that is possible.
Eight's very cozy.
I tried to tell you.
Hey! Hey, stop!
There's no way through.
There's no way through!
No way through!
- Lou, wake up.
- What?
Cell phone.
- What?
- Do you have a cell phone?
Who wants to know?
There's been an accident, a bad one. A lady's hurt.
- We need a cell phone right now.
- Dude, slow down.
First, we don't know who you are.
Second, we don't see an accident...
Listen to me, dude, I'm having a really fucked-up, wet, bad fucking day.
So if you have a cell phone, give it to me now!
Dude, we don't have a cell phone, so could you just let go of me now?!
I need you to give me a lift in the other direction.
It's flooded that way too.
It's worse than this.
Ginny, pop the trunk.
Let them in.
Let them in.
Hey. How you doing?
- Phone still dead?
- Yeah. Where's your Lincoln?
Stuck in a run-off two miles down the road. The other way's fucked too.
The kids gave us a lift.
The girl was stranded.
- Is there another way out?
- Is she a hooker?
Hey! Is there a back road?
Where do you think the water's going?
You wouldn't get 500 feet.
- How's the woman?
- I don't know. They're in number 4.
I'm sorry. We don't rent rooms by the hour.
Funny. You still serving food?
Vending machines are around the corner. Go ahead.
Rooms are 30 bucks in advance with picture ID. You need one room or two?
Excuse me. I was talking to you.
I'd appreciate it if you looked at me.
Well, I don't like looking at trash.
We're a little stuck here, George.
I don't think we can get out tonight.
- She just keeps shaking.
- She's in shock.
- Let me take a look.
- What?
Let me take a look.
Did your wife pack a sewing kit?
No.
Ginny, wait up.
Six.
At least we got a good number.
- Did you feel that?
- Feel what?
Cold.
Are you the manager?
Yeah.
I'm Officer Rhodes, Corrections.
I'm transporting a prisoner here.
The law gives you the right to refuse us service...
...but the roads are flooded.
I could use a room.
- It's an emergency.
- You got a radio in that car?
- Who's this?
- Limo driver, had an accident.
I got a lady pretty banged up.
I could use an ambulance.
Four-four-two requesting medical.
Four-four-two requesting medical.
Nothing. It's been like this for the past hour.
She's losing a lot of blood.
Got a first aid kit?
Band-Aids, that's it.
- How about a needle and thread?
- Maybe in the diner.
I'll get it. Locked up.
Stay dry.
I'll be back with your key.
I'll put you in 10.
- Okay, thanks.
- What do you got back there?
Prison transfer.
Maybe when you get him situated, come to 4 and look at the lady.
- I could use a second opinion.
- Yeah, sure.
Looks like you're fucked.
Shut up!
- I wish I had beige.
- This is fine.
Would have been better.
I gotta get the officer situated.
Let me know if you need something.
I'll be right back.
Where did you learn to do that?
Pretty much where you're standing.
Hey, is the?
The little boy, is he all right?
He hasn't said a word since the accident.
No, no, no. He doesn't talk much ever since the...
I'm his stepfather.
His father...
Two years ago, he left.
Little temper problem.
Watch your step.
The furniture's for shit.
If you're fixing to cuff him to something, the toilet's bolted down.
Thank you so much for your assistance.
- It's a good idea. Come on.
- I got stripes
Stripes around my shoulders
And these chains
These chains
They're about to...
Let's go look at that lady.
- You get anyone?
- What?
- Did you get through?
- No, not yet.
Good stitch job.
Pulse is shallow, but steady.
Keep her comfortable.
We should take turns on the radio, if that's all right.
No, it's not. I can manage.
You gonna arrest me, officer?
What?
How'd you do that?
How'd you know I was a cop?
No shit.
Cheetos for dinner, huh?
- That don't seem right.
- You got a better idea?
I worked mess in the service.
Maybe the diner's open. I could...
You got change for a dollar?
I don't know. Let me see.
Here you go.
You got a name?
- Paris.
- Paris, huh?
I'll get it.
Never been.
Well, you ain't going tonight.
Please.
Please be strong.
You see, Timothy and I...
...we need you.
We need you so much.
Lou?
Lou?
You need to tell them, Harry, that I can't work, I can't perform...
...I can't shine living in an environment like that.
No, it is not about the money.
It's about the working conditions.
One bar.
One bar.
No bar.
One bar.
Two bars.
Come on. Come on.
Here we go.
There you go. Come on.
Goddamn desert wasteland!
Oh, shit! I just had it.
Holy fuck.
- Jesus, Mother of God.
- Who is this?
The woman I was driving.
- What the hell are you doing?
- There's something in there.
- Use this, man.
- Thanks.
- Are you a cop?
- I was.
- She was in Room 10?
- I am.
- Where's your guy?
- Cuffed to a toilet.
Son of a bitch.
That was a fucking drive.
- Gentlemen.
- Your Honor.
Ready, Sharon? Alrighty.
In the matter of Rivers v. Nevada, for the purposes of...
Judge Taylor, sir, with due respect, we should wait till my client arrives.
- He has a right to be present.
- He has precious few rights.
He's 24 hours from execution.
But to demonstrate his mental state, which is the purpose...
His mental state?
His mental state?
Do you know what time it is?
You think I got time for bullshit?
That the justices called me in the middle of the night to review a case...
...I already sat on, that I already decided, may make you happy.
But it pisses me off.
When your boy gets here, do what you want, but in the name of decency...
...state your goddamn case!
Yes, sir.
Somebody get me a cup of coffee, black.
All right, everybody! Listen up!
There was an incident tonight.
That's police talk for,
"Someone's head got lopped off."
Larry!
- Caroline Suzanne was murdered.
- What?
- Who's Caroline Suzanne?
- The actress I was driving.
And where exactly did that happen?
We don't know, because we can't find the body.
Not all of it anyway.
- What do you mean, you can't find it?
- Stay calm. Everything will be all right.
Officer Rhodes is outside.
He was transporting a convict.
- Who escaped.
- What are you...?
- Hold on.
- Running free!
Will you shut the fuck up so he can talk?
This is my place, ho!
I'll say what I please!
- It's safe here.
- It is not safe here!
- There's a cop here.
- Yeah, two cops.
Wait. You're a cop?
- I was. Shut up, Larry!
- It's not safe here! I'm not staying...
It's all right. It's okay.
Nothing.
- Is she okay?
- Ginny.
Ginny, will you?
Stop it. Don't do this right now.
- What are you doing?
- Put your arm around your girlfriend.
- Actually, she's my wife.
- Everybody just stay here.
- Stay in this room.
- Wait! I'm not staying here if he is.
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.
- I'm not.
- All right. Larry?
- Come with us.
- Why?
- You know the place.
- Here's what I know. I'm not a cop.
I don't take orders from a professional slut!
- Fuck you!
- Listen. Just stay here, please.
Keep everybody calm.
He's not gonna get too far.
Not in this!
Rhodes!
What are we chasing here?
Multiple homicide.
I'll go around this way.
Meet you in back.
Is that where you live full-time? Las Vegas?
- Used to.
- What's that supposed to mean?
It means I don't live there anymore.
Maine!
We'll go see if we can use this one.
We'll go in here.
Since that wasn't a successful attempt, we'll go in here.
I'll be right out here. It's okay.
I'm gonna stand guard.
Not a worry. I'll be right here.
I'm not going anywhere.
See, his mother usually does this.
Hey, Ginny. So how long you two been married?
About nine hours. It was a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing.
Viva Las Vegas, huh, Gin?
- We need to leave!
- I was just talking to her.
Something's happening!
I need to get out of here!
- Ginny! Ginny!
- You don't own me, Lou!
I own what's inside you!
Half, at least.
You don't own any part of me or my baby!
Then why did I marry you?
- Don't slam the goddamn door on me!
- Hey! Hey!
You guys, just calm down!
We are not leaving.
There is no place else to go.
There's a flood outside,
Ginny. Stop it! Stop it!
I'm not pregnant!
What did you just say?
I lied.
I'm not pregnant.
What are you talking about?
I saw the test.
Why would you do that to me?
Because Alison saw you at
The Hawk with that fucking girl!
- Ginny, what are we, like 15?
- Go away!
Goddamn!
- Open this goddamn door, Ginny!
- No!
I haven't been to The Hawk in over a fucking year.
Alison is a stupid bitch-whore, who likes fucking with your head.
Open the damn door, Ginny.
- Open the fucking door!
- Not until you calm down!
I'm calm! I am very fucking calm!
What are you doing?
Lou?
Ginny, open this damn door!
Open the door!
- Open the door!
- Stop it, stop it!
Ginny, damn it, open the door!
Ginny, Ginny, Ginny!
Lou, please stop!
Lou?
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Help me! Somebody help me!
Help me!
Help me! Somebody help me!
Is he in there? Is he in there?
Ginny, are you okay?
What happened? What happened?
- Oh, shit.
- Jesus Christ.
Lou? Lou?
What's going on?
What the hell?
Oh, shit!
Come here!
They caught him. They caught him.
Why are we keeping him in here?
- Where would you prefer, Larry?
- I don't know.
I told you to stay in 3, didn't I?
Did I tell you that?
They got in a fight! I tried to get them to go back inside!
Should we try the radio again?
Larry, just stay here and watch him.
- Go back and look after Ginny.
- Where are you going?
Just do it, please.
Ed?
I don't know if I'm comfortable with guard duty, per se.
He's unconscious, Larry.
He's tied to a post.
Timothy.
Timothy.
Alice? Oh, my God. Alice?
I don't remember anything.
We had an accident.
George? Can you keep an eye on Ginny for a minute?
She's awake now. I have to get some aspirin to help her.
Darling, I gotta go get something out of my room.
- Shit!
- What's wrong, buddy?
What do you got in the fridge?
- You shut up.
- What's in there?
What's in there?
- What do you got in there?
- Shut up.
What is it, huh?
- Shut up.
- You can tell me.
I'm good at keeping secrets.
I got a whopper myself.
What are you doing?
Motherfucker!
- What are you doing out here?
- Getting shit that's mine.
What are you doing?
What, I don't get to ask a question?
I'm taking photos. There's been two murders. Before all the evidence...
That's not an answer. You're a limo driver. What are you doing?
Looking to win some "beyond the call of duty," limo-driver merit badge?
You're not on the job anymore.
You don't need to be a hero.
There's a real, live, active-duty cop outside...
The one who's managed to lose a convicted killer?
You're a complicated cat, Edward.
No. Not really.
I think so.
What month were you born?
- May.
- Taurus.
Same as me.
- Where were you a cop?
- Los Angeles.
Were you fired or did you quit?
I took medical leave.
It was making me sick.
I burned out, I guess.
Wasn't up for it.
One day I got a call...
...for a jumper.
A young Mexican girl.
Pregnant, infected with AIDS, totally strung-out.
She was truly one of the doomed.
I asked her to come in off the ledge and into my arms.
She asked me why she should bother living.
What did you say?
I was trained to tell her lots of things.
Her dreams, all the people who'd miss her.
But for a second, I hesitated.
And she saw it.
Within that second, I couldn't think of one optimistic thing to say to her.
So she spread her arms and jumped.
I started getting headaches...
...and eventually started blacking out.
So I filed for medical.
What?
What is it?
Rhodes!
- It's worse. Nothing but static!
- Where's that key from the actress?
This was on the kid.
- What is it, some kind of countdown?
- Larry!
What the fuck is he doing?
Larry, come over here!
Come over here, man.
What are you doing? Come over here.
- What are you doing?
- I just went to get something.
We told you to watch the guy.
What are you doing in your office?
I just went to get something.
How many sets of keys are there to this place? Look at me. How many?
- Two and a master set.
- Oh, my fucking God!
Larry, you mother...! You son of a...!
Get the fuck in here! Get in here!
Why did you kill him?
Why did you kill my con?
Holy shit! Who did that?
Jesus Christ, I didn't do that!
Bullshit! You're lying!
- It's your bat sticking out of his throat!
- I know, but I didn't do it!
Check the doors!
- I didn't do it!
- Look at him!
- Why'd you kill him?
- Why were you outside?
- Why'd you leave him?
- I was scared.
- What were you scared of?
- You wouldn't understand.
Try me.
- Why'd you kill my con?
- I didn't!
I don't know how...
I went to my office, that's all!
- Why'd you leave him?
- This your key? Number 8?
Ten, nine, eight, huh?
This is your key!
You can't say that!
Those aren't my keys!
That's like leading the witness or something. Look.
These are my keys, okay?
These are my keys. You see?
You got a Gucci wallet?
It's the actress's.
Yes, I took her wallet.
Afterwards. After she died!
Afterwards, all right? I didn't kill her.
And I didn't kill him.
- Let her go, Larry.
- Get back! You won't pin this on me.
- Timothy?
- Get him out of here!
- Put it down.
- I didn't hurt anybody. No one!
But I don't like cheap fucking whores!
If you take one more step...
Fuck!
Get it off!
Shit!
Come on, you little bitch.
Please fucking start.
- Goddamn it!
- Hey!
Larry, stop!
What is going on?
- Larry!
- Get out of my way, I didn't do shit!
Timothy! Timothy!
An insanity plea was refused by the court...
...despite the fact that my client is a certifiable Axis IV dissociative.
To this day, he remains unaware of the crimes for which he was convicted.
In 1986, the Supreme Court ruled decisively that states cannot execute...
...a person who does not understand why he's being put to death.
He signed a confession.
- He didn't just sign it, he dictated it.
- Thirdly...
...Malcolm's diaries found misfiled in state evidence.
Your Honor, this notebook contains entries made just before the murders.
Important to note are the spectacular changes in handwriting style...
...tone, point of view.
What you are looking at are the private thoughts of several different people.
With permission,
Dr. Mallick will elaborate.
Thank you.
Your Honor, there is no universally efficacious treatment...
...for Dissociative Identity Disorder.
In theory, one attempts to move the patient towards integration.
- A folding of their fractured psyche.
- Your Honor?
He's here.
No! What you saw was an accident!
He ran out in front of me!
I'm not a murderer!
There's a dead body in your freezer, Larry.
- I didn't kill him. I found him like that.
- Stop it!
Listen! Listen! I was in Vegas last month and I lost everything, okay?
Everything!
I drove west. I didn't know where to go, but I was running on empty...
...so I pulled in here at this place.
And there was no one at the station, so I came over to the office...
...and I walked in.
And there, sitting at that desk right there, was the manager...
...facedown in a Banquet Potpie.
Dead!
- Heart attack or something.
- Banquet Potpie!
He'd been sitting there for God knows how long.
All of a sudden, this auto-parts salesman pulls up, looking for a room.
I didn't have a fucking dime...
...so I took his 30 and gave him one.
I just took the key from the wall and gave him a room.
Maybe that was wrong, but I was broke, and that's what I did.
Then I came back in here...
...and I moved Larry's body...
His name was Larry too.
I put him in the freezer.
I wasn't trying to hide him.
It was hot out.
I thought it was the best place for him till his family or someone came along.
Only no one did...
...except more guests.
So I checked them in too.
And they all seemed happy...
...so I just stayed.
Cry me a river.
This is a total crock of shit!
- No, it's not!
- Admit it, you killed him!
Just like you killed my con.
Just like you killed her husband.
Just like you killed his actress.
Just admit it.
- Say it, "I killed them."
- Stop it! He can't take any more!
Everything is okay now. Everything is fine. We got the guy. It's fine.
- I don't know what we got.
- What?
We thought we got the guy two hours ago, then...
You believe this shit?
It's him! It's this guy!
He had a knife to your neck, remember?
His story's so unbelievable,
I think it just might be true.
She's got a point.
You guys are crazy.
Maybe it's the burial ground.
What?
Read the brochure in there.
It's all around us.
A hundred years ago, the government moved these Indians here.
They all died because there was no water.
Now they're coming back to life like sea monkeys, huh?
Come on.
Give me a break, sweetheart.
- Just take it easy, Rhodes.
- You know, you take it easy!
You've tried to run this show all night.
Giving orders, pointing fingers!
You blamed my con for everything, and he ends up dead.
I'm telling you, it's him!
We all saw him run down George.
Your actress's wallet is right there.
She's dead, there's the wallet.
- What more do you want?
- Stop it! Please shut up!
All right. You want a plan?
Here's the plan, okay?
No one's gonna move. We'll stay here, like this, in this room until dawn.
No one leaves, no one moves.
And if he tries anything,
I'm gonna shoot him!
And if something out there comes in here, I'll shoot it!
And if anyone of us tries anything,
I'll shoot them!
- We get it.
- Good!
Timmy? Timmy?
- You need to stay in here with us.
- It's all right.
Remember that movie where the 10 strangers went to an island...
...and then they all died one by one...
...and then it turned out they weren't strangers, they all had a connection?
They all messed with the wrong guy, and he was getting revenge.
Shut up!
I'm just saying maybe there's a connection between all of us.
Like what?
- We're all in Nevada.
- Shut up!
Where were you going with your con when you pulled in here?
Carson City. Okay?
I was going home to Florida.
Where were you going?
I was taking the actress to L.A.
I was born in Florida.
Since you been in that chair, no one's died, so shut up!
No one's died since we've all been here!
- Hey, sweetie, sit down.
- Where in Florida, Larry?
- Where in Florida?
- Friends now, huh? Great.
- Polk County.
- That's where I was born.
- Which town?
- Mulberry.
- Frostproof.
- No wonder you left.
There's a town called Frostproof?
They grow oranges.
The name doubles as a slogan.
I danced hallelujah the day I left Polk.
Why would you wanna go back?
I found a grove for sale on the Internet.
Nine acres, 1200 trees.
Limes and oranges.
According to the realtor, the soil needs a few tills, phosphorous...
...lanes need reading, but it's real good land.
What?
It sounds nice.
Ed?
She's dead.
Get him out of here.
Come on.
Come on, sweetie.
Look at this.
- Where'd you get that?
- Right here.
This doesn't make any sense.
She died from an accident.
George was an accident, if you believe Larry.
Where is seven?
Back it up!
- See, I told you it wasn't me!
- That's not possible.
I was standing right there. I saw what happened. We all saw what happened.
He ran out. Nobody could have known he was gonna do that.
No one human.
We're back to that again?
It's the spirits, huh?
Maybe it's the ghost of the guy that Larry put in the freezer.
Somebody untie me.
Goddamn it!
You know it wasn't me.
Come on.
- Listen.
- We gotta get out...
- Listen.
- We gotta get out...
Take her car and get out.
You, her and the kid.
There's nowhere to go.
- How much gas do you have?
- Half a tank.
You can drive till dawn on that.
Look at me.
When you get to where it's flooded, go the other way.
I don't know if I can.
Get the kid and go.
Right now. Come on.
Timmy.
Timmy, come on. Let's go.
Get up.
What's going on?
- They can't leave!
- This way.
We'll see you when the storm breaks.
Hey! Hey! They can't leave!
Where are they going? Get back here!
Go, go, go!
They're leaving.
- They're not leaving.
- Go!
You can't let suspects leave after four people have been killed!
- You really think they're suspects?
- They're not leaving!
Shit.
Ginny!
Extinguishers.
Larry, you got a fire extinguisher?
- Fire extinguisher! Where?
- Back there!
Nobody in there.
Maybe it got so hot, they got cremated.
There'd be something left.
You did this.
You did this!
You told them to get into the car!
Are you happy?
Where is he?
Nothing.
I give up!
I give up!
What the hell do you want?
What do you want, you sick bastard?
What the fuck do you want from us?
I am turning 30 next week and I just want to go home...
...and grow oranges!
It's your birthday next week?
It's my birthday next week.
The 10th.
Me too.
Me too.
Yeah.
George York, May 10.
Alice York, May 10.
Caroline Suzanne, May 10.
Ginny and Lou Isiana, May 10.
Me, Larry Washington,
May fucking 10.
What are the odds?
Must be 10 trillion-to-one.
What is it?
- Where's the fuse box, Larry?
- Other side of the building.
Ginny and Lou Isiana.
Virginia and Louisiana.
Caroline, Carolina.
Paris Nevada.
George York.
Larry Washington.
Rhodes, Rhode Island.
Ed Dakota.
When I was going up the stairs
I met a man who wasn't there
He wasn't there again today
I wish
I wish he'd go away
Who is this?
Who am I speaking to right now?
Where did you learn that poem?
Who am I speaking to?
Look at me.
Who am I speaking to right now?
Doc?
- Edward?
- What's happening?
- Please be quiet.
- He can hear what we're saying?
Of course I can hear what you're fucking saying.
Edward, you missed your last appointment. Where have you been?
- Did I black out again?
- Try and think back.
Where have you been?
All right.
I was driving this actress...
...and we got stuck at the motel.
There was a storm.
We couldn't get out because of the storm.
What happened at the motel?
People started dying.
And then their bodies...
It didn't make any sense.
They disappeared.
Edward, I'd like to show something to you, if I may.
Do you recognize this man?
No.
That man, Edward, is Malcolm Rivers.
He's had a very troubled life.
He was arrested four years ago...
...and convicted of the murder of six people in a violent rampage.
- He did this.
- Detective, please.
Edward, listen to me.
When faced with an intense trauma, a child's mind may fracture...
...creating disassociated identities.
That's exactly what happened to Malcolm Rivers.
He developed a condition that is commonly known...
...as Multiple Personality Syndrome.
Why are you telling me this?
Because you, Edward...
...are one of his personalities.
What?
Jesus Christ! What the fuck did you do to my face?
- Keep calm.
- Where is my face?
- That is your face.
- Why am I tied up?
- Keep calm.
- Where is...?
- Please.
- Jesus Christ!
- Where is my face?
- Stay calm.
No! I'm not gonna stay calm!
Why am I tied up like this?
Who are all these people?
What happened at the motel?
- Where is everybody?
- They don't exist, Edward.
You were all created by Malcolm as a child.
- You're a liar!
- Consider what you know.
- Everyone named after a state.
- No.
Everyone sharing the same birthday.
Your blackouts.
No! I was a cop!
I was a cop in the Rampart Division of L.A.P.D. For six years.
Edward, please.
I live in Hollywood, in a studio apartment.
- You don't live there.
- I do live there!
You don't live anywhere.
I know this is difficult to accept, but the face you saw in that mirror...
...is the face I've always seen when
I talk to Edward or Paris or Larry...
...or anyone else you've met tonight.
Malcolm is in the midst of a medical treatment.
One which forces all his identities to confront one another for the first time.
I knew there would be violence...
...and with it, the number of the identities would be reduced.
Reduced?
One of the personalities you've met tonight, Edward...
...committed those murders four years ago.
He took control of Malcolm's body, as you have now...
...and released an unspeakable rage.
And in 19 hours...
...Malcolm Rivers will be put to death because of those actions...
...unless I can convince that man...
...that the killer is gone.
I need you to stay with me.
Edward?
I need your help.
I need your help to finish this.
Edward, listen to me.
Edward, stay with me.
Listen to me.
I need you to understand.
The killer cannot survive.
Edward!
Got it?
I can't see a thing.
Is there a flashlight?
Hang on. Hang on.
- You got a flashlight?
- Yeah, yeah, it's dead. Goddamn it.
Shut up!
Hey. What am I supposed to wear, man?
You're in it.
Larry.
Larry, come here.
Ed!
Ed!
Larry!
- Larry!
- Paris.
Paris.
Larry?
Larry? Larry?
Where are the keys to the truck?
Where are the keys to the truck?
- That was good, Larry.
- We gotta get out of here.
- Ed has the keys to the truck.
- I got a spare right here.
- Where is he?
- I don't know. Here.
- What are you doing?
- We need a gun.
Holy shit!
Give me the keys to the truck.
Ed!
We gotta get out of here!
- Paris...
- He's coming. He's...
- Stay here.
- What's wrong with you?
Paris, listen to me.
Stay here.
It's gonna be okay.
Throw me the keys to the truck, Ed.
Throw me the keys to the truck.
Stay there. Stay there!
Ed! Ed! Ed!
Ed, let me see.
We gotta get you to a hospital.
We're gonna get you to a hospital, okay?
Stay with me because
I'm gonna get you to the truck.
Put your arm around my neck.
You gotta hold on, okay?
You with me, Ed? Stay with me.
Okay. One, two, three.
You gotta help me get you up.
Ed, you gotta push a little bit.
Ed, why won't you let me help you?
Where did you go before?
What did you see?
Tell me what you saw.
I saw you.
I saw you in an orange grove.
Why won't you let me help you?
Where did you go?
What did you see?
I saw you...
...in an orange grove.
The question, Your Honor, is whether to convict the body or the mind.
His body committed these murders, that is true.
The person who remains inside did not.
Judge Taylor, that may not be true...
We witnessed the destruction of 10 identities tonight.
Nine were innocent and one was guilty.
They're not real!
The violence that existed in him has been executed.
Your Honor, Malcolm belongs in a state hospital.
In the matter of Rivers v. Nevada, it is the recommendation of this court...
...that Mr. Rivers' execution be stayed.
I am transferring Mr. Rivers to state psychiatric services...
...under the care of Dr. Mallick.
Cracked heels and washed-out horns
Blow into my face with scorn
But it's not that way
I wasn't born to lose you
I want you
I want you
I want you so bad
Timmy.
No, please don't.
No, Timmy, please.
What is it, Malcolm?
Malcolm?
Whores don't get a second chance.
When I was going up the stairs
I met a man who wasn't there
He wasn't there again today
I wish
I wish he'd go away
André Polonski, do you wish to take
Marie-Claire Muller as your wife?
I do.
Marie-Claire Muller, do you wish to take...
...André Polonski as your husband?
I do.
Having answered in the affirmative, by virtue of mutual consent,
I declare you bound,
...or re-bound, if I may say so, by the bonds of matrimony.
Would the witnesses please sign?
Please exchange rings.
They're the same ones.
We've laid on a small reception in the main hall.
You seem happy anyhow.
I am.
But it's all for his sake.
I'd have gladly stayed the way we were.
You won't make me believe that.
Why else wait until Guillaume turned 18?
I know you like my own daughter.
I'm no one's daughter.
He seemed the ideal son-in-law, the one who'd take over
Muller Chocolate.
How naive.
Surely he knew Andre was an artist.
And what an artist!
He was already very weak.
He'd been fighting illness for over six months.
My father-in-law?
Poor man!
He was obsessed by his chocolates.
He was right to be proud of them.
Success like his is rare.
I wasn't the ideal son-in-law.
It's sad to say but he died before I could disappoint him.
He was spared the sorrow of your divorce.
As you say.
Can I fetch you another?
- You're too kind.
- You're welcome.
I admire him as a pianist but, as a man, he bothers me.
You're swayed by your affection for Marie-Claire.
You're mistaken.
To be honest, I'm glad they're giving it another try.
That's just like her.
She hates losing.
The situation has changed too.
Polonski's fame is assured.
And Mika's no longer a little girl.
She's strong-headed, she'll stand up to him.
She's not eighteen this time.
You know they've been living together for three years now.
My dear Dubois,
I'm not partial to gossip.
My father gave me this for you.
Thank you, young man.
What's your name again?
Guillaume.
Will you seek a career in music too?
I have no talent for it.
That's such a pity.
What do you plan to do?
We've always called her Mika.
An administration school?
No, my father hates the idea.
Join us at the factory.
You can take over from your stepmother.
My stepmother?
She's your stepmother now.
I can't think of her that way.
He wasn't really playing like before.
On that recording after Lisbeth died, you can tell he's in mourning.
Poor Lisbeth...
Bravo for the exhibition of your mother's photos.
It's a tribute to her talent.
Mika organised everything.
I see now how good she was at her job.
I agree with Mika.
A low-key wedding is better this time.
It was Andre's idea too.
The first one was so luxurious...
There were 500 guests.
And look where it got them.
So, how's it going?
Fine. How about you?
If you're happy,
I am too.
But there are too many people.
I think we can slip off soon.
Are you two plotting again?
I think Mika wants to leave.
- Whenever you want.
- No, when you want.
There's a piano next door.
It's totally out of tune.
Sorry, I have a favour to ask...
For the press... A photo.
Just one little photo.
You're the devil incarnate.
NIGHTCAP
Where have they got to?
They must be playing a tie-break.
Your son's too gallant.
Let them have their fun.
I'm so glad you were able to take Axel on.
It's changed him completely.
Nothing ever interested him before.
He's found his calling.
You'd have done the same for Jeanne.
I don't see how. Jeanne's known what she wants for a long time.
In any case, he's doing well.
His lab chief loves trainees.
A little too much.
I'm sure Axel can manage.
There's no problem there.
Here they come.
I'll put them in the boot.
Afraid of thieves in Switzerland?
Victor,
I think we can eat at last.
You're in no hurry, darlings.
Who won?
He won't lob hard because I'm a girl.
Hurry up, it's 1:15 already.
I'll have a salad with a soft-boiled egg and bacon.
Today's special is lake fish.
I'll have that.
Any heartier fare?
A rib of beef for two?
Okay.
- Rare, right?
- Yes, very rare.
The Coffee's better down here.
Maybe but your cigarette spoils it.
What's my mum like at work?
Not too harsh?
Wonderful, a real pro.
Everyone respects her.
Don't make fun of me.
You've never said what you do there.
- What does he do?
- Experiments.
Something practical and useful at last.
Toxin surveys, sample analysis.
I've become indispensable.
Want to see a film tonight?
If you like. What's on?
I have today's paper.
Fancy that! Look what I've found.
"Marie-Claire Muller and André Polonski"
"announce their wedding..."
Polonski... Isn't he the one from the clinic?
- What clinic?
- He's a top pianist.
- You must have heard of him.
- What clinic?
When Jeanne was born.
- When I was born?
- What of it?
You know, Louise, that mix-up they had.
There was no mix-up.
A mix-up? Are my origins shrouded in mystery?
She doesn't know?
I've put my foot in it.
No, you haven't.
There's just nothing to say.
Mum always has something to say.
Shall I tell you?
You bet!
Polonski's child was born in the clinic on the same day.
His wife, not this one, gave birth while he was performing in Lucerne.
Is that right?
Anyway...
He rushed to the clinic and asked to see his child, before seeing the mother.
She was sleeping anyway.
The nurse went to the nursery and showed you to him saying,
"You have a lovely daughter."
Then he went to see his wife, she was awake by then, who told him they had a son.
He started kicking up one hell of a fuss.
Luckily, your father managed to calm him down. Is that it?
How could that happen?
Babies have a bracelet with their name.
The clinic had run out of bracelets.
They wrote the first three letters of your name.
Pollet and Polonski start the same.
It was dark and the nurse mixed you up, that's all.
I might be Polonski's daughter...
It's just like
Life is a Long, Quiet River.
Oh, please, you can't swap a boy for a girl!
Really?
You father sorted it all out.
I never knew.
Mum, just think, he's a pianist like me.
If Mr Polonski is your father,
I'm not your mother.
And you're still studying to be a pianist, remember.
I'm sorry, mum.
And your father was an artist too.
Yes, I know. I'm sorry.
I forgive you, dear.
- Can I have a cigarette?
- Of course.
Why did I mention all that?
Never mind, the incident's over.
In fact, there never even was one.
- Your father will be furious.
- So don't tell him.
I need to go into town.
Can I take the paper?
Of course, dear.
Don't go dressed like that.
Besides, you said you'd practice every day, even on a Sunday.
See you later?
Yes, I'll call you.
Want me to drive you home?
Do I have a choice?
Can I take the car keys now?
Yes, they're in my pocket.
The papers are in the glove-box.
- That's a pretty dress.
- You bought it.
I did?
You have corpses on Sundays too?
Life goes on.
Paradoxically, they can't wait.
This Jewish gold business resurfaces every year.
- Before elections.
- What's the use?
A prosecutor, a homosexual and from Geneva...
Excuse me.
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
Don't worry.
You're kind.
Come on.
- I'll take your chocolate up.
- I'll do it.
Out of the question.
I see to the chocolate here.
I hope you've made less today.
I had to leave half.
I noticed.
Do you mind me playing?
- Is this disturbing you?
- Yes.
I'm sorry.
What's that?
- The doorbell.
- Expecting someone?
Was that the doorbell?
I'll go.
Good evening.
I'd like to see Mr Polonski.
Do you have an appointment?
Yes... Well, no, but he knows me.
I'll go and see.
What's your name?
Jeanne Pollet.
Tell him "from the clinic".
All right.
He doesn't know you.
Sorry but I can't help that.
What is it you want?
He does know me.
I'll explain to him.
Oh, no! Mika!
I've seen you before, young lady.
You were at the gallery.
You were standing outside.
What brings you here?
Sorry to burst in like this but I absolutely had to come.
I could well be your daughter.
My daughter?
You're out of your mind!
No, listen to me, please.
I was the baby you saw at the clinic.
Of course...
I remember that business.
But I never had a daughter.
Some idiot of a nurse...
Yes, I know.
What if they switched us?
They didn't. Your father explained.
A marvellous man. How is he?
- He's dead.
- I'm sorry.
It was a long time ago.
So it was you?
I kissed you that day.
Will you have a drink with us?
I'd like that.
You were delightful. You still are but I wouldn't have known you.
What will you have'? Fruit juice, white wine, whisky?
Fruit juice, please.
Can you get it, Guillaume?
No, Guillaume dear, in the kitchen.
So what do you do?
I'm doing the Budapest competition.
You're a pianist?
That's incredible!
Let's say, I play the piano.
I was on the jury two years ago.
Yes, I know.
It's tough. What are you playing?
A Bach fugue and prelude, a Chopin study... They're obligatory.
Liszt is harder.
I've chosen Funérailles.
That's a good choice.
But it's full of traps.
You mustn't only play it like a funeral march.
If you can pull it off, you'll triumph.
It's impressive in any case.
And you mustn't try to play it like some virtuoso.
I'd like to see how you manage.
- Pineapple juice.
- Thank you.
- Come on, show me.
- Dad!
The guests will be here soon.
What?
That's right. It is a little late.
Listen... Your name's Jeanne?
Jeanne, can you come back tomorrow?
Yes, of course. Thank you.
- Call me first.
- I don't want to disturb you.
Not at all, I'll look forward it.
Drink up now.
Something to drink, Mika?
No, thank you, dear.
We'll drink enough later.
By the way, would you like to see the self-portraits we have of Lisbeth?
Of course.
Can we go UP?
Yes, go ahead.
Come on then.
You live in Lausanne?
Yes, Chemin du Languedoc.
- Do you believe her?
- I believe her.
What she's saying is true.
You're my son and Lisbeth's.
You weren't switched.
- Did you check?
- Of course.
Her father gave me a thorough demonstration.
It's odd she's a pianist.
If musical talent was hereditary, we'd know.
Don't be ridiculous.
You welcomed her like one of the family.
No, it's not that.
She reminded me of Lisbeth.
You think they look alike?
No, she just reminded me of those days.
We were so happy then.
You weren't after?
After too...
How did she fall asleep at the wheel?
It wasn't suicide, you know.
I don't know. We'll never know.
That's the thing I can't stand.
She was beautiful, wasn't she?
A real woman.
A true woman, if you see what I mean.
I could understand André.
I adored her too.
It may sound odd but we were good friends.
Almost like sisters.
Sisters aren't always friends.
You're probably right but we loved each other.
I'm so clumsy!
I'll get a towel from the bathroom.
Damn, what an idiot!
You'll ruin your handkerchief!
I'm always replacing things I break.
It would leave a nasty stain on a carpet.
What a horrible mess!
I'll wash your handkerchief.
Please, it's nothing.
Don't be silly.
We'll have it washed for when you come back.
You needn't bother.
- I must make amends.
- I'm sorry.
You must be joking!
I'm the guilty one, not you.
I'll put all this in the kitchen.
Have you got the stopper?
For the flask. I left it behind.
I'll get it.
On the chest.
Have you found it?
Here, let me.
You're a darling.
I can't believe how clumsy I am.
It happens to me too...
The door.
André, can you go?
My hands are full.
He invited musician friends, on a Sunday, the staff's day off.
Are all pianists so forgetful?
I forget things but I'm not a good enough pianist yet.
Excuse me, I'm hopeless.
No chocolate tonight,
I spilled the lot.
Miss Pollet, a pianist.
We met at the Conservatoire.
You're Dr Pollet's daughter.
Your father was a doctor?
No, mother's the doctor.
She runs the forensic science lab.
A very important lady...
- Can you show Jeanne out?
- I'll get my shoes.
Call me tomorrow.
I certainly won't forget.
Thank you.
See you tomorrow, dear.
With a clean handkerchief.
Here's our number.
Let's have a drink before dinner.
I'd forgotten it was Sunday.
But we'll be all right.
So, are you happy?
I never imagined I could meet him.
Now I'm invited to play,
I'm more than happy.
- This mix-up...
- What about it?
You believe you're his daughter?
Of course not!
I'm my parents' daughter.
You never believed it for a second.
Of course not.
I just wondered if you...
Funny we have the same birthday.
See you tomorrow perhaps.
Perhaps.
It depends what time.
Can I have some water?
Right away.
What a sight!
Thanks.
Your mother really thinks we're at the movies?
Of course. She's pretty old-fashioned, you know.
You could tell her.
That you're banging me?
I hate it when you get vulgar!
If a woman spilled a flask of chocolate on purpose, what would you think?
Was it really on purpose?
- She knew you could see her?
- No.
- I saw her reflection.
- Not so simple.
In any case, I'm sure.
She opened the flask and knocked it over.
What do you think?
I've no idea.
I'm not Hercule Poirot.
You've got a one-track mind.
Was the chocolate for her?
No, someone else.
She didn't want them to drink it.
Okay, but why?
Why? How should I know?
To stop them putting on weight.
You're impossible...
Or deprive them of a treat.
With a mind like that, you won't last long at the lab.
There's only one solution:
The chocolate was poison.
Maybe you're going a bit too far.
Who made the chocolate?
I don't know.
What's the matter?
Look, I stained it with the stuff.
- Messy, aren't you?
- Oh, come on...
Can you analyse it?
Hold on, I've only been doing the job for two weeks.
Don't look at me like that.
I'll try but I'm not sure.
Can you do it in the morning?
I have to work fast too?
I'll try to do it as soon, as fast and as well as possible.
I'll call you.
No, I'll call you once
I've finished.
You weren't too bored?
Not at all. It was delicious.
I'm going to bed, I'm stuffed.
Shall I make more chocolate?
No, Mika, really.
I don't know where I'd put it.
- Good night, dad.
- Good night, son.
I need water. How about you?
Excellent idea.
Just what I needed.
What's that?
I'm practising for tomorrow.
Liszt's Funérailles.
I haven't played it in ten years.
Well, not so long.
It's what that girl's playing.
I like her a lot.
She's pretty and lively.
And very intelligent too.
An awkward situation.
She handled it admirably.
I'll get it, Marielle!
Why aren't you calling my mobile?
Oh, come on...
Found anything?
Plenty of benzodiazepine.
What's that?
It helps you sleep.
And can it... Can you die of it?
You don't waste time.
You can die of anything.
You'd need one hell of a dose.
Is there a lot?
I haven't checked the concentration.
I set fire to your sweater.
Luckily, I was alone.
They'd have thrown me out.
You learn by your mistakes.
You ruined my sweater.
I'm kidding, I couldn't care less about the thing.
What was that stuff again?
Benzodiazepine.
You know what Rohypnol is?
The rape drug.
I read about it.
You give some to a girl on the sly.
That's easy, it dissolves in alcohol.
You rape her and she can't remember a thing afterwards,
even if it wakes her up.
She never knows she's been raped.
No kidding! I hope you haven't tried that stuff on me.
Are you sure that's what the stuff is?
Not one hundred percent.
But it's similar.
Look, I've got to go.
But if you want my opinion, forget the whole thing.
Benzodiazepine.
The 1999 accounts are approved.
That's all then.
Excuse me but, first of all,
I'd like to raise a couple of brief points.
Go ahead, Patou.
Thank you. Firstly,
I'd like to stress the success of what I call the "lactoline".
An original way of bringing milk directly from the farm to the factory.
Our milk is incomparably fresh and it saves us time and money.
What's the problem?
I'm coming to that.
I observe that, in 1999, sales of the drinking chocolate invented by your father show the only rise.
You agree with me there?
Carry on, please.
Other sales are stationary for the fourth year in a row.
And that's despite end-of-year sales,
...exceptional, of course, that our industry benefited from.
But new centuries are a rarity and I have great fears for next year.
Let's face the facts:
The wide range of non-chocolate products show disappointing results and we must learn from this.
For our customers,
Muller means chocolate
- and nothing else.
- That's in your report.
It's wise not to lose sight of that.
I'd also like to mention the public relations and sponsoring budget.
Given the poor returns, it should be re-evaluated.
My dear, you can't reject everything related to childhood.
People notice and that's bad for us.
It's our stock in trade.
Schools, sports clubs, organisations...
You refuse to help any of them.
It would cost a lot less than your centres.
I'll use my money as I see fit.
It's our money too, in a way.
I know that chocolate secretes endorphines and so on and so forth.
That's no reason to subsidise only anti-pain centres, twelve of them to boot, along with the exhibition of photos by Lisbeth Polonski that I'm not criticising at all.
I should hope not!
It's simple enough:
People shouldn't suffer.
Children suffer too.
You could just offer them chocolates.
Your centres bring in nothing in advertising terms and cost us a fortune.
I won't touch them.
Please don't insist.
However, I think we need to modernise our packaging.
The study results will soon be available.
Keeping up appearances is all that counts.
End of meeting.
Thank God that's over.
I fixed that appointment.
Very good, thank you.
Dufreigne...
Yes?
Forgive my insisting like this but I really must see you.
Of course, Patou.
Without fail?
- I promise.
- I'm counting on you.
Good-bye, dear, have a nice evening.
Thank you, Patou, you too.
Old papa Dufreigne is getting to be a pain.
My appointment?
At half past.
In twenty-five minutes.
Your appointment, doctor.
She's in your office.
Tell Dr Vernay to take over until six.
- Very good.
- I'll call in on him.
Dr Pollet?
I'm Marie-Claire Polonski.
Thank you for seeing me.
I'm here about Jeanne.
Jeanne?
Yes.
You probably know she came to see us yesterday.
Yes.
She didn't bother you?
Not at all. It was a surprise but it was a pleasure to get to know her.
Sit down, please.
Would you like some tea?
Well, I wouldn't say no.
Nathalie, could you bring some tea, please?
Two cups.
And don't forget the milk.
You can leave after.
You didn't forget the milk?
Is there anything I can do to help Jeanne?
She asked for help?
But I believe everyone needs help.
- Milk?
- No milk or sugar, thank you.
She doesn't need help.
She just needs to grow up.
She could do with a father.
She told us he was dead.
She seemed upset about what happened at the clinic.
My husband too, in fact.
Could she be his daughter?
On an emotional level,
I'm sure she isn't.
But, on a professional level,
I know unlikely situations are sometimes real.
So you have doubts?
No, just a scientific mind.
I suppose you must have checked blood groups and so on...
My blood group matches your husband's.
Your husband had the same group as Mrs Polonski... as mine.
You all have the same blood group.
So there's some doubt.
Not for us.
There may have been for our gynaecologists.
The blood groups are in the files.
You left it at that?
Surely your lab could have helped.
Things aren't that simple.
I didn't have this lab back then.
Above all, what you suggest is illegal.
Only a judge can ask for such tests.
My husband and I had no doubts,
I promise you.
Is that why you came?
No, not at all.
André has no doubts either.
He was pleased to meet Jeanne.
So was I.
I was glad that she came to call.
Wonderful.
Would you like more tea?
No, thank you.
I've taken up enough of your time.
I was just worried about Jeanne.
She seemed bothered by it.
It's terrible, I'm always meddling.
It's very kind of you.
You have wonderful facilities.
Are you State financed?
Partly. We have contracts with private bodies for research.
Really? I could finance you then?
Yes but I don't see what research...
...Muller Chocolate could require from a crime lab.
There's no obvious link but if you need anything, let me know.
Don't worry about Jeanne.
She manages very well alone.
And she has her mother.
Your tempo's better.
I played it faster.
That's not the problem.
Did you feel like a good pianist?
- Not at all.
- That's okay then.
- Have you heard Arrau's recording?
- I don't think so.
It's surprising, nothing like a funeral march.
It is, but in a subtle way.
You'll notice if you listen again.
Don't try to copy it, it would be a disaster.
I play it very badly.
Not at all.
You're not playing the right way.
There's a percussive side to Liszt.
Supple wrists and finger control have to be forgotten.
Try to keep your wrist as hard as steel.
Control has to come from the arm and forearm.
You understand everything.
Well, a fair share of control...
It works for Bartok,
Prokofiev or Stravinsky.
Petrushka is astounding on the piano.
Back to work.
Your turn now.
Why do you always make it the day before?
It's better that way, Marguerite.
That's the secret.
A convent mother superior found it out.
Why?
The lactic ferments have time to develop.
If it's all chemistry then...
I'll make the Aztecs' chocolate soon, with turmeric, ginger, cinnamon...
- Let me.
- Heavens, no!
That's better.
The final chord must be more terse, clear and final.
Release the pedal and strike it.
I'm not interrupting you?
I've made the chocolate.
We've finished for the day.
And we've done some good work, haven't we?
That's not up to me to say.
How can I thank you?
That's easy. Work on all this and play it for me tomorrow.
Meanwhile, sample Mika's chocolate, the world's eighth wonder.
Where's Guillaume?
He isn't in his room.
He went out around three.
Just after Jeanne called.
Yes, I called around three.
He's enjoying his holidays.
What's he studying?
Ancient languages this year.
I hope it lasts.
It Will.
Here, Jeanne.
I met your mother this afternoon.
You saw my mother?
I was very impressed.
What an intelligent woman.
And so composed too.
She adores you. You're lucky.
How come you saw my mother?
Well, I asked for an appointment.
You've unsettled us a little.
Hasn't she, André?
It was a surprise. A pleasant one.
I think it's upset Guillaume a great deal.
I'm sure that's why he's out.
That's ridiculous.
I know but that's how it is.
Drink up before it gets cold.
Your mother is as sure as André about what you told us.
You learnt about it recently?
It must have been a shock.
Not particularly.
It was the coincidence mainly.
The fact that I'm a pianist too.
It is amusing.
What do you think?
Delicious.
I'll make some every time.
Get to work. See you tomorrow.
I see André's using your first name now.
May I do the same?
Mrs Polonski, I'd be honoured.
Then you must call me Mika.
Good-bye, my dear.
Finished your act, have you?
We were all wondering where you were.
Sure... The little family's worried about me now?
I wanted to see you.
Sure... What is it you're after?
- Nothing...
- You're pathetic when you try to look like my mother.
And when you try to play like dad.
Listen, stupid. Your chocolate was drugged yesterday.
- Are you crazy?
- No.
- I swear it's true.
- How do you know?
Through my mum's lab.
Your mother handled it?
No, my boyfriend's a trainee there and he ran the tests.
What tests? On what?
I'd splashed my sweater with it.
This is crazy! Why on earth did you run the tests?
I saw your stepmother spill the chocolate on purpose.
Mika? That proves it, you really are crazy.
She made the chocolate herself.
She always does.
She'd never let anyone else do it.
So?
You're trying to say she drugged it?
I'm just telling you what I saw.
That's ridiculous.
I mean, why would she do it?
So, according to you, she drugged my hot chocolate and then spilled it to make sure I wouldn't drink it?
There's only one explanation:
You're out of your mind.
Believe what you want. I've warned you, my conscience is clear.
I've had all I can take of the Polonski family!
Wait!
Why would she hurt me?
She's got my father back now, she's happy.
How did your mother die?
She fell asleep at the wheel.
You've seen the road up here.
It was fatal.
- Did they do an autopsy?
- Yes.
Maybe my mother did it.
I don't know. They found sleeping pills and alcohol.
It was my tenth birthday.
My father performed that afternoon.
When we came back here for dinner...
You were living here?
Isn't it the Mullers' house?
We had no fixed abode.
We mostly lived in hotels.
Mika invited us to live here when we were in Switzerland.
She said that the pianos got bored without dad.
Not only the pianos, I'd say.
She'd left a beautiful bicycle in my room.
I fell when I ran back downstairs to thank her.
I really sprained my ankle.
I couldn't even use the bicycle.
After dinner, mother had a small cognac.
That was a habit:
Every evening after dinner, a small glass of cognac.
Then we realised that dad was out of sleeping pills.
That was a disaster because clad can't sleep without pills. He's hooked on them.
So mum decided to drive into town for some.
She went off the edge of the road.
Was she taking sleeping pills too?
No, never. That's what no one could understand.
Dad wouldn't understand if you never came back.
You don't know what you want.
I can't say yet. I want to work with him, that's true.
I need to think it over.
Take care of yourself.
You'll have to get some more.
It's my last one.
Don't worry, I'll go tomorrow.
It's all planned.
I need some aspirin too.
I really enjoyed my session with Jeanne today.
Know what?
She makes me young again.
I noticed.
Does she play well?
She could, without the bad habits that her idiotic teachers have given her.
She's lucky she's met you.
Absolutely. Tomorrow, I'll see if she's understood what I said.
I'm reserving my opinion for now.
Won't Guillaume be jealous?
Jealous? Why would he be jealous of a student?
She didn't come as a student.
That old business.
Think it's still bothering him?
What about her?
She never mentioned it.
She could be my daughter.
I'd like to have a daughter.
What if we tried to have one?
Tonight?
We can start tonight.
No, not tonight, silly.
Why not?
You'll doze off on the job.
- I won't.
- You will.
You're always in a rush to take your pills.
Tomorrow then.
Tomorrow, if you take your sleeping pill afterwards.
You're beautiful and reasonable too.
True, I am starting to doze off.
I'm like a kid, aren't I?
Not always.
Carry on reading, it doesn't bother me.
No, you're sweet, but I'm sleepy too.
Good night, sweetheart.
Good night.
Sleep well at least.
If you want to make her work, shouldn't she spend a few days here?
Just a second...
I need to wake up!
I'm sorry, the milk was boiling over.
Forgive me, doctor.
It's Mika Muller here.
My husband is so impressed by your daughter's talents...
I don't know what to say.
Jeanne isn't up yet.
I'm sure she'll be flattered by your husband's opinion but I don't know her plans...
That doesn't matter.
She's coming to see my husband.
If she wants to stay, we'll have a room ready.
Board and lodging along with the music.
It will be a very great pleasure for us.
- You look pale.
- I didn't sleep well.
Breakfast is ready.
Do you ever relax?
I was up. What else could I do?
Make toast if you want.
That was Mrs Muller.
- They've invited you to stay.
- Really?
Her husband likes the way you play and wants to coach you a little.
He has to go to Germany next week.
Yes, I know...
What did you say?
That I'd tell you but I didn't know your plans.
What do you think?
You're old enough to decide.
I've no idea.
But I feel like accepting.
That's that then.
You don't seem pleased.
I'm not an unnatural mother.
I'm glad Andre' Polonski thinks you're talented. Very glad.
But they want to monopolise you and you're getting all worked up.
You can't manage two days without your daughter?
Pretentious thing!
I hardly ever see you anyway.
You're always with Axel, playing tennis... or seeing movies.
I want to go.
Go but remember, you're not Polonski's daughter.
- That's all over.
- I'm not so sure.
I know you. I made you.
What's that tone?
I'll use the tone I choose.
I'll spend two days with them.
I'll never stop you from doing what you want.
But your father isn't your father.
Polonski, you mean?
I didn't say that?
No, you didn't.
You said,
"Your father isn't your father."
Polonski isn't your father nor was my husband.
You're telling me this now?
So who is my father?
Jean asked me never to tell you.
I didn't agree but I promised.
I didn't agree so now you know.
Jean was sterile.
No doubt about it.
We had to face the truth.
I considered adopting...
But your father chose.
He begged me to try insemination.
It worked straight away.
There you go.
You're my daughter and Jean loved you.
Don't go looking for another father.
Sperm straws, was it?
He was terrified you'd hold it against him.
He didn't want people thinking he was impotent, which he wasn't.
Even the clinic didn't know.
It's been hell keeping quiet.
I've felt so dishonest with you.
Now I feel dishonest with him.
Maybe I shouldn't have told you.
You've been keeping a lot from me.
It'll do me good to get away.
I'm going, mum.
Don't worry but I'm going.
What are you doing?
Gathering snails.
- Snails? What for?
- To eat.
It's the season.
We have a guest today.
Your little twin.
Jeanne, your father's student.
Really?
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.
Not at all.
Mr Dufreigne, please.
It's Mrs Muller.
Patou, it's Mika.
Yes, me too.
Listen, if I came by on Sunday, would that suit you?
In the afternoon? Perfect.
I'm delighted.
We'll get everything sorted out.
Take care, Patou.
Stupid old fart!
You don't look too happy about this.
It's not that.
Don't ask me anything, okay.
Shit!
I'm doing you a big favour.
It's no fun, driving you up here.
I'd rather spend two days with you.
Your mother will be mad at me.
Did you see her at work?
Yes, briefly.
How was she?
Just like you.
She was sulking.
What's up?
Have you fallen out?
Don't ask.
She's been a bit heavy-handed.
Oh, come on, she's wonderful!
Where is this place? Berchtesgaden?
You're an angel.
I don't know what you're up to, but if you want to return to civilisation, give me a buzz.
Jeanne, welcome.
Let's get to work.
No, you're not there yet.
You're trying too hard and it's obvious.
You're loosening up.
It was better before.
Sorry, I don't think I can.
Don't talk rubbish.
Like this.
- Don't you feel well?
- I'm fine.
This isn't natural for me.
It isn't for anyone. It's all concentration and hard work.
So concentrate and work hard.
Imagine the sound you want and make it.
There, much better.
Mika says that lunch is ready.
Marguerite's leaving early today.
Stop right there.
Time to eat!
I hope you're hungry.
All true musicians have one thing in common.
They love their food.
You don't regret coming to work?
No, not at all.
Actually, I'm glad to be able to get away for a while.
Did your mother object?
Not exactly, no.
Put it on the table, we'll serve ourselves.
I'll get the side dishes.
I'll help you.
I'll take the vegetables.
Clean the sauceboat, there's a splash on it.
You can go straight after.
You angel.
I haven't seen Joseph in ages.
Dessert's in the fridge.
Fine, don't worry.
Do you know
Britten's piano concerto?
I think I heard it once.
Not one of his best but truly fascinating for a pianist.
The whole piano part requires you to brush over the notes.
It's the exact opposite of Funérailles.
Nothing is ever stressed.
And yet the piano part structures the whole piece.
Have some meat while it's hot.
It isn't played often, because of its qualities.
It's thrown plenty of colleagues.
Have you ever played it?
Once or twice but I'm like the others.
It's a lot of hard work for an unsatisfactory result.
You should try it.
Your touch would suit it.
I have other problems.
- You've fought with your mother.
- Why?
Because.
I'm sure you've fought with her.
Guillaume, please.
You're being tactless.
I hope it isn't true.
Your mother's a wonderful woman.
I don't want to talk about it.
- Let's talk about Mozart.
- Andre, please...
Jeanne, listen to me.
You never really fall out with your parents. I was adopted.
What's going on?
Everyone knows.
I never knew my real parents.
But I had other parents who gave me their name and love.
I was rebellious at times, like any girl, to assert my personality.
Especially alone with father.
But I realise now that we never really fought.
That was impossible.
You understand?
- Was it good?
- Delicious.
You can tell Marguerite.
Who wants coffee?
- Jeanne?
- No thanks, not for me.
Guillaume, can you help me?
- Let me help.
- Certainly not!
We'll have it in the lounge.
Whatever you want.
Why didn't you try the Haskill competition?
I wasn't ready.
Exactly...
The dishes can wait.
Can you grind the coffee?
Is Jeanne like Lisbeth?
My mother? No.
Well, maybe a little.
I think she's in love with you.
Well I'm not.
Pity, you'd make a nice couple.
What?
Her father's dead, your mother too.
What of it?
I want everyone to be happy.
You have some funny ideas.
Oh my God! I'm so sorry!
Sit down on the chair.
You poor thing.
- Hold on, my shawl.
- Jesus...
I'm really sorry.
I can't believe I'm this clumsy.
I'm really sorry.
Stay here, I'll get a bandage.
Just a second.
Put this on it for now.
I'll be right back.
Here we are.
A greased bandage for burns and analgesic cream...
I feel better.
It's stinging less.
It isn't serious but it still needs bandaging.
Like a real professional.
I wanted to be a nurse once.
What's going on?
I wanted a glass of water.
I've been clumsy again.
I tipped boiling water over his foot.
Look at this bandage.
Brilliant!
- Does it hurt?
- Not now.
- I'm terrible.
- You didn't do it on purpose.
- You wanted some water?
- For André.
I'll take it to him.
Can you walk?
Of course.
She does nothing by halves.
Shut up. Don't talk rubbish.
You've scalded your foot?
- It was my fault.
- He didn't move his foot.
It's no big deal.
I'll lie down in my room.
Can you manage?
I'm okay.
I want to watch the TV for a bit.
I can manage.
Will smoked salmon and blintzes be okay for dinner?
My favourite.
- Guillaume? Smoked salmon?
- Wonderful.
I'll go into town for it.
Can I take Jeanne?
Jeanne's not here to shop but to learn to play the piano.
Back to work, young lady.
These yoghurts have bright colours.
Aren't there any chemical flavourings in them?
No, we make nature-identical flavourings.
What do we mean by that?
They're flavourings just like natural ones,
using the same molecules as nature
but instead of nature making them,
a chemist made these molecules.
I've found some Danish salmon and a bottle of aquavit for those who like it.
Is Guillaume upstairs?
We haven't seen him.
Jeanne's playing well.
I'm sure she is.
Are you okay, sweetheart?
Of course, Mika. It's nothing.
I've found two new tapes for you.
Lang's Secret Beyond the Door and Renoir's La Nuit du Carrefour.
Brilliant.
I'm happy then.
You'll ruin your eyes.
I'll call you down for dinner.
Let me help you.
That's kind of you.
You're hardly limping anymore.
It still hurts but I'll be fine tomorrow.
Jeanne's a good pianist.
We had a great session today.
I heard you upstairs.
Have you enjoyed your holidays, son?
I don't do much to tire myself.
You can say that again.
Mika found me two great tapes.
So you'll forgive her.
At that rate, she can scald my foot every day.
What's so funny?
You.
- Why?
- We love you.
Where's Jeanne?
She insisted on doing the dishes.
The machine's still broken.
And you let her?
She wanted to. There are only four plates plus the cutlery.
Want your chocolate?
Yes, please.
You too, Guillaume?
No, Mika, I'll have coffee tonight.
Well I never!
Get yourself a cup then.
I only brought one for Jeanne.
I wait on you hand and foot.
I could have come and fetched it.
I'm exhausted.
I'm going to abandon you but feel free to carry on if you want.
Mika and Guillaume won't mind.
Not at all.
Can I have my Rohypnol?
What?
My Rohypnol, sweetheart.
Oh my God, I completely forgot!
I was so upset about scalding his foot.
I even forgot the prescription.
What are we going to do?
I'll pop into town, what else?
No, don't go out now.
I can go if you want.
Would you? That's kind.
But you don't know my car.
It's okay, I won a rally last year.
There's a prescription?
I'll fetch it. Drink your coffee, it'll perk you up.
You take Rohypnol?
Yes but they're banning it soon.
I don't know what I'll do.
I'll come with you.
There's no need.
I want to.
You're really very kind, Jeanne.
The night pharmacy's at the station.
I'm going with her. I know it.
With your foot?
I'm not fatally wounded.
And Jeanne's driving.
I'd prefer him to go with her.
If last time...
What?
Nothing.
Drive safely, I'm in no rush.
See you later.
She left her coffee.
No, she drank it.
It's Guillaume's then.
Why didn't he want chocolate?
They've gone.
She seems to drive well.
She does everything well.
She must have her faults like all of us.
She knows what she wants.
She'll get it.
She's gifted and stubborn.
When I look at Guillaume, idling around with no ambition...
He's young.
Give him time.
At eighteen, children start to disappoint you.
That's rubbish.
You handle it well.
I love this.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
The machine's not working.
Why are you washing the cups?
To clean them. You know that...
What are you doing, Mika?
You can see.
Yes, I can see.
And on the night Lisbeth died, you washed the glasses.
Yes, I washed the glasses.
I washed the glasses.
- What's got into you?
- Look at me.
My God!
What's her mother's number?
It's in our address book.
Why did you switch our cups?
I thought
Mika put something in yours.
See, you believe me.
Hello, Doctor Pollet?
It's André Polonski.
I'm calling about Jeanne.
I can't explain but she's in danger.
Call her mobile. She's in our car.
Tell her to stop and wait.
I'll explain later.
Here's my number... 6161007.
Come here.
Come here.
I have a knack for doing wrong.
Look out!
Sorry, I feel as if
I'm going all numb...
It's wrong when I pervert good.
The more violent it is, the more it appears as good.
I give, I give and I can never ask.
I didn't even ask to live.
You received life like everyone else. You can't deny that.
I don't understand.
I never understand when you speak.
I know what I am. I'm nothing.
So...
What have you done to them?
Tell me what you've done.
You know how I cherish Guillaume.
You should tell him.
Guillaume's like me and we're not like you.
My mother never thought I was a genius.
I'm just a hanger-on.
You don't realise how much you've helped me. Thanks to you I...
I know, I help everyone.
I helped Lisbeth too.
But you adored Lisbeth...
I let her do what she wanted.
I only put Rohypnol in her cognac.
Why did you do it?
You loved her...
That makes no difference.
Instead of loving, I say,
"I love you," and people believe me.
I have real power in my mind.
I calculate everything.
It's in God's hands...
I think I need to feel tired occasionally.
You understand?
Why am I telling you all this?
What have you done to them?
Who?
The children.
Nothing.
Why would I do anything to them?
I put Rohypnol in the coffee.
Are you angry?
What a question!
Are you angry?
You fool everyone.
Some people fool themselves.
Oh my God!
They're dead.
They're dead?
No, your luck ran out this time.
Just damage to the car.
They're not hurt.
They're at the police station with Jeanne's mother.
They'll be coming back soon.

Good morning, beauty.
Let's go, or we'll never leave on time.
I'm totally ready.
Come on. I'll make you some waffles.
- Mother....
- Caitlin.
Blueberries!
Hey, Cooper.
You want some breakfast too?
You want some waffles?
Good boy.
Look. They're at it again.
Christ, that's twice in....
When did they move in?
Three weeks. What's their name?
Feur, I think. Psych department.
Figures, they're all nuts.
She's awake.
We'll be quiet.
Quick and quiet.
I don't want to be either.
- When's she out of here?
- Norman Spencer!
All right, I can't stand the rejection. I'm going for a run.
Hey, you okay?
Yeah.
Come on, Pooper. Let's go.
We'll have to leave by 11 if we want to beat the traffic.
Eleven o'clock.
You know, you can call me...
...whenever you want.
Sweetheart...
...I've known this day was coming for a long time.
I have Norman, and the garden and the new house.
You really don't have to worry.
- I'm just saying--
- Really.
Okay.
Mom?
Mom?
Mother?
I have to go.
Honey, if I don't get you out of here quick, they'll make you enroll.
- I'll call you.
- Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Come home often.
Call your mom.
- Beatrice, it's nice to meet you.
- Bye.
- You take care of each other.
- I won't go to a bar without her.
I'm just kidding.
Bye.
Well, I almost made it.
What are you reading?
"Genetic Repair Mechanisms in Eukaryotic Organisms."
Eukaryotic. How is it?
Excellent.
Oh, a couple of...
...Swedish sailor cells just gang- divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
Almost there.
- If you have to work....
- No, no. Just let me get this.
Okay, almost.
There.
How's it going?
Great. I think we cracked it.
The prenatal thing?
Yeah, I targeted repair.
You are so brilliant.
Yep.
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk...
...Norman Spencer.
Yes!
How are you?
- I'm fine.
- Yeah?
I am. Yeah, really.
It's okay if you're not, you know.
To tell you the truth, I'm...
...excited.
Really?
Yeah, I'm gonna get my life back.
Get some time for myself.
Some time for us.
Did a great job.
She's a good kid.
We did.
Just us now.
I know.
Tired?
Nope.
Want to fool around?
Yep.
Jesus.
What is he doing to her?
- I guess they're making up.
- Wait.
Leave it open.
Think we can take 'em?
It's worth a try.
Do the brilliant Norman stuff some more.
And speak up.
Oh.
Hello?
Ouch! Ow!
Hello?
Mrs. Feur?
Hello?
Are you all right?
He's so....
It's too much...
...and I can't....
I can't breathe.
And I'm afraid.
What? What are you afraid of?
That one day I'll just...
...disappear.
Is there something I can do?
Can I...?
I've never even met you.
I know. I'm sorry.
I've been consumed.
This fence...
...it's so....
I'm sorry. Listen, would you like to come over for coffee, or--?
Oh, God, he's back.
I'm sorry. Please forget what I said.
I don't even know you!
Please!
She sounded...
- ...terrified.
- Of what?
Of him, I think.
Did she say that?
More or less.
I want to go over there.
Let's go and--
- Why?
- To see if she's all right--
Honey, we're not going to march over to our new neighbors and accuse them--
- That's not what I'm suggesting.
- Especially since they'll keep us up...
...with their sexual olympics.
What if something happened to her?
- Nothing will happen.
- I'd never forgive....
Honey, people argue.
People fight.
It's not our business.
- I've got to work tonight.
- I know.
This conference is the first big preview of my paper.
I've just got to stay focused a little while longer.
This is what I've been working for.
I just wish you could have heard her.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll call Harvey Tomes tomorrow in the psych department...
...and I'll see what I can find out about him.
Promise?
Yeah, I promise.
Hey, lady!
What are you doing?
Looking for you.
What are you doing?
Just trying to drop off this welcome thing for the new neighbors.
Not home?
Guess not.
- You are so good at this.
- If I were, I'd have done it weeks ago.
I gave my neighbors wine that someone left at my house.
- Are you staying?
- Just came by to see how you're doing.
Good. I'm good.
Are you?
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
Because your only daughter just left for college...
...who you're extremely close with.
I'd be tripping.
Oh, right.
You had a hell of a year too.
The move, the new house...
...the garden.
The car.
A minor setback.
Was that a year ago?
This week.
Wow. Now Caitlin.
Big stress stuff.
Okay.
I'm a little tender.
Good. You're human.
And so far this week, my big task is to take pictures of my roses...
...for the garden club.
Got here just in time, didn't I?
Brought you something.
It's Kambucha mushroom tea.
It soothes heartache and promotes psychic wellness.
- Floriana suggested it.
- So you discuss me with your psychic?
No, and she's not really a psychic.
Just an enlightened spirit.
Like me.
That's worse.
You're gossiping about me.
Notice anything different?
Oh, my God. You bought it!
Yep.
Nice.
It's a beautiful thing, alimony.
You lose a husband...
...get a car.
- Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
- Absolutely.
Cool.
I have to run. You take care.
Thanks for the tea.
Norman.
Norman.
- Norman!
- What?
Come here. You have to see this.
- What's the matter?
- Look.
What, Claire?
I thought I saw....
- I--
- What?
- I thought I saw something.
- Jesus Christ!
Ow.
Hi, is Caitlin there?
Any idea when she'll be back?
You be sure to tell her I called?
Thanks, Beatrice.
Well, that's a first.
Cooper, come on.
Get your ball.
What's the matter?
Cooper, it's your favorite ball.
- Hello?
- Hi.
I'm stuck here for another couple of hours. Sorry.
Unless you want me to come home?
No. No, it's fine.
You sure?
Claire?
Huh?
Oh, absolutely. Take your time.
See you soon. Love you.
Love you. Bye.
Cooper!
Cooper!
Fine. Have it your way.
We use different kinds.
Now we're using halothane.
Halothane? Is that a sedative?
It's a dissociative.
It paralyzes motor function but leaves her conscious.
She can't move but knows what's going on.
- Hi, Mrs. Spencer.
- Hi, Teddy.
- How long does that last?
- Five minutes.
- Sometimes three.
- Can it be used on all mammals?
Yeah, any procedure where you want to get the patient immobile, pain-free.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Hi. What are you doing here?
- Are you okay?
- I....
I heard noises.
- What kind of noises? Where?
- At the house. I was scared.
- Did you call the police?
- No.
I'll have the police check on the house while I'm gone.
Oh, great.
"Could you check in on my wife?
She's hearing voices."
Wait till that gets around.
I'll be in New Haven for the conference. I want you to feel safe.
I do.
I'm sure it was just...
...nothing.
Did you call about the Feurs?
Oh, yeah.
Harvey says the guy's harmless.
Wouldn't hurt a flea.
Warren. Warren Feur.
What about her?
I know he told me....
Oh.
I met Schumway today.
Who wrote that book you love.
They were doing some spiel for the chemistry department...
...so Bob Shine introduces us.
You'll love this.
He looks right at me...
...and congratulates me on Spencer's Theorem.
He didn't know your father was dead?
He knew.
Oh, Norman.
What?
You're so sensitive about that.
- No, I'm not.
- You are.
You always overreact.
I'll have to watch that, won't I?
Was it Mary?
Mrs. Feur.
Warren and Mary?
Yeah.
Mary. That's it.
I'm gonna do some work.
Hello?
Mrs. Feur?
Can I help you?
Oh, yes.
Hi.
I'm Claire Spencer, from next door.
Nice to meet you.
I wanted to stop by and welcome you to the neighborhood.
Thank you, but this really isn't a good time. I'm running late.
Is your wife home?
No, she isn't.
When will she be back?
I have to go.
I'm sorry. It was nice to meet you.
What's he doing?
Eating dinner.
Alone.
TV dinner.
That's bad.
That's my shiatsu guy.
Listen, call me back if he starts in on some serial-killer dessert...
...like ladyfingers.
- You got it.
- Bye.
Where did you go?
Shit!
Jesus, Claire.
- What the hell are you doing?
- I was looking--
- Spying.
- Spying on Mr. Feur.
- How come you're not dressed?
- Dressed?
Dinner with Stan.
- Tonight?
- Tonight.
- We're going to be--
- Fashionably five minutes late.
Are you saying he murdered his wife?
Is that so ridiculous?
She was terrified...
...and now she doesn't answer the door, but her car's in the garage.
Maybe she was out, or in bed with the flu.
- Or maybe she was abducted by aliens.
- Who are you calling?
- Restaurant.
- We're not at the center of the bridge.
You can't get service until the center.
I know we're not at the center.
There. See?
Well, that's a relief.
Hi, Stan.
Hey, Claire. Norman.
- Sorry we're late.
- It's my fault.
We just got here.
- Where's the new squeeze?
- Here I am.
- This is--
- Elena?
Oh, my God. Claire!
I don't believe it!
- This is--
- We know each other.
- Norman.
- Hello, Norman. How do you do?
Claire, look at you!
You look beautiful.
Here was this brilliant conductor in purple bikini briefs...
...with no bangs...
...cursing his ass off in Finnish.
Oh, Claire.
I made an honest woman of her.
How long have you been in Vermont?
Oh, well, Norman grew up here.
Remember Beau Flynn, head of cardio at the hospital? He was just sacked.
I just dropped her off at college.
He was involved in some stalking incident. An intern, some girl.
We're getting so old!
They don't screw around with that anymore.
- When did we last get together?
- New York.
- Of course. Right after--
- Right after Michael died.
- Michael who?
- Marlov.
Claire's first husband.
- Oh, the musician.
- Yeah.
You know, we all toured together.
Have you heard her play?
No.
No, I....
I would sit on-stage...
...during Claire's solo...
...and I mean, truly, I had tears streaming down my face.
I mean, she's fabulous.
So why did you stop?
Oh....
Well, one night, after a concert...
...I met a dashing, handsome...
...genius scientist...
...and three months later,
I was married.
Is that when you guys moved up to Vermont?
No, we were living in Boston...
...when Norman was offered a position.
A position.
The DuPont Chair in genetics.
I see. So now you're teaching at your father's school here.
I actually don't...
...do much teaching anymore.
I run a research project.
Oh.
Norman's father had this old stuffy--
--stately place on a lake.
- Which we're renovating.
- Practically gutted.
- No, we didn't.
- Yes, we did.
"Gutted."
- Wait till you see it. It's beautiful.
- It is beautiful. You'll see it.
It's haunted.
No.
Is it really?
Claire's hearing things.
What? What are you hearing?
I, um....
I don't know. I heard...
...voices, whispering....
A picture fell.
You know, I completely believe in all that.
You do?
I do.
Wait a minute.
Who do you think it is?
I know exactly who it is.
It's my old man.
He's pissed about us dicking around with the house.
Ow.
Claire.
Jesus....
It's all right.
Calm down, Claire.
It's okay.
Whose idea was it?
Mine. His.
We both thought....
I didn't want to come here.
- Then why did you?
- He was worried about me.
- Your husband?
- Yes.
I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of Prozac or lithium...
...so he can live out his life in peace.
- Do you really think so?
- No.
Are you on medication?
No. Well, Valium.
For sleeping.
Having trouble sleeping?
Sometimes.
When I get anxious.
Do you get anxious only at night?
No, I only take Valium at night.
For sleeping.
Why do you get anxious?
I don't know.
Why do you think your husband's worried?
Because....
I don't know.
Because ever since Caitlin left--
Ever since my daughter left for school...
...there have been....
I've been....
Why is this so hard?
Here. Have a fireball.
Thank you.
It's hard because I'm a complete stranger...
...and you're talking about incredibly personal things.
Besides, most people, when they come the first time, are wondering...
...if I think they're crazy.
Don't worry. I'm required...
...to have three sessions before I can commit.
That was a joke.
These are good. They're hot.
There's a ghost in my house.
I saw her in the water, beside me...
...in the bathtub.
What does she look like?
She looked like...
...me.
Oh.
Only she had green eyes.
Any idea who she is?
Maybe. But I'd rather not say just yet.
Fine.
What do you think I should do?
Try to contact her.
Communicate with her somehow.
Find out what she wants.
What do you want me to do?
Go buy a Ouija board?
Ah.
Are we hoping the ghost will have to use the potty?
This is where she was.
This is where I...
...saw her.
That makes sense.
- Where did you finally find one?
- Kmart.
I think we're supposed to sit in a protective circle, aren't we?
What's that for?
- Where did you get it?
- Never mind.
You stole her shoe.
You have to have something of the dead woman's.
Says who?
Is that blood on it?
I don't know. Just place your fingers on the message indicator.
Okay.
We wish to commune...
...with the spirit--
What?
"Wish to commune."
- Forget it.
- What?
No, this whole thing is insane.
I'm sorry.
What's her first name?
Mary.
Feur.
Mary Feur, Mary Feur....
Mary Feur....
We wish to communicate...
...with the spirit of Mary Feur.
- Not much happening.
- Shh.
What was that?
It's flickering.
Yeah.
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.
Cooper!
Listen...
...about our little séance.
Norman doesn't need to know.
- I won't tell if you won't.
- It's just that...
...ever since the accident...
...he treats me like I'm this...
...fragile, loopy....
Well, I am seeing ghosts in the bathtub, aren't I?
You did wrap your car around a tree doing, like, 80.
He was pretty shaken up.
- We all were.
- It was an accident. A year ago.
I'm fine.
Right?
Of course you are.
You're just not much of a medium, however.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Get some rest.
Did you pick up any dudes yet?
I have one in the trunk.
Bye.
What do you want?
She's dead.
- Who's dead?
- You know damn well who's dead.
The Feur thing.
Listen to me.
He killed her and I'm not crazy.
Jody and I had a séance in the bathroom, and nothing happened...
...but when I went back there she was there. She was.
Wait a minute.
You had a séance?
- Are you angry with me?
- What?
- Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
- No.
You know what I've got at stake for this paper. How important it is to me.
I can't help feeling that you're trying to sabotage me, to hurt me.
Norman, this isn't about you.
Something is happening to me.
And it's not to get even, and it's not some warped bid for attention.
Something is happening in our house, whether you like it or not.
Claire.
Claire, stop.
You're overreacting.
Don't tell me how to react.
- Will you keep your voice down?
- I will not!
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I am losing my mind.
But what if I'm not?
What if she died...
...some horrible death?
Can we please not do this here?
Oh, wow.
You.
You think you're smart, don't you?
You think you got away with it.
Well, I know you killed her, you murdering son of a bitch!
Who?
Don't give me that shit.
Your wife.
She's very upset. Forgive us, please.
Honey.
I didn't kill my wife.
Are you all right?
Come on, honey.
Come on. Let's go.
I'm sorry.
You all right?
Oh. Yeah.
I'm fine.
What happened? Just now?
I just saw Norman's face.
He was so frightened for me.
How's your marriage?
Good. Really good.
We've had our moments, I guess...
...but he's a wonderful husband and father.
I mean, sure, he can be obsessed with his work...
...and sometimes it's like...
...that he doesn't see me.
Or, you know...
...like I'm....
That there's something wrong...
...with me.
That can't feel good.
No.
Okay.
I see where you're going with this...
...but my marriage is fine. No.
I have had some kind of empty-nest episode...
...where I saw...
...some things that weren't there.
Let's deal with that.
I'm willing to deal with that.
"Thought you might need this.
Love, Jody."
Uh-oh.
Mrs. Spencer.
I wanted to apologize for scaring you like I did.
When I thought about how it must have seemed--
Please. Let's just....
Claire Spencer.
Mary Feur.
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- Very much.
That day at the fence...
...you seemed terrified.
I don't think I imagined that.
No.
What were you so afraid of?
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone...
...that you couldn't breathe?
Thought that your time together was so...
...passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they'd leave?
Um....
Sure.
I couldn't catch my breath...
...and I panicked.
I never dreamed anyone would hear me.
I tried to leave him.
I went to my mother's in Providence...
...but he brought my things up...
...in the middle of the night...
...during the rainstorm.
He pleaded with me to come home.
You must think I'm pathetic.
No.
I don't.
I'll be quick. I've got to get Sidon to okay my budget before his trip.
What's Templeton's wife's name again?
Lois. Phil and Lois Templeton.
Don't let her corner you, she'll chew your ear off.
- Evening, Phil.
- Here they are.
How do you do? Hi.
Hi. Nice to see you again, Lois.
White wine, please.
How are you holding up?
Just fine. It's a lovely party.
Norman was telling me the house is finished.
- Almost.
- Wonderful.
It's good to see you doing so well.
Thank you.
Well, I was worried.
I don't think I've seen you since
Norman's reception here last year.
You were worried?
I swear, I've become that nosy old lady
I used to run away from at Amherst.
No, I'm just not sure what you mean.
You got so upset.
Oh, at the party.
For the DuPont Chair.
You remember?
Well, I remember the party, but....
Oh, God!
I had completely forgotten.
I broke your crystal.
Oh, my dear.
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.
But you went completely pale.
You couldn't catch your breath.
It was as if you had seen a ghost.
"Missing girl."
Madison Elizabeth.
M-E.
Frank.
Madison Elizabeth...
...Frank.
M-E-F.
Claire?
Hey, good morning.
Up all night?
Mm-hm.
You okay?
Do you remember this?
It's the girl that disappeared last year.
Did you know her?
No.
Claire, I'm afraid to ask.
Where's all this going?
It's her.
The woman I saw in the bathtub.
- The ghost?
- Yes, the ghost.
I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not.
I'm positive this time.
Claire, stop it!
Stop it.
I know you're going through something
I don't understand.
I have tried to be here for you, but this is enough, Claire.
Enough.
Do you want to go see somebody together?
I'll call Dr. Drayton.
Then what, Claire? What?
Tell me what to do.
It's her.
So let me ask you this....
Mr. McCain?
- McCann.
- McCann.
Nothing was ever found?
No car, or...?
Listen....
This girl's a real live wire.
She drives around in a souped-up
Mustang convertible.
Most people think she's...
...off around Mexico or somewhere with her friends.
The police downgraded it to a runaway.
Her mother lives out here in Addison County.
- Mrs. Frank?
- Yeah?
I'm Claire.
I wanted to talk to you about Madison.
Just plain coffee.
- None of that mocha nonsense.
- Fine.
You look a little old for a student.
I'm not a student. We met at a party.
Well, that sounds about right.
I never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.
She liked to read a lot, though.
Sometimes she'd lock herself up in her room for days, just reading.
They wanted to put her in a school for the gifted when she was young.
Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
I don't know where she got it.
She didn't get it from me.
She probably got it from her father's side of the family.
She never really mentioned her father.
Yeah, well, she wouldn't.
She was 12 when he left.
Never spoke about him after that.
You don't even need the sound.
You can pretty much tell what's happening by the faces.
I turn it up sometimes, though.
Feels like there's someone here.
Why are you here?
I don't know.
You want to see her room?
Full scholarship.
Princeton too.
She wanted to stay on the East Coast.
You must be so proud.
These are the last pictures taken of her.
The police used this one.
Let me get that. Excuse me.
Claire?
Claire?
- Hello, Dr. Spencer.
- Mrs. Spencer.
Forbidden fruit.
You got a problem with that?
Guess this means you're not mad at me anymore, huh?
I wouldn't go that far.
Ow.
Take it easy, huh?
What's got into you?
- Ow!
- What's the matter?
It's too rough.
Since when?
This is a brand-new--
Shh.
- Okay, Claire, that's--
- Why don't you shut up, professor?
Why don't you just...
...shut up?
I think she's starting to suspect something.
Who?
Your wife.
Stop it!
You know.
What the hell are you doing?
I know.
I was there.
Just before the accident.
I remember now.
What?
I came to the door.
There was whispering.
I saw you in the mirror...
...lying there with her...
...in our house.
Claire, listen to me.
She was at the DuPont party...
...staring at me. It was her.
That's why I couldn't breathe.
That's why I dropped the glass.
Honey, that was last year.
We were having troubles.
So you slept with a fucking student?
- That's not what I'm saying.
- Don't touch me.
Get away from me.
Get out!
I said, get out!
Fine.
Claire, please, please.
I gave up everything.
Claire, please don't....
- My life, my music.
- I never asked you to quit.
There was never any other choice!
You had to topple perfect daddy.
That meant perfect wife.
- Perfect family.
- That's not fair.
You were touring with a baby...
...and you were happy to give it up.
When you did, you hated me for it, so you gave it all to her.
- Who?
- Caitlin!
Leave her out of this.
And then some bright young woman finds me attractive.
- Stop it!
- And I slipped!
- God help me, I slipped!
- I'm not gonna listen.
- Claire, I tried to break it off.
- You should've tried harder.
I was in Adamant.
In Adamant?
You know, that artsy little hippie village a couple hours away down on 7.
I stopped at this café to get coffee, and I see Norman sitting in the back.
But he wasn't alone.
It was a young blond woman.
I didn't see her face.
I didn't think anything of it at first.
And I was walking over to say hello.
And they started arguing in such a way...
...that it stopped me.
Then a few days later, you were in the accident.
And I get a bizarre call from Stan working at the hospital...
...asking me, was I with you that day?
If you were upset about anything.
He made it sound like you had deliberately...
...driven your car into a tree.
And I thought, "Oh, my God.
Claire's found out."
And when I went to the hospital,
I see Norman.
And he was so desperate at the thought...
...of losing you.
I couldn't say anything.
Please...
...don't hate me, Claire.
I don't hate you.
Hello, this is Miss Jody.
Can't get to the phone. Leave your name and I'll call you back.
Jody, it's Norman.
I'm looking for Claire.
Will you please...
...ask her to call home, please?
I can't talk to him.
Will you call and tell him
I'll be home in the morning?
I have to ask him something.
Norman?
Norman?
Norman!
Oh, God!
Norman!
- How's his blood pressure?
- How about his rhythm?
- Rhythm is normal. Normal sinus.
- No sign of arrhythmia.
- Good.
Pulse/ox is normal.
His pupils were equal.
I'd still like to take you down.
I'm fine, really.
Dr. Powell, I'd recommend a cardiac workup.
- I'll take care of that.
- He needs to sign the release form.
Thanks, guys.
They can take you for a CAT scan tomorrow if you start feeling dizzy.
I'm not going to the hospital...
...unless they have a miracle drug for clumsiness.
Honey, I'm so sorry.
Thank God you came home.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
You know, if that breaker hadn't popped, he....
I know.
Yeah, don't worry, Claire.
You just keep him quiet tonight, okay?
You might want to think twice about keeping anything electrical...
- ...next to the tub.
- Oh, thank you.
Goodbye. Call me, okay?
I called you last night.
I left a message on Jody's machine.
I want you to answer one question.
Did you have anything to do with her disappearance?
Yes.
I had an affair with her.
And when I tried to break it off...
...she became unstable.
She came out here to the house.
She threatened to kill herself...
...or you.
I didn't think she'd go through with any of it.
But then she....
She disappeared.
It was her, Norman.
She tried to kill you.
- Claire.
- You said it yourself.
She wanted you dead.
Are you saying I was attacked by a ghost?
You had an affair with a girl...
...who threatened to kill herself, and now there's a presence in our house.
A young, blond girl.
Don't you get it?
She did it, Norman.
She's dead...
...and now she's trying to hurt you or both of us.
- You don't know that she's dead.
- Of course we do!
It's the only thing that makes--
Oh, God.
It's my fault. I....
I opened the door.
- Madison. I stole her hair.
- From where?
- And it gave her power.
- Claire.
Nothing attacked me.
There are no ghosts.
It was an accident. I'm fine.
It's not your fault.
Are you listening to me?
- Yes.
- Claire, say it.
Say it:
"It was an accident.
It's not my fault."
Say it, Claire.
I need to go lie down.
I didn't sleep last night, and I need to lie down.
I want to be alone for a while.
Hey, Teddy, it's me.
Right, yeah.
What's the name of that friend of yours? That who-you-gonna-call guy?
The guy that does the paranormal psych stuff?
Holodnik.
Could you contact him and ask him to give me a call here?
I'd really like to talk to him today.
Hello.
Yes, this is he.
Thanks for calling back.
No, sir. That was my father.
Yeah, he passed away a couple of years ago.
Yes, he was. Thank you.
Look, the reason I'm calling is....
I'm a little out of my depth here.
Someone who is very close to me...
...believes herself to be or seems to be...
...in contact with some kind of...
...entity or spirit, and--
No, there's no...
...no history of delusional behavior.
Well, I guess what I'm asking is, is it possible that she could be...
...causing these manifestations...
...through some kind of unconscious or telekinetic--?
Uh-huh.
Is there anything else that it could be?
And this has been documented?
Really?
I'm sorry, but could I call you back...
...or have you call me back?
Please, yes, that'll be great.
Thank you, sir.
Claire!
Claire!
Claire!
You all right, Claire?
The braid!
Where's the braid?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
This?
Is this what you're talking about?
- Where'd you get this?
- I took it from Madison's house.
This is hers?
This is Madison Frank's hair?
What do you think?
I really don't know.
Norman.
Yes...
...I believe you.
You're playing.
She's gone.
How do you know?
I can feel it.
I picked up the book you ordered at the bookstore.
Claire, I don't know how to apologize to you for what I've done.
But if you give me another chance...
...I promise I'll spend the rest of my life making you glad that you did.
Please.
Last sail of the year.
Beautiful, isn't it?
We ought to take a drive before the leaves all disappear.
- Stay at a little bed-and-breakfast.
- Look for antiques.
Yeah, we haven't done that for a while.
Adamant.
- Adamant?
- An artsy little village down 7.
Supposed to be charming.
- Do you know it?
- No.
Maybe we'll stop there for lunch.
What's that for?
Nothing.
God, oh, God....
You don't understand what that is.
Don't I, Norman?
That's Madison's necklace.
You killed her, didn't you?
I did not.
I didn't kill anyone.
Jesus, Claire.
Listen to me.
When I got here...
...she was already dead. She killed herself in our house to destroy me.
Do you think I'm stupid?
She left that for you in the garden, with a letter.
I burned the letter and threw the box in the lake.
A week before...
...she showed up at the DuPont party.
I was terrified.
She insisted, so I agreed to meet her here.
When I got here...
...she had taken pills.
I tried to revive her, but...
...she was gone.
There was nothing I could do.
So I put her in her car...
...and I drove to the boat ramp...
...and I rolled it out into the lake.
I made a terrible mistake.
I know that.
But tell me, Claire.
What should I have done?
Should I sacrifice everything?
Our marriage?
My work, which I spent my whole life on?
Tell me, Claire.
Tell me, please. Because we can put this behind us.
Our life can go on.
It's not too late.
What are you asking me to do?
I'm asking you to forgive me.
That girl must be brought up.
Hello. This is Dr. Norman Spencer.
I have some information...
...about a missing person.
Madison Frank, yes.
Could you send an officer out to the house, please?
15 Willoughby Lane.
It's about a mile from the bridge.
Okay.
Thank you.
I'm gonna go get dressed.
Information. What city?
Don't!
Stop it!
I begged you, Claire.
I pleaded with you.
But you wouldn't let it go.
Oh, Claire.
I never wanted any of this to happen.
All I ever wanted...
...was for you to love me.
Be proud of me.
To be happy.
She was going to go to the dean.
She would have ruined us.
Did she think I was just gonna sit there...
...and watch it happen?
You have no idea what it was like.
Hold her underwater...
...watch her life slip away.
But she gave me no choice.
And neither have you.
I can't figure out how you put it all together.
At first I thought you knew.
Thought you created the whole ghost thing as an elaborate trap.
Then I realized you believed it.
It was a passive-aggressive masterpiece.
The first time I met you...
...all I ever wanted was to spend the rest of my life with you.
It's not gonna happen now.
Too cold.
I almost froze to death laying here...
...wet, naked, pretending to be electrocuted.
Hey, Coop.
How you doing? How you doing, boy?
Let's go get your ball. Come on.
Come on.
Jody, it's Norman.
If you're there, pick up, please.
It's Norman.
Listen, Claire and I...
...had a terrible blowout.
Could you do me a favor?
I'm sleeping at the lab. Could you check on her in the morning?
I'm worried about her.
Thanks.
The halothane's starting to wear off.
I'm sure in some...
...tragic way, your suicide is gonna...
...help bring Caitlin and I closer together.
And every time I look at her...
...I'll see you.
Oh, God.
What's this?
Oh, shit.
I'm on the bridge!
Somebody help me!
I'm on the bridge!
No!
I beg you...
...think of Caitlin.
Please, don't. Please.
If you get a chance, get over to Marin.
Check out the Marin County Arts Fair.
It's amazing.
It will be going on through this Thanksgiving weekend.
Well, nothing's changed.
We've got fog and low clouds...
in both the East Bay and here in San Francisco.
And we're lookin'at a high of 68 degrees once these clouds burn off.
The time now is twenty-three after 7:00.
Oh, my gosh.
Stick with your girl.
We'll be coming at you with more music.
Hello!
I don't know you
Don't know those melancholy eyes I see
Yoo-hoo!
Tommy, turn it off.
We gotta make a baby.
Yeah?
I can't do that now. 'Cause I got a drainage issue with a floor in Paris that...
- We have an issue that needs to be resolved first.
- needs to be resolved first.
- Right now?
- It's red.
Okay, I'll talk to you later.
- I thought you had a sentence hearing.
- I do, so we have to hurry.
We've got seven minutes for us.
Fifteen minutes for resting with my hips elevated.
And I'll only be four minutes late if I check my messages in the car...
- and there's no traffic on the bridge.
- Okay.
How about ten minutes for us and twelve minutes for hip elevation?
- Nine and thirteen.
- Okay, deal. Come here.
No. No, no, wait. It's actually supposed to work better if you're on top.
Okay.
I thought I'd never hear you say that.
So nice.
The pressures of being a man is hard
Don't think I don't understand
I know what they said, reduced sentence, but I think I can get a new trial.
Claire, I don't know if we should bite off that much.
It's a first offense.
We can ask for leniency.
The jury forewoman is an advocate.
She's not an impartial juror.
I'd hate to push. This is a rape case.
I don't wanna piss the judge off.
Trust me on this, Alex.
Tell me you're joking.
Your Honor, my client is looking at serious time in jail and irreparable damage...
- while these guys are laughing all the way to CNN.
- That's ridiculous.
Your Honor, juror number nine is a rape victim.
And very much to her credit, she's a major fund-raiser for a sexual assault hot line.
I point out that the prosecution should have submitted those facts at the voir dire.
- The prosecutorial misconduct does not stop there.
- Really? How do you figure that?
This very D.A.'s office handled juror number nine's case eight years ago, and I find it impossible to believe...
- that no one on their team recognized her.
- This is outrageous.
Ms. Kubik, do you feel that justice was served?
We're very pleased that Gary Norris will be receiving a new trial.
His victim might say she's been raped all over again. This time by the system.
My heart goes out to her.
But when the rights of any defendant are violated, we are all at risk until injustice is redressed.
- Good job.
- Thanks.
Good job.
I need to talk to you.
Good! I need gossip.
- That was luck, Kubik.
- Ooh, just like your Bruins last night. Sorry.
- She scores again.
- The heart of American democracy beats on.
- Would you punch up my calendar, please?
- Personal or business?
Both. Thanks.
- Hi, big guy.
- Good work, Claire. We're proud of you.
Thank you very much.
I guess I'll type "partner" in right here next to January 1st.
I didn't know you were clairvoyant.
Really?
Are you serious?
- We'll see.
- Yes!
Not bad.
I think that was just lucky.
- Bring it on, girl.
- Pretty.
- Pretty nice.
- Pretty lucky.
- Well--
- I'm taking you to pool school.
I don't think you have a shot.
Thirteen ball off the five in the corner pocket.
- Not in this lifetime, pal.
- Oh, yes.
Okay.
That is not fair.
That is not fair!
You can't hold--
You can't use your left hand now.
You're a mutant.
Hey, guys, look!
This was the scene in City Hall earlier today.
Ms. Kubik, do you feel that justice was served?
We're very pleased that Gary Norris will be receiving--
His victim might say she's been raped all over again.
- You look great! Look at you!
- When the rights of any defendant are violated,
we are all at risk until injustice is redressed.
- About the family--
- Wow.
I just want one.
- Honey, lock the door.
- Huh?
Someone's in the house.
Leave!
- Hurry!
- Wait up!
Damn kids.
It's okay, honey.
- 225 Dover. Send somebody right away.
- They're gone.
Are you okay?
Oh, God.
I'm fine.
Uh-oh, cute baby alert.
Hi. Can we meet your baby? Hi!
What a doll.
He's in a pretty good mood.
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on our troubles will be miles away
There's this, uh, well--
Doesn't he have on a T-shirt?
The T-shirt was just a huge hit afterwards.
Men all across America were buying T-shirts.
I always liked
It's a Wonderful Life.
Nice. Christmas domestic.
Yeah, that's the spirit.
Interesting. Real interesting.
Keys please.
What is it, baby?
F.B.I.!
- Get down!
- Get down, honey.
- What?
- Get down!
Get down on the ground now!
- Get him!
- Get down!
Leave her alone!
- You cuffed him? You cuffed him?
- I cuffed him, yeah.
Screwed up the whole thing.
You know you're looking at a multimillion dollar lawsuit, right, Mr. Mulkins.
Excess use of force, harassment, reckless endangerment.
- How's that for starters?
- It is "Mullins," Mrs. Kubik. Special Agent Mullins.
You have a warrant for the arrest of someone named Ron Chapman.
My husband is Tom Kubik. Your computer is obviously having a psychotic break.
It wasn't our computer.
If your people had gotten any closer, you would have burned the guy, all right?
Fine. Forget about it.
It wasn't our computer.
It was Marin P.D.
They ran the fingerprints after your house was burglarized. I'll tell you something else.
The A.F.I.S. flagged your husband's.
They've been in the system for 12 years.
Once again, what is he being accused of?
- I'm sorry, but I can't tell you.
- Oh, come on!
You know that having been subject to arrest,
I have the right to know the charges.
No, you don't. Not when it's a military court, and not when national security is involved.
Military court?
Hello?
Thank God I caught you. I was freaked out that you were gonna be out of town.
And I caught you on the news. Claire, you have to stop letting them mess with your hair.
- Jackie?
- I just need some money. I hate to ask--
Well, not really, but can you just help me out? Please?
My landlord's breathing down my neck as we speak.
If you say no, I'm gonna be evicted.
Can you come get me?
I know what it could be.
Maybe what it is is that he did something that he doesn't even know he did.
- And so he's in like witness protection.
- That's enough, Jackie.
Just stop it please.
Sorry.
Next time you need help, call your other sister. Oh, wait.
- You don't have another sister.
- I didn't call you, Jackie. You called me.
And I came to pick you up and it's the first time you've tried to see me in months...
by the way.
The base is in San Lazaro.
It's 45 minutes south of L.A. on the coast.
I booked you a flight into
John Wayne Airport in Orange County.
- Okay, with luggage?
- Luggage, rental car.
You should be on the base between 11:00, 11:30.
Good afternoon, ma'am.
May I see your I.D. please?
All right.
Mrs. Kubik?
James Hernandez.
Ron and I were in the same unit.
This must be a terrible shock to you, ma'am.
- But if there's anything I can do.
- Anderson.
Atchison. Chapman. Green.
Ron was a good marine.
Now, I won't keep you. Good luck.
- Thank you.
- End of the hall, ma'am.
Room "B," ma'am.
What the--
- Where the hell are his clothes?
- Suicide watch, ma'am.
- I want clothes put on him!
- You'd have to file that request with the brig command.
Is your name Ron Chapman?
Yes.
How--
I-- I don't know what to say.
I had no choice.
I had no--
I had no choice.
They were accusing me of something that I didn't do. Please believe me.
Believe you?
Well, I believed that, um...
- you were raised in a foster home.
- I was.
- That you were never married.
- Claire.
That you don't have any children.
That you love me... Ron.
Tom.
Whatever your name is. Oh.
I do love you.
But I did not do this.
Okay?
I swear... that I never did this.
And I didn't want to tell you...
'cause I didn't want you to leave me.
What happened?
My lawyer's here.
Mrs. Kubik?
Sorry to interrupt.
First Lieutenant Embry. Terrence.
Hi.
Um, I'm older than I look.
So--
Well, I'll let you two--
I'll wait in the--
Claire.
Just let me go talk to him, okay?
- First Lieutenant, is that what I call you?
- Lieutenant.
Why the hell haven't you filed a request to get him out of those chains and into clothes?
Right, yeah.
I'll take care of it.
I'm an attorney.
May I please see the charging document?
We call it a charge sheet.
Fabulous. May I see it?
Can you give me the basics?
Article 85, desertion.
Article 90, assaulting or willfully disobeying a superior commissioned officer.
Murder? Nine--
Yes, if convicted, he'll get the death penalty.
Shi--
Who's prosecuting?
Major Lucas Waldron has been detailed as trial counsel.
- He any good?
- The best.
How 'bout you?
I do okay.
Have you ever won a case?
No.
I'm going to defend you.
I know you didn't kill nine people.
- Mrs. Kubik--
- I don't want you involved in this.
- I'm already involved.
- You don't understand. Military law is not the same.
I'll learn.
We're gonna fight 'em, okay? Together.
You remember those three American kids?
The students who were killed in that cafe in El Salvador, back in '88?
There was a little town called Monte Azul.
A member of a rebel group threw a satchel bomb into that cafe.
- Press had a field day.
- Right. Everybody went nuts.
So they call up my unit,
Detachment 27, to locate the rebel leader who was responsible.
He was a terrorist by the name of Danilo Chacon.
- And your orders came from?
- Our C.O. at Camp Lejeune. Bill Marks.
- Anyways--
- Wait. I'm sorry.
Brigadier General Marks?
Special Representative to the
Joint Congressional Committee... on Military Appropriations,
Bill Marks?
Yes. He was Colonel Bill Marks back then.
Under his orders,
we were sent into a little village called Las Colinas.
It's not even a village, even.
Just some fields, a few huts.
Danilo Chacon was supposed to be hiding out there.
And--
It was supposed to be routine.
Um, but somebody lost it.
I hear gunfire.
By the time I get to the other end of the village,
nine people are slaughtered, and uh-- goddamn.
I-- I'm just standing there.
Old women,
men, kids, just dead.
And I lost it. I, uh,
I jumped the guy who did it.
And next thing I know,
I'm looking at first degree, nine specs.
- Who did it?
- Hernandez.
Jimmy Hernandez.
He ordered me to keep my mouth shut.
Said he was teaching them a lesson, that Marks would back him up 100%.
- I told him to go to hell.
- Major Hernandez?
- Mark's top aide?
- Yes.
Um, he introduced himself to me yesterday in the waiting area.
What?
What? Claire, I want you to listen to me.
I want you to stay away from him.
He's extremely dangerous.
Do you understand?
So, General Marks--
See, he's like the most decorated,
most powerful, most--
And you're saying you were framed... by General Marks and his special assistant.
Th-That's our defense?
Yup.
Claire, would you sit down for a minute?
I'm not gonna pretend
I'm looking forward... to seeing the firm's name even remotely connected to this.
As it stands now, nobody knows
Ron Chapman is Tom Kubik.
- Alex, my husband is innocent.
- I'm not considering any other possibility.
And I'm even less interested than you are in seeing his name associated with a mass murder.
Claire, I-- I just want you to understand...
all the possible unforeseen consequences.
Alex, I'll make it real easy for you.
If the firm's name gets dragged into this, you don't have to fire me. I'll resign.
Hey, Josh, remember that thing from the 20--
Thank you.
Claire, can I do anything?
Yeah. I need a lawyer.
Somebody from the Marine Corps.
Somebody who's beaten 'em before and is hungry to beat 'em again.
Where will you be?
Bill. Bill.
William.
I'm looking for a Charlie Grimes.
Well, don't tell me you need a lawyer, because you are one.
I followed the Norris case.
Talk about a rabbit out of a hat.
- Are you Charles W. Grimes?
- You just can't get over my decorator, can you?
Welcome to Grimes and Associate.
- Associate?
- Delilah?
Rumor has it that you're a very good attorney, formerly of the JAG Corps.
In another life.
And you had an affair with your superior officer's wife, and they pushed you out.
Let's not dwell on my youthful offenses,
Mrs. Kubik. What do you want?
The military has set up my husband.
And they've assigned some junior varsity lieutenant to defend him.
- Who's prosecuting?
- Waldron.
Tell your husband to cop a plea.
Try to make a deal with the judge.
Military justice is to justice as military music is to music, Mrs. Kubik.
Wake up and smell the napalm.
Charlie, you're not gonna believe this shit!
They busted me again.
It's like every time I turn around...
they slap handcuffs on me.
That's because every time you turn around, you've got some private's privates standing at attention, Lola.
I perform a very important service for the military.
There's a novel defense.
- You do somebody at the base too?
- Yeah, actually.
How about your lawyer here?
Is he any good?
When he gets off his ass, yeah.
How about it, Mr. Grimes?
- Man, turn this shit off.
- Nice to meet you, Lola.
- I'm due in court in an hour.
- In an hour!
- Jackie?
- I'm here to help, 'cause what are sisters for?
Wow.
Tacky.
You got evicted, didn't you?
- What happened to the money I sent?
- Too little too late, too much credit card debt.
- All I need's an extra phone line.
- What for?
My new job.
Psychic hot line.
Don't laugh, I'm really good at it.
Twenty-nine past the hour--
Otherwise, kick back.
I got you covered, wall-to-wall.
- Good morning, Lieutenant.
- Good morning, Mrs. Kubik.
I'm gonna kill that goddamn clock.
- Hi, G.I. Joe.
- Ma'am.
"Ma'am." Claire, did you just hear that?
He called me "ma'am."
Shall we?
Yeah, let's get outta here.
So I do not need any security clearance for the pretrial portion.
Yes. The only portions of the trial that are classified are those... pertaining directly to the incidents in El Salvador.
I just-- You know,
I hope she didn't think I was staring.
- Who?
- Well, your sister.
Don't worry about it.
She understands. She's psychic.
Okay.
Well, what do you know?
Mr. Grimes has decided to join us after all.
Mrs. Kubik, you do know that Charlie Grimes has a history of being a major drunk?
Are you sober, Mr. Grimes?
Four hundred and sixty-two days, Mrs. Kubik.
Ain't life grand?
Fill me in.
- Pretrial hearing is in ten.
- Ten what?
Minutes.
What?
You don't think they'll be impressed with leather?
- Who's the judge?
- Colonel Farrell.
Yeah, it would be.
Full bird colonel at his terminal rank.
He'll piss all over us because we're civilians.
And he won't give a shit about reversals down the line because he's about ready to retire.
You file any motions?
- Absolutely, dismiss charges, insufficient evidence.
- Motion denied.
- You haven't even read the brief.
- No doubt neither has Farrell.
- The military judicial system is based on denial.
- Then we fight the whole system.
No, no, no.
You play by the rules.
You do not fight the system.
Fight the system, you lose.
Isn't that right, Embry?
Say, "yes, sir."
- Yes, sir.
- Don't be a sap, Embry.
Nobody in a uniform can think for himself.
This is a pretrial hearing. The goal is to listen and not reveal anything.
- Do we have anything to reveal, Mrs. Kubik?
- Claire.
- Claire?
- No.
No? Then that ought to work.
- Which one's the prosecutor?
- Trial counsel. We call them trial counsels.
- Mrs. Kubik, I'm Major Waldron.
- How do you do?
Hi, Lucas.
Charlie Grimes.
Nice to see you.
Bullshit.
All rise.
Be seated.
This Article 39-A session is called to order.
I'm Colonel Farrell of the U.S. Marine Corps.
Where the hell is the accused?
Charlie Grimes.
I'll explain later.
Sergeant Chapman, you see the charges against you. How do you plead?
Your Honor, before my client submits a plea, would you please address our motion to have all charges dismissed?
Motion denied. Since you are painfully unfamiliar with our court-martial system, we don't have clients here.
Sergeant Ron Chapman is the accused, and I'm still waiting for the plea.
I plead not guilty. Not guilty.
You may be seated.
Your Honor, prosecution requests the court's ruling... on the permissibility of the accused being represented by his spouse.
- Your Honor--
- I'll allow it.
Thank you, Your Honor.
The prosecution requests a short pretrial period to ensure security.
Granted. Opening statements are scheduled for one week from today.
Objection! Your Honor, there's no way we can prepare defense for a capital case in one week.
Noted and overruled.
Are we done?
Your Honor, I'd like to add, the defense has no intention of waving our right to a public trial...
as guaranteed by the sixth amendment.
Your Honor, this case involves national security and classified information.
We would like defense counsel admonished that any attempt to try this case in the media... would be a direct violation of this court's order.
Your Honor, co-counsel and I are civilians and not subject to military orders.
Any such orders, sir, will be taken for informational purposes only.
Be advised, counsel, that civilian or not, you can go to the brig and be disqualified from participating in this trial altogether.
All rise.
And so it begins.
See you soon.
He's supposed to be the best.
What the hell was that?
I said you should follow the rules.
I'm the wild card.
- You could've gotten us thrown off the case.
- Nah, it's too early.
See, if they think we're gonna go public, we might get an idea how scared they are.
What do you think, "Embry-o"?
I think, "Why me?
Why was I assigned to this case?"
Seven guys in Tom's unit, and all of them say he did it.
But only two of these eyewitnesses are on their list.
Hernandez and Troy Abbot.
Now what happened to the other five?
Uh, dead.
- All of them?
- Dead how?
Two were killed in combat, the Gulf and Panama.
One was murdered.
And the other two, accidents.
Accidents, huh?
I know a couple of P.I.'s, ex-Green Berets.
Not very ethical, but maybe they could get us the unofficial version of how these guys died.
Could be useful.
Here we go.
Troy Abbot, Sacramento, California.
Doing four to six in Lompoc, armed robbery.
And Waldron's office is trying to expedite his parole.
Now, why am I certain he's gonna succeed?
- 'Cause it's the Marine Corps. "Be all you can be."
- That's the army.
Mrs. Kubik, I really think our theory should be that Hernandez acted alone.
No one's gonna believe that
Brigadier General Marks was in on this.
In other words, you don't believe it.
Wh--
Mrs. Kubik, that's not my point.
- Do you believe Tom or not?
- Hey, easy. He's just expressing his opinion.
Isn't there something you should be doing somewhere else?
Not really.
Can I get you another coffee, sir?
Uh, no, ma'am.
I'm good.
Okay.
Girl. Sit down.
Come here.
I'm gonna have to agree with Embry.
A guy like Marks... smells, looks, tastes credible.
Put him on the stand, he's just gonna give Hernandez credibility.
- Right, that's what I'm saying.
- Well, young man's had an original thought.
- You know what?
- What?
- Go to hell.
- Another one.
- Hello?
- Mrs. Kubik, will you hold for Major Waldron?
Yes, I'll hold for Major Waldron.
- Mrs. Kubik?
- Hello, Major.
Why don't you folks come down to my office about 8:00?
- Let's try to work something out.
- We'll be there.
I can't believe it.
They want a deal.
I love being a wild card.
But, Mr. Kubik, sir, voluntary manslaughter, only one specification, that's only five years.
Plus one condition, that you sign a nondisclosure agreement. And as your counsel, I--
Claire, tell the man to take the deal of the century.
Sweetheart?
Honey, I won't do five minutes for a crime I didn't commit.
Do you have any idea, any of you, do you have any idea what it's like to spend 23 hours a day in a six-by-eight cell?
Five years in Leavenworth.
They'll make sure I'm dead long before that.
So, motion denied.
Come on in.
Based on our conversation--
That's all right, Major.
We're here to tell you we're gonna pass.
Thanks anyway.
Mrs. Kubik.
Personally, I'm quite happy to go to trial with this case, but there is a lot of interest in putting this thing behind us.
It works for everyone: command and your husband.
And Major Hernandez and General Marks.
See you in court, sir.
Here on the
Fantasy Jewelry Hour.
You can expect to pay $199 for a ring like this.
This beautiful piece is available--
So, no deal.
Can you believe I asked my husband to do five years in prison?
Go ahead. Tell me what a waste of oxygen all lawyers are.
So if you're on the phone, don't get off the line.
- You're not gonna wanna miss this.
- That's right.
You're curiously quiet on the subject.
Jackie, would you please turn that down?
I mean, come on--
Your husband came to my village and killed my family.
And it's true, lawyers are a waste of oxygen.
- Drop this deal, Mrs.--
- Jackie? Mrs. Kubik?
Jackie? Oh, my God.
He ran out!
Claire?
Claire, are you okay?
Bastards!
It's Hernandez.
Oh, goddamn.
We turned down their deal, and he's trying to scare us.
Baby, you don't know how these people work.
I don't know how any of it works.
- What do you mean?
- This other life of yours.
You don't believe me, do you?
Of course, I believe you.
Baby, I'll take a polygraph.
There's no need for it.
It's not even admissible in court.
The hell with the courts.
I wanna do it for us.
Hey, Ronnie. Or Tommy or Paco or whatever it is.
You haven't changed a bit.
- Major Hernandez, this is an unethical exparte--
- I'm just here to help.
- What are you doing here?
- Hey, you oughta plead this out, Ace.
Major-- Tom, don't!
Stop it! Stop!
You're making it worse!
Who let Major Hernandez in?
He's not authorized to be here!
- See? Look at your killer!
- He is provoking my client!
- Who is in charge? Who let him in here?
- Look at your killer!
- He's not supposed to be here!
- Major Hernandez said he was a defense witness.
He is not a witness for the defense!
Who is in charge?
I wan-- I want to talk to whoever is in charge!
Is your real name Ron Chapman?
Yes.
Regarding the incident at
Las Colinas on March 15, 1988,
- will you answer my questions truthfully?
- Yes.
Did you actively participate in the death of anyone... during the 15th of March 1988 shootings?
Mrs. Kubik?
You passed.
Of course I passed.
Are we being monitored?
No, it's absolutely secure.
Absolutely secure?
What do you mean?
What do you think I mean?
And, Lieutenant Colonel,
- were there any eyewitnesses to this massacre?
- Yes.
We had seven eyewitness statements all I.D.-ing Chapman as the shooter.
Thank you.
Nothing further, Your Honor.
Colonel LaPierre, you were and still are... a special agent with the
Criminal Investigations Division...
- in charge of this investigation, yes?
- That's correct.
So, when you say that the investigation was not flawed, you're basically giving yourself a big thumbs-up.
I'm just expressing my opinion.
So help you God, no doubt.
Now, is it possible, Colonel, that these so-called witnesses were coached before you got your hands on them?
I guess it's possible... but unlikely.
Mm-hmm. And are you aware... that of the seven witnesses, two were subsequently killed in combat?
Yes, I'm aware of that.
And another three, three relatively young men, have died as well?
- Yes.
- Let's see.
There was a Lieutenant Allen of Longview, Texas: hit-and-run.
A Sergeant Stenstrom of Taos,
New Mexico: accidental drowning.
And the other, an unfortunate mountain climbing fall.
- That sounds right.
- Does it?
Well, that's interesting, Colonel, seeing as how I just made up those causes of death.
I mean, there was no accidental drowning,
and no mountain climbing fall.
I do have the details of these tragic deaths, including a fatal home-invasion robbery, if you care to look at them.
I'm-- I'm a little fuzzy on the details.
- I wasn't in charge of those investigations.
- No further questions, Colonel.
- My investigation was strictly by the book.
- No further questions.
Hello?
Claire, it's Charlie. You know the witness in Tom's unit that was murdered?
Yeah, home-invasion robbery.
He was killed right in front of his wife.
And the word is, she accused the military of having been involved.
Will she talk to us?
Problem there is that she disappeared right after that.
- Hey. Is this a bad time?
- Hey.
A bad time? No.
I was thinking we could go over the Hernandez cross.
Well, I was just taking a break, 'cause, uh, going over the Hernandez stuff myself and--
Please don't be mad.
It wasn't him. It was all me.
Mrs. Kubik, I want you to know this doesn't affect anything, okay?
I mean, my work.
I-- I'm totally up for it.
He is.
Come on, Claire, we were just going over his briefs.
Claire, wait.
You never can take anything seriously, can you? Nothing, ever.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
You know, you get to be a lawyer, so I gotta get to bang one, right?
We're closed. Closed!
Sorry, lady, we're closed.
Excuse me. Can you tell me how to get to State Street?
- Sure. Two blocks down.
- Thank you.
Sorry.
Want some cheese?
Yeah, I could make an omelet.
I'll make one. You want cheddar?
American? Swiss?
Cheddar's good.
Mrs. Chapman?
It's Kubik.
Okay, Mrs. Kubik. I want to tell you about what I do for a living.
This sicko bothering you?
'Cause I know how to deal with weirdos...
- who hang around the frozen food section.
- I teach guys to beat the box.
Who are you?
I teach techniques that enable anyone to beat a polygraph.
Like, special operations personnel... who might be captured, interrogated behind enemy lines.
Basically, I teach people to create a new persona.
That way, when they lie, they're not really lying.
Why are you telling me this?
I don't know.
But my guess is, you do.
Who are you?
Who sent you?
I was just asked to convey this message to you.
Just so you'd know... along with everyone else.
Good night, Mrs. Kubik.
Okay, get outta here.
Hey, honey.
Is it true?
What?
That you get that kind of training, to beat the box?
- What are you talking about?
- The polygraph, Tom.
Sure, but... I didn't beat the box.
I told the truth.
Why didn't you tell me you could do that?
'Cause it just didn't occur to me.
That's not a part of who I am anymore.
Well, that's it, isn't it? That's it right there. How do I know who you are?
Claire, you're the only one who knows who I am.
You know what? That's it. I--
I don't care anymore.
I did it.
I shot 'em all. Yeah.
For the fun of it. Why not?
Who the hell cares, Claire?
You know, the man you've been waking up to every morning... loves, just loves to kill women and children... in cold blood.
'Cause I--
Who the hell knows why, Claire?
Am I making any sense?
Does what I'm saying make any sense to you?
No.
Oh, Tom.
This whole base isn't secure.
They know every move we make.
Tell me. How do they know, Charlie?
Huh? How do they know?
Good question, Mrs. Kubik.
Good question.
- Damn, Charlie Grimes.
- Hey, Renny.
It's been ages.
Did you come to beg for leftovers?
No, I just want to look through your trash.
Okay?
What's the problem?
Take it easy. Goddamn!
- Hold his legs.
- No. No.
- Hold him.
- No, no, please.
Hey.
Come on, come on.
I just don't believe it. I refuse.
And my sister-in-law used to say truth is less fun than fiction.
- Terry would never do that.
- Oh, you're screwing him, so you know him?
Excuse me, Mrs. Ron Chapman.
I gotta sit down.
Oh. Well, well, well.
- What happened?
- Lucy, you got a lotta explain' to do.
Charlie, you all right?
Wh-- Who did this?
Just some of the old gang from down at the club.
The same group that mysteriously knows every move we make.
Wha-- What are you talking about?
How did they know about the polygraph?
Tarot cards?
What-- Were you with them?
Were you drinking with Waldron?
Wait a minute. Every Friday everybody drinks there. We don't talk about cases.
Charlie, you were in the Corps.
You know what it's like.
Right?
- Claire, you can understand.
- I understand you're fired.
What? No, listen. This case'll be over, and you'll be gone, but I'll still be here.
- Did you know about this?
- What? Wait a minute. Y--
Did you, did you know about the attack on me and Claire?
- What? Do you seriously think--
- Or was it coincidence you happened to show up then?
What do you say we go to the hospital, Charlie?
I'm worried about your ribs.
Ah, just get me some ice.
Hell, I've been here before.
Oh, and I won't be there for Hernandez.
I got word...
Troy Abbot got his parole.
I gotta go track him down.
Well, kind of sick.
See, Chapman taunted the victims.
He tossed his gun around like a cowboy.
Kind of showing off, and then... he executed them.
Please continue, Major.
I ran to the south end of the village, but it was too late.
They were all dead.
Chapman was still shooting.
Chapman!
Two members of the unit assisted me, and we got him down, got his weapon.
Major, you say Sergeant Chapman did some sick things.
Yet you, his X.O., allowed him to proceed without any supervision?
I didn't realize he'd take it that far.
Had Chapman ever been cited for this kind of behavior before?
- No, he had not.
- In fact, wasn't he...
"the most experienced and reliable member of Detachment 27"?
Before you answer, that's a direct quote from a report you filed.
Defense exhibit "A."
- Chapman was a good marine.
- Courageous.
- Honest.
- I thought so.
The kind of good marine...
- who would not go along with a cover-up...
- Objection. for you who actually committed the killing.
- Objection!
- Sustained! Make that your last outburst, Counselor.
The jury members, you are instructed to disregard that accusation.
Major, how is it possible that seven men, spread all over a village, would witness the exact same thing?
We all got to the barn at the same time.
Wow! How convenient.
Doesn't it make more sense that some of those alleged witnesses... were ordered to lie on their C.I.D. statements?
- They were not ordered to lie.
- How do you know?
I would know if something like that happened to my men.
And if something like that happened to your men, you would tell us?
Of course.
I wouldn't lie about it.
But, Major, you were trained and often compelled to lie about your clandestine missions.
As I understand it, you're trained to beat a polygraph.
Is it true you possess that talent?
I'd only use it if interrogated by the enemy, ma'am.
That's good to know.
So, tell me this, Major.
Do you consider me a friend?
- Hey.
- Hey.
I ain't done nothin' with her. I ain't interested if there's gonna be pimps involved.
Oh, no. No. You got that all wrong, brother.
That ain't me.
Shit. I should be so lucky.
No, I'm just supposed to deliver this to, uh... Troy Abbot.
- That you?
- Yeah. Who from?
- It's from Jimmy Hernandez, down at the base.
- Hey, Charles.
- Grace, what are you doing here?
- Got a call from the base.
- You got a call from the base?
- Yup.
- Bullshit you got this call! I got this--
- What, bitch?
Who you raisin' up. Get up!
I'm gonna whup your nasty ass self!
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Why are you always gettin' into trouble?
Why you always tryin' to play daddy?
- Apologize to the man.
- I ain't apologi--
Do you want me to apologize, baby?
Do you? Hmm?
Gracie can apologize real good.
Do you? Hmm?
Do you want me to say sorry?
I'm sorry.
- So they paroled you?
- Yeah.
Then they bring me all the way to this dump to testify.
- What happened that night?
- Hey, I don't know, man. It was years ago.
El Salvador. Some massacre shit.
I'll bet some damn officer ordered it too, right?
- You ain't thirsty?
- Hmm? Oh, yeah. Shit, yeah.
I'm just, you know... just chillin'.
- So then what did you say back? That's like--
- Yeah, what'd you say?
- Uh-uh.
- Come on tell us. We never get to hear shit like this.
- All right, hey, hey.
- Who we gonna tell, you know what I'm sayin'?
What'd you say?
That I was nowhere near the place.
And they want me to say that
I saw this guy shootin'.
- Damn. That's intense.
- You gonna do it?
Hell, I already did it in my statement to the C.I.D.
I just gotta testify to what
I already said, you know?
What's C.I.D.?
Criminal Investigative Division.
Yeah, but what about this poor guy?
Forget the poor guy.
I mean, what are you gonna do?
Your X.0. comes up... says, "You see Chapman shoot the wetbacks?"
You say,
"No, sir, I didn't."
He says, "Be sure about this.
Your career's on the line."
Everybody else said he did it.
So I say what they want to hear.
One more witness, no difference. Right?
Right.
9-1-1.
What is your address and emergency?
- Yes. 10145.
- All right, ma'am, is this an emergency?
There's somebody trying to get in the house.
- Claire?
- Hello? Is he in?
No. No, no.
It's okay. I'm sorry.
- False alarm?
- Yeah, it was a false alarm.
- Thanks.
- Claire?
- Charlie, you scared me to death.
- Huh?
- That guy was out there.
- What guy?
- You've been drinking.
- Who, me?
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no. No, no. You got it wrong.
See, I'm just a victim of hazardous working conditions.
- Sure you are.
- No, really.
- That man was watching the house.
- No. Ain't nobody out there.
What is this?
What is this?
Looks like a recorder.
Hmm. Is Abbot on here... saying he never saw what he agreed to testify to in court?
- You didn't?
- I most certainly did.
And you know what?
He was nowhere near the shooting.
I mean, nowhere near it.
Charlie, this is fabulous.
This does it.
This proves they're setting him up.
Charlie, I--
You really think I wanted to give up
483 days of sobriety... and start all over at day one, Claire?
I'll make some coffee.
Oh, wait a minute.
Not so fast.
See, I figure...
"Hey, you already slipped, Charlie.
So what's one more gonna hurt?"
How about it, Claire?
- One for our side.
- I can't. I'm trying to get pregnant.
Oh.
Well...
I'm not trying to get pregnant.
I am certainly not trying to get pregnant.
You're absolutely right.
But a judge will be more lenient.
- You're late, Counsel.
- Prosecution requests a sidebar.
Make it good.
Your Honor, our next witness,
Troy Abbot, has disappeared.
- What?
- Things are gone from his room.
We've notified the M.P.'s.
Notified, my ass. You let him out of jail and you turned him loose.
We have a tape that impeaches Abbot's original statement and fully vindicates our client.
- There was no discovery about a tape.
- You got spies all over!
In my chambers, everybody.
Court is recessed.
All rise!
I mean, what are you gonna do?
Your X.0. comes up, says...
"You see Chapman shoot the wetbacks?"
You say, "No, sir, I didn't."
He says, "Be sure about this.
Your career's on the line."
Everybody else said he did it.
So I say what they want to hear.
One more witness, no difference. Right?
Without Abbot, we can't authenticate this tape.
For all we know, he may have been coerced, any number of things.
- It's inadmissible
- What?
Your Honor, you admitted Abbot's C.I.D. statement.
We need this to rebut it.
This tape clearly exonerates Ron Chapman.
The C.I.D. statement was taken by an objective party.
Bullshit! He lied!
- They lied! How the hell is that objective?
- The tape is excluded.
- What's next?
- Your Honor!
Excluded, Counselor!
Major?
We're out of witnesses, Your Honor.
The prosecution rests.
Your Honor, this is a capital case.
An objective judge would admit the tape, and you know it!
We'll hear from the defense next Friday.
This is grounds for an appeal.
Honey?
- Claire--
- We'll appeal this.
- Claire, stop. You can't fight 'em.
- Tom, don't talk that way.
- We'll get another break.
- You do not know these people.
Stop it before you get yourself hurt.
We can win this!
I am not gonna let them do this to you!
What are you doing?
Is that a--
Must have done it when they installed the phones.
And you two were so ready to blame Terry.
So self-righteous.
Let's go to Farrell, demand a mistrial.
Denied. There's no way we'd be able to prove...
- that Waldron or Hernandez had anything to do with this.
- Then what?
We are out of witnesses and we are out of time.
Maybe it's time we heard from the brigadier general.
- Not on the stand.
- No.
- You think we should pay him a visit?
- I think you should pay him a visit.
Why me?
Are you scared of him?
No. But I'm just a thorn in the Marine Corps' ass.
But you, my dear, you're the pretty, young, sympathetic little wife.
I don't play those games.
Shit.
- General Marks?
- No press, please.
- I'm not the press. How do you do?
- Miss, uh--
Kubik. Claire Kubik. I'm representing my husband, Sergeant Ron Chapman?
Mrs. Kubik. Good day.
- General Marks, you gave James Hernandez the order...
- I have nothing to say to you. to eliminate Danilo Chacon and his terrorist group at Las Colinas.
You knew they fully expected Detachment 27 to come under attack.
You're a dignified man, sir.
End the cover-up.
- How dare you.
- Your man James Hernandez overacted and opened fire.
- You know what happened.
- Young lady, you are way out of line.
Listen to this, sir, and tell me how out of line I am.
This is C.W. Grimes and Associates.
If you want to talk to Charlie, you should leave a message after the beep.
If you want to talk to Delilah, you should get your head examined.
Well, Charlie, that was a great idea.
The man flicked me off his suit like I was a flea.
I am gonna lose my mind. I mean, we cannot let them get away with this.
There has to be somebody who was there.
There has to be somebody who's--
- Directory assistance.
- The Herald.
Of course not.
When you settle down,
I do have something to say.
You're representing your own husband in the court-martial?
Is there a military conspiracy at work here?
You know that I cannot legally comment on...
the details of a court-martial proceeding.
I would, however, like to say emphatically that my husband is innocent.
There is a man who's a stranger to me who said to me last week...
that all lawyers are a waste of oxygen.
As a wife and an attorney,
I greatly fear that justice in this case...
will not ultimately be served...
and I would like to challenge that man or anyone who has firsthand knowledge...
of what happened that day in El Salvador to please come forward.
- Charlie?
- Laurel, just to recap...
today's press conference with attorney Claire Kubik,
she's continually insisting that her husband is innocent.
This attorney and wife is clearly standing by her man.
Reporting live for Channel 12 News, this is Karen Cobb.
- Hello?
- You just had to do it.
The whole firm just saw you on the six o'clock news.
Hello, Alex. I have been expecting your--
Claire?
- Claire?
- I'll--
You'll, um--
- I'll send you my resignation tomorrow.
- Claire?
- Get in.
- No.
Wait. Okay, wait.
No.
Where are we going?
I want to know the truth.
I want to know what happened at Las Colinas.
You don't care about the truth.
All you care about is saving your husband.
Get out.
Get out.
You want to know about Las Colinas?
Women like you... beautiful.
Young.
And the old people...
begging for their lives.
Jesus Christ.
It was 12 years ago.
They all look the same, a bunch of gringos in uniform--
- Don't be foolish.
- It's a photograph.
I just want to show you a photograph.
I remember him, the one with the patch on his eye.
The blood still fresh from the explosion at Monte Azul.
This man was at Monte Azul?
Of course he was.
He killed Danilo Chacon.
Chacon was in the cafe in a secret meeting,
and this man was there; he was there.
That's how he hurt his eye.
No. But Danilo Chacon blew up the cafe and killed the three American students--
You people believe anything.
The students were killed by mistake,
because the American military didn't know they were there.
To cover it up, they blamed the rebels...
and pretended to look for their leader in Las Colinas.
But they knew he was already dead.
They knew they had killed him with the bomb.
- Thanks a lot.
- Ah, you're welcome.
Well, if it isn't little
Miss Six O'clock News.
You're drunk.
You were supposed to call me, but--
- When you got-- Huh?
- Charlie?
I called you.
I was out, but you could have called back.
I thought we had an agreement.
Excuse me.
I thought we had an agreement.
I thought--
I thought me and you was partners.
- But partners don't decide to do dumb shit...
- Charlie, it worked. without telling the other part of the team they done some dumb shit.
- Charlie? I just spent an hour with a guy.
- Huh? What?
He's the real deal.
He saw the whole thing.
Tom's innocent. This proves it.
There's a cover-up, Charlie, and it's bigger than we thought.
I need you sober.
- Yeah.
- Come on.
- Yeah, all right.
- Let's get you home.
Okay, baby. All right.
- No, Charlie.
- Hmm? Chris, last one.
- Just one more.
- Forget about it.
I got it. I got it.
Come on, partner.
All right, partner.
Damn! What was that?
What? Oh, my God!
Shit! It's oil!
Hi, sweetie.
Mm.
I had the worst dream.
I dreamt I was pregnant and these people came and took the baby away.
You one lucky girl.
You and the gentleman.
I want you to take something.
Here, baby.
Don't you worry about a thing.
You'll have another baby.
What?
- Don't you worry.
- What?
You'll have another one.
Jackie?
- No. No.
- I'm sorry.
No. No. No.
That's not fair. No.
Shh. Be strong. Be strong.
You have to rest. Shh.
Claire, it's Charlie.
Come in.
Hi.
- How's your neck?
- Oh, it's all right.
I've had worse whiplash just looking around at pretty women like you on the street.
I'm truly sorry, Claire.
I wanted that baby so much, Charlie.
You know, I kept thinking... maybe there was something wrong with me or I didn't deserve it or...
I wouldn't be a good mother.
- I really didn't think they'd do something like this.
- Hmm.
- I'm at zero, Charlie.
- Hey, whoa. Whoa, now. Listen to me.
I know about zero.
I've hit bottom.
And I was on my way back there before the accident.
But you know what?
I think we were spared for some reason, and you gotta believe that.
So, for you and me, kiddo, this is day one.
Okay?
Hey, you got another visitor.
Hello.
Merry Christmas.
You all right?
I owe you an apology, Lieutenant.
We were mistaken.
Ah, that's okay.
Although, I'm not sure "merry" is the right word to use around here.
Well, that's where you might be wrong,
Mrs. Kubik. Uh--
You see, if it's true James Hernandez injured his eye in the bombing at the cafe,
- he would have got immediate treatment for it.
- And they just keep records... of those covert operations so people like us can go look them up?
No, he would have insisted on it for insurance purposes... so the government couldn't screw him out of compensation.
Here you are.
Agent Mullins!
I just need a minute of your time.
Somehow I'm confident it's not my rugged good looks... to which I owe the honor of this visit.
The press accepted the official version of the story.
Well, what if Chacon didn't blow up the cafe?
- Mrs. Kubik--
- What if James Hernandez, the X.0. of my husband's unit, blew up the cafe and killed the American students by mistake?
What if Brigadier General Marks, to cover the whole thing up, staged a raid on Las Colinas?
What if all this is not my job and none of my business?
I'm just asking you to help me look into it.
Make it a lean one, chief.
- Why not? I know you have your sources.
- My sources?
- You keep saying it's not your job.
- Good.
- I wasn't sure you were listening.
- Well, then whose job is it?
Come on, whose job?
Goddamn, what a pain in the ass you are.
Hernandez was injured in the explosion.
There has got to be a classified medical document...
somewhere.
- Yeah?
- Hey, Charlie, it's me, man.
- Oh, hey, Mac.
- I've been checking out the rumors...
about how those witnesses in Chapman's unit really died.
I've been all over the place, man.
I got expenses-- phone bills, plane tickets.
- It's gonna cost you, man. It's gonna cost you.
- Well, you told me that.
I found the wife of the one who was murdered.
Lisa Stenstrom is living in Mexico.
- And she swears the military killed her husband.
- Oh, yeah?
Just inside, ma'am.
- Have you heard from Charlie?
- He called about an hour ago, but he was really weird,
like he didn't want to talk on the phone.
Well, like Charlie, I don't know if I should talk on the phone.
- He did say he was in Mexico.
- In Mexico? What is he doing in Mexico?
- I don't know. Are you on your way back here?
- I'm gonna stop in Los Angeles first.
- So I'll see ya.
- Bye.
General.
You all have had him all night.
It's my turn.
Shall we?
We uncovered the real reason you sent Detachment 27 to Las Colinas.
- Uncovered? It's a matter of public record.
- Well, not really.
What is a matter of record, though, is James Hernandez sustained an injury to his left eye in the bombing at Monte Azul.
Eyewitnesses place him in the truck from which the grenade was thrown.
- Mm-hmm.
- And he had that injury treated at a hospital in San Salvador... before Las Colinas.
Your gung ho raid was a decoy for your bombing.
You know, uh, this fairy tale of yours... would have to be based on classified material, even if any of it were remotely possible.
Now you're bluffing, and you're doing it badly.
You know, General Marks, we'd be only too happy to have you testify under oath... and allow the court to fully explore our evidence.
For example, classified document dated 3-14-88.
Major Hernandez's medical report for a shrapnel wound...
at Santa Maria hospital.
That's the same day and mighty close to Monte Azul.
You have no shame.
Look what you're willing to do to free a murderer.
Pick up the phone and call the right people.
I want the charges dropped...
- or the document goes public.
- Haven't you noticed... that you've been unlucky lately?
Now caution might be the order of the day for you.
I am not afraid of you.
I've already survived you once, you smug son of a bitch.
The real question is will you survive me?
Make it go away, General, or the document goes public.
For both our sakes, sir.
Pull over, right here.
Jackie. Jackie?
Jackie?
- Ma'am.
- Claire?
- You all right?
- Oh, my God. Yeah.
- What the hell's that all about?
- Colonel Farrell wants us in court tomorrow morning at 0800.
Waldron filed a motion to have you disqualified from the case... for talking to the press.
- Any word from Charlie?
- I've been trying him on his cell all day.
Just getting voice mail.
We've still got Hernandez's medical report.
I'll-- I'll do my best.
Farrell wouldn't admit a classified document any more than he would the Abbot tape.
- Maybe you should take the deal.
- There's no more deal.
Not now.
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Kubik.
- Why don't you spend the night out?
I don't know if it's a good idea to be around here tonight.
I, um, could use a little time on my own.
- Hey. You heard from Charlie?
- No.
- What's going on, honey?
- I don't know.
All rise.
Be seated.
Major Waldron, Mrs. Kubik, please approach.
- What the hell is this?
- For reasons of national security, the Department of Defense has determined that charges against Sergeant Ron Chapman... are to be withdrawn.
Court is closed.
Sergeant Chapman, you're free to go.
Oh, my God!
Shit! Let's go.
Let's get out of here.
Hey, Charlie. Listen, in case you're interested, pal, we won.
We're going to Marin.
We're blowin' this town.
If you ever want to call me, that's where we'll be.
Hope you're okay.
Jesus! Look at this.
What do you suggest I do?
Have Jackie meet us on the next block with her car.
Will there be more of them at the airport?
- Probably.
- Why do we need to bother? Let's just drive.
- Here you go.
- Thanks, Embry.
Okay, good.
Thank you for everything.
- Yeah. You take care of yourself, Mr. Kubik.
- You too.
- Okay.
- Thanks, Jackie.
Well, kid, turns out you're okay.
Well, you too, kid.
- Thank you so much, Mrs. Kubik.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
- We're gonna take our time.
- Okay.
So we'll call you when we get there.
Probably around 7:00.
- Bye.
- Bye.
About a week before Paul was murdered...
he started making phone calls to an old Marine Corps buddy...
who, incidentally, was killed about two months after Paul.
I don't know what they talked about, but it really upset him.
You have no idea what it's like... to see somebody you love killed right in front of you.
And you believe this is somehow connected to the military?
Yeah.
It's just a feeling,
'cause Paul knew him.
You know? Well, he just seemed to recognize him, the thing he did with the hands.
Paul seemed to know who he was.
You think that owl's still around here?
You know one thing that bothered me more than anything?
I couldn't protect you.
I had to stand by while they hurt you.
Shit. I should have got more champagne.
I love you.
I love you.
I thought... you unplugged that.
I did, but I tried Charlie one more time.
Hi, Claire. It's, uh, it's me.
Sweetheart, I'm sorry.
- Look, I'm--
- Be right back.
I'm sorry I wasn't there today.
- I, uh, let you down. Hi.
- Yeah, Charlie.
Look, Claire, I'm real sorry. I just--
- I couldn't get there.
- Why today, Charlie, of all days?
I mean, what if Marks had opted to testify or what--
You know what?
I don't want to talk about it.
I thought I had a friend.
I am your friend, kiddo.
Sure you are.
Just say a toast for my husband while you drink yourself silly.
- Good-bye, Charlie.
- Listen. I am your friend.
I was being your friend today more than you'd care to know, kiddo.
- What do you mean?
- We need to talk.
I just-- I just don't think now is a good time for it.
- Where are you going?
- I think A.A. meetings are supposed to be anonymous.
I'm gonna get some more champagne.
Okay. Hurry back.
Are Marks and Hernandez going to give us trouble?
- Is Tom still there?
- No. He's going to the store.
All right, get to your computer.
Pull up your calendar.
Find out where your husband was on January 20, 1997.
- Why are you doing this?
- Look it up, Claire. It's important.
Uh, Tom was in Santa Fe,
New Mexico.
He met a collector.
I picked him up from the airport.
February 10, '97.
Houston, Texas, trade show.
Claire, listen to me.
Those are the dates that witnesses were murdered.
Stenstrom was murdered January 20, 1997 in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
Allen died in Houston, Texas, February 10.
Oh, and wait a minute. Didn't Hernandez say that Tom tossed his gun back and forth...
taunting his victims?
- Is he ambidextrous?
- Yeah.
Stenstrom's wife said the man shot her husband,
then tossed the gun back and forth showing off...
and shot him again with the other hand.
- I can't talk about this right now.
- Sure.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Claire.
- I just-- I just thought I ought to let you know.
- Fine.
I gotta go.
I thought you went to the store.
Uh, I grabbed the wrong keys.
Those are the right keys.
Those are Jackie's.
Oh.
- What are you working on there?
- Nothing. Um--
You want to run out with me to get some champagne?
I'm not really in the mood for champagne.
- Ouch, Tom.
- I'm sorry.
Well... well, let's just talk then.
Talk about what?
About what you were talking about on the phone.
What, do you think I'm stupid, Claire?
You must.
Why didn't you come to me to talk about it?
- You must like to keep your secrets--
- Your life is one big secret.
Did you do it, Tom?
You can tell me.
I certainly have a right to know.
Risked my life for it.
Lost a baby.
- Claire--
- Did you kill those people?
Yes.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I did. I had to. Uh--
That's what I was trained to do, Claire.
They lied to me.
They told me they were terrorists.
Told me to interrogate them and so...
you do what you have to do to get every--
any kind of information you can out of them, and... so I did.
Because I was the best at it.
And they knew it.
What about Stenstrom and Allen?
What about Stenstrom and Allen?
Stenstrom saw me on the street one day, and he told Allen, and they needed to go away. You see?
Do not look at me like that.
I do not-- not deserve it.
Sorry.
I'm a bit tired.
I was just protecting us.
We'll get over this.
You'll see. I--
Claire!
No!
Stop it! Stop it!
Tom! Oh, God, you're hurting me!
You're hurting me.
Ow! You're hurting me.
You're hurting me.
Stop it. Tom. Stop it!
Stop. Look at me. Look at me.
- Honey. Honey--
- Shut up. Shut up. You're a liar.
Liar. Don't lie to me.
Liar.
I didn't want to have to do this to you, Claire.
Tom. Tom.
Es-- Esta bien.
It's okay. It's okay.
Esta--
I'm sorry.
You're listening to the Bay Area's number-one station for sports,
news and information--
You have a whole suite of offices here, Charlie.
Yeah, but, uh, don't talk about it because I might get spooked.
I mean, who knows what might happen?
How are you holding up?
I'm okay.
- Same old associate?
- Oh, yeah.
She's back there in the back somewhere.
I just brought her a bone back from lunch, so she's probably busy.
Hello. Come and see me. Yeah.
Ah. Hello.
You know, I often ask myself why I never left San Lazaro.
Then it occurred to me that, hell, I never left because
I didn't have anyplace else to go.
You know, it could read "Grimes and Kubik."
It's gotta say "Grimaldi."
- Huh?
- My maiden name. And, Charlie,
you gotta do something about these colors.
- What?
- Well, I'm very sensitive about my work environment.
Really?
- Yeah. So I was thinking about a tropical color.
- So?
Just like a really pretty--
With a little contrasting trim on the windows.
- Claire!
- Uh, Charlie, check out this exterior.
I mean, it's, uh, skid row chic.
I understand that.
But, um, the watermark's gotta go.
That's a given.
I don't know you
Don't know those melancholy eyes I see
Do you even know me
Your scent is familiar
Your voice familiar
But those words you speak
Are not familiar to me
You can't love nobody unless you love yourself
Don't take it out on me, baby
I'm not the enemy
Are you the man I love
The man I know loves me
Come on talk to me, boy
I'm not the enemy
Your worries
Your stress
Are both the root of your unhappiness
Fueled by insecurity
The pressures of being a man is hard
Don't think I don't understand
Put a little faith in me
You can't love nobody unless you love yourself
Don't take it out on me, baby
I'm not the enemy
I said we can't be happy
Until you're happy with yourself
Come on talk to me, boy
I'm not the enemy
Ooh, what I feel is unconditional
I love you at your best
And at your worst
Don't shut me out
I'm here for you
I'll be on your side
You can't love nobody unless you love yourself
Don't take it out on me, baby
I'm not the enemy
Are you the man I love
The man I know loves me
Come on talk to me, boy
I'm not the enemy
You can't love nobody unless you love yourself
Don't take it out on me, baby
I'm not the enemy
We can't be happy
Until you're happy with yourself
Come on talk to me, boy
I'm not the enemy
Previously on Enterprise
We don't have a complete casualty list yet ... but so far the news isn't good.
Five people are confirmed dead, dozens wounded.
If you destroy Earth, you won't just be eliminating my species.
You'll be eliminating your own!
Do you have any idea why they released you?
I think I may have gotten through to one of them.
Degra.
We were told the Reptilians attempted to build a bio-weapon.
Who told you this?
We've also learned that they were building this bio-weapon in the past on Earth.
When I was exposed to trellium it affected me in a way I wasn't prepared for.
I discovered I was able to access certain emotions.
I wanted more.
I devised a way to inject it into my bloodstream.
You must have known it was dangerous.
Trellium exposure is deadly to Vulcans.
Elizabeth, get out of there!
We're in bad shape...
I can't deny that.
But we're still in one piece.
Enterprise is a tough ship.
She took more than anyone could ask her to, and then some.
And so have all of you.
I wanted to say thank you.
I only wish I could thank the 18 crewmen who were lost.
Like you, they understood how important our mission is... and they accepted the risks.
We came into the Expanse not knowing what we'd find,... with no one to rely on but ourselves.
But we're going to succeed...
To accomplish our mission... for everyone on Earth who's relying on us... and for the 18.
We managed to get into Sections Six and Seven on C-Deck.
We found Taylor and Kamata.
That accounts for everyone.
What's our status on weapons?
Mr. Reed has both... forward phase-cannons back on-line in addition to the aft torpedo launchers.
Hull plating is up to 80%.
That'll have to do.
We could wait-- hang back until we've had a chance to make more repairs.
Degra's message was clear-- we're to meet him ten hours from now.
And I don't intend to be late.
Maybe that's what he's counting on.
Lure us into an ambush while we're still licking our wounds.
I've made my decision.
We have got a lot of work to do.
I suggest we get to it.
Aye, sir.
Commander...
Crewman Taylor was one of yours, wasn't she?
She was an EPS control specialist... a damn good one.
I'd like you to write a letter to her family.
She worked on Rostov's team.
I can ask him.
I asked you.
I'm barely holding the ship together.
I don't have time to sit down and write a letter.
It doesn't have to be long, ... but her family deserves to know what happened to her.
Understood.
You're busy.
I'll come back. have a seat.
I'll have to use a hand-scanner.
The Imaging Chamber is still off-line.
Commander Tucker reassigned the repair team that was working here.
He said the Armory was a "higher priority."
We'll see how low a priority I am the next time he burns his fingers on a plasma conduit.
You've experienced no further withdrawal symptoms?
None.
I'm only detecting trace amounts of trellium in your system... hardly worth mentioning.
That's good news.
What is it?
These emotions... have grown more difficult to control.
My usual techniques for suppressing them haven't been effective.
On Earth, there's a cautionary tale about the dangers of releasing... a magical creature called a "genie" from a bottle.
Once it's out, it's extremely difficult to put back in.
Are you saying these emotions may never subside?
You used trellium for three months.
It caused significant damage to your neural pathways.
You may have to learn to live with these emotions.
We're approaching the coordinates, Captain, right on schedule.
No ships out there, sir.
Hoshi?
Scanning all frequencies.
Nothing so far.
Maybe they're running late.
Tactical alert!
It's a spatial anomaly.
We've entered a dense field.
Tucker to the Bridge!
This is not the best time for this!
Stand by, Trip.
Reports of injuries on B-Deck.
No one's out there, sir.
-Get us out of here.
-Aye, sir.
Captain.
We're receiving a transmission.
It's Degra and he's telling us to follow him.
-Stay with him, Travis.
- Aye, sir.
They're hailing us.
I see you found my message.
We have a great deal to discuss, and I don't have much time.
Come aboard my ship.
If we'd left you with the Reptilians, they would have killed you.
Degra arranged for the Aquatics to return you to your ship.
Then you also called off the attack on Enterprise?
The Reptilians weren't very pleased about that either.
You've taking a big risk.
If you're telling the truth, the future of my people is at stake.
Everything I've told you is true.
Forgive me, ... but the Council will need more than your word.
Perhaps you can demonstrate your ability to time travel.
That might be a bit difficult.
But if you come aboard my ship,
I can give you all the proof you want.
Very well.
But there are some things I want to know first.
Such as?
When will your weapon be launched?
The precise date hasn't been determined yet.
Weeks...
-days?
- That's up to the Council.
I'm trying to help you, .... but I need to know my world isn't being destroyed while I'm doing it.
The weapon won't be launched for several days.
Show us your proof... and we'll do what we can to stop it.
What did you get?
Pepperoni pizza.
Don't worry.
You can pick the pepperoni off.
Damage reports?
No.
The Captain wants me to write a letter to Crewman Taylor's family.
I'm sure they'll appreciate that.
Their daughter's dead.
You really think they'll care what I have to say?
When was the last time you slept?
I don't know.
Not since the attack.
That was two days ago.
All right, then.
Two days.
Go to your quarters.
Get some sleep.
Believe me, I'd love to.
I could order you.
I don't have time.
We're full of holes, the only thing keeping us flying is a stolen warp coil, ... and now I got to write this letter.
What the hell...?
Tucker to Engineering!
Shut down the auxiliary coolant lines between Sections...
-12 and 14 on E-deck!
-Aye, sir.
Tucker to Sick Bay.
Medical emergency on E-deck, Section 12.
On my way, Commander.
Reactor pressure's holding.
Good thing I wasn't taking a nap.
Damron.
Friend of yours?
A colleague... of sorts.
They're the ones we found on Earth... in the past.
And this is the result of your "finding" them?
They were about to release a bio-weapon that would have decimated the population.
The Reptilians felt a toxin would be more effective on your species.
Damron and his team disappeared shortly after the Council rejected his proposal.
Apparently, they decided to go ahead without your Council's approval.
But, fortunately, you were able to stop them by traveling back through time.
I already told you... we had help... just like they did.
This proves nothing.
How do we know he didn't capture them in the present?
You need more evidence?
They had this with them.
We destroyed the toxin, but my doctor kept a sample of it in stasis.
This appears to be Xindi technology,... but I'd like to have our engineers confirm it.
Have them come aboard... perform whatever tests they'd like.
This proves nothing except the Reptilians disobeyed the Council.
Which comes as no great surprise.
But you also claim that ... we've been misled by trans-dimensional aliens.
Where is your evidence of that?
Come with me.
There's a microfracture in the magnesium jacket.
-That's why it ruptured!
-I ran a pressure test.
Tell it to the man lying in Sick Bay!
-Test them again-- all of them!
-Aye, sir.
-Commander?
-I'm a little busy, Doc.
So it seems.
I understand you haven't slept since the attack.
T'Pol tattling on me now?
She's worried about you.
Well, I appreciate that, but I'm trying to hold this ship together with spit and baling wire.
Has it occurred to you that we'll be far worse off if you collapse from exhaustion?
Your concern is duly noted, Doc, but I got to get back to work.
I don't believe so.
Come again.
I'm relieving you of duty.
You will go to your quarters, and not return to your post before 05:00 tomorrow.
-Six hours?
- Please don't make me involve Security.
Archer to Doctor Phlox.
-Yes, Captain?
-I need you in Sick Bay.
I'll be right there.
Well, Commander?
I could give you two hours.
I believe the number was six.
If I'm gone longer than three, there may not be a ship here when I get back.
Four.
Not a minute less.
Done.
And remind me never to buy a car from you.
-Captain's waiting for you.
- I'm aware of that. good night, then.
We found him adrift.
Do you recognize his species?
We've met one of them.
What caused his death?
Some kind of cellular degeneration.
It started the moment he was taken off his ship.
Perhaps your atmosphere was toxic to him.
I believe our universe was toxic to him.
His species evolved in a different dimension, ... under a different set of physical laws.
He simply couldn't exist here.
That's why his species built the Spheres-- to make our space more compatible for themselves.
We believe he was a test subject sent here to see if they were succeeding.
And, if they are, you're saying the Expanse will no longer be compatible for us.
For any of us.
We're destined to form an alliance to stop them.
But, if you destroy Earth, that'll never happen.
You'll be condemning your own race to extinction.
Trouble sleeping, sir?
Taylor?
You were killed.
This whole section decompressed.
Did you find a sealed compartment?
No.
Then how...?
You're dead... and I'm dreaming.
The letter...
How's it going?
I got as far as...
"I regret to inform you..."
That's a little dry, sir.
You're not real.
You don't have to call me "sir."
So what's the problem?
The letter doesn't have to be long.
The Captain told you that.
You can't think of anything.
I wish it was that simple.
I served on Enterprise for three years.
You pulled me off the Saratoga to be on your team.
Captain Brody was pretty angry at you.
I forgot about that.
You told me I'd make a fine Chief Engineer someday.
You will.
You would have.
Then tell my parents that.
Tell them about the practical jokes
Rostov used to play on me.
Or that one time I found that glitch in the injector assembly that everyone else missed.
Tell them how hard I worked.
How much you liked me.
Why can't you look at me?
Just remember me.
Is that asking so much?
Yes.
Why?
Why?
These tests only confirm the equipment belonged ...
-to the Reptilians.
-There's also evidence of chronometric distortion... time travel.
The readings could have been fabricated.
You're determined not to trust him.
No more than you seem to be determined to believe whatever he says.
Now, I admit Archer's evidence is intriguing, ... but we barely know this human.
Our contact from the future has helped us many times.
She brought this Council together.
And you've never wondered whether she might have an agenda of her own?
I am not a fool, Degra.
All I'm saying is that it'll take.... a little more than a few chronometric distortions to turn the Council against her.
Captain Archer is expecting me.
More evidence?
He claims to know a great deal about the Spheres.
Degra...
I know you've had doubts about building the weapon.
Don't let them cloud your judgment.
We've been working to reconstruct our database.
The pounding your ships gave us didn't help much.
Try it now.
I'm going to reset the optical subprocessors.
That might clear it up.
When we slipped through your detection grid, ... we got a look at the weapon you're building.
An impressive piece of engineering.
Hell, it'd take at least... a thousand starships like Enterprise to blow up an entire planet.
You know, I'd like to see the telemetry from the probe you launched against Earth.
Increase the data resolution.
I assume you were watching the attack.
Calculating the blast yields.
Boy.
You must have been pretty damn excited.
I mean, that beam cut one hell of a swath through Florida.
That's the name of one of the places you destroyed.
Florida.
Commander.
Did you actually see the cities burning, the houses... the people being vaporized?
You know, I had a sister there.
Commander.
How are the repairs coming?
Just need a few more minutes, Captain.
Why don't you join me in my Ready Room until they're finished.
Let's stick to the job at hand.
Aye, sir.
The Captain is trying to gain Degra's trust.
It's one of the warp plasma conduits.
It must have ruptured when our sensors were off-line.
Perhaps my crew can help.
We'll handle it.
We'll need to shut down the main plasma feeds.
The flow regulators are damaged.
There are manual cut-offs here and here, but we can only access it from outside.
That's very close to the fire.
We don't have a choice.
If we don't get control of it fast, it'll spread to the reactor.
Get going.
-I could use a hand.
-That would be me, sir.
Open that panel and
I'll talk you through the cut-off sequence.
-Where's the other valve?
-Over there.
I need to open the emergency bypass ports first.
You can't close your valve until I release the pressure from the secondary line.
Commander.
I have a problem.
I think the heat's warped the metal.
The panel won't open.
Use your plasma torch.
I'll be there in a minute.
I'm releasing the interlocks on the first port.
This is going to take a while.
Careful you don't cut through the bypass relays, Malcolm.
The manifold pressure is increasing.
We have less than six minutes before the fire reaches the reactor shielding.
Archer to Trip.
You've got six minutes.
Understood.
You okay, Malcolm?
I'm almost there.
Captain.
The temperature in Lieutenant Reed's suit is over 44 degrees.
He's too close to the fire.
His EV suit can't compensate.
Malcolm.
Get back to the airlock.
I'm almost finished, Captain.
That's an order.
Get inside, Malcolm.
I can wrap it up.
I'm opening the primary bypass port.
Two more to go, and... we're in business!
46 degrees.
Malcolm.
I'm sorry, sir.
You're breaking up
Get inside, Malcolm! I can finish.
There's no time.
Do what you have to do so I can shut this down!
A few more seconds! I'm purging the last port.
The forward valve is closed.
Okay, Malcolm, clockwise 90 degrees.
Nice work, Malcolm.
Malcolm? Malcolm!
Tucker to Doctor Phlox.
Meet us in the airlock.
We need to bring his body temperature down.
Let's geto Sick Bay.
I hope he'll be all right.
What's one more dead human to you?
Trip...
You had no problem killing seven million of us.
But seven million and one is more than you can...
-stomach?
-That's enough.
-I guess even Xindi have their limits.
-I said, that's enough!
Aye, aye, sir.
We've determined there are 59 of them.
78 at our last count.
Seventy-eight?
We've had more time to study them than you have.
I apologize for Mister Tucker.
I never expected to meet anyone who'd suffered because of what I'd done.
At the time, I thought the attack was necessary to save my people.
I know.
Believe it or not, we've had this conversation before.
That's right.
Our "escape" from prison together.
The Reptilians are correct about one thing, Captain.
You have an impressive facility for deception.
Erasing your memory probably wasn't the best way to earn your trust.
Probably not.
They're all connected by a subspace energy grid.
Unfortunately our data on the Spheres' interiors is extremely limited.
Maybe I can help.
How did you get this?
The first Sphere we came across was damaged.
There was a breach in the outer shell.
We've never been able to gain access to one.
These scans are remarkably detailed for a military vessel.
Enterprise was designed to be a ship of exploration.
If we're successful, it will be again.
Computer, begin recording.
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Taylor.
I regret to inform you that your daughter was killed in the line of duty.
She was a fine engineer, ... and she died performing her duties.
Computer, stop recording.
Delete that.
Computer, start again.
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Taylor.
As Jane's commanding officer,... it's with deepest regret that I inform you of her death.
She was a diligent engineer.
Very hard-working...
Tactical Alert.
All hands to stations.
Report.
We've detected a ship.
They just passed through the cloaking barrier.
On screen.
Reptilians.
-Did you invite anyone else?
-We masked our warp trail.
I don't know how they found us.
With the humans?
I suppose the Council authorized these negotiations.
No one authorized the development of a bio-weapon,... but that didn't deter your colleagues from creating one.
Undock from the human vessel immediately.
He intends to seize the human vessel.
He'll destroy both our ships if we don't comply.
We don't stand a chance against them, not in the shape we're in.
What kind of weapons do you have?
You expect me to attack a Reptilian warship?
If we work together, we might be able to disable them.
They're charging weapons.
Are you familiar with the design of that ship?
I did some work on their power systems.
Then you know where they're vulnerable, where to target our weapons.
Their ship is heavily armored.
At least we'd stand a chance.
Those Reptilians are Xindi.
You're asking me to attack my own people.
Proceed to our starboard docking port.
I want your word that my crew won't be punished.
You'll all be dealt with as the Council sees fit.
He's nearly reached the Reptilians.
He's knocked out their shield generators.
Fire.
Evasive maneuvers.
Keep firing. Target their weapons.
Their weapons are down.
Degra was spot on.
He knew exactly where to hit them.
Open a channel to Degra.
- Sir!
- He's charging weapons.
The Reptilian ship has been destroyed.
Captain, Degra's hailing us.
They would've contacted the Council and exposed our alliance.
I had no choice.
Crewman Rostov said I'd find you here.
Repair crews are starting tomorrow.
I thought I'd try and get 'em some power.
These assemblies are all fused together.
I've spent the last hour trying to isolate the damaged relays.
You might find this useful.
Portable power cells.
Courtesy of our new Xindi friends?
Damn neighborly of them.
Is there anything I can help you with?
Not unless you can resurrect the dead.
Crewman Taylor had a real knack for this kind of thing.
But Taylor's not here, is she?
And neither is Crewman Kamata or Ensign Marcel... or a dozen others.
So forgive me... if I don't want the damn power cells!
We found Taylor over there outside her quarters.
She was probably trying to get to her station.
If she'd made it a few more meters, ..
I wouldn't be trying to write this damn letter.
Every time I start,...
I hear myself saying what a fine young woman she was, how... smart and full of potential... and I realize ...
I'm not thinking about Taylor at all,...
I'm thinking about Elizabeth.
So many people dead...
I tried not to see her any differently than the other seven million.
So I've spent the last nine months... trying to pretend she was just another victim.
But she's my sister, T'Pol... my baby sister.
I envy you Vulcans.
You think that the loss of a colleague ... or friend doesn't affect us?
It does.
But if we give in to those emotions, they overwhelm us.
You're the ones to be envied.
You need to speak to the Council.
With the evidence you've shown me they'll have no choice... but to take us seriously.
Even the Reptilians?
I'm more concerned about the Aquatics.
They can be somewhat enigmatic.
But if we can sway them, we'll have a majority on our side.
These are the coordinates for the Council chamber.
This is nearly a dozen light years away.
-It'll take us weeks to get there.
-There's a shorter route, a subspace corridor.
It's located in a nebula less than half a light year from here.
That will show your helmsman how to get through it.
I'll meet you at the far end in three days.
Will it be soon enough to stop the weapon?
I'll do everything I can to delay it.
Use caution when you enter the nebula.
A hostile species is known to prey on ships that approach it.
Thanks for the warning.
See you in three days.
Three days.
Computer, begin recording.
Mr. and Mrs. Taylor,... by the time you get this, ...
Starfleet will have already told you about Jane.
Since I worked so closely with her, ...
I wanted to add my personal condolences.
I have to confess,
I've been putting off writing this for a while.
I convinced myself that... my duties on Enterprise took precedence.
But the truth is...
I didn't want to face the fact that someone so young, ... with so much promise... could just be gone.
But I'm facing it now ... and I find myself thinking how important she was to me.
She was a great engineer... and she was my friend.
She won't be forgotten.
Good-bye, Elizabeth.
Chris, what is it?
I love you so much.
Don't you love me any more?
I've made progress, and I recognise that.
But my wife, who I can't even convince to come here...
Anything can set her off.
It could be the phone ringing, something on the news, something online, going shopping maybe.
A commemorative T-shirt in the window.
It just puts her right back in that place, and it's like all my progress - ripped away.
And I'm right back there with her.
I feel totally the opposite. I see the TV and I see the Internet and I see those T-shirts and I feel nothing. The more I see the images, the less I feel, the less I believe that it's real.
I mean, I think I'm supposed to feel something by now. Don't you think so?
Linda, this is Chris Kelvin.
I'm returning your call.
I have two times available this week;
7am on Tuesday or 6.15pm on Thursday.
You can leave a message if either of those times are good for you. Thank you.
Well, I know that's not true.
Because I know you, and I know it's not true.
Good. I'm glad.
All right.
Let's pick this up on Wednesday.
Can I help you?
We're looking for Dr Chris Kelvin.
Chris...
I can't imagine what you must be thinking, getting a message like this.
I apologise if it seems melodramatic, but you are the only person I can... I can trust...
in the situation.
I need your help.
I need you to come to Solaris, Chris.
I don't know how to describe what we are experiencing up here.
We can't even agree amongst ourselves what is... what is happening, or...
what to do about it.
I suppose the... the most obvious solution would be to leave.
But none of us want to. That's why you're getting this... this bizarre request.
I...
I told the crew that your background and experiences
made you the... the ideal candidate for this job.
Don't worry. I didn't elaborate.
But it's true.
So, anyway...
I, uh... I hope you will come to Solaris, Chris.
L- I think you need to.
You will see what I mean.
I wish I could be more specific about all of this, but... you know.
People are listening.
You can imagine the distress
Dr Gibarian's message caused at DBA.
Why not send in the security force?
We did. We lost contact as they were approaching Solaris.
They haven't returned.
There must be some sort of on-board Al system.
They shut it down.
The company was hoping to solve this problem without involving a civilian.
Obviously these are extreme circumstances.
Some preparation is involved but you shouldn't have any trouble.
The flight itself is fully automated.
You'll be asleep most of the trip.
We feel confident that if you board the ship, you can negotiate their safe return.
Is that what everybody wants?
Of course.
Find the probability of F.
OK, stop. Go back.
Snow.
Kelvin, is it?
Yeah.
Kelvin. Right. Oh, man.
Sorry about that, Kelvin.
Names, you know, just...
For some reason. It, uh...
Yeah. Uh...
Well, uh, you wanna come in?
I'm fine.
Whose blood is that, leading to the lab?
Yeah. Blood.
How 'bout that?
Katarn.
He, um... Yeah.
Security forces showed up and he just took off, and they...
Yeah. Put a hole in his pot.
What happened to Gibarian?
Yeah.
It was a suicide.
Who found him?
I found him.
What happened to Rhys?
Yeah, now, Rhys w... Huh.
We don't know, because the thing is, he kind of... disappeared.
- Disappeared?
- Disappeared.
- How did he disappear?
- Exactly.
Don't know. We do know that he's not on the ship, uh, and that's... that's all we know.
Where's Dr Gordon?
Dr Gordon. She is in her room, and, um...
Dr Gordon won't let you in her room.
Can you tell me what's happening here?
I could tell you what's happening, but, uh...
I don't know if that'd really tell you what's happening.
I just wanna talk to you.
You have to give me your word you won't try to come in.
All right.
Well?
- What happened to Gibarian?
- Didn't you talk to Snow?
- I wanted to hear your version.
- There isn't any version.
He killed himself.
Why haven't you come home?
What happened here?
What did you find?
- Who are you representing?
- I'm the last effort to recover this mission, before they abandon this ship and everyone on board.
Until it starts happening to you, there's really no point in discussing it.
Hey.
Hey!
- Who else is here?
- Who else is here?
I saw a boy.
Gibarian's son.
- Michael.
- How is that possible?
I think that's why you're here.
I want a formal interview with you and Gordon. I'll need your help with her.
Yeah. All right.
Um...
How much sleep do you need, Kelvin?
- How much sleep?
- Yeah.
- How long can you go without sleep?
- Depends.
Well, when you do go to sleep,
I find I sleep much better with the door locked.
I was with the project when it was still with NASA, before it was sold to DBA.
I was trained in physics.
I was sent here to assess the economic potential of Solaris.
Whether or not it was a viable commercial property or possible energy source.
I was still compiling data when this shit started happening.
Did you run any tests on the food, air, water?
I checked it 50 times. There are no signs of contaminants or psychotropic compounds.
How about you? How are you doing?
Depression.
Along with bouts of hypomania and primary insomnia.
Suggestions of agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, shock, fatigue, denial...
- Not unusual, given the circumstances.
- I know.
All right. Now, what can you tell me about what's happening here?
Just that I want it to stop, but I want to stop it.
If I can stop it that means
I'm smarter than it is.
You know you can go home, walk away from all of this.
I can guarantee it.
Yeah.
The thing is... Man, I would kill to go back there. I'd... kill.
But Gordon?
Gordon happens to be Gordon, you know?
So, um...
But I'll see what I can do.
We take off into the cosmos.
Ready for anything - solitude, hardship, exhaustion...
death.
We're proud of ourselves.
But when you think about it, our enthusiasm's a sham.
We don't want other worlds. We want mirrors.
So, anyway... How's the spawn?
Oh, good, good. He cries and shits in his pants every two hours.
I know the feeling.
When are you leaving?
- We've been postponed again.
- I didn't hear that.
Nobody knows yet.
The governments are looking for a buyer. I wish we could tell people what's happening.
You can tell me. I'm a doctor.
Well, Doctor, as we study Solaris, the most interesting thing is it, um...
Well, it seems to be reacting.
Almost like it knows it's being observed.
We can't explain it.
Are you listening to me? Chris?
- So anyway...
- So anyway. Sorry.
Go to her. Her name is Rheya. She's a bit tricky but, um, I guess she's worthwhile.
Maybe she needs a shrink.
Don't we all?
Don't blow it.
You start.
I did.
Really?
All right, I'm gonna resist the impulse to ask you about the door knob.
- Do you always resist your impulses?
- Not always.
Try poetry.
"And death shall have no dominion."
Mm. Thomas.
It's not a very happy poem, though.
Well, you didn't seem very happy when I saw you on the train.
I wasn't.
And tonight?
It's early.
Goddammit!
I'm awake.
Yes.
How are you here?
How are you here?
How do you mean?
Where do you think you are?
Where do you think you are right now?
At home.
Where is home?
With you, where we live.
And do you remember being anywhere else with me? Being together anywhere else?
- Our apartment.
- Describe it.
It's dark. It's very very dark.
And there are no paintings on the wall.
No pictures anywhere.
No pictures on the fridge, even, which I always thought was a bit strange.
Do you remember where we first saw each other?
On a train.
Chris...
I'm so happy to see you.
I love you so much.
Don't you love me any more?
I have to check out something with the crew.
No! No!
- Don't leave me! Don't leave me!
- Why? Why?
- Why?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
It's OK.
It's OK.
Why are you sitting over there?
Can I come and sit with you?
Hey.
What was that?
Yeah.
How 'bout that?
Still workin' on that.
Where's your visitor?
I don't know. Stopped appearing.
- Who's your visitor?
- My brother.
Who was it?
My wife.
Dead?
So what was her name?
Will she come back?
Do you want her to?
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't. It's crap.
- Only one way to find out.
You can submit it to someone and see if they publish it.
That's not an indication of anything.
So no one else's opinion counts except for yours?
- Yeah.
- That's insane.
- "That's" insane.
- I like it.
Brings out the red in my eyes.
So, did you show it to your father?
- Yeah.
- And?
- And he liked it.
- What'd he say?
- He said he liked it.
- Well...
He's a man who doesn't pass out compliments very easily. That's something.
- What's that tell you?
- Can we talk about something else? Please?
All right. When do you wanna get hitched?
Every time I bring it up you make a joke about it, and...
I know, I know. That's pathet...
I'm sorry. It's just...
It-it's so difficult for me.
Still? Is it something that I'm not doing?
No. No, no, no. That's not the issue at all.
Because, you know, if you keep putting this off, then in 15 or 20 years
I'm just gonna stop asking.
- Well, I've got ages, then.
- Mm.
So apart from the poem that you quoted to me the night that we met...
The night that you were hitting on me.
Oh, I don't think so.
What's your favourite poem?
My favourite Dylan Thomas poem?
Well, there's the, uh...
Listen to this. We have, uh... There's the...
Well, there's the one he's most famous for, which starts, um...
- "There was a young man from Nantucket..."
- I knew it. I just...
I'm not marrying you.
You...
Oh, you're marrying me.
Would we have to invite anyone else?
There should be witnesses.
Otherwise nobody'd believe us.
When I was little I had this imaginary friend called Mikashelli, who used to live under the wallpaper in the corner of the room.
I used to go and visit. I had a very intense relationship. I was an only child.
As you know. And, um... that was like my sibling.
That was the person I used to have battles with and fights with and everything.
What happened progressively over the next few years is that my mother stopped communicating with me.
She only communicated with me as
Mikashelli, and wrote me these letters, and we didn't have conversations any more.
- I mean, admittedly, she was certifiable.
- Mm-hm.
But, um, yeah, that was a strange way to grow up.
You know, you're with the right man.
I so know that. That's what's great.
Cos, man...
Rheya...
It's me.
It's me.
I don't remember that.
When did you get that?
I got it just before I came here.
- Was I with you?
- No.
I don't actually remember anything.
I only remember you.
Have I been ill?
Sort of.
And we've been apart?
- Yes.
- For how long?
A few years.
- Were you alone?
- Yes.
Was that difficult?
It was easier than being with someone else.
Did you think about me?
Yes.
What is that, out there?
Solaris.
Oh, my God, yes.
I can't remember how I got here.
Did I come here with you?
- I don't know how you got here.
- What do you mean?
I woke up and you were here.
So I wasn't here yesterday?
No.
Right.
Getting dressed?
People will notice tonight.
If you're not there, Rheya, people will notice.
I can put up with all of it, you know? The mood swings, the... restlessness,
changing jobs every three months, all of it.
What I can't put up with is you hiding from me.
Why do you do that?
Do you wanna be here?
Cos I need help. I can't do this...
I can't "continue" to do this on my own.
The idea of God was dreamed up by man.
A silly animal with a small brain.
Even the limits that we put on it are human limits.
- It designs, it creates...
- No, I'm talking about a higher intelligence.
No, hold it. You're talking about something else - a man in a white beard.
Ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human.
Aren't we all?
Rheya, given all the elements of the known universe and enough time, our existence is inevitable.
It's no more mysterious than trees or sharks.
We're a mathematical probability, and that's all.
How do you explain that of all the creatures on this planet, only we are conscious of our own mortality?
You can't explain that.
That doesn't mean there's a God.
Maybe religion has been bred into us.
The pope is a wonderful woman...
- Excuse me.
- A nihilistic shrink. Is there a school?
Not yet.
You see? He's funny, at least.
Where you been?
Away from those fucking people.
They're my friends.
Yeah.
Chris, I've got to talk to you.
What's wrong?
I don't understand what's happening.
And if I do understand what's happening then I don't think I can handle it.
What do you mean?
I mean...
I mean...
I'm not the person I remember.
Or at least I'm not sure I am.
I mean, l-I do remember things, but I don't remember being there.
I don't remember experiencing those things.
My... I...
I mean, I'm really really... really really trying to understand.
And-and these, uh...
These... these strange thoughts keep coming into my head, and I...
I don't know where they're coming from, and I'm scared.
Um...
And l-I don't know what's happening.
L-I don't know what's happening.
- What do you think's happening?
- You need rest.
- No...
- Take that.
You don't understand. Because
I don't think that I can live with this.
I don't understand what is happening now.
I mean, this-this-this... I remember this.
I have a memory of it. But...
But I don't. I don't remember seeing it. I don't...
I don't remember being there. I...
Rheya, it's fatigue. It's fatigue.
It's brought on by stress.
It's fatigue. That's why you take this.
Right. Yeah.
No, it is. You'll be fine. I'll talk to Gordon and Snow. We'll go back to Earth.
- Mm-hm.
- And you're gonna be fine.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
- I'm coming right back.
- Right.
- Are you gonna be all right here?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.
This door locks from the inside.
- Yeah.
- You'll be perfectly safe in here.
Yeah.
You sure you're gonna be all right?
You-you keep asking me that, actually. Yes. Yeah.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Stay here.
I was so worried, man.
About this guy. But then you show up, and I'm even more-more worried about you.
Particularly after the first... when you sent the first one away.
Yeah, you were pretty...
Pretty, uh... You deserved to be as freaked out as you were.
She can never know anything about that. Ever. You understand?
No, no, no, no, no.
I wonder if they can get pregnant.
Where are you going?
- I can't be here.
- What?
You should have told me.
- It wouldn't have made any difference.
- Really?
Chris, I had to!
Obviously I had to. You know that about me.
I had no idea you'd react like this. Listen!
Listen to me.
What's changed?
I didn't even know you wanted one.
Yeah, why would I want one?
Why would I want a child, or anything that would bring life into this house?!
- No, no, Chris. No. No.
- Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.
Stop it! Stop it!
No, Chris, you don't understand.
You have to understand. I had no idea you felt like that. I won't make it without you.
- Then you won't make it.
- Chris, no, please!
- Let go of me!
- No...
No!
Oh, my God.
Oh, no.
You wanna change Gordon's mind.
What if Gordon and your wife, right, your very nice wife... She's nice, right?
Of course she's nice. Your wife is nice.
They get together, right?
Cos I'm thinkin'... women, right?
Right now we got woman and woman, right?
If we get "women", you know, together on the same team and all that shit, what happens?
You know what happens.
All kinds of shit you can't explain happens.
Like the... But good shit, you know?
Mysterious, but good. Usually very good.
Things get solved, you know?
That's my plan, you know?
What do you... think?
I'll have to think about that.
"And death shall have no dominion."
"Dead men naked, they shall be one
With the man in the wind and the west moon. "
"When their bones are picked clean and the clean bones gone,
They shall have stars at elbow and foot. "
"Though they go mad they shall be sane."
"Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again. "
"Though lovers be lost love shall not."
"And death shall have no dominion."
You found me.
I came back for you.
I came back that day.
I'm sorry.
All right. Enough hypothesising.
The visitors. Are they or are they not made of subatomic particles?
Subatomic particles... I'm not sure.
What do you think?
I think... probably.
Stabilised by what?
Guess.
I don't know. Maybe... a Higgs field.
So... if we created a negative Higgs field and bombarded them with Higgs antibosons they might disintegrate?
Maybe. You know, it would take a lot of power.
Shut down all the noncritical ship functions.
This is just a theory, you know? We could be wrong.
- Let's find out.
- We'll take the findings back to Earth.
What if they follow us back?
What if what's happening here happened on Earth on a mass scale?
Don't you see that as a problem?
I think it's a serious mistake to assume it's benign.
It's driving us crazy so it can watch us kill each other.
Is that really why you think they're here?
Given its resources it could have done anything, including destroy us.
Meet me in the lab in an hour.
- I won't let you.
- How you gonna stop us?
- How you gonna stop me taking her back?
- Shall we pick up the other one on the way?
Shouldn't be too hard. We could chart its course. Only take a day or so.
Chris, what's she talking about?
- Nothing.
- Her oxygen might have run out.
Maybe they don't need any.
Chris, what are they talking about?
You didn't tell her?
Tell me what?
Tell me what?
- You came before.
- He got rid of you.
You what?
I sent you away.
Into space.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
No. Rheya...
Don't touch me.
Rheya, I didn't understand.
Rheya. Rheya. Hey.
- Don't.
- No. No. No. Don't.
What were you trying to accomplish with that, exactly?
Kelvin...
It is a mistake to become emotionally engaged with one of them.
You're being manipulated.
If she were ugly, you wouldn't want her around. That's why she's not ugly.
She's a mirror that reflects part of your mind. You provide the formula.
- She's alive.
- She is not human.
Try to understand that, if you can understand anything.
What about your visitor? The one you're so ready to destroy without hesitation?
Who is it? "What" is it?
Does it feel? Can it touch?
Does it speak?
We are in a situation that is beyond morality. Hm?
Your wife is dead.
How do you know? How can you be definitive about a construct you do not understand?
She's a copy. A facsimile.
And she's seducing you all over again.
You're sick.
We are not taking her back with us.
Leave the light off.
You think you're dreaming me.
You're not Gibarian.
No?
Who am I, then?
- A puppet.
- And you're not?
Well, maybe you're my puppet.
But like all puppets, you think you're actually human.
That's the puppet's dream - being human.
Why did you kill yourself?
It seemed like a good idea at the time. Now I think I made a mistake.
- What about your son?
- That's not my son. My son is on Earth.
And that's not your wife.
They are part of Solaris. Remember that.
What does Solaris want from us?
Why do you think it has to want something?
This is why you have to leave.
If you keep thinking there is a solution... you'll die here.
I can't leave her.
I'll figure it out.
Do you understand what I'm trying to tell you?
There are no answers.
Only choices.
Rheya?
Rheya?
Rheya?
Rheya?
Gordon!
- What happened?
- She drank liquid oxygen.
She's dead.
No.
I never get used to them.
These... resurrections.
Oh, no.
No.
Why'd you do that?
Rheya?
Don't call me that.
There are two components.
A high-energy proton accelerator and a matter phase modulator.
By adjusting the tuning frequency I get an enhancement of Higgs antibosons at 90GHz and an almost pure beam at 160GHz.
I used it on mine.
What happens?
They disappear, back where they came from.
It's what she wants.
I won't let her do it.
She'll come to me when you're asleep.
Then I won't sleep.
Don't you see?
I came from your memory of her.
That's the problem. I'm not a whole person.
In your memory you get to control everything.
So even if you remember something wrong,
I am predetermined to carry it out.
I'm suicidal because that's how you remember me.
My voice sounds the way it does because that's how you remember it.
I don't believe that we're predetermined to relive our past.
I think that we can choose to do it differently.
The day I left and you said you wouldn't make it, I didn't hear you because I was angry.
This is my chance to undo that mistake.
And I need you to help me.
But am I really Rheya?
I don't know any more.
All I see is you.
All I see is you.
It created me.
And yet I can't communicate with it.
It must hear me, though.
It must know what's happening to me.
And you and I, we would have to have some kind of... an arrangement, some kind of... unspoken understanding... that I'm not really a human being.
No, Rheya.
Chris...
Chris, I wish you would just let them use the device on me.
And then you can go back to Earth and you can tell everybody all about Solaris.
No.
It's the only solution that makes any sense.
We could never have a life together on Earth, Chris.
You know that.
It would be impossible.
And this? What kind of life is this?
Trapped here.
It's not a life.
I don't know what to call it.
It's what we have.
It's enough for me.
You need to rest.
You're going to make yourself ill.
- I don't care.
- Just lie down for a moment.
Please, Chris.
You have to rest.
You know I'm not human so I don't understand what you're afraid of.
Of course you can use the device.
It's not murder. You said that yourself.
You're the one who had the idea in the first place.
Chris doesn't trust me. He...
Chris, don't blame Gordon.
It's not her fault. I begged her to do it.
It's better this way.
I found the suicide note.
I went through your things.
The page torn from the book of poems.
And I realised...
I'm not her.
I'm not Rheya.
I know you loved me, though.
I know that. I felt that.
And I love you.
I wish we could just live inside that feeling forever.
Maybe there's a place where we can.
But I know it's not on Earth.
And it's not on this ship.
That's all I can say right now.
- You killed her!
- Not her. It.
- It's murder!
- Kelvin, she begged me. It wasn't painful.
- She'll be back!
- No.
- Why would you let her do it?!
- Kelvin!
It's not human!
Whatever it is, it's not human, and I'm threatened by that.
And I wanna win. I want humans to win.
Whose side are you on?
- What are you doing?
- Putting the Al back online. I'm going home.
Gordon.
Gordon!
- I knew it.
- How long you think he's been dead?
Hard to say because of the cold.
He attacked me.
There I am. Somehow, there I am.
And I couldn't tell you how I'm there, or who I am or what's going on.
But before I can get to that, what's this over here?
Comin' at me. What... what are you tryin' to do?
Oh, I see. You're tryin' to kill me.
Yeah, confusing. I'll tell you somethin' confusing. Bingo, there you are, and my welcoming committee dropped his knife and it's good night.
And, oh, by the way, after all that I find, uh... this, uh, whoever this... I get my first good look at it and it happens to be...
I survive the first 30 seconds of this... life, whatever you wanna call it... by killing someone.
And, oh, ah, by killing someone who happens to be me.
See, most people... I would think most people in this position would be, like "This... ah."
"I don't know." However, this is at least...
This is an incredible opportunity.
This is... What if this is a gift? I'm a gift.
Hey.
I say we use the Higgs device on him.
Mm. Mm-mm.
I don't think you really have time.
Why would you say that?
Well, you know, ever since we used the famous Higgs device,
Solaris started taking on mass exponentially.
You might have noticed how we're a lot closer to it.
That would be because everything within its gravitational field - it's pulling it in.
Ah, and, yeah, sorry. By the way, the Higgs device also drained the fuel cell reactors.
Uh, if... Can I make a suggestion?
I mean, this is... You can do what you want, but I would just lock me in here really tight and take the "Athena" back.
Wear your seat belt.
Switch to internal power.
Start fuel cell operational diagnostic.
Service check on LGA.
Point and calibrate high-beam antenna.
Depressurising. Spin all turbines to standby.
Disengage coupling interlocks and all docking couplers.
Vent and seal all main engine propellant lines.
Earth.
Even the word sounded strange to me now.
Unfamiliar.
How long had I been gone?
How long had I been back?
Did it matter?
I tried to find the rhythm of the world where I used to live.
I followed the current.
I was silent and attentive.
I made a conscious effort to smile...
nod...
stand...
and perform the millions of gestures that constitute life on Earth.
I studied these gestures until they became reflexes again.
But I was haunted by the idea
that I remembered her wrong.
That somehow I was wrong about everything.
Depressurising.
Spin all turbines to standby.
Disengage coupling interlocks and all docking couplers.
Vent and seal all main engine propellant lines.
Rheya!
Rheya?
Chris?
Chris?
Am I alive... or dead?
We don't have to think like that any more.
We're together now.
Everything we've done is forgiven.
Everything.
[“Spiegel im Spiegel” plays]
Hey, Gerry, the path.
–God. It is so…
–[Urinating]
Yeah.
It is really nice, man.
Fresh air.
–You ready?
–Nope.
–Hi, guys.
–Hey.
Hiking moms on the trail?
It's just gonna be.
It's all tourists up there.
Well, how far is the thing?
We're halfway there.
Let's go this way, man.
Everything's gonna lead to the same place.
–Just loop around?
–Yeah.
Do our own fresh route?
I can't believe that, like, fucking fanny packs and sing-alongs the whole way to the thing.
[Both laugh]
[Singing softly]
[Laughs]
[Both laughing]
[Both breathing heavily]
[Exhales deeply]
[Breathing heavily]
[Laughs]
[Exhales deeply]
Fuck it, dude.
Fuck this.
–Fuck the thing?
–Fuck the thing.
Power on to the thing!
–Fuck the thing.
–Fuck the thing!
[Both breathing heavily]
It's just gonna be a fuckin' thing at the end.
–Fuck the thing!
–Fuck the thing.
Let's go back.
Fuck the thing.
[Spits]
Hey, is this the way we…
Yeah. That's it.
Right?
Yeah.
Hold on.
Is this the way we were going?
–Yeah. This is it.
–Yeah.
So…
She thought it was a "Y“?
–Who? The contestant?
–Yeah.
Yep.
She had every letter except for the ”L“.
She had ”B-A-R-R-E,“ blank, ”l-N-G down the road."
“B-A-R-R-E,” blank,
“l-N-G down the road.”
And all she had was "L“ for ”barreling down the road.“
And they were like, ”Do you want to solve the puzzle?“
Because you have to when…
When you have one letter left, you have to solve.
You're not allowed…
[Laughs]
Because you're only spinning to drive up your earnings.
Right.
So it's like cheating if there's only one letter left.
And so they told her to solve it, and she said…
”Barreying down the road?“
[Both laugh]
And there's this really uncomfortable pause, and Sajak was like, ”No.
Kenny?“
And the next dude did it.
But for zero dollars because he couldn't spin.
He was just like,
”Barreling down the road.“
I hate you.
[Both laugh]
–Not really, though, right?
–Not really.
It's just really hot on my front and really cold on my back.
There's a man perched on the ledge…
10 feet in front of us.
Don't look.
I see you, man.
Do you hear that?
There's a lot of dinosaurs near here.
I conquered Thebes.
When?
[Inhales deeply]
Two weeks ago.
How'd you do it?
Well, I got…
I did more than that, actually.
I said to Gerry…
[Clears throat]
”I ruled this land for 97 years, and…"
“…and I'd like it.”
I had all the sanctuaries built, and then I…
This hot lava leaked out of a volcano and half destroyed my sanctuary to Demeter, I guess it was.
And…
But I didn't have the marble to rebuild, like, the sculptures and that to fix the sanctuary.
But I already had all these docks to, like, Calydon and Argos and…
I had everything.
Everything.
I was trading with, like, 12 cities and…
I had a really good army.
But the river had just flooded.
And it flooded out, like, four of my docks, and I couldn't import the marble to rebuild the sanctuary.
Demeter got pissed off, and she made my fields infertile.
And then…
So I couldn't grow the grass.
I couldn't grow the wheat to feed the horses.
And there was no…
I couldn't…
And there was nowhere for the sheep to graze.
And some of my people were growing hungry and restless, and then…
And I couldn't trade because the rivers had flooded.
And so, Knossos, one of my vassals, got really upset with me and turned against me.
And they… attacked me.
And because I couldn't train any sheep
'cause I didn't have the wheat.
I didn't have…
I didn't have a, um, a…
You couldn't train sheep?
I couldn't train the horses because I didn't have wheat.
And so when they attacked me, they just dogged me.
And I actually went to send my army out to defend the city, and you can only send them out if you have 12 trained horses, and I had 11.
So I was one horse shy… of almost saving my city.
So then you didn't really…
Oh, I had just conquered Thebes, and then that happened.
All right.
You go to that one, and I'll go to this one.
All right.
[Grunts]
Hey.
Hey.
You see anything?
Big hills.
Yeah.
Uh, re-split up.
All right.
All right, see the ravine?
Yeah.
That's the spot.
So you go to the next one,
I'll go to the next one.
If you don't find anything, we meet back right there.
If you find something, fuck the spot, I'll find you.
Higher hilltop, meet at spot.
Or fuck the spot, wait there.
–Yeah.
–Roger.
Gerry!
Gerry!
Gerry!
[Sighs]
[Echoing]
Gerry! Gerry!
Hey!
Hey.
What are you doing?
What?
You're supposed to go on a high-hill scout-about.
You're on a rock in a canyon.
I did.
Yeah, did you see anything?
No, did you?
No.
Well, what are you doing on the rock?
Looking for you.
Why didn't you just go to the spot?
I did.
You weren't there.
I've been there.
I was just sitting there.
Dude, that's not the spot.
The spot is, like, a half of a mile that way.
I was at the spot.
I was waiting for you forever.
I was yelling your name.
And I just came walking up here, and I saw the rock.
I crow's-nested up here to scout-about the ravine
'cause I thought maybe you gerried the rendezvous.
Sure enough, I mean, that's not the spot.
All right, my fault.
[Laughs]
Well, if you had assumed that, then you should've gone to the top of my mountain because the whole plan was if one guy finds something, then you go to his mountain.
No, I know the plan, but I saw you coming down when I was on the way down, and when you never showed up,
I thought maybe you'd succumbed.
I almost did succumb, but then I turbaned up, and I feel a lot better.
Come on, dude, let's go.
I can't.
Why not?
Fucking marooned.
Come on.
You're not rock-marooned.
Just climb down.
But I am rock-marooned.
I can't climb down.
I'm gonna have to jump.
Hold on.
How do you get up to that part?
Scramble.
[Rocks rolling]
Jesus.
[Grunts]
How the fuck did you get up here?
Such a bear.
I think you gotta jump.
I can't jump,
I'll break my ankle.
You'll have to barrel out of here and get help, and I'll just be sitting there.
[Sighing]
All right, I'll jump.
No, no, no, no.
You're gonna twist an ankle or something, and then we're fucked.
[Clears throat]
Well…
Is it really crumbly there?
Like, the ledge?
Yeah.
I mean, I could try and…
Why don't you make me a dirt mattress?
No, Gerry.
Come on, dude, I crow's-nested all the way up here to scout-about the ravine 'cause you gerried the rendezvous.
[Laughs]
If I hadn't we'd be split.
We'd still be re-split.
Dude, just jump.
You'll be all right.
I won't be all right, Gerry.
[Both laughing]
Well, I could try and break your fall.
[Rocks rolling]
–Jump on your head?
–Like the circus, dude.
No, not on my head, with my arms.
Didn't you ever go to Barnum's, dude?
They have a fat guy.
He's got huge arms, and he catches people from, like, 50 feet.
All right, you ready?
No, I'm gonna break your arms.
Just make me a dirt mattress.
–Where do you want it?
–Right there.
All right.
[Whistling]
Well, I gotta haul the dirt.
Well, get hauling.
I can haul it from over here.
–Shirt basket?
–Shirt basket.
Yeah, it's crumbly.
–Is it soft?
–Yeah, soft.
It's like…
It feels hard, but it's…
You know, it's like dust.
Yeah.
You're gonna take forever,
Gerry.
I'll get all this stuff up to it also.
I mean, all you really need is, like, a two-by-two… like, air-ram dirt mattress.
Just to put your feet
'cause that'll cushion it, and then you'll probably fall forward.
So if I clear, like, your head area… and then make, like, a little, like, a dirt box.
You know how to rig that?
Yeah.
See, this is already, like, a foot.
If I can get it to, like, two feet…
And that's a good angle, right?
Think you can hit that, right?
I mean, I'm not done yet, but, I mean, you…
–Where it is, is good.
–Yeah.
Ah, that's great.
You really only need it to hit with two feet in one spot.
So if we can get the spot, and if you can hit it, that's all the cushion you need.
How's that?
No?
Look, it's not gonna be comfortable, but it's not a knee-breaker.
How many feet do you think it is?
[Laughing]
It's what?
Here, I'll get more,
I'll get more.
That's pretty good.
I don't know if I can do it.
[Exhales sharply]
You okay?
Yeah.
[Breathing heavily]
What time do you think it is?
That was far.
Here.
Animal tracks.
Follow these to water.
Animals have to know where the water is out here.
Then we follow them to the water, and we just drink our faces up.
Or else they go to the mating grounds, you know, and…
And then they mate, and they get thirsty, and they come back.
All right, but, I mean, I…
Yeah.
We don't know how far the water is, though.
And I don't think we should abandon the higher-ground idea,
'cause it was a good idea.
And that was a rolling hills scout-about.
And if we go on a mountain, like, crow's-nesting, like that mountain over there…
Yeah, but…
We know where the water is now.
We could just go there, and then get water and then go on our mountain, the mountaintop scout-about, after we've gotten water.
I think the mountain's a better idea because what if we go to the mating grounds and they see us and they get self-conscious, and then they don't mate?
Then we'll just…
And then they won't get thirsty…
Whichever way it is, if we go there, and it's the mating grounds, then we'll just watch them from a brush.
They won't know we're there, they won't have any body shame, and they'll mate, and get thirsty, and then they'll come back, and lead us to the water.
All right.
–[Both breathing heavily]
–Fuck this.
I can't even see the tracks anymore.
Fuck 'em.
[Grunts]
[Breathing heavily]
Do you think we should just go over to that mountain?
Just stop crying, man.
Where you going?!
[Voice breaking]
I don't know!
You wanna help?!
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
[Exhales deeply]
We're walking north-northwest… for… a couple hours… a ways…
But that's been the way we've been walking the whole time.
I mean, it's been
30 hours of walking.
North-northwest.
–Okay?
–Uh-huh.
We've gotta be fucking close to the highway.
Yeah.
But we got lost.
I mean, we were going…
We walked our ways, and maybe it was north.
And then…
We came, we turned around, and…
We got off…
We started going straight back down the way we were going.
No, we didn't.
No, no, no, no.
Before we turned around, we started going down the same way.
But we had turned before…
No, we didn't go the same fuckin' way.
We have not seen any of the stuff that we've seen.
We haven't passed anything that looks familiar.
Whatever our direction is, it's not south, and it has not been south.
We veered off at a different point, and when we started to come back, to go back, we started back the exact same way.
But we didn't see anything that looked the same.
We could have just bailed early, you know.
There were so many gerrys along the way.
We took a…
[Inhales sharply]
I mean, we started going back the same way, and then we stopped and said it didn't look right, and then we went to the right for a little while.
So we were going east, all right, which is a total gerry because that's fucking a million miles to a road.
That's because we came up over the thing, and we saw that whole layout.
There was nothing there.
We didn't see anything.
And then in the morning…
In the morning, we walked north again.
In the morning, we…
[Sighs]
In the morning, we definitely walked north.
And then we gerried off to the animal tracks, which was east… which was west, but it doesn't matter…
When we hit the tracks, we took a left, which was going…
…which was going west.
But more importantly, when I got up, when we split up, and I was walking up on my scout-about,
I was looking into the sun, which means that it was east.
Um…
So, and then, when I was on the rock, and I was looking at you, the sun was…
When we came down, we went in that direction.
That means we were going east, and we walked for a long time.
And our scout-about was east, so we gerried the scout-about.
We went up the wrong fuckin' mountain.
Okay?
So our direction's been north-northeast, but if we spin the fucker and just go north, balls-out north, we're gonna hit the fuckin' highway because we can't go south.
South is a fucking disaster for us.
It would take too fucking long to get there.
All right, then let's go north.
[Exhales deeply]
Come on, let's go.
We may as well just sit here.
You know why
I think we should go?
Why?
Because I've got water.
Come on, don't fuckin' joke.
I'm not joking.
I found water.
I know exactly where the car is.
[Sobbing]
How?
Just figured it out.
It was another fuckin' mirage.
It was a mirage.
What are you doing?
I really wanted to… walk up to you and say I had two bottles of water, and that I knew where the car was.
Come on, we gotta go.
–Come on.
–[Groans]
How do you think the hike's going so far?
[Chuckles]
Pretty good.
[Laughing]
I'm leaving.
[Choking]
