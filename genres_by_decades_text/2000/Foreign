Tordesillas, the year of Our Lord 1554.
She is 74 years old and has been locked up in this castle for almost half a century.
She has been successively betrayed by her father, by her husband and by her son.
Daughter of the Catholic Monarchs, wife of Philip of Habsburg, mother of the Emperor Charles V, queen in her own right of Castile and Aragon.
They call her
Joan the Mad.
When I close my eyes, he approaches me.
I feel his skin beneath my fingertips.
His voice flows into my ears.
I perceive the odor ofhis armpits.
He arouses my desire.
I do not fear death.
No matter what, it will take me to Philip.
JOAN THE MAD
Lady Elvira.
We're spending the night here.
Laredo is only a few hours away.
- Anything else, Captain?
- Whatever Her Majesty orders.
Alvar!
May I still call you Alvar?
Of course, Princess.
You may still call meJoan.
Look.
You gave it to me, remember?
I'll never forget our happy childhood days.
They're taking me to be wed, Alvar.
In Flanders.
All my blessings.
What are you thinking, daughter?
This time tomorrow,
I'll be on my way to Flanders.
And far from you.
It's God's will.
And yours too.
That is so.
The sovereign of Castile,
Queen Isabella the Catholic, has set out, accompanied by her children.
They are all there,
Princess Isabella,
John, Catherine and Maria, to accompany their sisterJoan as she sets out on her greatjourney to Flanders.
Laredo, August, 1496.
Be a good girl, Catherine.
I'll be thinking about you.
God chose to make me
Queen of Castile.
My people have crossed the seas in search of another world.
Yet the sea is still a mystery to me.
I am too old to undertake a voyage.
So you will never come to see me.
My duty is to your father and to Castile, as your duty will be to Philip of Habsburg, to Burgundy and to Flanders.
I shall obey you, Mother.
I know that my life, like yours, requires greater endeavor than my humble person can offer.
That is so.
My prayer book.
I got it from my mother.
You were born a princess and must accept it.
It is true that your marriage to Philip is for political reasons, but some happiness is also possible.
No one, except God, possesses the power and knowledge of what is to come.
Did you know Father before you married him?
I married Ferdinand for love.
How will I know if I love Philip?
With time.
Put it there. Be careful.
With time.
Perhaps you will never know.
If that is so, take consolation in living in sanctity with a man.
And if you're asked, answer as I do, that you married him for love.
It is an enormous task.
At times, a painful and terrible task.
Don't cry, child.
You'll soon have a husband.
Soon, my princess, you'll be a woman and you'll dream of paradise.
Ready.
Raise your bows.
Take aim.
Now!
The Spanish fleet arrived yesterday in Ostende, Sire.
- How is the princess?
- Princess Joan is in good health.
She is anxious to meet you.
Tomorrow morning
- she will reach Brussels.
- Lord de Veyre, how soon can we be in Brussels?
With a change of horses, we can be in the palace tomorrow evening, Sire.
My horse!
Double formation!
Present arms!
Brigitte de la Motte.
Carlota de Foix.
Inés de Bravante.
The letter, Madam.
The letter.
"I have the honor to address the Archduke of Austria and
Duke of Burgundy and Bravante, and to wish you every blessing on behalf of my beloved parents, the monarchs of Castile and Aragon.
I also wish to express my joy and satisfaction on establishing between our kingdoms an eternal union blessed by the Pope and the Church."
The princess and I wish to be married immediately.
Who must give us the blessing?
Sire, it is the Bishop of Malinas who is to bless this union, but that will be, God willing, a week from now.
The ceremony will take place on that day as planned, but the princess and I wish to celebrate it in privacy, now.
Do you agree, Princess?
Your blessing, Father.
Kneel down.
May the Lord God confirm your mutual consent expressed before the Church.
What God has joined let no man pull asunder.
We shall see you at the official ceremony within a week.
What?
Don't leave.
Please.
Brigitte, Inés.
Brigitte, Inés! Come here!
The old folk say that a lass pulls more than a rope.
But they forget one thing.
You have to adorn the lass.
Now, my princess, take a little turn around.
Just a few steps.
If you don't close your legs, the whole court will laugh.
Leave us.
Are all lovers like him, Aida?
No, my child, no.
Tonight I'll paint your nipples and your lips with henna.
I want you to drive him mad.
October 1497.
Death has begun to trace out its plans by stealing the life ofJohn, the firstborn of the Catholic Monarchs.
Fate will still have to cut short another four lives before making Joan into the heiress to the crown of Castile.
It's a girl!
Meanwhile, at the court in Brussels, life was forcing its way through, thanks toJoan's abundant fertility.
Your daughter.
She will be called Eleanor.
Majesty.
Sire, it was a very easy birth, and very beautiful.
Joan, are you there?
She's a glutton.
She wants to devour me.
You're the only princess who breast-feeds her children.
- Why do you insist?
- I like it.
And so does Eleanor.
It helps ease the pain in my breasts.
There are other ways to ease that pain.
I will not be milked like a cow.
My daughter is alive and I want to feed her with my own blood.
Your words and your behavior are surprising everyone.
Don't get dressed.
Lord de Veyre received a letter from my father. I have to see him.
Let him wait.
He has told me there is important news regarding our friends from France.
Your husband has duties which require his attention, Madam.
My husband's first duty is to make me happy.
I am full.
You are mad.
Joan, it is barely a month since you gave birth.
We mustn't abandon ourselves to such transports.
Despite everything, the days and months passed happily in the palace.
Excuse me.
- Yes, Madam?
- An indisposition.
Accompany her. You go too.
It is nothing, Sire.
- Madam, do you feel well?
- Yes, very well.
The poor man shits, the rich man too.
- What can ail her?
- I don't know.
Is anything wrong, Madam?
How pregnant is she?
Eight months.
She wouldn't have it here and now?
Her Highness is like a cow.
Say something, Madam, please.
Come in.
A ribbon.
October 1500.
The newborn would become, with time, the glorious Emperor Charles I of Spain and Vof Germany.
Give the word.
Lady Elvira!
Lady Elvira!
The hand of death would soon strike down Queen Isabella, on November 24, 1504.
Send the swiftest horseman you have to carry the news to Flanders.
I hear there is an old friendship between you and Princess Joan.
My father was her Latin teacher.
I often played with the princess.
Perhaps the news will be less painful coming from your lips.
How many days will it take you to reach Brussels?
I'll ride day and night.
"Because of the great heat
"Because of the great heat and because the windows were closed, her dress was undone and her breasts were revealed like two apples from Paradise."
A woman and a tipple by the nipple.
Raise your head, Madam.
Look a little longer in this direction. Like that.
What are they laughing at?
Aida is competing with you, Sir.
- I do not understand, Madam.
- Ask Inés de Bravante.
- Why are you laughing, Lady Inés?
- I'm being tickled.
Ask her who tickles her at night.
Which fortunate gentleman tickles you at night?
Does he make you laugh like that?
What a cheek! How dare you?
My breast guards that secret jealously.
Is it the breast you're painting so carefully which guards your secrets?
Without the necklace.
- It's better with the pink dress.
- I hate pink.
It's my lord Philip who hates pink.
"And turning the other way, ashamed that he could be seen by Diafebus, unable to pronounce another word, he said: I love."
A double step.
Right, left.
Madam.
A messenger has arrived from Spain.
Welcome, Captain.
Speak. What has happened in Castile?
Castile has been orphaned.
Lord de Veyre.
Proclaim court mourning.
"Thank you" is little for your efforts, Captain.
Thank you.
Where is Philip?
The archduke wasn't feeling well.
He went out for air a moment ago.
He'll be in the hunting lodge.
Do you know what this news means?
You and the archduke are now the monarchs of Castile.
Make way for Princess Joan!
Make way for the archduchess!
What is happening?
They're guarding the palace, as usual.
Restrain that dog!
You want it to attack me?
Where is the archduke?
Lord de Veyre, where is the archduke?
It would be best if you did not know, Madam.
Traitor!
Traitor!
Traitor! Traitor!
Monster!
- Son of a bitch!
- Mind your tongue!
You're talking like a slut, and I won't be humiliated.
It is I who have been humiliated!
I who have been betrayed!
I feel dirty.
Soiled!
Contaminated!
Mad.
You're mad.
Mad!
Always mad!
It must be madness to love someone as despicable as you!
Who was that?
I have to know who that whore is.
Sire.
I shall give you the news.
Queen Isabella is dead.
The archduchess is now
Queen Joan of Castile, and you are consort.
My mother is dead!
My husband is unfaithful!
My mother is dead!
My husband is unfaithful!
My mother is dead!
My husband is unfaithful!
My mother is dead!
None of this is true.
My imagination!
Whims.
Whims ofJoan the Mad, because I am mad.
I'm mad, am I not?
Yes, I am mad.
Mad, mad, mad!
I'm mad! I'm mad!
Mad!
Inés, come here.
Turn round.
Hold this whore.
- Madam, please...
- Hold her!
Scissors.
- Madam...
- I said I want scissors.
Do not commit an injustice.
What happened?
The queen is suspicious.
She thinks that...
And with her own hands...
Why did you do it?
I hate everything that comes between your body and mine, even the air.
Your behavior is scandalous.
I am sovereign of Burgundy and I've made you king of Castile.
But I also want to be your wife,
- your woman and your whore.
- Am I to be compelled?
I'm more powerful than you, and craftier.
And more shameless, to speak to me in that tone.
It isn't shamelessness.
It's passion.
Uncontrollable passion.
With reason it's rumored that you are mad.
Mad, because I love you to the point of madness?
Mad, because I want you to be mine?
Mad, because I don't want you going to another for what I have in abundance?
Mad, because I aspire to engender and bear your children?
Mad...
Mad with love.
Is that madness?
Joan and Philip traveled to Spain to be proclaimed sovereigns of Castile.
The people gave an enthusiastic welcome to the young monarchs.
Look at her.
She's holding him so tightly it's like she wanted to hurt him.
Untimely bouts of crying, groundless fits of rage, continuous eccentricities.
She chooses the ugliest ladies-in-waiting.
You know why?
Yes, the king is an inveterate womanizer, unworthy of the love the queen bears him.
And unworthy of occupying the throne of Castile.
Philip wants to be rid of a jealous wife and also be rid of one who is queen of Castile.
Don't pretend you don't know.
Admiral Henríquez.
I want you to love Philip as if he too were Castilian.
I want the people to be happy with their king.
The people love you and will love what you love.
I am a doctor, and I can tell you.
- She is not mad.
- The people think otherwise.
They don't give the same meaning to the word "mad" as you do.
Speak to those who have lived with her in Flanders.
They'll tell you what they've seen and heard.
We have visitors. Honest people.
Leave this table free.
Your turn.
A gentleman has requested your services.
Very well.
Welcome.
She pleases you?
Her name is Aixa.
Would you like to see her close up?
What for?
It's a beautiful body.
The body of a woman who risks her life every night coming to dance here.
She risks her life?
- Why?
- For money.
She risks her life so as not to die, to go on living.
Don't you know the Moors are persecuted?
She's a Moor?
A king's daughter.
Would you like to see all of it?
He's been so long.
What if something has happened?
- Your worries are unfounded.
- He's been gone for five hours.
The king forgets everything when he goes hunting.
Hunting!
You think he's hunting?
Undoubtedly.
- Elvira.
- Madam.
Philip is unfaithful.
You like tormenting yourself.
You know that the king has often betrayed me.
Say you won't scold me, and I'll tell you what I've recently learned.
Speak, Madam.
No, it isn't him.
You were saying?
The king goes out every afternoon, and he doesn't come back for at least three hours.
I had my page Hernán follow him.
Where did the king go?
You will never guess.
He went to a mansion known to be a place of sin.
Are you sure it was the king?
Yes, yes, yes!
Would to God
I were mistaken, Elvira!
Madam, think. There can only be the lowest of women in that place.
And what? They're still women like us, aren't they?
Don't they have the same between their legs as we do?
He's here!
He's here!
I was worried.
Joan, please.
- Tell me if you're unfaithful.
- What do you mean?
I know you visit a house of ill repute.
Speak.
Answer me. At least take the trouble to lie.
It's impossible for us to live in peace.
Tell me you're faithful.
Trust your husband.
Tell me you're faithful.
- Tell me and I'll believe you.
- My dearJoan, you worry me.
You ask too much of me with your rages.
I want to be yours.
I want to love you even if you loathe me.
Whatever I say?
Whatever you say.
Your Flemish gentleman.
He tries to conceal who he is, but his appearance gives him away.
Dress as what you are.
Make him dream of heaven, but don't grant it to him.
If I am heaven, how can I refuse it to him? He's relentless.
- Just a little piece.
- This little piece.
- In any case, don't kiss him.
- Not as I kiss you.
Hell of Satan and Beelzebub,

He's got a picture of me and quinn.
WELL, DO YOU KNOW HIM no.
I thought maybe you might.
How would I know him
MAYBE YOU KNOW HIS WIFE.
Oh, my god.
KATE, HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT
HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK IT what am I supposed to think what, some complete stranger is just wandering around with a...
Family photo ever since you got back...
Something's going on.
I promise you, kate, nothing's going on.
I LOVE YOU.
I'm not afraid of the truth.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Who was that
WHO WAS ON THE PHONE
I have to go back to the station for a couple of hours.
I thought you wanted to stay home tonight.
Hey, buddy. You wanna go visit aunt gayle it's tuesday.
She'll be home by now.
What about dinner
I'll only be a couple of hours.
Quinn, honey, if you're done why don't you go wash up, okay what's going on
I can't help it, kate.
Something has come up.
Something's what why do you suddenly want us out of the house there's something
I have to deal with.
That you have to deal with have you done something you know there are things about work that I'm just not allowed to share with you.
I do know a harry caine.
Then why didn't you say something before should I be worried
I mean, who is he
I think he's part of an unfinished case.
Why is he looking for me
I DON'T KNOW IF HE IS.
Are we in danger
I would sooner die than to ever let anything happen to you.
Hi.
HI.
Are you alone excuse me
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME COMPANY
I'm married.
So, is your wife here
No.
Can I use your phone
Hi. It's me.
Yeah.
SURE.
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE NOT ALONE
I'm sorry.
Hello, peter.
Is there something wrong these kinds of meetings are dangerous.
I know, but this is important.
THERE'S A MAN BY THE NAME
OF HARRY CAINE HERE.
What's the problem he's asking about kate.
YOUR WIFE
DOES SHE KNOW HIM
NO.
But I think he's from wisconsin.
HAVE YOU HAD
ANY CONTACT WITH HIM
I wanted to talk about it with you first.
Do you think he's looking for you or is he looking for us no, that doesn't make any sense.
You see, if he knew of us why would he just come here and openly make inquiries like this
It was a woman.
HER NAME WAS CAINE.
Why did she have to be there right at that time it was just a shadow.
I didn't know.
You can't blame yourself, peter.
You only saw the threat to your life.
You knew.
We all knew and accepted the possibility of this event happening,
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING.
INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE HURT
AND KILLED EVERY DAY.
THAT'S THE WAY THE WORLD IS.
Yes.
Yes, we've talked about that.
But all that talk never prepared me for the reality.
I killed an innocent woman.
We have to keep our focus on our goals, our ideals.
Corrupt law enforcement is a cancer.
It eats at the heart and moral fabric of society.
Without law there is no order.
What you did was right, peter.
He was a corrupt cop and he's gone.
BUT THERE ARE OTHERS.
WE MUST KEEP OUR FOCUS.
So, where does that leave us
HE MAY BE ALONE, or they may be others.
FIND OUT WHAT HE KNOWS.
Peter...
I know how difficult this is for you.
BUT WE HAVE NO CHOICE.
I know.
I'll do whatever's necessary.
Would you prefer one of us taking care of this matter no.
Thank you...
But I created this situation.
Lounge.
Hold on.
Are you a mr. Caine yes.
THERE'S
A PHONE CALL FOR YOU.
Thank you.
Hello
MR. CAINE yes
MY NAME'S PETER.
Do I know you
NO, WE'VE NEVER MET.
I'M A FRIEND OF THE WOMAN
YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.
Oh.
SHE'S ASKED ME TO COME
AND MEET WITH YOU.
OF COURSE,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO MEET ME
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.
BUT SHE IS HOME
AND IF YOU WANNA SEE HER...
Yes, I'd like to meet her tonight.
GOOD.
I'M IN ROOM 503,
WHY DON'T WE MEET UP HERE why
WELL, A STRANGER COMES TO TOWN
LOOKING FOR MY FRIEND
AND NO ONE KNOWS WHO HE IS.
I'M SURE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
HER CONCERN.
I'm not looking to hurt anyone.
I just wanna talk to her.
GOOD.
I'M IN 503.
Pleasure to meet you, mr. Caine.
Please, come in.
SIT DOWN.
MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE.
May I see the photograph, please
I thought you were gonna take me to see your friend.
SHE'S EXPECTING US, BUT...
THERE ARE A FEW THINGS
WE NEED TO CLEAR UP.
Who gave you this photograph no one.
I found it.
IN KENWOOD PLAINS
HOW DID YOU KNOW I...
Who else has seen this picture no one.
Where's your friend why are you so anxious to see her
I need to talk to her.
WHY
I believe she can help me find someone I'm looking for.
Who is that someone who can explain why my wife was murdered.
What makes you think that
I'VE GOTTEN
THE INFORMATION.
Then you've had help from others no, not really.
I need to know why my wife was killed.
Is that all you need
And you really don't wanna kill this man
I'm not a murderer.
HOW DO YOU KNOW
Is it worth your life
I'm not living anyway.
Then let's go see my friend.
We'll take my car.
Did you know my wife
No.
You.
Why
Why
For god's sake...
Why
Oh...
I'm sorry!
No!
Why did you go after him
He murdered my wife.
I see.
He murdered your wife, so you went after him and killed him.
I never wanted to hurt him.
WHO IS "HE," MR. CAINE the name of the man you killed what's his name
I don't know.
Can I speak to you a minute, ed
We did an extensive search of the hotel.
AND THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE
OF ANY CRIME.
NO CRIME.
THERE WAS NO BODY,
MR. CAINE.
Not even the surveillance tapes show anything.
We know what happened to you.
YOU CAN'T CHANGE WHAT WAS.
WHAT USED TO BE.

My name is Pacu,
It's a brand new name, so I'm not used to it yet,
I'm trying to remember a story,
Sometimes I can,
Sometimes I get mixed up,
Because there's another one stuck in my head,
It's about me, my brother, and a shirt in the wind,
The blood is starting to turn yellow.
Yah! Yah! Yah!
Yah! Yah! Yah!
Yah! Yah!
It's Pa who drives the oxen 'round the mill,
In Grandpa's time, the slaves did all the work,
Now we do it.
Tonio, my brother, crushes the sugarcane,
Ma gathers the scraps,
Bring more cane, kid.
Hurry up!
Let's go, Blocky!
Turn, turn!
 Ma says
God never gives us...
heavier burdens than we can bear,
But God keeps messing up,
He sometimes dumps such burdens on us, we all collapse,
We live in Stream-of-Souls,
It's in the middle of nothing,
All we know is it's above the ground and below the sun,
It's so hot that it sets our hearts boiling...
like a pot of molasses,
 Tonio, I dreamed about Inácio again,
Go back to sleep now.
Go on, kid.
And now, sleep.
Go on, go on!
The blood has turned yellow.
Tonio... you know what you have to do.
Don't go, Tonio.
Your brother's soul isn't at rest.
He did what he had to do.
It's Tonio's turn now.
Don't go.
 Listen to me, kid,
Your grandfather, your uncles, your oldest brother... all died for this land and for our honor.
One day, it could be you.
You're a Breves,
I, too, did my duty.
But it wasn't God's will that I die.
Tonio, you'll leave at daybreak,
And remember... you're only to seek out your brother's killer.
Man to man, face to face.
 Tonio will be walking over land that used to be ours,
The Ferreiras took it from us and we took it back,
Now it's theirs again,
That's how the feud began,
Pa says it's an eye for an eye,
One of theirs for one of ours...
and so on, until everyone ended up blind,
In the land of the blind...
one-eyed people are said to be mad,
MO THER,; May God consent, may it be God's will,
May the soul of Inácio, my first- born... find peace alongside his own.
May each drop of his blood cost the enemy two.
May you, my son... find the peace you never found among the living.
And watch over your brothers when their turn comes,
We're going for water.
Yes, sir.
 Everything quiet?
GUARD,; Yes, sir,
Like this.
Go outside, kid.
For my brother!
I won't pray for your grandson's soul, since he killed my son.
But I respect your suffering.
It's the same as mine.
Today, ours is greater.
My son asks permission to attend the vigil... to pray for the deceased's soul.
Afterwards, if you accept, he'd like to talk to you.
- Where is he?
- Outside.
Thank you.
Good-bye, my friend.
I prayed for the deceased.
I came to the wake and the burial.
Now, I'd like to talk to you.
I request a truce.
Grandfather, don't accord a truce.
The truce is granted.
The same one your father granted to my grandson.
Until the next moon.
From one death to the next.
This is your guarantee until the full moon.
After that, when the blood turns yellow, it will expire.
How old are you?
Twenty.
Your life is now split in two.
The twenty years you've already lived... and the short time you have left.
Have you ever known love?
You never will.
Do you hear that clock?
Each time it ticks-one more, one more, one more... it will be telling you... one less, one less, one less.
Whoa.
Good morning.
Morning.
 Do you know of a little village... near here called Born Sossago?
It's over there.
But it's not little.
 It's not?
What's this place called?
Stream-of-Souls.
So where's the stream?
Dried up.
Only the souls remain.
What is your name?
- Kid.
What?
I don't have a name.
- What do they call you?
- They just call me kid.
They call the kid "kid."
Kid!
Here, this is for you.
Can you read?
No.
But I can read pictures.
Hey, kid!
Stay away from those vagrants!
 Ma thinks the bloodstain will come out,
But it won't come out,
 You did your duty, my son,
Now you have much to do before the next moon.
Crush the sugarcane and fix the roof... in case it rains this year.
It never rains.
Then the raw sugar has to be sold in the village.
 That sounded like a bad dream, Tonio,
I tried to wake you up, but you didn't want to,
What are you doing up, kid?
Reading.
Where'd you get that?
A present.
From who?
The girl gave it to me.
What girl?
My friend, of course.
- You went into town alone?
No.
They were lost.
But not anymore.
I showed them the way.
Hmm.
So what's that book about?
It's about everything.
Something's wrong, kid.
- What's wrong?
- It's upside down.
No, it's not.
Want to bet?
It's the same this way... or that way.
No difference, see?
You don't know a thing about books. Give it to me.
-  It's her!
- TONIO,; Her? Who?
The girl who gave me the book.
She lives in the sea with the fish, the crabs, and the boats.
She'll take me with her.
She'll teach me the alphabet and all.
You don't believe me?
When I grow up, we'll get married.
- Has she been informed?
- No.
It's still a secret.
 One day... the mermaid comes up to the surface.
And she saw the tree, the cows, the mountains, and grass.
When she looked at the top of the raw-sugar house... she saw the rooster with the mangy neck crowing for her.
Ahh.
Wow, she really liked that!
And she also saw the sugarcane, the mill... everything delighted her!
But the best part of all was when she saw the kid.
Are you still reading that book?
Can't you see it will hurt your eyes?
I'm trying to remember the story.
Sometimes I can, sometimes I forget.
Then just forget.
Well?
It is beginning to change color.
It won't take long now.
No, it won't.
You're the most important merchant in town... but with all due respect, this isn't the right amount.
MR, LOURENÇO,; No,
It is the right amount,
But I gave you the usual quantity.
Steam power is bringing the price down. It's progress.
I think you should follow the example, Mr. Breves.
But Mr. Lourenço, we had an agreement.
There is no shortage of raw sugar!
 Come on up!
Come one, come all, if you want to watch...
the snake and the toad dance!
Everyone will come.
Together we will go.
Tomorrow night, no one will sleep.
No man, no woman, no child.
Come one, come all!
To the circus!
Mr. Lourenço wants to decide other people's suffering.
I saw her.
Who?
The mermaid.
Up on stilts.
On what?
She's in the circus.
Yeah?
They're bringing the circus to town...
with a fire-eater, a clown... and a snake that dances with a toad.
- A snake with a what?
- A toad.
Yeah?
Hey, are you daydreaming, kid?
More cane!
Keep turning!
 Hurry up with that cane!
Tonio.
I want to go to the circus real bad.
You think Pa will let you?
We're like oxen here.
We go 'round and 'round and never go anywhere.
Let's go, kid.
You want to see the circus?
Hmm?
Then let's go.
See? I told you, she's hot stuff.
Fire! Fire!
I'll be damned!
I'm toasted!
Salustiana, look who's here.
Hey! It's the kid without a name.
Anything's better than "Salustiana."
My name's Clara.
What's yours?
That's Tonio, my brother.
Good evening.
Did you like the show?
I liked the fire best.
You're really hot!
Holy shit!
I brought the book so you can remind me of the story.
It's late now.
SALUS TlANA,; Hey, kid...
I'm going to give you a name.
A name all your own.
What's your favorite animal?
Do you like birds?
He only likes sea creatures.
Oh, yeah? Then I'll name you Sardine!
Ha ha!
You bullshitting me?
We'll choose another name.
Pacu.
Pacu!
I've christened you,
You have a name now.
And I'm your godfather,
Hmm!
To celebrate your christening!
-  I don't like it,
- TONIO,; What?
The name.
Pacu.
He's pulling my leg.
Pacu is a kind of river fish.
Tonio.
Do you think they sleep together?
I don't know.
All I know is, he's your godfather now.
Pacu.
Pacu!
Pacu! Ha ha!
Cut it out, will you?
Where'd you take the kid?
Where?
To the circus.
Where?
The circus.
Go to your room, kid.
Right now!
 Having fun at a time like this?
Have you no respect for our dead?
You should follow your older brother's example.
Don't worry.
I'll soon be like him.
Shut up.
Sorry, but I won't shut up.
- Shut your mouth.
- No!
- Shut up!
- No!
-  Shut up!
- TONIO,; No!
- I won't!
- Shut up!
 Tonio,
You have to go away.
Did you see his black armband?
Yes.
He won't be around much longer.
- What are you talking about?
- It's true.
It's a family feud.
One side kills, then the other.
- How do you know?
- It goes way back.
They're fighting for the land.
They'd rather kill than solve their problems.
Real fanatics.
It's like the two snakes
I saw fighting.
Each was biting the tail of the other.
They ate each other up until nothing was left.
Nothing but a pool of blood on the ground.
They'll all be killed off.
Hmm.
I feel sorry for them.
I really do.
Yah!
Stay in line!
Keep it going, Slowpoke!
 You're lagging!
Keep turning!
Come on, Blocky!
Keep it going!
Come on, Slowpoke!
Get up, Slowpoke!
That's good, my ox.
Tonio!
The oxen are going 'round on their own!
Need some help?
I can always use help.
Especially if it's free.
Where's my godson?
At home.
Come for the circus?
Heh!
You'll have to wait till next year.
We're off to Ventura for the festival.
Ever been to Ventura?
No. I haven't been anywhere.
Were you born dead or alive?
What?
Were you born dead or alive?
Alive.
Well, I was born dead.
True or false?
True, I'm afraid.
Ha ha!
Let me explain.
My mother almost died giving birth.
I was born purple-so purple they thought I was dead.
True or false?
They ignored me for two hours while trying to save my mother.
Then they decided to wash me so
I'd look decent for the funeral.
As soon as I felt the cold water, I started howling.
As a result, that was my first and last bath.
No more baths!
And the second result:
Nothing bothers me.
Anyone born dead has been through the worst.
After that, life's a breeze.
No kidding!
So when it comes to water...
I don't even use it for drinking!
Ha ha ha!
Yuck! Let's go, Bootleg!
How long do you have?
Not long.
I'll go as far as Ventura, then I have to go back,
SALUS TlANA,; Clara...
where are you?
In this house, the dead command the living.
Sometimes I wish Tonio wouldn't come back.
Don't say that, woman.
Even the worst life is better... than being slaughtered like an animal.
Look around you, woman.
What do we have left?
Nothing.
You see, we've already lost everything.
And if Tonio doesn't come back, we'll have lost our honor, too.

Let's go, Bootleg!
Come on, Bootleg!
Sleep well, young man?
 The mermaid coul dn't live on land...
because she had a fish-tail... where her legs should be.
The poor thing couldn't walk.
Even so, one day she got furious and jumped out of the sea!
She started fighting with snakes and toads.
Then, because she missed the kid so much... she started puffing out fire and smoke.
So the kid got on a tired ol d ox...
and galloped after the mermaid,
Do-dum, do-dum, looking for the mermaid.
He went through the woods, the cane fields... and when he parted the last row of sugarcane... he came upon the sea.
And he found the mermaid.
Following in your brother's footsteps?
Think you can just take it easy around here?
 Give me my book!
Give it to me!
Give me my book!
Give it to me!
GROUP,; Die, you rabid dog!
Take that!
To hell with the traitor!
Hah!
 Don't tell me this shitty circus is still around,
What did you say?
 You heard me,
- Shit what?
Circus!
Get out of here!
You lousy bum!
Ha ha ha!
Reginaldo. Come here!
Shitty things are impossible to get rid of. Like you.
You mean like you.
REGINALDO,; Is that Clara?
Your stepdaughter?
Spitting image of her mother.
REGINALDO,; How she's grown!
Do it right, kid.
You're big enough now.
Come, Tonio.
I'm going to show you something, Tonio.
Help me. Pull on the rope.
CLARA,; Start turning,
Turn it faster, Tonio.
Faster!
Faster!
Even more!
I'll never forget this... or you.
Neither will I, Tonio.
 Clara!
 Yah! Yah!
Yah! Yah! Yah!
Whoa.
Yah!
The shirt is almost yellow now.
It always turns yellow.
With your permission...
I could get the men together...
and wipe those Breves from the face of this earth,
 I'll repeat this one last time,
Blood has the same volume for everyone.
You have no right to take more than the blood taken from you.
Otherwise, you'll pay twice- in this life and in the next.
That's what my father taught me and his father taught him.
And that's how it'll be until I die.
I taught you how to fly with this, remember?
You were scared shitless.
Tonio, today it's your turn.
Huh?
You take my place,
I'll take yours.
No, I don't want to.
Just once.
 Ooh!
 Tonio!
Tonio. Tonio.
Tonio. Tonio.
Huh!
You're too damn strong.
No, you just forgot how to fly.
Let me, it's my turn!
Ooh, it's hot!
Ha ha!
Hey!
This is my favorite part of the show.
Ha ha!
Come on! Who's next!
Keep filling it!
Fill it up!
You can't do this.
Anyhow, he's already dead.
But I'm not.
It's turned yellow.

Is it reall yellow now?
 Yes, it's yellowed,
You know what you have to do, then.
Yes, I know.
Tonio, you know the truce ends today.
From now on, it depends on the shirt.
Don't go too far from the house.
Stay close to me,
And always carry the gun,
It's going to rain.
No, it's not the rainy season.
I know it's going to rain.
Tonio?
Pa took my book.
I can't remember the story or the mermaid's face anymore.
The mermaid...
Had a fish tail... while the boy had toes, feet, and...
Aren't you going to sleep, Pacu?
I can't, Tonio. It's too windy.
Then talk in silence.
OK.
Tonio.
Clara...
I wanted to tell you
I've left everything.
I'm heading east, to the coast.
You have the right to do it, too.
I'll be waiting.
 Now you know my story,
But I still can't remember the other one,
The mermaid, the ships-damn!
The kid coul dn't find the mermaid...
no, it wasn't like that,
Damn,
It's the mermaid who came looking-yeah, that's it,
I think I'm remembering it!
One day, the mermaid came and took him to live with her,
And he reall y liked that!
She turned the kid into a fish...
and took him to live in the east, at the sea,
In the sea, everyone wasn't dying all the time,
There was a lot of room for everyone,
In the sea, they lived so happil y...
so happil y, they coul dn't stop laughing,
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha,
In the sea, they were so happy, so happy together... they couldn't help laughing.
Tonio!
Oh, God, not my son!
Not my son!
They've killed the kid.
Get the gun, Tonio! Right now!
There's no truce, go avenge the blood!
Reclaim the blood of those pigs!
Go, my son! Reclaim the blood!
Immediatel y!
What are you doing?
The gun!
Where's the gun, Tonio?
Tonio!
Tonio!
Come back!
Come back or you'll die for the honor of the family.
It's over! Don't you see?
It's all over!
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
 One day...
the mermaid took him to live with her by the sea,

What are you morons ogling at?
Who takes those trains these days?
Nothing but cheap dealers.
Everyone's smuggling stuff somewhere.
Russia's got the clothing fever.
And our Little Nell is posing like some Greek statue in the Pushkin Museum.
Ever heard of that museum, you shitheads?
Cleaning detail, finish up.
The rest of you, get to bed.
You hear me?
Yes, sir!
So, you losers, seen enough?
Had your little fix?
Shame on you.
War and stupidity will feed this generation.
A generation of junkies and trash.
I spit in your faces.
"Thunder rumbles on the front
"My boots tramp on regardless
"Charge, onwards to the enemy!"
Wipe that up, please.
Get lost, scumbag.
Wipe it up.
I spit on you all, the runts and the tyrants,
Iinks in the chain of strength trampling my homeland!
Physical abuse is illegal.
That's a violation of the law on psychiatric care and the rights of the citizen adopted in July 1992 by the Supreme Soviet.
-Wipe it up!
-I'll do it!
Wait.
Leave her alone.
She has bad nerves.
-She spat, she cleans it up.
-Who do you think you are?
To give me orders!
You maniac, schizophrenic bald scribbler!
Maniac, schizophrenic, bald scribbler!
A man must not force a woman.
You animal! Goddamn screw!
Flunky!
In the camp, guys like you were smothered under mattresses.
-Get up!
-Come on!
You're humiliating humanity.
Your turn will come one day.
Just wait a while and we'll change places.
I'll spit and you'll wipe it up.
"Sit down by my side
"Take me in your arms and sing
"l feel so alone without you
"But complete when you're near"
Open up! Who locked me in?
Crazy bitch.
"Sit down by my side..."
Good morning, my love.
He's covered in fly shit again.
Damn things!
I thought I'd killed them all.
I dreamt he sang me love songs again.
I dreamt of cocks again.
Cocks with wings like angels flying all around me.
He's missing me so much.
I can tell he's waiting for me.
Give it a rest.
I bet he already has a wife.
Are you stupid, Lucia, or what?
She's a girlfriend.
He doesn't love her.
He knows he has a fiancee in Russia.
For the wedding day,
I'll buy a big white hat.
Hats really suit me.
Lucia! There! There it is!
Bastard!
I'll beat the shit out of you!
Quiet!
It's dead.
Stop pushing.
You're not getting through,
I'm next!
-What about your toilet?
-Flooded again.
You'll crap all over ours again.
Have you seen Goga?
You haven't seen him?
Goga!
We'll miss our turn!
Have you seen Goga anywhere?
-Has Mahmud been here?
-Yeah, but he's gone again.
Where's my place?
He was keeping it.
Get to the back of the line,
Citizen Atanessian.
Hey, Tut-tut, come out now!
Shorty's going to burst.
You were keeping my place?
Where am l?
I was here before anyone for you.
Gangway!
Stop! Let Goga through.
I'm going nowhere.
Never!
No privileges here!
This is the women's toilet.
Come on, Shorty's bursting.
A real mafia, selling places in line.
Get out of there, bitch!
I have a bladder!
Here, this is for later.
And that's for you so you won't be jealous.
Lucia told me everything.
Just think!
Be quiet or there'll be trouble!
Understand?
See you.
See you.
Doctor, are we eating with the women again?
Don't you like it?
Oh, we do!
If you behave, you can eat with them every day.
That's a violation of the rules governing psychiatric care.
Vika, our rules were written ages ago.
In America, they've done it for years.
The quiet patients eat together.
It has a beneficial effect.
But if you'd rather eat alone, that's no problem.
Doctor, can you give me something so I don't need to poo?
I'm sick to death of having to queue every day.
You can't have it all, Mahmud.
Life's like that.
Like what?
Well...
It's when new shit is produced every day.
Nothing to laugh about.
That definition has a certain depth to it.
Misha!
Wait!
Roustam, watch Vika closely!
Do your best!
Go on! Well done, Zoia!
Now, the bridge!
Let's stop and do the bridge!
Lie down!
Heads towards me!
Good, Lucia!
Well done! Congratulations!
Zoia's the best at it.
Vika, careful!
You'll break your neck!
Janna, look, I'm a yogi!
Well done, Shorty!
Give him a round of applause.
Well done, Shorty!
Give him a big hand!
It wasn't me!
Hurray! We're burning!
"Two guitars behind the wall
"Strike up a sad song...
"You and I lie together
"On a narrow bed
"You stare at the ceiling
"And seem to count the flies
"l feel so lonely
"And you don't even see"
Can I have your porridge?
-Who's that?
-Grandpa.
A tooth!
A tooth in my porridge!
A human tooth!
You know what this means, comrades?
Imagine what they're feeding us if our teeth are falling out.
I want to know.
Who did this?
Who gave Mahmud matches?
-You don't know?
-Who's asking you?
Who's going to own up?
I warned you not to give him matches.
Do you want to be burned alive or what?
He's capable of it!
Well?
Who'll own up?
I already told you it wasn't me.
It wasn't me!
Stay away, you're going to hurt me!
My bladder! Put me down!
Don't touch me.
Aminazine up the backside.
Strap them to their beds.
Very well.
Do we have to force-feed you?
Aren't you sick of it?
You can be so stubborn.
You know very well
I'm going to do it.
There'll be no train today.
All go back to your rooms.
-ls it broken?
-No, it's fine.
He's just tired of pulling those heavy carriages.
Even iron locomotives get tired sometimes.
All go back quietly to your rooms.
The phone's cut off and the radio's dead.
What does that mean?
It's not good.
We'll have to evacuate the patients.
But we'll need to find money first.
Fire me if you want, doctor, but
I won't spend the night here.
What are you doing?
Give it back!
-Let me have a go.
-You'll break it!
It's not going to break!
"Water flows from the well..."
Tell him. It's my accordion!
Lucia, they've taken my accordion.
What's wrong?
They've taken my Shorty away!
That faggot Goga. The asshole!
I'll smash his head in with my iron.
They're in the women's ward.
-Who let the violent ward out?
-We did.
-What if the doctor finds out?
-He's not here!
The rats have deserted the ship!
The Communist regime is over!
Freedom!
Stop it!
You should be ashamed!
I'll untie you.
Shorty, my love, are you all right?
Do you like my wig?
It's Claudia's, the second floor nurse.
Open up!
Vika let the violent ward out!
The doctor went for a bus to evacuate us.
I woke up at 4 in the morning.
The place was deserted.
Freedom! Down with Fascism!
Take to the streets!
I'll go.
Not a soul.
The coast is clear! Hurray!
Down with the bars!
Break it down!
Bombs! Mother!
Faster!
-Wash the floor.
-But we're being attacked!
Even if it's a world war,
I don't give a shit!
I warned you, Vika!
Play!
Will they kill us?
Tank regiments are commanded by total idiots.
You send in the infantry first, then the tanks.
It wasn't me!
Don't kill me!
Don't worry.
We won't hurt you.
Don't hurt me.
It's nothing to do with me!
Wow! She's hairy.
It's a man.
-Where's the doctor?
-Getting buses.
-Who are you?
-Alikhan.
I need a room without windows for the prisoners.
In the basement.
Spirit and bandages for the casualties.
Upstairs, in the interns' office.
But the violent patients have locked themselves in.
Cut it, instead of staring!
Will you fucking cut it or not?
-We need spirit.
-I have some cologne.
Over here.
Hold me down.
Pour it on!
That hurts.
Hello.
What's the sense in sending three of you to cover her?
She never listens!
We told her not to go!
We couldn't stop her!
You lay down your life for a sniper.
Calm down. Got any antibiotics?
Hand them over.
She's a woman?
Yes, a Lithuanian.
With nerves of steel.
-ls the basement this way?
-Yes.
Did we scare you?
What are you, a bandit group?
This is Shorty.
Janna, I'm hungry.
Everyone's hungry.
I haven't eaten a thing all day.
Let go of me!
Remember the guy with the green eyes?
As soon as I saw them,
I got goose bumps.
Did you see his beard, Zoia?
Nice and soft.
You hear? I touched his beard.
It was so soft.
They've taken my accordion again.
He pressed me up against the wall and said he could guess my name.
I said,
"You'll never guess."
Hello.
Come in and help us.
Do you like it?
That's my accordion.
It is? You know how to play?
I don't believe you!
I do know how.
Sit down and show us, then.
Come on, don't be afraid.
You're pretty. Are you a nurse?
-I live here.
-You're sick, then.
I used to be but I'm not anymore.
A polka?
Any other pretty girls?
Yes.
A lot?
There's Lucia.
I share a room with her.
Then there's Sonia.
And Vika, she's very beautiful.
You play well.
-I can dance too.
-You dance?
You're kidding us!
I'm doing the circus school exam.
I can even tap-dance.
Incredible! Show us.
I don't have the right shoes.
Show us anyway.
What music do you want?
Something fast.
Faster.
Do you believe me now?
What a woman of passion!
Will you marry me?
You want to marry me?
Marry you?
Yes, today. We can hold the wedding this evening.
Are you crazy?
I already have a fiance.
Damn! Where is he?
In America, on tour.
One fiance's not enough for a woman like you.
One in America, one here.
Ask my friends.
Ahmed never lies.
Bring your accordion tonight.
You will come?
I'll be waiting!
What a fiance!
What's up? You want kebabs?
The Russians are coming!
Ahmed, get up to the roof.
Quick!
MENTAL PATlENTS
Don't shoot!
We've an offer to make.
Are you going to shoot?
Make sure you don't miss.
Don't shoot!
Get out!
What do you want?
My captain wants to speak to yours.
Captain, come here.
Well?
We have one of your corpses.
Want to lD it?
Check if it's one of ours.
Any dope?
Two crates of ammo for 5 ounces.
1,500 rounds?
What kind of shit is it?
Top quality. Try some.
We don't sell crap.
Okay. We'll leave the crates with the body.
Well?
It's Salman.
How much?
Two thousand bucks.
Tell Mahomet, he'll fix it.
Take Askhab and get the body.
Let's sit down a while and count the money.
All right.
A villager said he was yours.
If not, we wouldn't have known.
Count out two thousand.
No hundred-dollar bills?
Small bills aren't money for you?
You went begging to gather all that together?
Fuck me!
The 20th Paratrooper Regiment.
You were in Afghanistan, then?
Did you guys save our asses in the Chungur ambush?
Your commander had a stammer.
Poltavchenko, a great guy.
You said it.
What's your name?
There's time for a quick joint.
You'll really marry me?
It went off by accident!
Hold your fire!
Our captain's over there!
You fuckwits!
Are you totally wasted?
Sir...
Shut it!
You'll end up in deeper shit!
Captain!
Wait!
Get back in!
Hurry!
You forgot the money!
We'll manage without it!
We had an agreement.
Give it to your mullah!
I owe you that after Chungur.
I'm sorry.
You will forgive me, won't you?
I'll pray for you every day.
I won't abandon you.
You'll find someone else.
What are you doing?
-Nothing.
-Where are you going?
Lucia, are you afraid of men?
Me? Yes. I don't know... No.
I'm getting married.
He asked for my hand.
Who?
The best-looking Chechen, in a black hat.
He plays the accordion too.
It takes your breath away.
That's it!
I can't cheat on him.
On who?
Bryan.
He'll find two new ones.
You can have my new patent leather shoes.
No, I can't accept.
Take them, please.
I'll just try them on, then.
Perfect.
If Bryan comes tomorrow, what'll you tell him?
Go, don't turn down your chance to be happy. Go!
Go!
No, I can't go!
It only happens once in a lifetime, never twice.
So?
I have some presents for you too.
Goga, here. "The Miraculous
Power of Water".
Thank you.
Zoia...
-My toy elephant.
-I'll take it later.
Take it now, I'm going.
Thank you.
A silver spoon for your first baby.
Can I have your accordion?
I can't, it's my breadwinner.
As my dad, the human torso, used to say.
Hi, everyone.
Janna, I've never been good at giving presents but I don't think this will spoil things, far from it, in fact.
I wish you happiness.
I only wore it once.
A hat!
I've dreamt of one.
Hats suit me so well!
To be honest,
I never thought you'd do something like this.
It's a powerful symbol.
As the world ignores this tragedy, you're marrying a man who is fighting against Russian imperialist policy.
It's an act of international significance.
All the mass media should know about it.
I call it popular diplomacy in action.
Even if,
I have to admit that I'm going to miss your gym classes terribly, along with your humanity.
I'm not afraid of saying it.
Shut your mouth, Vika.
All right.
We've found a proper wedding veil!
That's my bedspread.
Calm down, Vera.
I don't want a veil.
Hats suit me better.
Janna, come over here.
Roustam, help us.
One...
Two...
Three...
What a knockout!
Let's take a picture!
Ali's got the camera.
Where is he?
He's locked himself in his room.
I knocked but he didn't answer.
Can I come in?
Give us the camera, please.
There's no film left.
You want to upset me but it won't work.
No, it's really all gone.
I have a gift for you.
You mustn't leave.
Lucia says I mustn't miss my chance.
It only happens once.
You mustn't go.
Bye!
There's a war outside.
Let go, you're hurting me.
Are you stupid or what?
I've brought you an apple.
Eat it. That way the nurse won't shout at you.
Zoia will grate it for you.
I've got a hat.
Andrei, sweety.
The hat.
See you.
See you.
Last New Year, we kissed, you remember?
This will be the second time.
Keep the curtain closed or the flies will crap all over Bryan again.
Vika, be careful when you do the bridge.
Don't go breaking your neck.
Fedia, you're a plumber, so fix the toilets.
There...
Bye.
I'm going.
Bye.
-Where are you going?
-I'll see her to the gate.
Let's go upstairs to watch her go.
Let's go.
Hello.
-Hello.
-Hi.
Come on in, women are always welcome.
Be careful here.
Hello.
Here I am.
Ahmed, your fiancee's here.
Ahmed's marrying his beauty.
You were right to come.
Sit down at the table.
Next to your fiance.
Get her a clean plate.
Ahmed, why don't you ask her to sit next to you?
Is it true?
What?
You promised her?
Yes, he did, sir, I was there.
We were all in the laundry room.
Say something.
It's tasty. All we get is porridge and cocoa.
Ahmed, I'm waiting. Is it true?
Yes. Why? Is that a problem?
A wedding needs wine.
Sir, may l?
You made a poor choice.
He's an actor.
Never trust an actor.
I don't usually keep my word.
But I will now!
I'm marrying her.
You're all witnesses.
Pass me the vodka.
You know our dances?
No, only the polka.
Go on, you play!
Look at this woman!
Such talent!
Show them how you dance!
Come here! Come on!
I've come to take her back.
-ls he a relative?
-No.
His name's Ali.
He helped us out earlier.
Come and eat with us.
Sit down.
Don't!
He never takes his pack off, even when he sleeps.
What's it in? Dollars?
It's a secret. I can't say.
Why are you doing this?
She's sick.
I'm not sick.
I'm perfectly healthy.
Let's go back.
You want to take her back to the nuthouse?
It's not a "nuthouse", it's our home.
That's where we live.
We'll spend our lives here.
Have a drink. We'll talk later.
Come on!
Leave him alone!
They're letters.
They're not letters, they're poems.
Ali is a poet. They're poems.
Ali, don't be angry. Read them your poems instead.
"The storm brings darkness, the wind howls,
"Like a beast, like a child
"lt howls at everyone
"Twisting round tenderly
"Like a wanderer lost on earth..."
Let's go back.
Ahmed!
Leave me alone!
My hat!
Good evening, my sweet fiancee.
Forgive me, please.
For what?
I can't marry you.
He can't survive if I abandon him.
Who can't?
My fiance, Bryan Adams.
-He loves you that much?
-You've no idea!
It's crazy how much he loves me!
But that's not the reason.
It's because I love him.
It's tough on him.
He wouldn't get by without me.
Is he in the army?
No, you're in the army.
He's a singer.
He's Bryan Adams.
-The American star?
-He's Canadian.
He was born in Canada and lives in London.
His father's a diplomat, he loves opera.
Bryan Adams loves opera?
No, not Bryan, his father loves opera.
Perhaps Bryan does too.
Do you know that we're alive because someone somewhere loves us?
They pray for us and give us strength.
Tell me, who's praying for you?
Someone has to be.
Don't worry, someone has to be praying for you too.
That's all.
You're not angry, are you?
I should be asking you for forgiveness.
I never intended to marry you.
I was just fooling around.
I often speak before I think.
When that argument started,
I spoke out of pride.
After, when we danced,
I saw how stupid I am.
I'd make a poor fiance.
But you're a great dancer!
I never thought
I'd carry a gun one day.
I couldn't even shoot straight.
But when my brothers were killed, when the roof fell in on my father,
I went and asked them for a gun.
So now I shoot.
I wonder... when they'll kill me.
You won't get killed.
You're special.
Who do you look like, your father or your mother?
Who do I look like?
Like a bald bastard, that's who!
-Totally fucking bald.
-So what?
Ali's bald too, and so is the doctor.
Lenin was too.
And he was smart.
And his wife loved him.
And aliens, forget it!
Not only are they bald, they're green.
I need another drink.
I've got some vodka.
Fedia stole it from the laundry.
So you're an actor?
That's a bad idea, beautiful.
Time to fix the hangover.
I told you to eat something.
I don't remember a thing.
You danced and then you cried.
After, you fell asleep on my breast.
Wet it with some beer.
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.
I've cheated on my beloved.
Stop it!
You can go back to him.
I won't tell him anything.
No, it's too late.
He'll never forgive me.
You and l will be together forever now.
Listen, what's your name?
Janna... Timofeeva.
Janna, don't think that way.
You understand me?
Don't panic!
Everyone pair off!
Move to the boiler room!
Vika, that concerns you too.
Nothing concerns me.
I don't have time to talk to you.
Don't touch me!
What are you doing?
That's hospital property!
Don't forget anyone.
Stick together, in pairs!
Come in here!
In pairs!
The Russians are at the market!
Help me! Teach me to shoot!
Get out of my way!
I want to help.
Okay, give me those sacks.
Vakhid, teach me to shoot.
Try to understand.
I have to be with you.
It's such a joy, fighting for your own freedom.
I don't want to miss the party.
-Get to the basement!
-Show me!
It's such a joy, fighting for your own freedom.
We're heading for the market!
Go back home!
You understand Russian?
Where's my home?
Here!
You're totally crazy!
I can play the accordion!
Look, I can play the accordion!
Faster!
Don't stay there!
Down with
Russian chauvinism!
Let's go!
Freedom!
I love you!
Don't stay there!
Don't leave me!
I'm yours now, Ahmed,
I'm your wife!
Those are not yours!
What are you doing?
Tell him I'm your wife!
Go, you're in the way!
I don't have a wife! Go!
Ahmed, don't kill me!
Ahmed,
I love you!
Don't kill me!
Fire,
I love you.
Don't kill me.
Mud,
I love you.
Don't kill me.
Go now, I'll stay here a while.
Go on.
Lucia!
Zoia!
I can't take anymore!
What are you doing here?
Go down to the basement!
Lucia!
Anybody!
She's been killed in my room!
She has a headache.
Listen to me, she's lying on Lucia's bed!
You didn't eat your apple?
The nurse says that
God forgives.
Will he forgive everyone?
Who?
God.
Which one?
You know, God.
What do you see?
An apple.
Is that all?
Well, yes, what else?
It's an apple.
I see different nations on that apple, people that love each other and destroy each other, fighting for generations, and dying.
They stare up in hope to see my face.
And you want me to eat them?
I can only forgive them.
Just as I forgive you.
I'm aware of your existence.
Go now.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
A new hairstyle.
It's getting in my way.
You didn't leave?
Well, no.
There wasn't enough room in the truck.
Besides, I cut my hand.
Where's your fiance?
I changed my mind.
Shorty, come here!
Janna is back!
Doctor, where have you been?
I went to get some buses, but the Chechens captured them, along with me.
We went to Sali.
We had no idea where you were.
I'm staying with you now.
Will we have our pills again?
Colonel, you're holding all your pills.
Pills again!
-Everyone upstairs!
-Let's go home!
We'll sort the mess out.
How do you feel?
The nurse isn't coming back?
I don't know.
I heard her grandson's been killed.
Nobody hurt you?
No.
We sang every night, we danced and drank beer...
I'm glad.
Good...
Is he still alive?
Who?
Him.
Ahmed. Is he still alive?
Let's go in.
Let them kill him.
I want him to be killed.
Bullet or bomb, straight in the head.
A shell or a missile.
I hope he's crying in pain.
And that he forgets about me.
I hope he suffers a lot.
Let's go.
Anybody here?
Scouts, forward!
Go in!
Where are you dickheads off to?
You have your instructions in black and white.
If you see Chechen corpses, you keep going!
If not, watch out!
Someone's out there!
-What is it?
-There's a guy in there.
What's with him?
-You read the sign?
-Yes, sir.
We're in the nuthouse. Stop!
It could be booby-trapped.
-Do you get it?
-Yes, sir!
I can't.
I can't let anyone through.
Get me your captain.
What's all this shouting?
Let my patients use the canteen.
No way, we haven't checked it yet.
Let me pass, then.
I need to get syringes.
All right, go on!
What is this? Look at him.
He seems half-dead.
It's nothing.
Just an adrenaline attack.
He's in shock.
He'll get over it.
Get the picture?
Look at my boots.
I've never seen shit like this.
As soon as it rains, there's fucking mud everywhere.
If a tank passes, we're stuck.
And there are mines everywhere.
Look at my laces.
It's crazy!
I can't undo them now!
I can't take anymore!
All Chechens should be shot.
Where are my men?
Where is Vaska?
Victor's head was blown off.
Listen,
Serguei was shot by a sniper.
He was such a great guy!
Listen, give me a shot of something strong.
Just don't let my men see.
Hold it.
I don't get it.
What happened to me?
Know what the most important thing in the war is?
It's not victory.
The most important thing is Death.
I've never known fear.
Maybe your mind hasn't felt it, but your flesh has.
Tolstoy said,
"Why is a man happy when he kills another?
"What's there to be happy about?"
Feeling any better?
Not a fucking word to anyone!
Understand?
Faster!
Right and left!
Hey, Miss Musician, have you seen anyone?
-What?
-There is nobody!
Head on up.
They must be upstairs.
Nobody goes out, unless you want to be shot!
Understood?
Is it the war again?
We're looking for bandits!
They're hiding here somewhere.
Understand?
Everybody hit the floor!
-It's the war, all right!
-Get down!
Toss in a smoke bomb!
Surrender, you fuckers!
Wait.
Rekemchuk?
Holy shit, we're shooting at our own side!
Rekemchuk, are you fucking crazy?
Answer me and make it snappy!
They shot Smirnov on the roof.
We were firing at you...
It's just a scratch.
Safonov is hurt.
We'll set him straight.
Get up there, hurry!
Fucking move!
Unit 2, send in the tanks and surround the asylum.
Yes, the one near the bridge!
To avoid further casualties, put down your arms and come out.
To avoid further casualties, put down your arms and come out.
Stay. There are bandits upstairs.
Lucia, I'm going with you!
Go on up!
To avoid further casualties, put down your arms and come out.
No country treats its people like this.
Listen, they're firing on the bandits.
Is the train coming through tonight?
The doctor promised.
Of course. If he promised...
Is this place free?
Look!
Attention!
Don't be afraid of these soldiers.
They're kind.
They caught the bandits on the roof.
One of them got away.
Did you see anyone suspicious?
If you do,
Iet the guard out in the yard know right away.
Understand?
We'll show you one of the bandits.
He's a very bad man.
Is he one of the men who took over the hospital, smashed our windows and stole our drugs?
Bring him in!
Well, who knows this man?
He's hurt.
What?
What did you say?
He's hurt.
And so you haven't seen someone suspicious around?
Right!
Petrov, hold on.
Take the prisoner to HQ!
We'll soon see.
The building's clean, as they say.
Any problems, call HQ.
Who's that?
Who are you?
I'm sick, I need to be treated.
Do you all know him?
He's one of us, he's Ahmed.
Right! He's our Ahmed!
He's in our room.
Art, for me, is a form of nourishment.
I... I need... I need the land.
I need it.
I want to understand that state and that energy that I have in me that I also feel in the plants and in the land.
The energy and life that is running through the...
Flowing through the landscape.
You know, that intangible thing that is here and then gone.
Growth, time, change, and the idea of flow in nature.
There's two big influences in my work...
The sea and the river...
Both water.
You would think that time would be more compatible with the tide.
Time and tide...
This daily up and down.
But somehow, I think there's a lot to be learned about time by the river.
There are always these obsessive forms that you cannot get rid of.
I don't like the sensation of traveling.
I feel dislocated, uprooted, and it takes me time to re-establish roots again.
And when I arrive at a new place
I have to begin work almost immediately.
There's no period of research or resting.
I go straight to work.
The tide is quite extraordinary...
To have that liquid movement backwards and forwards.
And the cold, and its relationship to stone and fluidity.
But I'm a stranger here.
I'm a stranger, so...
I am so out of touch with it.
I've shook hands with the place... and begun.
And the work's going well.
I feel warm, but...
Then there's a collapse.
I think I've got this cold, and it's right through me.
Yeah...
I think good art keeps you warm.
I've mistimed it today.
I got up early, very...
You know, 4:00.
And I couldn't see anything.
The moon was out, but...
But it cast a shadow down here.
And then once you lose your heat, it's gone, you know.
Have to get it back.
And I have to work with my bare hands.
Because my gloves stick, and I don't have the sensitivity to do it with gloves.
I lose feel of it.
I always like to touch, you know...
You never shake someone's hand with a glove on.
It is hard... hard going.
And it is cold sometimes on the hands, and I do get up very early.
And all that effort is ultimately going into trying to make something that it is effortless.
I wish I had reached this point about an hour ago before the sun had risen.
What is extraordinary that I didn't expect but I would have... could only have dreamt of happening is that the sun coming from there shines completely on both sides of the rock.
So all that icicle is illuminated and against that cliff.
And I never had any idea that that would happen.
So the potential...
The potential here is fantastic!
You know, it is water.
The river and the sea made solid.
And there's so many works that I've made that the thing...
The very thing that brings the work to life is the thing that will cause it death.
My first view of the beach was a river, and a pool that was being turned by the river.
So I'm trying to touch and understand that motion...
The flow and the meeting of the river with the sea.
I mean, these two waters meeting.
- Hello.
- Fantastic!
- Do you need any help?
- No, I'm done for the day.
When I was a boy, we used to stand on those rocks and dive in.
- The water was a little deeper then...
- Yeah?
I think.
Must have been.
Do you have a name for this?
This a salmon hole. Yes.
- So, you caught salmon from here?
- Yeah. Well, many times.
Many times. Salmon.
They were touching each other, they were so thick.
Yeah.
But I'll need such a strong connection to Scotland.
You know, we have a lot of salmon holes, too.
I like that. I like that feeling of the fish there underneath.
- Yes.
- You know that?
It has a sense of a whirlpool, you know.
And that's exactly what I wanted.
So I fed off that motion into this piece.
So, what's gonna happen?
What do you expect is gonna happen when that tide hits that?
- Don't worry.
- It's just gonna float away!
It's gonna float away.
It'll move into the...
- Will it stay intact?
- It'll move into the pool there.
No, it won't stay intact.
- Absolutely not.
- No.
It feels like it's being taken off into another plane, taken off into another world or another work.
It doesn't feel at all like... destruction.
That moment is really part of that cycle of turning.
You feel as if you've touched the heart of the place.
That's a way of understanding for me...
Seeing something you never saw before that was always there but you were blind to.
There are moments when it is extraordinarily beautiful in a piece of work.
I mean, though it happens, that is...
Then those are moments that I just live for.
Well, it's quarter to 8:00.
And I think the tide's due in at around 3:00.
And, well, you know, there's not a lot of time.
And I think you should stop filming and collect stones instead, you know.
Do something useful.
The stone is not so bad.
But the...
We're having to walk quite a distance to get it,
So, all the time we're losing...
Losing time.
And...
So that makes for an interesting work.
Maybe I quite like that, that tension.
And there's a risk, you know, that maybe only this half way up, and the tide's here.
And, you know, it's like a marker to that time that's coming up behind me.
I began working on the beach.
It's where I began.
And it was a great teacher.
About time.
I think the relentlessness of it...
There's no getting away from the fact that sea is going to be here.
I was at Art College at Lancaster, and all the students were in their cubicles, as they are, and in that cramped space.
And every day I'd catch a train to Markham, where I was staying.
And you get off the train, and you see this big expanse...
The space...
In such stark contrast to the Art College.
And one day, I went off and worked on the beach.
What struck me was that sense of energy when you were outside of the Art College.
It was very secure in the Art College.
As soon as you made something outside, there was this almost breathlessness and an uncertainty.
Total control can be the death of our work.
Oops.
The stone's speaking.
I've never had one do this before.
And I think it possibly...
It's either the sand that's settling, and...
Or the weakness of the stone.
Or even the combination of the two.
But I don't think this is going to...
I think that I'll make this the widest point and just try to get some weight back in the middle to start securing it.
Damn it all.
Shit!
This is my work, you know.
Too many unknowns.
I think its chances of survival are a bit slim.
Shit!
No.
Let's go.
We need a very heavy stone right here.
Can you bring me a very heavy stone, a kind of lumpy squarish one?
Maybe I shouldn't have put that one on.
- Can you get one end down here?
- Yes.
Just put it gently on this.
- Ready?
- Down.
You okay?
That's the fourth...
The fourth collapse.
And the tide is... coming in.
I think it would be better to wait.
The moment when something collapses, it is intensely disappointing.
And this is the fourth time it's fallen, and each time I got to know the stone a little bit more.
I got higher each time.
So it grew in proportion to my understanding of the stone.
And that is really what one of the things that my art is trying to do.
It's trying to understand the stone.
I obviously don't understand it well enough yet.
People make small piles of stone to mark pathways in hills, mountains in Scotland, and I think all over the world.
So all the cones are related in some way, and they have become markers to my journeys and places that I feel an attachment towards.
And then it has a quality of this guardian, the way that it stands and feels as if it is protecting something.
I like the connection the form has with the seed...
Very full and ripe.
I think to look at stone and find growth, and is expressed in the seed within stone is a very powerful image for me.
The sea came in and the cone just disappeared.
And then it was gone.
But it was still there.
The work that I had only just finished making, so my contact with the stone was still very, very strong.
So I was with it down there, but I still couldn't see it.
What I have touched on this time is that I haven't simply made the piece to be destroyed by the sea.
It is... the work has been given to the sea as a gift.
And the sea has taken the work, and made more of it than I could have ever hoped for.
And I think that if I can see in that ways of understanding those things that happen to us in life, that changes our lives, that causes upheavals and shock...
Can't explain that.
That deeper rhythm of change
I can't see other than in my home.
And, well, this is why my homeplace is becoming more and more important to me.
Bracken is a material that I have always enjoyed working with.
But it's a very hard...
It's a very tough plant to work with.
It's very aggressive on your hands when you're pulling it.
It's like razors.
And I always associate the material with bleeding hands.
And it's one of the few plants
I use a knife on.
And it's a very toxic plant, too.
When it's sporing, you shouldn't really inhale at that time.
And I think we misread the landscape when we think of it just being pastoral and pretty.
There is a darker side to that.
Where they've been in the ground, they've gone black.
And I really like that idea that the contact between...
The alpine cows with bells.
I like the idea, that feeling that the contact between the plant and the...
Sorry.
The flavor of the fire makes the energy of the fire visible.
Well, it's the same with this black.
It's like a result of the exchange of energy that has taken place between the plant and the earth.
And that... through that process there is an exchange of heat that gives it this...
Well, it looks charred.
It looks painted, but it's not.
That's just the root as I find it.
And I think at this time, when spring is beginning, that it doesn't begin on the surface, it begins below, you know?
So this idea of finding evidence of that heat within the ground is something that I... in a way, is my way of understanding what's going on at the moment.
And even though these are stalks from last year's plants and will not grow again this year, they are still connected to that root system underneath the ground.
And the idea of what happened last year is being repeated this year, and it's going to come through this.
I am fascinated by those processes that are happening in nature over time and connected to the sun, the light, the tide, growth.
The real work is the change.
Bacon will be ready.
Okay.
Want some?
Yes?
No, it's a surprise.
Yeah, it's cooling out.
Probably you guys can get it.
I called you stupid.
Guys, you don't say that.
Will that do?
Yes.
You want some bread?
Here we've been cooking...
Frying bread all morning.
The rabbits.
Don't forget to give him some green leaves, Holly.
I won't.
No, thank you.
Pull it out then.
Fun.
Pete, come on. Pete.
I'm coming.
- Pete!
- This is a little...!
I'm gonna hold you. You sit.
- I'm gonna hold your fingers.
- Okay, hold my fingers.
Pete, Pete! Come on!
The pupil is dropping.
Floppy. Floppy ears.
Yeah, I think we're good.
And then there's the...
I do my first one of the day's two.
Each are underneath here, and these all turned out.
Check them for spelling.
The images are coming from Charlie Sorkin.
Okay.
I began taking photographs when I was a student at Art College when I first began working outside, and I had to explain to my tutors what I was making.
And the way to do that was to take photographs.
So it still is a little bit like that.
Photography has become the way I talk about my sculpture.
And Brancuzzi once said about sculpture,
"Why talk about sculpture when I can photograph it?"
It's the language through which
I talk and describe what I've made.
It's also become the way that I understand what I have done.
When I've worked all day in the rain, and I'm tired,
I get visually and physically numb to what I've made.
And I need that time between the making and the return of the images to be able to see afresh what I've really done.
And I have in here everything...
Good work and bad work.
Everything is put into here.
I'll see you later, then.
Just to work with the tree, if you want to.
The tree. Okay?
- Okay?
- All right.
See you later.
What you going to make?
Where are you going to make it, the tree on, Dave?
Who are you working for?
You know, but what are you going to make at the tree?
I work intuitively.
Most days I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I have no idea.
I haven't worked there for a while, so...
Is Wallis going to help you?
I think Wallis is there, yeah.
So we'll see.
I came here I think 12 years ago.
All my children have been born here.
Most of my good friends are here.
I make my best work here, and I think those are indications of how strongly I feel for this place.
Yeah!
Take the ball away!
Fine, Johnson!
- Hey, Audrey.
- Hello.
I've lived in places for four or five years and moved on, and that is not enough time.
It really isn't enough time to understand the changes that happen in the place.
You have to live on the same street, the same village for a long period of time, and seeing children when they're waiting at the bus stop grow into adults and have children of their own.
There was an old lady in the village who since died.
She was quite a doer Lady.
And she'd had a tough life.
And she used to walk up and down the street that I lived on, and I said, "Well, you know, think about it this way."
Since I've been on this street, my son...
Well, all my children were born there.
My eldest son was the first child
"to be born on that street for 21 years."
And she said,
"Well, you see only births, and I see only deaths."
From her perspective, she just knew all the people who had lived in those houses and who, you know...
Who had died.
And I hope I never forget either those people who have been born, and those people who have died.
Somehow the river is that line that I follow.
The river has an unpredictability about it.
It really is unpredictable.
And that line running through, yet, at the same time, having its own cycles related to the weather and the sea.
It...
So if I had to find something that would join the year together, it would be something like the river.
The river is a river of stone, a river of animals, a river of the wind, a river of the water, a river of many things.
A river is not dependent on water.
We're talking about the flow.
And the river of growth that flows through the trees and the land.
And here's the other lamb on its own.
Just place it up there.
Make sure it's most clear.
Check that her udder's okay.
And that was all over very quick and painless.
And if we just retreat, and they'll get back to the lambs.
Can you bring the lamb to drink?
I think this one would be safe here.
The sheep is very brutal to any young growth.
And the way it rips and tears the grass.
They are, at times, like a river of sheep.
The flow and movement in their own way.
The reason this landscape looks as it is, with no trees, is because of the sheep.
So the sheep have had this very deep impact on the land.
And...
So I do feel this need to work with the sheep.
And, yet, our perception of sheep is so different to the reality of the sheep.
You know, we...
In that it makes it an incredibly difficult thing to work with because we perceive it as being a wooly animal.
And to get through that wooliness to the essence of the sheep is very, very hard because sheep are incredibly powerful animals in their own way.
They have been responsible for social and political upheavals.
The Highland Clearances, when people were put off the land, the land lords put sheep on the land and moved the people away.
And they've left their story behind them.
And it's written in the place, in the landscape.
But there's an absence in the landscape because of the effects of sheep.
People have lived, worked, and died here, and I can feel their presence in the places that I work.
And I am the next layer upon those things that have happened already.
I don't think the earth needs me at all.
But I do need it.
To just go off into the woods and make a piece of work roots me again.
And if I don't work for a period of time, I feel...
I do feel rootless.
I don't... I don't know myself.
And it's very odd if I've not worked for, say, two, three weeks, and then I give a lecture and I'm talking about my work, and it feels like I'm talking about somebody else.
I do need to be on my own at times.
I enjoy being by myself.
There are people's company
I do enjoy.
And there probably is a social nature, too.
And that I feed from that to some extent.
To be honest, I think I do.
I am tired. I am drained by... people.
But of all the subtleties that I am aware of, like the fact the wind has just now got a little bit stronger, and although, you know, I look as calm as I did 30 seconds ago, there's these little warning bells inside going.
When I make a work,
I often take it to the very edge of its collapse.
And that's a very beautiful balance.
Oops.
Dear.
Well, that was close.
I am so amazed at times that I am actually alive.
Well, that happened occasions.
Well, on occasion, when someone very close to me died.
It was my younger brother's wife.
Very young.
And the image of...
The image of somebody dying...
Julia dying...
Was just very burnt in your mind.
And the day after Julia's death,
I worked with the tree.
It seemed the right place to go.
And made, the work...
La work with a hole on the tree.
I've become to see it as a kind of entrance, a visual entrance into the earth, into the tree, and stone.
That entrance between which life both ebbs and flows.
Looking into a black hole,
I've often described as like looking over a cliff edge.
There's this sense of being drawn into the black as you're drawn into the depth, the distance.
But the other side of that is out of that comes growth also.
And that was my way of trying to understand that...
And not just the death, not just the absence, because the black is the absence.
It's the...
It's the intangible, but it's in a context of a tree that I know will come back to life.
And there's nothing more potent to me than a black hole that I've made, and returning later, and seeing a little finger of growth...
Growth, a blade of growth growing out of that black.
That is such a potent image.
You and Maxwell were saying that Scotland's a lot better than England.
I have never, ever said that!
When have I ever said that?
I'm not going to...
There's a brilliant rock.
The first wall that I made with a waller...
You know, my idea was that I would work with him, to make the wall.
I used to gap... that's repair, broken walls a little bit.
But he kept taking my stones off the wall.
And, you know, he was right to do that.
I've learned that I have to respect their work, their life, you know.
And when I work with a waller, it's not just the time they spent with me, but they bring their lives to it.
They don't want me to touch the walls, playing at being a waller, just like I don't want them to start playing at being artists.
That we both each have our roles in this.
And my role is to find the line of the wall.
And I work the space.
Their dialogue with the stone is what makes the wall.
The stones are laid on, and on, and on, and the work makes itself to some extent.
And it's that fluidity of working that gives the sculpture a sense of movement and energy.
When I was asked to make a work at Storm King...
And I spent a lot of time walking around, just getting to know the place.
And I see these walls, that's now derelict, that are a link back to my home.
Because these walls were probably made by people who came out from Europe, possibly even Scotland...
Who came out here as settlers, made farms, made walls.
So that was the first interest.
I wanted to redraw the line, remake the wall, so that it talked about the place as it is now.
The walls here came out of that process of cutting down the trees and turning the forest into farmland.
But then farming has shifted away from this landscape.
And trees found shelter in the wall and grew.
So it was this dialogue that was of interest to me.
That each bast of wall is a line that is in sympathy with the place through which it travels.
And that sense of movement is very important to understanding the sculpture.
While the movement, the passage of people, the movement of the wall, the river of stone, as it runs round the trees, the river of growth that is the forest.
And it has made me aware of that flow around the world, the veins that run around the world.
The reason why the stone is red is because of its iron content.
And that's also the reason why our blood is red, too.
I do feel a...
There is a special energy about the red.
I mean, it's probably its relationship to blood.
But probably something that I can't really explain entirely.
I think it's the color is an expression of life.
Even though things die, they're part of that flow still.
You know, they become part of the river of red.
In Japan, you'll see a red maple tree against a green mountain and this incredible red.
And it's like a wound.
It's like a wound in the mountain.
There's such an energy and violence about that color.
And I will al...
I am in a continuous pursuit of the red.
And I have this feeling that as I approach its source, the more I begin to understand the color.
You know, there are many lessons to be learned by that color.
And I think that when the realization was that I...
The color is also in me, you know, then it's this feeling of both a color and an energy flowing though all things.
I must have worked here several times before realizing the red here.
You know, it's not so obvious.
And just looking underneath stones, you find these small, red, soft iron stones.
That something so dramatic, so intense, could be so...
At the same time, so hidden.
It's so underneath the skin of the earth.
And there's a real shock at seeing that color.
Something very alien to the river.
In fact, it is so rooted and about that place.
You know, here I am working with the stone, grinding them down, and...
You know, I spend all this time...
Several hours...
Making a little pile of pigment that I will make into a ball, and throw into the river, and there'll be a splash.
And that's just an instant in that cycle of stone as it goes through its process of solidification, of then becoming fluid again, and then being solid...
Made solid once again.
And I think it's one of the...
It's a little memory in the life of a stone, but very much in the spirit of that...
In the nature of stone.
We set so much by our idea of the stability of stone.
And when you find that stone itself is actually fluid and liquid, that really undermines my sense of what is here to stay and what isn't.
When I work with a building,
I try to use the whole wall...
To touch on a landscape contained within and behind the building.
It's almost a memory of the building's origin contained in the walls, and it's drawing out that memory.
I wanted the clay either from Dean or a clay from Scotland.
What I didn't want was a sort of anonymous, processed clay that came from some ceramic shop somewhere.
The clay is dug raw from the ground, and I sift out some of the stones.
It's dried, then it's crushed, and mixed with human hair, and mixed with water...
Reconstituted.
And the hair is necessary to bind.
And I could use sheep, cow, horse, but I do like that feeling of people being bound up in there.
The hair came from the hairdresser's in the village near to where I live.
So my village is in this work.
I discovered when I made the first clay walls that the architectural geology of the building where beams were affected the drying rate and formed cracks and patterns within the cracking.
So what lies bellow the surface affects the surface.
Of course, it feels alive, yeah.
If anything, it's an expression of the stone alive...
Almost back to its origin as in a volcano, you know, when the stone was alive.
I mean, it's always alive, but that visible evidence of movement and eruption of the stone.
There's that feeling of energy within it.
And that's life.
I cannot then explain beyond that, but I know that there is more than just a simple collapsing and arrival of material.
I struggle to say these things, and I know I can just about get them out, but there's a world beyond what words can define for me.
Words are... do their job, but what I'm doing here says a lot more.
Oh, Harper. Left behind again.
Last time i wait around for anybody.
Okay.
Let's see if i made good on my promise here.
Huh, what do you know?
It worked.
Hey!
Don't suppose you're the welcoming committee.
Is that working?
Of course it is.
What do you think i am?
Look at it.
Look at it.
Wonderful.
Kill him!
This is the thanks i get for fixing the door?
Your days are over.
We've got to find the rock
Burma and his goons scrambled under.
Well, he can't have gone far.
Tarn vedra was his only option.
Tarn vedra has a lot of rocks,
And it's getting more crowded by the minute.
Blending in won't be hard.
Even with a hostage.
Even with a harper.
Almost makes you feel sorry for burma.
Seefra-2's evacuation's almost complete.
However, seefra-4 is officially burning.
We saved as many as we could, captain.
However,
The hydrogen ramscoop was successful.
Well, it's something we can be thankful for,
For the tarn vedran sun.
Oh, reposition us towards seefra-2
In case they need us there for final evacuations.
Repositioning. Repositioning.
Sorry, new habits die hard.
Why don't you go find harper now, okay?
Planet after planet,
It's the same thing over and over again.
The fighting, the whining, the questions... we've got a bigger problem.
Trance.
You got it.
She's working against us.
If it's the real trance.
Well, no matter who or what she is,
She's still an avatar,
And she'll be two steps ahead of us.
Captain, i have burma on comm.
This guy.
Put him through.
Dylan Hunt.
Just when you thought you'd won... oh, burma.
It isn't over until it's over.
Oh, it is over... for your scientist, seamus harper.
We've learned his value to you.
We have him, and we're going to kill him... unless... general burma, what's your price?
Price?
Everything we valued is gone,
Thanks to you
And what your technology has done to the seefra system.
Save a few million lives.
You're welcome.
All i know is you arrived in your big ship,
And the suffering started.
Right.
Everything was going so well before we got here.
I want you to experience
The same pain you inflicted on me
And my people- And the loss.
By killing harper?
He's important to you, i know.
A friend and a valuable resource.
I'm going to enjoy this.
Yeah, well,
Enjoy whatever sadistic pleasure it brings you, burma,
Because i don't have time to care.
Hunt out.
We're bluffing, right?
Yeah, we're bluffing.
I wonder if harper knows we're bluffing.
One problem at a time, rhade.
We have to find trance.
Do you have a plan?
Call it a hunch.
When we came back from fixing methus-2,
That's when trance started to seem different,
So i'm wondering
If the trance we went down with got left behind somehow.
Two trances.
Two trances.
She could be the same trance,
But changing,
As her sun gets closer.
There's only one way to find out.
Go back to methus-2.
You can't be serious.
In a matter of hours,
The tarn vedran sun will consume it,
Same as it did methus-1.
Well, then, we'd better hurry.
Great.
The universe is a dangerous place,
But in our future,
My crew and i fight to make it safe.
I am Dylan Hunt,
Captain of the Andromeda ascendant,
And these are our adventures.
While her whatchdogs follow a scent to methus-2
Poor lonely ship at sea.
They'll never find us.
Idiots.
And now for all you other lonely ships at sea,
More melodies to evacuate by... bring the scientist.
Now.
What's left of him.
So, you and rhade are going back into methus-2.
What's this?
High risk, high reward?
Something like that. Yes.
Dylan, you won't find her.
Thank you for your support.
Just so you know,
The trance we have onboard
Is heading toward command.
Dylan, you know,
You don't have a monopoly on caring for trance.
I've been with her for longer than you have.
Yeah, Dylan,
You should take beka with you.
I've already been there and done that.
Rhade.
Hmm?
As an android,
I can adjust my internal cooling systems,
Making me the best candidate.
Not the only android.
And her.
Fine.
Then we'll all go.
Forget about harper, forget about burma,
Forget about the refugees.
We'll all just go down to a live sun and have a picnic.
No need to be touchy.
We don't have time for this.
Two hours and counting.
I'm going with Dylan.
Thank you, rhade.
Beka, please.
You're in charge of Andromeda.
And find harper, okay?
Sounds good.
You and rhade go track down your friend.
Just be quick, please.
It's still my ship.
Trance, how you feeling?
Better, now that we're getting closer
To the tarn vedran sun.
Excellent.
You can help
With the evacuations and relocations.
I need all of you
To work together.
We're running out of time.
Yeah.
Change of plans.
There's a plan?
And i thought you were just the slash-And-Burn,
Evil dictator type.
I could've sworn you'd be dead by now.
Or is that giving you some kind of strength?
You're a real genius, huh?
It's a data port, for knowledge-
Something you're obviously lacking.
Now, what'd you have to go
And interrupt my torture session for?
I was just finally starting to go numb.
The point went out of it when i realized
Your captain doesn't care what happens to you.
Right.
Apparently,
He has more important things to deal with.
More like he realized i can take care of myself.
Obviously.
Too bad for you, huh?
Not when there's a better way to make him feel the pain.
Hurry up
And lick your wounds.
No, thanks.
You can lick 'em for me.
You're going to help get me onto
Andromeda while he's away.
Me?
Help you get onto the Andromeda?
Don't make me laugh.
Careful.
We need him functional.
No, go ahead.
Keep it up.
Ah! Yeah, that's it.
Because i ain't helping you.
Nobody gets onto the Andromeda
Without an all-Access pass
And the boss's approval,
And you're not getting either.
That's not the other choice, scientist.
The other choice is,
I fire a missile
Into the center of the seefra-1 landing port,
Full of incoming refugees.
He may not care about you,
But he'll care about the thousands of them.
Either way, Dylan Hunt will feel what it's like
To have things taken away from him,
Like he's taken from me.
So it doesn't matter what you choose, scientist.
Freaking psycho.
Methus-2, here we come.
Out of the frying pan and into the fire.
Rommie's shut it down.
We'll have time.
You know what's strange?
What's that?
The way you keep talking me into risking my life
On these long shots.
So it's strange because it keeps paying off?
The odds say one day, it won't.
Yeah, well, rhade, there are bigger risks in store
If we don't get to the bottom of a certain transformation.
Transformation- Humor to die by.
Yeah, well, i love to keep you laughing.
It's so horrible.
One by one, they go.
And now seefra-3.
You keep thinking it'll get easier,
But it never does.
In a few hours,
We can add seefra-2 and methus-2
To the list.
Yes, well, it may all be part of some grand design,
But it's still bloody tragic.
They did the job.
And they say inorganics lack emotion.
Speak for yourself.
I wasn't.
All right.
Obviously, standing here watching this disaster
Has become unproductive.
Agreed.
Dylan said there's much work to do.
The most important thing
Is to keep searching for harper.
Beka,
I have two seefra-1 landholders on comm
Asking for Dylan to resolve a dispute.
They seem to be fighting over
Who gets the better-Looking transport.
I'll handle that.
Why you?
Personally, i have the greater intuition.
No, no, and... definitely no.
Okay, i'm in charge here,
Which means i get the pleasure of dealing
With these bozos.
Rommie, you know
Andromeda's deep scan capabilities.
Doyle, you know seefra-1 inside and out.
Each of you stick to what each of you does best
And, hopefully, when burma comes out of hiding,
One of you will be there to nail him.
And me?
Stay close to me.
All right, andromeda.
Let's get this party started.
Put them on.
Lights out. It's party time.
We're going to go on the north side.
That mantle protected us from a flare the last time.
From your lips to tarn vedran sun's ear.
All right.
Preparing to initiate mantle breach on my mark.
Mark.
You got us on board
Without anyone knowing.
So far, i'm impressed.
I think a toaster would impress you.
Ouch!
You know, i can barely feel it now.
Finish the job,
Or i finish seefra's landing port.
Scanning sector five-Eight-One... scanning sector five-Eight-Two... this is hopeless.
Harper, please come in.
Increasing the carrier output
Won't get harper back on comm.
Clearly, burma took it away.
Harper is resourceful.
He may have made one
Out of broken glass by now,
For all we know.
And i hate
That you know my every move
On this ship.
Get used to it.
I don't need a lecture
About getting used to things.
Trust me.
I was merely suggesting a coping strategy.
I will cope when i find harper.
About that... if you were planning on going down to seefra-1,
Forget about it.
I have a drop pod waiting to take me.
Oh, no, that's the pod i ordered!
Like i said, get used to it.
I know seefra better than anyone.
I should be the one that looks for harper.
Ah, but it makes more sense
For the person who knows harper best
To be the one to go and look for him.
No, it doesn't. Yes, it does.
No, it doesn't.
Careful, don't blow a gasket.
Oh, isn't that the bot calling the metal black.
That would be harper's vain attempt
At giving you a sense of humor.
Is humor something
You're qualified to recognize?
I am the nebula.
The nebula is me.
Voila.
Ca fait complet.
The ship's sensors will no longer detect you.
Liar.
Is it that obvious?
Don't even bother trying to crack my code.
There's no way.
Your code versus the darkness.
How the hell did you do that?
Oh, no.
Dispose of him.
Hey!
Begin!
For a dark sun, it's hot.
Oh, come on, rhade,
You're a big, tough nietzschean.
You're just jealous.
What?
I'm sorry,
But boneblades never did it for me.
Don't knock it if you haven't tried it.
But i was talking about your age.
Oh, i see.
I'm jealous because you're younger than me?
That's right, hunt, by over 300 years.
Very funny.
For a minute there, i thought you were serious.
Let's just find the chamber and get out of here.
Let's get out of here.
Yeah.
Why do you keep putting us
In these situations?
Just luck, i guess.
Luck?
Luck has nothing to do with it.
You have a death wish.
No, no, no.
I'm just old, remember?
I'm senile.
I keep forgetting
That this kind of stuff can kill you.
Oh, yeah. That would have killed us.
So, what do you think?
This way.
I think it's this way.
No, no, no.
We are listening to me for a change.
This way.
Not a word.
I wasn't going to say anything.
You have the ship to take care of.
Unlike you,
I can be in two places at once.
Oh, wait a minute.
Make that three.
Some would call that a personality disorder.
I prefer to think of it
As a multi-Faceted personality.
Uh-Oh.
We are not the droids you're looking for.
What is that?
I don't know, but it didn't work.
Rommie, down.
What's with this guy?
I don't know.
Too bad you didn't show up
A minute sooner.
Oh, that's right. You did.
You were both doing very well, i thought,
Considering.
Yeah, well,
I want to know who they are
And how they got on board
Without me knowing.
They're burma's men.
Sometimes i get impressions.
What the hell's going on?
We've been invaded.
How many are there?
Well, there would be no way of knowing,
Because my onboard sensors
Have been disabled.
Again.
By these guys?
They brought Harper.
He must be on board somewhere.
There's no going right,
There's no going left,
And there's certainly no going back.
That leaves either up... or down.
Whatever.
That's the spirit, Rhade.
Fusion chamber's this way.
How do you know?
Because i'm a paradine. Really?
Nah, i just saw a sign that said
"Fusion chamber."
Oh.
I'm bred for survival-
So right now you'll have to excuse me,
Because every fiber of my being
Is screaming to get out of here.
That's why i appreciate
You helping me to find trance.
You're a good sport, rhade.
Well, it's better than being with the ladies.
Harper?
Well, this is where he'd come to hide.
If he could.
Look, we all know the logical conclusion,
But let's not go there unless we have to.
No messages, either.
I can't believe harper would let those men on board
Without leaving some kind of something.
What code word are you trying?
Rom-Doll.
That would be the one.
Try "dreamdoyle."
What?
I didn't invent me.
Okay.
No. No go on either of them.
Hmm.
Okay, so we don't know where harper is.
We're just going to have to assume he's okay.
Meanwhile, we have an invasion on our hands.
First thing we're going to have to figure out is,
What do they want?
Oh, good.
We can ask them.
Not again. I'm barely recharged.
That was my guy.
Not anymore!
Sometimes you got to make do.
How you doing?
Good. You?
Good.
Beka?
I got it.
Hiiyee! Giddyap!
This is it.
This is it!
If we don't get out of here soon.
The fusion container, it's still in one piece.
Dylan.
Trance's cloak.
The vapor's too thick to see if there's anything inside.
There's got to be a way to empty it.
Got it.
Let him go.
You're exhausted.
Well, at least we got most of them.
They're kind of tough.
Really?
It's not just me?
No, they're something else.
Maybe some kind of... alien.
Where did he go?
Okay.
So they don't stay down
And they disappear.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Oh, please don't lock me up!
Who are you?
I'm an evacuee from seefra-4.
You mean you're not
One of Dylan Hunt's people?
Not even close.
Oh, good. Then you can help me.
They promised me safety,
And now i don't know what's going on.
This ship is so big,
And there's so much fighting
And it's cold-
You shouldn't have accepted their help.
They're liars.
Liars?
No. No!
I gave up everything for them.
I have no one to protect me.
I have nowhere to go. Don't say that.
Calm down.
It's okay.
You can come with us.
Do you mean that?
I'm sure i can, uh... convince my leader.
I would really like to show you my... appreciation.
Explosives.
So now we know what burma's up to.
Revenge on Dylan
By blowing up the Andromeda.
It gets worse.
They're not human.
I've detected radical isotopes.
What?
What? What are those?
Apparently harper didn't program you
With knowledge of the abyss.
Who knew he'd need to?
I've got something here
That's going to hurt a lot worse
If you don't tell me
What the hell you did with harper.
Harper!
He's... he's dead.
I'm feeling emotions i never thought i'd have.
I know what you mean.
All those times i teased him.
Abused him.
Stole his share of a salvage without telling him.
What?
Very good. Very good.
Almost had you fooled, though, right?
It's an old meditation trick
I learned from rev bem.
Can you blame me for taking the opportunity
To hear what my three favorite ladies
Would say at my funeral?
You suck at playing dead.
Well, you suck at playing sad.
Some performances were better than others, though.
Yeah, that was almost as shameless
As that act you pulled with the guard.
Thank you.
What guard?
What guard?
What did i miss?
A lot.
But first, you've got to get control of the ship
Back from burma.
While we have some housekeeping to attend to.
And i have a date
With a friend i'd hoped never to see again.
Where might i find him?
I think he was saving the biggest bomb for command.
Right.
Ladies... she is not in here.
Trance!
Trance!
It's over!
It's not over, rhade.
She's here. I can feel it.
You can feel it?
Sorry.
Sorry.
What the hell you doing?
Trance.
Dylan... i knew you'd come.
Right there, burma.
Beka valentine.
We meet again.
We were quite... intimate once.
You remember the abyss,
Don't you?
Trance?
She's in bad shape.
Trance,
Methus-2 is disintegrating from the inside out.
It's my sun's fault.
Listen to me.
You can use it. Pull energy from it.
You've done it before.
For Andromeda, remember?
It's your sun.
You can get strength from it.
My life force.
That's right.
Take what you need.
Come on, trance.
Is there a way out?
I'd hoped we'd meet again.
That makes one of us.
You can't defeat the abyss.
I don't remember you being this much of a fighter.
I wasn't.
Someone else had to do it for me.
Not this time.
This time i'll win,
And you'll be mine forever.
I had a less depressing destiny in mind.
You know who burma is, beka.
Thanks for the input, trance, but i'm a little busy right now.
Beka.
On command.
All right, andromeda,
This should get you back on-Line.
Andromeda,come in.
Come on.
What the hell did he do, anyway?
Andromeda,report.
All right.
I think i got it.
Yes!
Captain, your arrival is timely.
We're on time.
Split up. Find burma.
Find him?
I'm going to kill him.
You can't kill the abyss, beka.
What are you, one of them?
Because you sure as hell aren't trance.
Mortals are such strange creatures.
They are trapped by fear,
The fear of death,
Yet death would set them free.
A new kind of freedom.
Who are you?
We're with her.
Hmm.
It's time for you to choose.
I'm going to have one of you.
Which of you will it be?
Burma,
You are such a drama queen.
Dylan Hunt.
Perfect.
I came to bring you pain.
Pick which of your friends
Will die.
I think i'd rather have you die.
If you shoot, i shoot.
Pick!
Now.
That felt good.
Yes, it did.
You're not-
I am.
You were supposed to be
Consumed by the sun.
Why was i left there?
You are not of the same mind as we are.
And what mind is that, sister?
I'm begging you to tell me.
This isn't over, trance gemini.
I guess that's what they call a black hole.
Beka, are you all right?
I'm all right now.
Dylan, i was afraid.
We should all be afraid.
It's not over yet.
This is it.
Methus-2 is officially gone.
Come on, vedran braking system.
I fear i am definitely out of possible futures.
This will work.
I feel it.
I know it.
Solar impact
With seefra-1 in 58 seconds.
Impact in 46 seconds.
Well, when used appropriately,
Vedran technology can be very reliable.
At least that's what i'm holding onto.
Yeah, plus, how many times
Has trance been wrong?
In this case, she only has to be wrong once.
I'm with harper on this one.
Dylan,
We better get ready to get the heck out of here.
It's too late.
It's stopping?
I think it's stopping.
It's stopping, right? Tell me it's stopping, rommie.
Incorrect.
What?
Ithasstopped.
Well done... everyone.
Mr. Harper,
Let's talk about burma.
What's to talk about?
He's a dangerous, misguided creep
With lots of unfocused anger.
How did he get on the ship, harper?
That's a great question.
Maybe i better check the ship for glitches.
See what burma and his boys did, huh?
Harper, how did he get on board?
Harper!
Harper had no choice, dylan.
You can blame his supposed superior intellect
Or his confirmed physical weakness.
The choice is yours.
Well, he did save me from having to save his life.
Actually, when you let burma think
You didn't care if he killed harper,
And you knew it wouldn't end there,
You did save his life.
And when you were on methus-2,
You knew we could take care of burma.
I didn't know that.
Well, now you do.
And now that you know that we've succeeded as a team-
Now that, i already knew.
Yes, but now you can take a vacation.
Or a nap.
A nap?
You know what?
Maybe i should take a nap,
And let you guys do all my work.
A long nap.
Welcome back.
Things will never be the way they were.
There will be repercussions.
There always are, trance, but today is a good day.
You know,
We did kick butt rather spectacularly.
We flattened those abyssholes.
It was rather enjoyable.
Speak for yourself.
You only had one guy.
Yeah, the abyss.
At one time,
I was fighting off 10 men.
I? We.
We, we.
Ladies, ladies, ladies.
Trance?
You coming?
Oh, so i finally figured out
Harper's password-
Valentine.
Are you sure you spelled "dreamdoyle" right?
A nap.
Someday.
''In the Name of God''
BARAN
-I win. I win!
-Wait for me.
Ten packs of pasta, four boxes of matches seven packs of Harvardin cigarettes... eight packs of Montana cigarettes.
Your name?
You always ask me.
I can't remember every name.
Lateef.
Look at my fortune.
Mr. Hossein, take good care of my ID card.
Remind Memar to send me some money.
Sure.
It's 3,480 tomans.
And with this candy, it makes 3,500 tomans.
Go ahead, help yourself!
Thanks a lot.
Don't forget to tell Memar.
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Put him down here!
Where does it hurt?
Is it real bad?
We're taking you to the hospital right now!
What happened?
It's Najaf.
He fell from the second floor.
He jumped without his parachute?
Shame on you!
Get the hell back to your work!
Put him up in the truck!
Now, all of you, back to work!
Come on!
Take him to the hospital!
Don't mention the address here!
I don't want any trouble with the inspectors.
Soltan, be careful! Go!
Mr. Engineer, stop flashing this light. I am going blind.
I don't know what's wrong.
Hey, Chief, this is the bill that Memar is sending you.
He hasn't even paid the wages and he is sending me a bill!
Don't get excited!
Go down and get the wages for the workers.
Unbelievable!
Mr. Engineer, are you still playing with the light?
Mind your own business!
You badly need a flash of genius.
Get lost!
Hey, Chief, this is your bill.
Memar tells you to come down to get the workers' wages.
50,000 tomans and the account is okay.
You are squeezing the hell out of me!
There are plenty of other workers!
Ask my own fellow countryman if he got anything.
The money I've still got is for the Afghan workers.
Iranian workers are more important than Afghans!
My God, in life you must be fair.
They come every day all the way from Kan Sulerun.
They work more than Iranian workers for much less money.
Look at poor Najaf who fell today.
He is laid up at home with broken bones.
Now in all conscience:
To whom should I give the money, to them or to you?
To us!
Enough! You're hopeless!
Please stop speaking Turkish.
Speak Farsi so I can answer you!
Okay for Farsi! Do you know what it means to have feelings?
-If you have feelings...
-No, you don't know.
...you give each worker his daily wage or a contract.
-So, you want a contract?
-Yes.
Okay, now take this money, and you this and get the hell out of here.
Now what?
When will you give me some money?
Your wife and kids are starving?
Your wife wants a divorce?
Your money is safer with me than in a bank... and I also give you pocket money.
I'd prefer to take care of it myself.
Kid, you think you're smart, don't you? Sit down!
Okay, take it, kid.
Come on, take it!
When I said you're not smart, that's what I mean.
What do you wanna do with this money?
Take this and it's already too much.
You're young. You're a kid.
You aren't able to make any savings.
Now, go and get the fuel to fill up the lamps.
Memar, that's a bill to settle.
Lateef, what are you doing?
Hurry up with the fuel!
I am coming. I am coming.
-Where is Memar?
-Upstairs!
Good morning, Memar.
Is that a time to come to work?
It is almost noon!
Sorry I am late.
I dropped by Najaf's house.
Wait here. I'll be back.
Who is he, your kid?
No, Najaf's kid.
Any news of Najaf? How is he?
His foot is badly broken and he is at home.
Today, don't work.
I'll pay your wage.
This money is for Najaf.
God bless you, Memar.
There's no rush.
This evening,
I'll drop by his house.
Najaf, in his state, can't work.
He's got five children to feed and his wife passed away last year.
His son could replace him.
Have you already worked in construction?
A bit, but mostly he was taking care of his brothers and sisters.
What can you do?
This boy is smart.
He'll catch up very quickly.
Can't he speak for himself?
Kid, what can you do?
I hope he isn't deaf and dumb.
I said what work can you do?
It isn't a big deal to carry cement sacks.
You're right, but it takes strength and this kid looks too weak.
One or two days, and he'll be okay.
What is your name?
Rahmat.
All right, I take him on trial for two to three days.
-Let him work with you.
-God bless you.
Where have you been since the morning?
I was doing the shopping.
Hurry up, serve tea to the workers.
That's what I'm doing.
How come you thought of serving me tea today?
I saw you in a nightmare.
Soltan, this is your boy?
No. This is Rahmat, the son of Najaf.
Oh, Najaf is dead?
God forbids!
He's home with a broken foot.
I was only joking.
Najaf and I are good friends.
Have some tea.
-Come on, have some tea!
-Rahmat, have some tea.
Hey, this tea is from yesterday?
No, from last week.
Of course it's from today.
Then why are you giving me this dishwater?
Get yourself a private servant!
What the hell is yourjob here?
Shut your big mouth!
You think you're so strong?
What is going on?
Get the hell back to your work!
Back to your work!
Memar, Memar, the government inspectors are coming.
The inspectors are coming!
Afghans, run, all of you hide!
The inspectors are here!
Hide yourselves. Hurry up, run!
Hello, sir. Welcome!
Memar, we heard that an Afghan worker fell from this building.
Afghan?
We haven't any Afghans here.
It was one of my fellow countrymen.
Where is he now?
He went from the hospital back to his village.
You don't have any Afghan working here?
No, sir.
Do you know what it means if you employ Afghans without an authorization?
Yes.
So, now that you know the law, read this paper and sign it.
-What's that?
-A letter of compliance.
-Please.
-How many Afghans work here?
One.
Oh yeah? Who's he? Where's he?
You're looking at him.
You think you're funny?
I work more than the Afghans and I am treated like dirt.
Enough bullshit, big mouth!
Get lost!
Please.
Hey, you signed it, right?
Yes.
My respects.
Welcome any time.
-Is there anyone there?
-No, there's no one.
Okay, let's get out of here.
Don't worry. Come.
How was his work?
Not bad for a first day.
Hey, give this to Najaf.
That's kind of you.
Bye.
Memar, is there any for me?
You can't get your eyes off from the money.
Bring tea. Go.
When he sees money, his tongue hangs out.
Memar, the account is not correct.
Some money is missing.
I know, I know.
First you fix the walls, then I'll give you the rest.
What are you doing?
This one is heavy.
Turn... bend a bit... further back.
A few days and you'll get used to it.
Then you'll carry loads better than a mule.
Oh! Stupid kid, where's your head?
Oh, my God. I'm getting blind.
I hope this place will soon collapse!
It's become a nursery.
Any kid who shows up gets a job!
Here comes the abominable snowman.
Have some hot tea.
It will melt the snow.
You stupid moron!
Hey! Wait, there!
What the hell's going on?
Go back to your work!
What have you done with yourself?
I was going down the stairs when I felt that damn plaster falling on me.
I looked up and it was that Afghan kid.
He's not fit for this work and then this idiot is trying to be funny!
That's enough.
Go back to your work.
Kid, come down here.
No need to work anymore!
Don't worry. Come down.
You Afghan, it is all your fault.
Memar, may I say something?
Don't you see I haven't got any time?!
Memar, please don't send Rahmat away!
How many times do I have to tell you the kid isn't fit for this kind of work.
It is all my fault.
I've gone too fast with him.
One more word and I'll throw you out, too.
Foreman Faraj, how many more bricks do you need?
Go and pick up your stuff from the room.
As of tomorrow, you'll work with Faraj.
If you don't want to work
I'll settle your account and you're out.
-I didn't do anything.
-Do as I said.
I don't feel like arguing with you.
You're no good as a worker.
Can you prepare tea, cook, and wash dishes?
If you can, then you stay.
Otherwise,
I don't need you here.
Shopping is now your responsibility.
Come here, kid.
Take Rahmat to the places where you do the shopping.
Introduce him to the Dariani shop owner.
Tell him to bring his own
ID card to give to Dariani.
He's got no ID card.
That's not my problem!
I'll get my card back!
Hell, get it! You think it is such a precious shit?
You're right!
In the past months, that's what has fed your stomachs.
Kid, don't play this game with me.
Get lost, stupid animal!
It's my mistake to try to make a man out of you!
Why the hell are you standing here staring at me?
Come on, clear off!
I'm warning you, Afghan!
You're taking my job and one day
I'll smash your nose into your brain!
-Thanks, Rahmat.
-Finally a real tea!
A good change from Lateef's dishwater!
This is for you.
I don't need it.
I'm not in a wheelchair!
Well done, Rahmat.
The food's great.
Smart kid.
Well done, Rahmat.
You're doing a greatjob.
Who told you to put your disgusting hands on my shirt?!
You're messing it up!
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Soltan.
-Hello. How are you doing?
-Fine, thanks.
You're alone?
Rahmat isn't coming?
He is. There was no more bread in the bakery. He had to wait.
Hey, kid, you're not working today?
I am.
So, why are you dressed like a pop star?
Why not? It's very possible to work with these clothes. See?
-What's the hurry?
-Nothing.
-Go upstairs with this worker.
-I'm busy.
There is a wall to knock down.
Go, I tell you!
Kid, come on, move.
You've got no brain! I told you
I want Montana cigarettes!
What are these lousy cigarettes you got me? Take them back!
Cigarettes are all the same.
They go up in smoke.
He's got hundreds of things to do.
He is no servant of yours.
And what has it got to do with you, moron?
Is your face in need of a quick fix?
You want to fix it?
What about smashing your nose to the back of your skull?
Just get lost, will you, moron!
What's going on?
Lateef, you're like a fighting cock always ready to jump and fight!
Stop it! Go back to your work!
Thank you, Rahmat, that's nice.
Thanks for the trouble.
You're kind.
-What is your name?
-Ismael.
One, two, three, four, five.
Take this.
Thank you.
Lateef, close the tap.
Kid, have you got fresh tea?
This isn't a tea room!
Get out of here!
Are you the watchman of the building or what?
I don't feel like beating you up.
So, get back to your work right now or I'll call Memar.
Hey, man, mind your own business!
Memar! Memar!
You're a real dummy.
All right, but remember, one day I'll have my revenge.
Hey, do you work here?
How many Afghans work here?
You're not answering?
Come here.
Go and catch him!
Afghans, run, go and hide yourselves!
The inspectors are here!
Rahmat, go!
Afghans, Afghans.
Since when you're a movie hero?
Why the hell did you get involved?
I could have taken care of it myself.
Because of you, I got a fine and now I must lay off all the Afghans.
You didn't tell me where you disappeared today.
Hey, you're deaf?
What? Are you again after money?
Memar, I have to go to my village for a few days.
My sister is ill.
You're a doctor, now?
Let her father take her to the doctor.
There is work. You can't go.
I don't want any money.
I'll be back soon.
No way! You know what that means-- ''impossible.''
Your father put you under my care.
I make the decisions.
Okay, then settle my account and give it to my father.
I am getting out of here.
You've got a thick head, haven't you?
Now, how many days are you going to be out?
Three, four days.
-Not more!
-Okay.
Hey, kid, come back here.
Take this. You may need it.
-Thanks.
-Say hello to your father.
Without your ID card, it's impossible.
I told you a hundred times,
I have responsibilities.
I'm a stranger in this city.
Today, at my new job, they kept my ID card.
You could repeat this until the morning.
I still need your ID card.
Go, find yourself a place where they won't ask for it.
Go, my dear sir.
Let me get back to my work.
Hey, what do you want?
Have you got your ID card or no?
-Yes.
-Okay, give it to me.
Come and warm yourself.
Please, there is a hole in my shoe. Can you fix it?
Do you live here?
Everyone who meets me, meets me on the road.
Do you know Soltan?
There are many Afghans called Soltan.
He is a construction worker.
All Afghans are builders.
At dawn they go to cities, at dusk they come back home.
Are you living with anyone here?
A man alone is a neighbor of God.
''From the hot fire of being apart comes the flame that burns the heart.''
You speak very well.
These are words from the heart, my son.
Please.
Would you share a piece of bread with me?
Thank you, but I've got to go.
-Good-bye!
-God bless you!
Hey, driver, stop! Stop!
Hello, Soltan.
How are you doing?
-How are you?
-What are you doing here?
Here... some... one of my fellow countrymen lives around here.
I came to visit him.
I am lucky I saw you.
Where are you?
You left us without any news.
I'm looking to earn my bread.
Memar can't hire any Afghans.
Where are you working?
Anywhere I can.
One day here, one day there.
Are you still there?
Yes, I am on my way right now.
What's Rahmat doing?
Where is he?
He works in Kan Sulerun.
It was difficult for him in the city.
Rahmat's work is close to the Shoeb shrine?
Just behind it.
I used to work there.
I know the place.
Come on down. Come on, hurry up.
If you ever are around here, come and see me.
-Okay, Good-bye.
-Good-bye. God bless you.
I told you a hundred times,
I am fed up.
Sir, please don't get upset.
How many times did I tell you to watch what the workers are doing?!
I'll tell them to fix it.
These walls aren't even straight!
It's ridiculous!
There has been a mistake.
It can be corrected.
Don't get upset.
I've just had enough.
God help me, it is not my fault.
Then, do as I told you.
At your service.
Sir, all will be fixed.
Don't expect to see a penny until it is done.
At your service, sir.
Hello.
Foreman Faraj, I told you to watch what's going on!
The walls upstairs must be knocked down.
I've got to go now.
Memar, wait!
Go back to your work!
Memar, wait!
Go back to your work!
I need you.
Where are you going? Wait!
What the hell do you want, kid?
I haven't got any money. See?
Memar, my sister is ill.
I want to send my savings.
Kid, you don't understand what I just said.
Who didn't understand?
Me or you?
I've worked a whole year for what?
To get my money when I needed it.
Now, I badly need it for my sister.
She is killing herself at work.
She is going to die.
Damned the money I have to beg for when it's mine.
Memar, for God's sake.
I swear to God, if you give me the money
I'll work three months without pay.
For God's sake, if I didn't need the money so much
I wouldn't be insisting like this.
Memar, please, please,
I'm desperate.
I need the money, for heaven's sake.
When do you need the money?
Tomorrow, a relative of mine is going to Ardebil.
He'll take the money.
It's a lot of money.
Do you trust him?
Tomorrow morning, I'll bring it.
Now go back to your work.
Where did you get all this money?
These are my wages for a year.
I don't really need it now and Najaf is in big trouble.
With his broken leg, he cannot work.
He can pay me back when he starts working again.
Why don't you give it to him yourself?
I feel embarrassed.
And if he refuses?
Why would he?
Maybe he can't pay you back.
There is no rush-- anytime he can.
If he refuses,
I'll bring it back.
Tomorrow morning I'll wait for you at the Shoeb shrine.
I would like to pay Najaf a visit with you.
Thank you very much.
-Good-bye.
-Good-bye.
Have you been waiting long?
Hello. I was waiting for Soltan.
-Soltan has gone.
-Gone? Where?
Afghanistan.
When?
Yesterday he came to me.
He had borrowed money from someone and wanted to give it to me.
Did you take it?
No. How could I?
His situation is worse than mine. He is broke.
His wife in Afghanistan has been terribly sick for months and he couldn't afford to go there.
Yesterday night, with God's help, he was able to leave.
Soltan told me to give you this.
It is an address.
Wait, I'll help you.
I don't want to trouble you.
It's no trouble at all.
You shouldn't walk too much with your foot like this.
I've got no choice, my son.
''I swear on our Blessed Imam Reza that I will give you back all your money. Soltan.''
Would you share a piece of bread with me?
Thank you, I've got to go.
Good-bye!
Good-bye!
When are you going back to Afghanistan?
After tomorrow.
If I can gather some money can you take it with you for my brother's children?
More than money, now, they need protection.
As you know, the town of Bamian has fallen.
Women and children have all fled to the mountains.
These are the things we found on your brother's body and a letter he wrote just before he died in the battle.
Any news from his wife and children?
Nothing yet.
What to do? Look at me!
I am useless with my broken foot and we're hardly living off the work of my daughter Baran.
Oh, brother, brother.
Don't cry. God will help.
Write them a letter.
That will be a comfort to them.
Yes, comfort is good, but what about loneliness?
Look who's here! It's Najaf.
What a surprise! How are you?
Who's there? What's going on?
Oh! Najaf, how are you?
Now, you all go back to your work.
Come with me.
Let's sit and talk.
Have some tea.
-I've no choice, Memar.
-Does your foot hurt?
I have so many other pains that
I forget the one in my foot.
Everything will be all right.
Nothing can be all right anymore.
Can I ask you to do something for me?
What is it?
-I am embarrassed.
-Come on, speak out.
If you could lend me some money,
I'll be forever grateful.
The times are hard. I am broke.
The engineer has given me no money.
By God,
I have no one else to turn to.
Please, don't let me down.
Come back in two weeks and I'll see what I can do for you.
I need the money today or tomorrow.
It's impossible.
Memar, I beg you, help me.
You take me by surprise,
Najaf, my friend.
Where can I find this money?
Look, these are my pockets.
Anything in them is yours.
Come, take this!
I am no beggar. I didn't come here to ask for charity.
What are you talking about?
We're friends. Take it!
It's no use. I am leaving.
Good-bye.
Wait, let's see.
What is your last price?
-How much are you ready to pay?
-Ten more.
I'm not selling!
Hey, pal, come here. Come!
Hey! Come on, I tell you!
Are you coming or what?
How much?
How much is this?
I'll give you a good deal.
Excuse me, I have to see Najaf.
Hello.
Hello. Welcome. Come in.
No, thank you, I must go.
What is this for?
The money is from Memar.
He told me to give it to you.
He is sorry he couldn't come himself.
He was busy.
God bless him!
Tell him I'll be forever grateful.
What for? It is his job.
Tell him that when I return
I'll pay him back.
You owe him nothing; he owes you.
He should pay you for the months you couldn't work.
What he is sending you is nothing. You could sue him.
Come on, Memar is a good man.
Tell him that when I come back from Afghanistan
I'll give him back the money.
Afghanistan?
Yes, I am going for sure.
They're waiting for me.
When are you leaving?
Tonight, hopefully,
I'll rent a truck.
Tomorrow, early, we'll load our things and go.
Now, come in and drink an Afghan tea. Come in.
Thank you, I must go. Good-bye.

She was born on December 8th, 1980, at 10:50 p.m.
The exact time
Mark David Chapman killed
John Lennon.
For me, though, that's just a coincidence.
All I care about is that she was born at that exact moment.
Her name:
Lily Chou-Chou.
Genius.
Or rather, genesis.
The Ether personified.
From: philia
Liberating our thoughts for that reason, SHE IS.
The shadows SHE releases into the Ether sublimate its wavelengths, transcend the spectrum, reach the transparent beyond.
A permeating image of pain fills the gaps of serotonin.
From: Cornea
The Ether heals my pain.
From: Dream Child
The things you hold dear... friends, family, lovers... hurt you the most.
You live with that.
That's why we have the Ether.
A place of eternal peace.
That's the Ether.
From: Les Paul
Lily sees something no one else can see.
If that's the Ether, then we must listen to her.
From: Ice
Does anyone else make music from the Ether?
The Beatles, for sure.
From: Ø.
Bjork, for me.
From: P-O-W-E-R
UA!
She cuts right to my soul.
From: Minako
Definitely Ringo Shena.
From: Sakiya
You think Ringo Shena has the Ether?
No way.
Only Lily has the Ether.
From: Sleepy Head
I am the Ether's Chosen One.
The one who guards Lily.
I must carry out my orders and lead fools to the true Ether so they will not err again.
From: Rod
This sounds like a cult.
Can't you live without this Ether?
From: Cuttlefish
I may be wrong, but I don't feel the Ether from Lily.
Am I crazy?
From: Kaiser
I mean, she's just a person.
I mean, like, who the hell is Lily?
From: S
Exactly!
She doesn't do anything for me.
You're all brainwashed.
From: Kaiser
What's this Ether you're all talking about?
From: Free Bird

PROMISSORY NOTE & CERTIFICATE OF TITLE
How can I read it?
"Kingo"?
Is that a name?
Ain't worth shit!
Hey, wait!
Come back!
Run, Clione!
I'm coming!
Smash the alarm!
My parents said it's okay, see?
You know we don't buy hot CDs.
Hot?
Hot... shoplifted, stolen.
But we have to depend on the customer's honesty.
Of course, business is business.
We want the popular CDs, especially the new ones.
These aren't hot.
Excuse me.
Is this for sale?
If you want it, it's yours.
I was gonna toss it anyway.
That's so lame.
SANO BEAUTY SALON
Can I change the channel?
YOUTH HIJACKS EXPRESSWAY BUS
They still haven't caught him?
Kids these days are very scary.
Is your boy all right?
Yuichi? He's a good kid.
Has he asked to dye his hair yet?
He hasn't said anything.
But I'd dye it for him if he wanted.
I just realized something.
"Yuichi" and "Shinichi."
"Ichi" means "eldest son."
So we should change
"Shinichi" to "Shin-ji."
I suppose.
Shinichi, you be "Shinji."
No!
Quit complaining!
It's only fair, since Yuichi has to change his last name.
Right?
Hello.
I'm blue cat.
I never knew there was a site like this.
So you probably don't think
I'm a true fan.
But I hope I'm welcome.
From: blue cat
Hello, blue cat.
This is a free zone in the Ether for those who love Lily.
"Lilyphilia."
I'm Philia, site manager.
The rule here is you have to love Lily.
That's all.
So feel free to write here anytime about your passion for Lily.
From: philia
Hello?
Shinichi! Watermelon!
Don't sleep there.
You'll catch a cold.
Shinichi!
They haven't caught him yet?
Nope. They haven't.
- You're late.
- Sorry.
Let's go.
Move it!
They should hang him.
Hey, good night!
Yuichi!
Spending money.
Don't tell your mom.
What about me, Dad?
Give me some too.
Lucky you.
Whoopee!
They just got the hijacker!
From: Yodo
A girl's being carried out off the back of the bus.
"Breathe" is on sale!
I bought it!
A new hit from the Ether!
Oh! I'm a complete Lilyholic!
Kind of.
From: Bear
It made me feel like I was drifting in the warm wind after a typhoon.
From: Nazna
Would a lullaby like this put a baby to sleep?
I've given myself to the baby inside me.
But I'm so busy "Breathing,"
I can't sleep. :-)
From: Rodem
The frequency summoned me.
What is here???
From: M13
A new CD just came out.
From: bancy
Thanks.
I'll buy it tomorrow.
But I have
NO EARS.
From: M13
Boss.
My name is Osanai, from Ayu Junior High.
Thank you for coming over.
He's one of my students.
It's just one CD.
What are you doing?
Why didn't you just buy it?
I'm really sorry about this.
You're his teacher?
He's a Lily Chou-Chou fan.
This rots the Ether, you know.
He used to be a bully.
You don't have to buy that.
No, I wanted it, and I'm here anyway.
I mean, you know, I'm here, so...
Osanai?
Sato?
It is you!
It's been ages!
You work here?
Yeah. And you're a teacher?
That's hard work!
Hey, don't give her a hard time!
You have strange tastes.
Show me.
"Breathe."
"Arabesque."
So you got caught shoplifting.
Was it fun?
Guess not, huh?
Mr. Onda.
She's in the guidance office.
All right!
Is that Chopin?
It's Debussy.
"Arabesque."
The first song on "Breathe,"
"Arabesque," is an homage to Debussy.
"Arabesque"!
Lily says the first to make ethereal music were Debussy and Eric Satie.
But make no mistake...
Lily's Ether is influenced by no one.
Lily was high on the Ether before she ever heard Debussy.
From: philia
Hello.
Oh, I didn't know you were expecting.
You never told me.
I'm sorry to bring you all the way down here in your condition.
I should have gone to see you.
Please, sit down.
That's right. I should've gone to see you tonight.
So I wouldn't have had to skip baseball practice.
Excuse me?
The fact is that Yuichi... was caught shoplifting.
By the way, when is your baby due?
What the hell is wrong with you?
What're you doing?
Take it easy, Mrs. Hasumi!
Let's talk about this.
It was only one CD.
Ms. Osanai went to the record store.
I apologized and cleared his name.
Even if it's just one CD, stealing is stealing.
Well, it's not unusual for kids these days to shoplift.
But overreacting won't solve anything.
Besides, kids these days have a lot of strange ideas.
"In my darkened room, arms around my knees..."
I think he's really sorry.
"That's all I remember," says Lily.
Even one CD.
Stealing is stealing.
Well, that's true.
"Arms around my knees," no TV,
"no music."
Lily says,
"It's always sunset."
As it grows dark, when the air splits in two, sound swells in my head, and the light leaks through.
I don't remember when it started.
"One day it was just there," says Lily.
This was the most important episode in her awakening to the Ether.
If that idiot interviewer hadn't asked her this question, she might have shown more of what's inside of her.
"What music influenced you?"
She didn't answer.
She didn't have to.
She has no need of other music.
She conceives and gives birth to it.
The Ether is the amniotic fluid that nurses her music.
That's all.
From: philia
Hello?
It's me. Hoshino.
Why don't you come out?
Yeah.
"Yeah"? say, "Yes, sir."
You know why we're here, don't you?
You ratted on us, didn't you?
- No.
- Liar!
Tsujii!
Leave that. Come here.
- Get up!
- Pussy!
The band with Lily at its center,
"Philia," on February 21, 1995, reached number one on the charts.
The first song was "Addiction."
But "Philia" broke up...
This guy's a Lily Chou-Chou fan!
Two short years later.
Fucking creepy!
Of them, only "Kamakatsu" has gone on to better things.
Come on!
"Kayama Katsuhiro," or "Kamakatsu," now leads "Yellow Fellows."
Give us a hand.
Hurry!
Take your pants off.
Hurry! Take 'em off!
Your underwear, too.
Yeah, them too. Move it!
- Hurry up!
- Hey! Move it!
- Jerk yourself off.
- Do it!
Spank your little monkey!
Rub yourself raw.
Turn this way so we can watch you.
Fuck!
He's really doing it!
What a pervert!
Skanky! It's making me puke!
- Keep in time!
- Where's your sense of rhythm?
Get over here!
And 1, 2, 3, 4!!
Keep in time, I said!
Hey.
Enough with the rocks.
You'll kill him.
So? Is that a problem?
Let's bail.
I'm getting sick of this.
You two stay here and make sure he comes.
Bring us a sample.
Kamakatsu used the band "Philia" as a stepping stone for his career.
So all of us Lily fans will never forgive him.
From: philia
Please stop now! Go home.
That's enough.
I can't watch this!
That's gross! Stop it!
Let's go.
Please stop!
Lily likens the Ether to colors.
"Breathe" was blue Ether and "Erotic" was red.
From: philia
"Erotic" was a masterpiece!
I still remember the rush I got when I first heard it last year.
From: blue cat
I didn't get to hear it when it came out.
It was only a year ago, but I still didn't know about Lily.

From Ayu Elementary,
Natsumi Murakami.
Well... I admire
Ikeda!
Hey, you can't say that!
Masks!
Come on, Ikeda!
Disturbing practice?
We're not disturbing anything!
We're serious about kendo.
Business is business, and pleasure is pleasure.
- You're mixing it up!
- We're not!
You're cheering for Ikeda.
We're supposed to cheer!
They told us to!
We don't have to take this from you.
You can't make us quit the club.
Are you jealous?
You like one of us?
Or maybe it's Ikeda they like!
- Homo!
- Faggot!
Get out of here!
Hoshino, you really think highly of yourself, don't you?
Almost everyone in school hates you.
Did you know that?
He's such an asshole.
His essence is asshole.
You think winning the marathon means you can brag?
Or that being smart means you're better than us?
Or that making a speech makes you a big shot?
Let's go!
Fuck them!
They're nuts.
I didn't ask to make that speech.
Those girls joined the ping-pong club.
What? They quit kendo?
Now they're cheering for another guy.
Whatever.
I wish they'd been a bit hotter.
There are hardly any hot girls in our grade.
Really?
Yeah.
There were only 20 girls in sixth grade.
The best one was Masumi.
Nice name.
No. She was called "Gorilla."
She had a monkey face.
And she was the prettiest?
In the monkey world, yes.
But junior high's a different world.
It's not only about girls.
I've never seen such smart guys like Hoshino here.
So now I'm almost like a frog out of its pond.
Kendo is sometimes like that too.
The nationals are full of guys you can never beat.
You'd never think they were in junior high.
Are they that good?
He's getting fired up!
An ambitious guy, as usual.
We've never gotten past regionals.
But maybe you guys will do better.
We've got you.
Just leave it to me.
I didn't mean you.
At least let me say it!
I'm going this way.
Thanks for treating.
He's... a nice guy.
Sweetheart?
Help me with this.
A friend?
Hello.
What's all this?
It was on sale.
You loaded it yourself?
Sure did.
What is it?
Dog food.
Is this your room?
You want to take a bath?
I'm fine.
I'm gonna take a quick shower.
I gotta go.
Why? You should sleep over.
What was your name?
Hasumi.
Hasumi? What's your first name?
Yuichi.
Yuichi. So you're the eldest.
Any brothers or sisters?
No.
Really? Another only child.
Why don't you stay for dinner?
I just had some noodles.
You're a growing boy.
You can still have some more.
Why don't you spend the night?
It's Sunday tomorrow.
I'll call your parents.
That's okay.
No, I insist.
Here's pajamas and underwear.
You can use his shampoo and conditioner.
These?
Those are Grandma's.
- These?
- They're mine.
- These?
- Yep. Those are his.
You're adorable, Yuichi.
Can we adopt you?
Guess not, huh?
Sweetheart.
Come give us a hand.
Just leave it open.
- Good night, then.
- Good night.
Is that your sister?
That's my mother, stupid!
That's bullshit!
No, it's not.
You came out of her?
Yeah.
No way!
Yes way.
Before the Big Bang, there was nothing. Amazing, huh?
The beginning of the universe.
It's still expanding.
Do you believe in aliens?
Maybe there're life forms we don't know about.
It'd be strange if there weren't.
Because then what are we?
I'm dubious about UFOs, though.
"Dubious"?
Uncertain.
The evidence isn't reliable.
You're like an alien yourself.
Why?
Because you're so intelligent.
And your mom's so pretty.
Everyone's got me wrong.
What?
I'm not that smart.
You were top student in our year!
No, I wasn't. I was seventh.
I wasn't first.
Be careful of rumors.
They said I came first in the personality test.
You didn't?
Think about it.
You can't come first in a personality test.
Nobody understands me.
But seventh is still pretty awesome.
Then I wish they'd say seventh.
Why first?
Whoever came first thinks I'm lying about it.
Maybe they're calling me a liar behind my back.
Let's go to sleep.
What's that?
Lily Chou-Chou.
I've recently gotten into her.
Someone guided me to Lily.
Someone who liked Debussy.
From: blue cat
Run! Run!
I sat beside her for a long time.
It was in fifth grade, before I changed schools.
Here's the bus!
Ouch! Don't push.
Sorry.
When I changed schools, she gave me
Philia's "Manic & Depressive."
I didn't understand it then.
In junior high I started liking it.
Maybe because I met her there again.
But now we're not even in the same class.
I can never talk to her.
I'm a stranger to her.
I wonder if she still likes Lily.
From: blue cat
I won!
Who said we were trying?
Cool him off a bit!
Hoshino, too!
Why me?
Just because!
You're next!
Go for it!
That girl was hot, huh?
Who?
The one Hoshino bumped into.
- You mean Kuno?
- Kuno?
How do you know her?
I don't know her.
Which one is she?
What Kuno?
- Kuno Kanda?
- That's Uno Kanda!
Kuno is her family name.
Class 1, maybe.
You know her.
No, I don't.
No? You're holding back something.
I really don't know her.
Have you ever heard me talking about her?
Bullshit! Tell us about her.
Why are you freaking out?
She was hot, right?
I'm gonna go ask her.
- Miss Kuno!
- I can't believe he's calling her!
Paging Miss Kuno!
Yes?
What a fucking retard!
This train is bound for "Miss Kuno."
Does he go to your school?
She was right next to me!
Hoshino!
Hoshino!
You! Hoshino!
We meet again, pussy!
Let's kick his ass.
- What are you staring at?
- Look somewhere else.
- Hey, don't look away.
- Which is it?
Can I hit him?
Leave it.
I don't care.
Think fast, dickhead!
- I can't stand your face!
- Beat it!
- What do you want?
- What do you want?
- Asshole!
- Midget!
- Fuck off.
- You fuck off.
You call me a midget?
Yeah. Got a problem with that?
- Asshole. Yes, I do.
- Got a problem, midget?
- Don't yell.
- I'm not yelling.
- You're too fucking loud.
- Too bad.
- What?
- So what?
- You got a problem?
- Yeah, you.
Get out of my face!
He must have been bullied.
From class wimp to class president,
Hoshino's come a long way.
He doesn't seem like the kind of guy you mess with.
Sure he does!
You should see his mother.
She's a babe.
His mother?
She's really hot.
How old is she?
Who cares?
Pretty is pretty.
She looks like...
Who?
Izumi Inamori.
She's like her clone.
When I stayed over, she fed me till I just about burst.
I think it was a ploy.
What do you mean?
Rich people do it all the time.
They feed you so you'll be friends with their kids.
Fight!
Men point!
Match point!
Do we present the flowers first?
- Thank you for everything.
- Thank you!
Present the flowers.
Thank you.
Say cheese!
Picture, please!
Say cheese!
Say cheese!
Bow!
Begin!
Fuck this!
I can't do this every day!
"The Charm of the Sea! Sea! Sea!"
The sea!
I want to go!
But there's no way.
10,000 yen, 20,000 yen...
Only 38,000 yen?
That won't get us to Okinawa.
Fuck Okinawa!
Fuck coral reefs!
But I don't want to beg my parents.
I hear you.
They'd never let you forget it.
- And Play Station 2's coming out.
- Really?
So we gotta be patient this summer.
It plays DVDs.
Wow! What's a DVD?
We can't go to Okinawa with our money.
My folks will be all, "No way."
- "You can't go for 100 years."
- "Go to the public pool."
Money! Money! Money!
Any ideas?
We can get a job. Manual labor!
- Delivering papers.
- Delivering milk.
That's hard work!
- Picking pockets!
- That's hard time!
A Porsche!
The guy's rich!
Now what?
- I can't do it.
- You go then.
Nice car you got there!
Give us your money!
Quick!
Cut it out!
A holdup!
Cool!
There's nothing in here!
Not that!
He's loaded!
Give me that!
Give it back!
Oh, fuck!
Hoshino?
Hoshino!
- Is he out of mind?
- They're coming this way!
Stop!
Get down!
Get out here!
Get out!
Hey, you, stop!
Shit!
Stop!
Get in shape, assholes!
Here's some tea.
You know the southern island in Lily's "Arabesque"?
It may not be the same place.
But in Okinawa there's a small island like it.
It's written "New Castle" and pronounced "Aragusuku."
They say the gods live there.
From: blue cat
I know that name.
I wonder why.
I can't remember.
From: philia
Wow! Girls!
Hello. Welcome.
Thank you for using
Marine Tour, Ltd.
This island is "West Front."
But in Okinawan it's "Iri Front."
West is "iri" in Okinawan.
East is "agari."
South is "fue."
North is "nishi."
He's asking how you say "west."
"Iri"?
Very good.
Let's get in the van.
We'll bring your luggage.
Come this way, please.
I'll shoot the video!
No, I will!
We'll be at the hotel soon.
Here we go!
Are you going to the Shirahama?
Can I hitch a ride?
Can we give him a lift?
All right?
Thanks.
Sorry to bother you.
Are they ever fast!
Okinawans say man was made from woman's rib.
So women here are very powerful.
You guys be careful.
Can I try it?
What do I do?
The red button?
Okay, everybody smile!
Say cheese!
Hilarious!
This is good right here.
I'll get out here.
"Nee Faa Yaa."
Thanks! "Nee Faa Yaa."
Good-bye.
Take care.
Excuse me.
My video camera...
Oh, that's right! Sorry!
- See you.
- Take care.
Bye!
See any wildcats?
Wildcats? That'd be lucky.
We didn't see any.
We want to see one.
He says no one knew they existed until a few years ago.
I've never seen one.
Are they that uncommon?
Yes, and people would eat them, not knowing just how rare.
What are you doing here?
Me?
Poaching?
No. I'm exploring.
Exploring? Cool!
That looks good.
Ice cream. Want some?
Really?
"Nee Faa Yaa."
Thank the boys. They paid for it.
Thanks.
Is this your first time here?
My fourth.
I want to see a "Gorakius."
What's that?
A bird. A kind of heron.
It's the right time of year.
Bye!
Take care!
Hey! The camera!
You look seductive.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, really.
So does she!
- You look good too!
- Not at all!
Hey, what's that?
It's lit.
- That's great.
- Pretty?
- Does it makes a circle?
- Yeah!
It's so beautiful.
You're prettier.
Can I light it on you?
Me? No way!
It's hot!
Oh, it's out.
Your firecracker may go out, but mine won't.
It's beautiful!
That's it.
Rocket fireworks!
Careful!
Freaked me out!
Great!
Hey, girls!
What are we gonna do now?
Let's go see the turtles lay their eggs.
- Turtles?
- Can we see any?
Almost every day in August.
So they'll be there tonight?
Probably.
They aren't coming.
Nope.
So there's no guarantee?
I'm afraid not.
I'm not a turtle.
Look at those stars!
Smile, everyone. Look this way.
No turtles!
Not tonight, I guess.
Shall we head back?
Let's go.
It's late and I'm sleepy.
Don't you ever get excited, Hoshino?
Put out that light!
What's wrong?
Something flew at us!
- Did it hit you?
- What is it?
What?
A fish?
- What is it?
- It's huge.
A flying fish!
It's huge!
It's not a flying fish.
It's called "Shijar."
"Shijar"?
They come flying out of the water.
They're attracted to light.
They could kill you.
Are you all right?
It's huge!
Did you get stabbed, Hoshino?
Hand me a light.
It's huge!
Look! Its mouth is like an arrow!
- Are you all right, Hoshino?
- Yeah.
She's cool!
I can't swim like that.
Great!
Is it good?
Yum, yum.
There's that guy again.
What's he doing here?
I thought I smelled something.
Would you like some?
- Do you mind?
- There's some food left.
My lucky day!
Here you go.
- Thanks.
- Thank the boys.
Having fun?
Convenient timing.
So... this ficus tree is also called the "strangler tree."
You know why?
Because it wraps itself around another big tree and kills it.
If you shot that in time-lapse, it'd be horrifying, huh?
Coral's the same.
It sticks out a thin tentacle and kills the coral next to it.
- It does?
- Yep.
For us the natural world is a playground.
But for the things that live in it, it might be hell on earth.
But that's nature for you.
It's good for me.
The place life and death are side-by-side.
It's exciting, don't you think?
That's why I keep coming back.
You said you saw a "Shijar"?
The same family as the "Needlefish."
That's it!
It hit our friend.
That was close.
Get off me!
Shut up!
She can sit on me, though...
What's that song called?
"Aragusuku."
"Aragusuku"? What's that?
An island.
The one over there?
The one past that.
It's the most beautiful of these islands.
"Aragusuku."
Are you okay?
Hey! Somebody!
Are you okay?
Hoshino!
Are you all right?
All right?
All right?
In Okinawa we say a person has seven lives.
You've lost two, so you've only got five left.
Are you sure you didn't bring something bad here?
You can't live with the gods angry at you.
Remember.
Life is precious.
- Something's happening.
- What?
They're stopping.
What is it?
You know that traveler...
Are you all right?
He jumped out in front of us!
It's not our fault!
He came out of nowhere.
It's not our fault.
It's his fault.
It wasn't our fault.
It was his fault.
Don't toss garbage in the water!
That wasn't garbage!
Summer 1999.
Nostradamus was wrong, but if the world had ended, if my life had ended during my summer vacation,
I might have been happier.
From: philia
It did end.
Humanity's extinct.
The world we live in now is "The Matrix"! :-)
From: blue cat
If that's true, humanity's last day was September 1, 1999.
The first day of school.
From that day on, the world was gray.
From: philia
Long time no see.
I was just telling them.
You almost drowned?
Tsujii! What's with the hair?
I dyed it.
Who said you could do that?
Tomorrow I want it black.
Inubushi.
You're a fine one to talk!
Look in a mirror!
What?
Your hair.
My hair? What about it?
You're a fine one to talk.
You've got a lot of balls.
You feel really tense.
Let me in there!
Cut it out!
Hold him down!
He jumps...
He's got a blade!
Hey, Dog!
Hey!
Tell me: How do you wanna swim?
You'll do the dog paddle.
Do it right.
Here.
Fetch.
With your teeth.
Not with your hands. With your teeth.
That's enough.
You can come out now.
Just kidding.
Kanda wants to see you tomorrow.
He says if you want to quit the club, write a letter.
Fuck off.
Inubushi says he doesn't want to come back to school.
This is our problem.
Let's talk about how this happened.
Anyone?
EXECUTION
The year 2000.
Fourteen years old.
The age of gray.
Only the rice fields are that bright, sterile green.
From: philia
You know her?
Tsuda.
Shiori Tsuda.
She's from our school.
Sure you know her.
She's in your class.
You know what we have to do?
Just follow her.
That's all.
Hello?
Hello.
Nice to talk to you.
Okay.
I like your voice.
How old are you?
I'm 14.
What's your name?
"S"... "ST."
Are you busy?
No.
You're "T," I'm "S."
Hoshino took some dirty videos of her.
She can't get away.
He'll work her to the bone!
This is your cut.
That's what Hoshino said.
Hey.
See her home.
You're in the same class.
Get going.
I heard Hoshino's sucking money out of you.
Take this.
Pick it up.
For me... only Lily... is real.
For me... only the Ether... is proof I'm alive.
But lately my Ether is running out.
Dear blue cat, talk to me.
Tell me about Lily.
Or about the Ether.
Or about her, a girl who likes Lily and Debussy.
From: philia
One, two, three.
A bit too fast.
Sorry.
One, two, three.
Let's take a break.
Are you okay?
I can't do it. Ask Kuno.
Kuno.
Kuno, could you come here?
I want to go home.
Let's go home.
Izawa says she can't play it.
Will you do it?
I'm sorry.
Give it a try, okay?
Here we go. Stand up.
Why is Kuno playing?
No one picked her.
Izawa's not feeling well.
What's wrong with Kuno?
We voted on it.
But she's the best.
We can win on just the piano.
It's not a piano contest.
We all decided on this.
Let Izawa do it, please.
Right-o!
That's what we call democracy!
Right!
Izawa!
Izawa! Izawa!
No way. Izawa has declined.
So what if Kuno declines?
She should decline and step down now.
Step down now!
Step down now! Step down now!
Enough of this!
We haven't got time for this.
Let's practice!
Fine.
Okay?
Be my guest.
Let's begin.
Let's bail.
Are they allowed to do that?
Sasaki! Can I go too?
Let's get started.
But how can we rehearse without them?
Miss Osanai, would you call the girls for me?
What's wrong?
No, I'll do it.
Could you conduct, please?
What's going on?
Why can't they sing with Kuno?
Please, Miss Osanai.
Just open your eyes.
This is out-and-out bullying!
Why do they have to do that?
They have no reason.
Kanzaki says she's repulsed to the core by Kuno.
How do the other girls feel?
If Kanzaki says jump, they ask how high.
Can we change to
"Kitten on the Keys"?
You bet.
I changed the arrangement.
It's the "no piano" version.
Aren't we rehearsing?
"No piano" version?
I see. A cappella.
A cappella?
Soprano, bass...
This is pretty difficult.
Are you serious?
Where's she playing?
A little louder from the top.
Let's turn on the lights.
Aren't we done yet?
Kuno's not going to play the piano.
So please...
It's a bit late.
We haven't rehearsed.
Who's going to play?
There's no piano.
We changed the arrangement.
It's a cappella.
A cappella?
What's that?
What should I say...
Human karaoke.
Human karaoke?
What's that?
So what should I say?
Well, you girls gonna be the stars!
You know the melody.
All you have to do is sing.
That's all. Please!
Hasumi!
You ask, too!
What's this?
Tuning.
Kuno's playing the piano.
No, she isn't.
What's she doing?
Tuning, I said.
Here we go.
Did you arrange that?
Of course not. Kuno did.
I'm so glad Kuno didn't play.
- See? It's good she didn't play!
- Yeah, really!
The next...
Hasumi.
Get on.
It's all right.
Don't be shy.
Where's your bike?
It's amazing how women can ostracize someone like that.
It's because she's so popular with guys.
Are you a Kuno fan, too?
No.
Bullshit! You must notice her.
- She sits right in front of you.
- So who sits in front of you?
Tsuda.
Does that mean you like her?
Yes, I do.
Are you going out with her?
I saw you guys walking together.
I just ran into her at the station.
Does she have a boyfriend?
- Tsuda?
- Yeah.
I don't think so.
You're sure?
Hello?
It's Hasumi.
What?
Sasaki wants to see you.
What?
He'll wait for you on the roof tomorrow.
What does he want?
Go and find out.
I got it.
Bye.
- Hello?
- Hello.
Well... is this from Hoshino?
I said "Sasaki."
So it's not that?
What's "that"?
Is Sasaki a customer?
Because I need to know what panties I should wear.
It's Kentaro Sasaki we're talking about.
So it isn't work?
No.
Oh, God!
Lately whenever I think of men,
I think "customer."
Maybe this will be more fun.
You think so? Why?
Go and see.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Hello?
He's waiting in there.
The shed on the right.
Oh, my heart's breaking!
Am I a bad girl?
- Miss Kuno!
- Find her!
Kuno! Come out here!
There she is!
Grab her!
Hold her!
You idiot!
Find her!
Hurry!
Come out!
She's over here!
Come on!
Do you know this place?
This factory was
Hoshino's family business.
It went bust and his family broke up.
That'd screw up even a good little boy like him.
Right?
Don't let her go!
Quiet down!
Hold her!
Hurry up and do it!
Now!
You can't get away from us.
What are you doing? Be good.
- What are you doing?
- Cut it out!
Hold her!
It's okay, Miss Kuno.
I won't do anything to you.
"It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!"
Jesus!
Long ago, people believed the Ether filled the universe as a medium for the propagation of light.
From: Bear
But the Ether Lily talks about is a catalyst for emotion.
Philia's the one who knows best about that.
From: Pascal
Thank you very much for all you've taught me.
From: Winter
Speaking of Philia,
I wonder where he's been lately.
From: Sleepy Head
- Look at this!
- Where'd you get that?
He was sound asleep, so...
Don't tell anyone.
I'm starving!
Menu, please.
All right.
Excuse me.
What? I'm eating too much?
Who cares?
What did Sasaki say?
He likes me and wants to go out with me.
Good for you.
I said no.
Why?
I'm not good enough for him.
Sure you are.
No, I'm not.
He says he likes girls with a positive attitude.
Excuse me.
The "Grande," please.
I'm not positive.
Sure you are.
There is no "positive" or "negative" for us, you know.
"Hey, Sasaki, what's your blood type?"
Type A? Wow!
"That means you're high-strung but cheerful, huh?"
- I can't talk like that anymore.
- Why did you turn him down?
He'd look out for you.
He'd fight Hoshino for you.
He'd be there for you.
He was your chance to get out.
You look out for me.
That sounded so cool.
You're so passionate.
But you like Kuno, don't you?
It's obvious.
You're blushing.
I am not.
Do you think he'd let me go if I got fat?
Or got a Mohawk?
Shit.
Good morning.
Excuse me.
This, too.
Excuse me.
Thanks.
What's this?
Lily Chou-Chou.
We're here.
What?
Is this her latest?
That's last year's.
Her latest is "Breathe."
- I'd love to hear it.
- It's great.
Can I borrow it?
Let me borrow it, stingy.
Her first album's great.
"Jewel."
Is this the new one?
It's two years old. "Jewel."
What about the new one?
I don't have it.
Liar.
Stingy.
She'll be all right.
Kuno.
She's tough.
- Yuya Kitajima.
- Here.
Yoko Kuno...
Miss Kuno?
- Kentaro Sasaki.
- Here.
Ryoka Sasano.
Misuzu Sato.
Masumi Shoji.
Kazuetsu Suzuki.
Mayumi Suzuki.
Erika Tamune.
Shiori Tsuda.
I wanted to die many times.
But I couldn't.
Falling! Falling! Falling!
Like an endless loop...
I keep on falling.
Somebody!
Help me!
Somebody!
Get me out of here!
From: philia
Dear Philia,
I know you're feeling the invisible Ether deeper than anybody.
From: blue cat
I don't understand.
I just don't understand.
From: philia
I understand.
Because...
I know the pain you feel.
From: blue cat
I take a deep breath.
"Breathe!"
And then I understand it all.
Everything Lily means.
From: blue cat
"Breathe!"
I'll try to say it loud.
"Breathe!"
From: philia
I'm alive! I'm alive!
Within the pure Ether!
We're alive!
From: blue cat
"Breathe! Breathe! Breathe!"
From: philia
"Sympathy! Sympathy! Sympathy!"
From: blue cat
"Arabesque"!
"Wounds that Heal"!
"Glide"!
"Experiment in Love"!
"Hearts in September Rain"!
"Airship"!
"Abyss of Loneliness"!
"Music Box"!
"Erotic"!
"Wings That Can't Fly"!

We've got to get our hands around Hoshino's neck.
It was all his idea in the first place.
You told us to do it!
I said to threaten her, asshole!
Who told you to rape her?
No one. I never heard it.
It was all Hoshino's idea.
Right. That's right.
He's got to pay for it.
But can these guys do anything now?
One, two... three, four, five.
Five of you should be able to kill Hoshino.
Excuse me.
What?
It'd be good if we could be quiet now.
If this goes much further, we could all get arrested.
Maybe.
But Kuno showing up as a skinhead was hilarious!
That blew Hoshino's mind!
How can you laugh after someone just died?
Now I'm flying through the sky.
I'm flying, flying!
From: blue cat
What are you doing?
Flying kites.
Want to try?
Hold your arms out... and pull down hard.
It's falling!
I'm sorry!
Dear blue cat,
I'm glad I met you.
From: philia
I want to ride on a kite!
That'd be scary!
I wanna fly through the sky.
Miss Osanai! He just threw up!
Shit!
Are you all right?
Somebody bring a towel.
Everything's so loud.
I have a strange noise in my head.
What sort of noise?
I don't know.
What's it sound like?
It might not be a noise.
It's not a noise.
Then what is it?
I don't know.
Miss Osanai...
Yes?
Pocket...
What happened to it?
Hoshino broke it.
On December 8,
Lily's playing live!
The princess of the Ether lands in Yoyogi!
From: Pascal
I'm bringing my teddy bear!
Look for me!
From: Bear
I like "Tree of Silence."
"Erotic."
It allows me to feel her pain.
Which song do you like the best?
The best?
Maybe "Glide."
I like them all, but for me
"Abnormality" is the best.
From Philia?
Yeah.
Abnormality!
How could you?
There're Lily fans from before, and fans from when she went solo.
You like the solo stuff?
I don't know much about Philia, and I don't like Kamakatsu.
That's too bad.
Philia's great!
Have you heard them?
Sure.
Weren't they great?
I don't know.
All she did was sing.
You don't know?
She wrote all the lyrics.
They were ghost-written.
That's what some people say.
But I don't believe it.
It can't be true.
Here, listen to this.
So? Well?
It's not bad.
What are you talking about?
It's fantastic!
But Philia was Kamakatsu's band.
It's not Lily.
There's no Ether in there.
You're ignoring me.
Don't ignore me.
They don't publicize it, but Kamakatsu's still backing her up.
That's bullshit!
It's true.
Lily's releases are timed so they don't conflict with Yellow Fellows.
Kamakatsu does more than just Yellow Fellows.
Yeah, but...
You're a pain in the ass!
Poser!
Who's a poser?
Hey, sorry! Sorry!
Fuck off!
You'll pollute the Ether!
- He started it.
- You're disturbing other people.
Wait!
Could you come with me?
- First of all...
- Tell it to me later.
Where's your seat?
Show me your ticket.
This is a better seat.
Trade with me.
Okay?
Okay?
I'm thirsty. Go buy me a Coke.
Take that.
Just a moment!
If someone talks to you, give them that, okay?
Dear Philia, let's meet at the concert.
You'll know me by a green apple.
From: blue cat
What'll you have?
A Coke, please.
150 yen, please.
Thank you.
What's this?
What the hell's going on here?
Oh, my god!
They won't let us in like this.
Tickets!
Who wants Lily tickets?
We want some.
- 10,000 yen each?
- That's it? All right.
Sold out, kid.
Thank you for coming tonight...
Are you still here?
Did anyone talk to you?
See ya.
It's Lily! Lily's here!
It's Lily!
Where?
She's waving! It's Lily!
Ow! Watch it!
Someone's down!
Call an ambulance!
That day... one soul was lost, and one boy died.
Who killed the boy?
Who soiled the Ether?
A helpless soul... now screams without a voice.
From: Dream Child
I was at that concert.
Have they caught the guy yet?
From: Amica
Because of that incident,
Lily's being tagged "ill-fated."
I hate how she's being... raped by the press.
From: Bear
That's good. The color took.
The school won't let you dye it too light.
Oh, honey. Why are you crying?
Fifteen years old.
You're not together at 366.
Watch your breathing there.
If you try too hard in your first year, you can stumble in your second and third.
You work just as hard, but the results don't seem to come.
And when they don't, you lose your drive.
Soon you have to focus on high-school entrance exams, but you try to have fun while you still can.
So your grades fall off.
And the worse they get, the less you want to study.
So you give up.
Is that what happened to you?
In your case, it's not like a smooth descent.
It's a crash landing.
Can't you concentrate?
Is something bothering you?
No.
No?
That's it, then.
All I can do is say, "Try harder."
So... try harder.
If you don't try harder now...
All right?
How's the noise?
The strange noise.
Is it gone now?
Will you tell Miss Kuno it's time to go home?
The Ether fills the universe.
Despair is red Ether.
Hope is blue.
Through eternity and silence... flies a while glider.
From: Shinobu
As strong light casts a dark shadow, so does the powerful Ether.
From: Multipolar
Because I'm alive, I found Lily.
"Thank you."
Today I've been given the happy Ether.
From: Hinako
I hate everyone.
But I like it here.
From: moto
How wonderful will be the end of all things, as my body rots and I am destroyed.
From: Lemon
Black tears.
Blue smiles.
I am transparent.
A world without color.
From: Lui-hua
Uninjured, I hurt.
Hurt, I feel no pain.
I want to see the beautiful blue sky.
From: Noah
When I'm here, my brain starts to laugh.
You say I don't understand this.
I say people all die... searching for a place to belong.
From: Mifune Ogawa
Lily is very mysterious.
But she's also a living human being.
She needs a certain number of sales to make a living.
Otherwise she can't keep on going.
From: dodon
Lily's not there to heal you!
Don't make her out to be what she isn't.
From: Blue Flower
For the cancer-ridden city hordes who are poisoned by exhaust,
Lily bravely keeps singing.
From: Guten-B
The wound that does not heal.
The wound that may heal.
The wound that should have healed.
It grows wider, wider.
What if the whole body became one big wound?
We can still revive, that is "the wound that heals."
From: Lui-hua
The great wound of the heart is Existence.
I listen to "The Wound that Heals."
Existence will heal you from the past to the future.
From: Shinobu
People can't fly.
From: Frog
Maybe I'm writing this because I want to scream out,
"I'm here!"
From: Palstela
PELLET
One, two, three.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen...
You re a cheater.
-You left too soon.
-You're the cheater.
And you suck.
Say it to my face.
Go on.
Hi, Dad.
Dad...
Grab the bag outside.
-Where?
-Under the counter.
This one?
Yes.
What is it?
It's for your mom.
Come on, let's go.
See you later.
Get a haircut later.
But make sure they cut it.
Ask your mom for money.
-You got that?
-Yes.
Who cut it,
-Juanjo or Vidal?
-Vidal. Juanjo wasn t there.
Next time wait for Juanjo. He s better.
It's too short.
Again, Grandma?
What's wrong?
She pissed again, that's what.
-Then clean it up.
-I wasn t going to leave it.
-Come on, get up Grandma.
-Sorry, I didn t realize.
Then ask me.
I can t spend all day with you.
Come on.
-The floor's a mess.
-It's all right.
And she has to be changed or else everything will stink.
My Lord!
You should have told me.
Come on, take off your sweater first.
Stop playing with that thing and eat.
I am eating.
Get rid of it or I will.
Hey, nice haircut!
Watch it.
-It wasn't me.
-Yeah, sure.
What a shithead!
Hi.
Carlos, do you have a moment?
Easy, kids.
Lower your voices.
Calm down.
This is Alfredo, our new student.
Hi, Alfredo.
Come with me.
Have a seat in front.
Okay, let s continue.
Lolo.
Pass it on.
It s not from me.
Can you see him?
He's not coming.
-Is that true about India?
-I don't know.
Bucktooth said it's from India.
-Bucktooth is an asshole.
-Nice tits.
Go on, pass it on.
That one's old.
There he is.
What's he doing?
What a dipshit.
What's going on?
They caught that fool.
You're the fool.
Hi.
Hi.
-What do you want?
-Who, me? Nothing.
You're following me.
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.
What is it?
I just wanted to talk to you.
What s your name?
Pablo, but everyone calls me
' Pellet '.
-What did the bear say?
-What bear?
The teacher who caught you smoking.
That I couldn't smoke at school.
-What did you say?
-Nothing. I put it out.
-Did you write the note?
-No.
Who was it?
You don't have to say.
Cobeta.
-Who s that?
-A kid who sits behind you.
Friend of yours?
No.
I have no friends.
I've got these, and those.
Anything bigger won t fit.
I ll be right with you.
These are fine.
Go help Mrs. Encarna.
Then give me... Let's see...
Three... Give me ten.
How are you, Pablito?
Hi, Encarna.
Do you have this kind of light bulb?
Dad, where are the smaller
-light bulbs?
-Second shelf on the left.
Bye.
How's your back, Mrs. Encarna?
As bad as ever.
Seen a doctor?
What can he do?
Tons of good for nothing medication.
-Age is the problem.
-You're in better shape than most.
-What do I owe you?
I'm sick of it, Mariano.
If we were Pablito's age we'd be fine.
I bet you don t have any back problems.
You see?
Bye.
How's school?
Fine.
Fine?
Nothing new?
-What was going to happen?
-You never talk about it...
So there's no news?
You mean the new kid?
-What new kid?
-A new kid came today.
Really? How was it?
What's he like?
I don t know,
I didn't talk to him.
-Hi, Ramon.
-Hi, Mariano.
-Look at me when I talk to you.
-I didn't do anything.
Especially in public, got it?
-Who is it?
-It's me, Sebas.
-Hi.
-Hi.
You coming out?
Where are you going?
The fair and the tracks.
-What time? at Moor Park.
-You going?
-Yeah.
Fox owes me money.
He said he'd pay today.
I mean to the tracks.
Only if you do.
-I'm not going.
-Cobeta is.
-Pablo!
-What?
Don't stand in the doorway!
Right, I have to go.
You're not coming?
I can't. Don't tell
Cobeta you saw me.
Okay. I'm off.
See you later.
-Hey, Sebas.
-What?
-You know where the new kid lives?
-In the new towers. Why?
No reason. See you later.
The ones with the round windows.
Look like a boat.
Hey, shithead!
Either come in or leave!
But close the door!
It was only one second!
I've told you to never talk back to me!
Okay, you can help.
Hand me the pliers.
-These?
-No, those are tongs.
The pliers have a red handle.
-These?
-Yes. Hand them over.
I'll get it.
Careful not to fall.
-Hello.
-Hello.
Who are you?
Pellet. And you?
I'm Juan.
Come in.
Who is it?
Who is it, Juan?
Hello.
Hi.
-Is Alfredo here?
-You're not my brother s friend.
Of course he is.
I never saw him with Alfre.
That doesn't mean they're not friends.
Look, go down to the end of the hall.
First room on the left.
Got a taboo?
What?
-Got a taboo?
-He means tattoo.
No.
Mommy's got one on her ass.
Great.
Tell him all my secrets.
Let him go, he's here to see your brother, not you.
See you, Pellet.
See you. Bye.
Bye.
-What did you call him?
-Pellet.
' Pellet" isn t a name.
He must have said "Juan", or ' Pedro', or "Alfonso '...
-He said 'Pellet".
-Fine, I believe you.
Yes?
-Hi.
-Hi. Come on in.
Don't worry, he won t bite.
Have a seat.
-How did you know where I live?
-Sebas told me.
-How did he know?
-Someone must have told him.
Very cool.
What is?
Your room, and the flat.
Very cool.
What's up?
Nothing.
You want to hang out?
Where?
Some of the guys are at the fair.
Who?
Kids from class.
And the area.
Cobeta's there.
That's not what I meant.
-Are you going?
-I don't know.
The fair sucks. I went last year and there was nothing.
Let's hit the amusement park.
I'm broke.
I know a guy at the door.
If he's there we can get in free.
I don't know...
Come on.
Coming or not?
The fair is a drag.
Who s that?
-Who?
-In the picture.
My old man.
Hey, Birras.
Come on in.
Aren't you going to introduce me to your pal?
Yeah. Pellet, this is Birras.
Birras, Pellet.
What's up, kid?
What?
Are you here to see me?
Or...
To see you.
And maybe you could let us in.
And kill two birds with one stone.
You're a smart little brat.
A couple stick-ons, and 2 tickets for the "Launch Pad'.
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.
You came to see me?
Well, you've seen me.
Give me a kiss.
And tell your pop to stop by sometime.
Hurry up, already.
We close at nine.
-See you later.
-Bye.
-Birras.
-What?
-Got a smoke for me?
-A smoke!
You little devil.
Here. Now beat it before I change my mind.
Ever been on this?
Yeah.
-How was it?
-You'll shit your pants.
-I don't think so.
-You ll see.
-You don t scare me.
-You're already scared.
You're the one shitting himself.
You always carry that pellet with you?
Not a pellet, a ball-bearing.
It brings me good luck.
I don't believe in that bullshit.
But hold on to it tight.
We don't want it to fall now.
You're shitting.
What if it broke right now?
If it broke right now, we'd be totally screwed.
Son of a bitch.
Relax.
It's all right.
Hey, are you a screamer?
-No. Are you?
-Me? No way.
-Ever seen anyone get a tattoo?
-No.
Well, once on a TV show.
It must hurt like hell.
It depends where.
Sensitive areas hurt, like your ankle, shin or knee...
Where the skin s close to the bone.
-If there's no bone it doesn t hurt?
-Much less.
What's so funny?
There's no bone in my dick but I bet it hurts like hell!
What a ride!
-It'd be cool to go to India.
-Sure.
But I'd rather go to Africa.
It must be amazing.
-Where would you go?
-To the desert.
What for?
Thanks, man.
You're welcome.
You can treat next time.
If it weren't for this,
I'd be puking still.
Why didn't you tell me you get dizzy, you dickhead?
I was embarrassed.
You should have told me.
-That hit the spot.
-Sure did.
What do we do now?
Digest our food first.
-Where do we go first?
-Your choice.
I don't care.
But not Corkscrew.
The ferris wheel.
-What for?
-I'm joking, dipshit.
You're crazy, man!
I m going to fall!
Relax, Grandma.
I've got you.
Stay still.
She's digging her nails into me!
Don t make this worse.
Raise your arm.
Raise your arm!
Don't shout.
Why are you shouting?
I'm not.
-Yes you are!
-Fine, whatever you say.
Turn around.
In front of the child.
How embarrassing!
I'm not looking, Grandma.
If you'd cooperate he wouldn't have to be here.
I wash myself everyday.
You wash your face, that's not enough.
I wash more than my face.
I don't want to argue.
See you later.
Where are you going?
To hang out.
It's the anniversary of your brother's death.
You want me to stay?
No, go on.
Go hang out.
That's all you do, hang out in the fucking street.
Let him go.
It wouldn't kill him to stay home for once.
I'd say.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-I thought you weren't coming.
-I got tied up.
-Why are you dressed like that?
-No reason.
It's only my dad's studio.
That's not why.
-Come on, let's go.
-Is it far?
The studio?
Yeah.
6 metro stops.
Come on.
What an outfit.
-Hi, Dad.
-Hi.
-What's up, monster?
-Hi.
Why are you here?
I came to see you.
I can see that.
Did you tell your mom?
Yeah.
He didn't tell her.
That wasn t very convincing.
Ever seen this before?
No.
Here's the design.
-Is the dragon finished?
-You can't see it now.
-Just let Pellet see it.
-No, Alfredo.
Go on, let him see it.
Hey, you faggot.
I'm on my way over.
No, he can't.
No, he said he had stuff to do.
The other one s for you?
Thanks.
This one's mine?
Yeah.
Alfredo says he wants to come to the studio sometime.
You've got some nerve.
Skipping school, dropping by without notice, and next the recording studio.
You live like a king.
You've got some nerve.
You always tell me to enjoy life.
Yeah, but not so much.
And you're pushing it.
Alfonso, are you free later?
You're not going home?
No. But you can take the metro, right?
Or do you need a chauffeur?
-Where are you going?
-To see Felix at the hospital.
So are you free?
No way.
Come on.
Come with me.
No.
-Why not?
-No.
He s okay.
He's fine.
So was Hendrix and he didn't even recognize me.
I just talked to him.
He asked about you.
No, Jose.
-I don't get you.
-You don't?
It's simple.
I m tired of seeing my friends die.
I've spent
3 years burying my friends.
I don't want to see Felix like that.
I don't want to remember him that way.
Dad, can I come with you?
No, I ve told you a hundred times.
You can't.
Why not?
Don't make me say it again!
Who's Felix?
My godfather.
What's wrong with him?
He has Aids.
-That's why your pop won t let you?
-Yeah.
I want to see him, though.
I ll go tomorrow at playtime.
They won't let you in.
I don't care.
I'll sneak in.
Hey.
-What?
-Come with me.
I can't miss class.
Next weekend if you want.
No, I m going tomorrow.
Come and meet him.
He's cool, and he'll like you.
I can't.
I would if I could, I swear.
How will you get out?
Through the front door, how do you think?
The door's locked.
I know a better way.
Pellet!
-What?
-Thanks.
You're welcome.
Hey, why don't you come with me?
Come on.
-I can't.
-You re a shithead.
I ll see you tomorrow.
See you.
Pellet.
-The tracks tomorrow.
-Fine.
What's up?
-Ditching again tomorrow?
-Fuck you, Cobeta.
You're scared.
Forget it, punk!
Why did you come?
I didn't want you to go alone.
I knew you'd come.
-How?
-I don t know, but I knew.
Hi.
Hi.
-We're here to see a patient.
-Room number?
-One second.
There's no answer.
Is he expecting you?
No.
You can't enter without an adult.
Sorry.
-Is he a relative?
-My godfather.
Is he alone?
I don't think so.
Wait over there if you want and
I'll try again, okay?
Okay.
What a crock.
What do we do?
I don t know. Let's wait.
What if your godmother comes?
I m not leaving till I see him.
With her there, it might be difficult.
Felix?
Alfredo.
Alfredo!
Come on, man. Let's go.
Come on, man.
That son of a bitch!
-Will you tell your pop you saw him?
-No.
I shouldn't have gone.
Why not?
Because.
I understand Alfonso now.
If you hadn t, it would have bugged you your whole life.
Why'd they shave his head?
I don t know.
How can they keep someone like that alive?
I d rather die than be like that. I'd shoot myself.
They wouldn t leave me half-dead. And if I die, they can burn my body and throw the ashes into the sea or anywhere as long as it isn't one of those sick tombs.
Big deal.
If you're already dead, who cares?
I care. I won't be put in a hole.
I don't want to die.
Of course not! Neither do I.
But it's impossible.
Why?
Because everyone dies.
-I don't see why.
-How should I know?
It's up to God or whatever.
God doesn't exist.
How do you know?
I just do.
God doesn't exist and I'm never going to die.
Or let Him stop this rock from landing on that light reflected in the water.
No fucking way.
No?
Get your ass in here, asshole!
Fucking move!
I'm going to kick your ass!
What do you mean, ' nothing '?
The next time you ditch class you're fucking dead!
What s E.T. s dad s name?
-What?
-Eat Me!
How stupid.
You in, Lolo?
I'm out.
New kid?
If not, what did you come for?
I can t be here?
Sure. You can watch.
I'm not watching you.
-What?
-You heard me.
Yeah, you d better not.
Leave him alone.
I just hate smart asses.
Okay, come on.
Let's draw for it.
Adri.
You in or what?
Let s go, shit.
Sebas against...
He always cheats!
See how he went before the signal?
I didn't see it.
You ll see when you go against him.
He s a real son of a bitch.
I won't because I'll never do it.
It s fucking stupid.
-What is?
-That fucking stupid game.
No way, it s real cool.
I don't see why.
It is, it's amazing.
Yeah, especially the day someone gets their head ripped off by the train.
-Like the tall guy.
-What tall guy?
Last year a tall kid got killed.
What's up?
He's not coming.
Shit. One less.
Why not?
-His father says he s grounded.
-Why?
What for?
I don t know.
What now?
Go try to talk to him.
You go, Alfonso.
I don't even know him.
Shit.
You know his name?
No.
All right, fine.
Be right back.
Jose, be diplomatic.
And cover the tattoo.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Pablo lives here, right?
-Yes.
I'm Alfredo's father.
-Hello.
-Hi.
-Could I speak to your husband?
-Of course.
Come in.
Good morning.
How's it going?
-Hi, Pablo.
-Hi.
He's the father of the boy who was here earlier.
Forgive the intrusion.
No, not at all.
What is it?
-Won't you sit down?
-No, thank you.
We re all going up to a house on the mountain, and thought
Pablo could join us.
Right.
-You'll be back today?
-Yeah.
We ll be back at around 10 or 11.
It depends on the traffic, you know how it is on weekends.
You want to go?
I have to do what you said.
You can do that tomorrow.
Go on.
Thanks. See you later.
Bye.
Who farted?
It stinks!
You pig, you farted.
It was you,
-don t lie.
-It was you.
Yeah, he s the pig.
-Open my window.
-Mine, too.
It s no big deal.
There they are.
Mommy, Alfonso fartied.
Yes, he did.
And it stinks.
Hop in.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Hi, Pablo.
-Get off me, Golfo.
Where are we going?
To the top.
To the clouds?
Maybe not as high as the clouds.
To the sky?
Hey, what's the hurry?
Be careful.
Let them go, give them a break.
So, when are we going to stop?
Stop?
Didn't you say we'd stop soon?
Go on, your turn.
Do it with him.
Let's see.
Where is it?
Don't...
Golfo!
Golfo!
Okay, we're in.
-Dad...
-What?
-I'm soaked.
-Don't worry about it.
Here, take the kid.
Up, Golfo.
Up.
It came from nowhere.
I'm drenched!
So am I.
That's what you get for not bringing clothes.
It's a great feeling.
Nice and wet.
Especially my nuts.
Warm and soggy!
Here. This is for you and this is for your friend.
Leave your wet shoes and clothes in the tub.
Okay.
It s big, but it's all we have.
I'll dry your clothes later.
Hey.
Don't drip too much.
We won't. Bye.
Bye.
Shit, I'm freezing, man!
Me, too!
Take the boots.
Shit.
It's big on you.
'Big", he says.
-Where's mine?
-In the basket.
It's in there.
Grab it.
How did that happen?
What?
Your back.
I fell the other day.
Well?
I'm washing my hands.
I don't want you with those people again.
Why not?
Because I said so.
Okay, okay.
Dry off and go to bed, it's after eleven.
Son of a bitch.
I hope you die.
Hey, you guys seen Pellet?
-You seen him, Red?
-No.
Maybe he s in the shop.
Salva?
-You seen him?
-Nope.
He's probably sick.
For a week?
Why not?
His dad probably beat him up.
Yeah? How do you know?
Cause I do.
Did he tell you?
No, but everyone knows it.
You ve got a big mouth.
Why do you say that?
Because you do.
Big-mouth.
Pablo, it s me. Open up.
I can't.
Why not?
Because. Please go away, my dad will be here any minute.
-How are you?
-Fine.
You sure?
Yeah.
Then let me in.
I told you, I can't.
Just for a second.
I can't.
Please leave and don't come back.
Leave or I'll be in trouble again.
He hit you?
Your old man hit you, right?
Pablo?
Are you there?
Just tell me if he did.
I ll leave. I swear.
-Can I give Golfo some dinner?
-No, you can't feed the dog.
When you gone
I give him.
Fine, but hold off until I leave.
Okay, squirt?
I'm not a squirt.
What s wrong with you?
Me? Nothing.
Come on, I know you.
What's wrong?
Have a bite.
Nothing.
You haven't said a word all night.
What is it?
It's not me, it's Pellet.
What about him?
Golfo!
Another?
He's missed class all week.
And?
Remember that day on the mountain?
When we were changing our wet clothes
I saw his back and it was full of marks and bruises.
I asked him and he said he'd fell, but he lied.
What do you mean?
It was his dad.
How do you know?
Everyone knows about it.
Hello.
Remember me?
-I'm...
-Sure.
Of course I do.
It s about your son.
Is there a problem?
No, no.
Well?
He's been missing class.
I thought he might be sick.
My son's been looking for him for days.
It's probably nothing...
He's at his grandma's with tonsillitis.
Right.
Then forget it.
Tell him Alfredo said hi.
Who?
My son, Alfredo.
Right. I'll tell him.
-Thanks. And excuse me.
-It's nothing.
See you later.
Good bye.
Pablo?
Pablo!
Pablo, wait.
How did that happen?
Pellet, wait.
-You going home?
-Yeah.
-Where were you at recess?
-In the yard.
I didn t see you.
What are you doing tomorrow?
I don t know.
My dad said we could go to the studio.
He s doing Ramiro.
I can't.
-Why not?
-I just can't. Bye.
-Where were the marks?
-On his back.
And his ribs.
Just bruises, or also scars?
I think he had scars, too.
How did he explain them?
He fell.
You re sure?
Everyone knows his dad hits him.
And I saw more on him yesterday.
None of it matters if we can't prove it.
You saw his dad hit him?
No.
That's what matters.
-Did he say why he can't come?
-No.
Get him to talk to Laura.
I'll talk to a social worker to see what we can do.
And meanwhile?
There's nothing else we can do.
Unless you want to press charges.
I wouldn't unless
I were completely sure.
Wait.
For what?
For it to happen again?
For him to speak.
The kid has to admit it.
Hello?
Hi.
Right.
He's here, don't call him.
When?
No, we ended up leaving later.
Yeah, I know where it is.
Tomorrow at five. All right.
Good bye.
Alfredo, come here a second.
-Come here.
-What is it?
Come here.
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.
Felix is dead.
It's all right.
It's all right.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-What are you doing here?
-I came to see Alfredo.
Where is he?
Next door. Come on.
Did you call your mom?
Hi.
-How are you?
-Okay.
Did you see your godmother?
Yeah, she's pretty sad.
Well, cheer up or she'll cry when she sees you.
You want anything?
I just had a coke.
-Pablo?
-No, thanks.
-You sure?
-Yeah.
Anyone?
Coffee for me.
-Okay.
-Sit down.
Hi.
-How did you find out?
-I heard at school.
When s the burial?
They're cremating him.
Good. They buried my brother and it sucked.
I didn't know you'd lost a brother.
Remember the day at the studio?
I'd just come from the cemetery.
I'm sorry.
Why?
About your brother.
I only lost a godfather and look at me.
I never knew him.
He died before I was born.
Aren t you still sad?
No. He was probably an asshole.
Why do you say that?
Because. My father always compares him with me.
He must have been an asshole.
How did he die?
In a car accident.
-He moved.
-Don't fucking move!
Come on, shut up already.
Me against...
You!
Hey! I'm talking to you!
What?
Are you in or out?
Leave me alone already.
-That kid's weird, man.
-Yeah.
A fag, like his godfather.
What did you say?
-I didn't say anything.
-I heard you!
I said you don't have balls for this.
I just think it's fucking stupid.
Sure.
-You want to try me?
-If you're up for it!
Relax, I won't do anything.
Cars 204 and 206, are you there? Over.
204 here. Over.
Some kids have been spotted on the tracks.
We're on our way.
What are you doing?
You should have gotten ran over.
What happened?
I told him he s an asshole.
-Why didn t you cross?
-I didn't want to.
I m never coming back here.
This sucks.
-Where are you going?
-Home. You coming?
Sure.
Pellet! Wait!
I'm coming with you.
Hey, kids!
Stop there.
-Where are you going?
-Home.
Come on, get up.
-What's the hurry?
-Let me see.
What is it?
Your knee?
So what s this train thing?
A game.
A game? No, shit.
Pretty dangerous game.
I've never played.
What?
I don t play.
You're too smart, right?
You just sit there waiting for one of your friends to get run over.
They're all stupid and you're the smart one.
I didn't say that.
Look.
I don't intend to be watching.
Alfredo, don't laugh.
I m serious!
You're getting on my nerves.
You hear me?
Do you hear me?
Yes.
I'm not going to follow you around whenever you go out, I'm not a cop.
But I'll tell you one thing.
If you get killed on those tracks, you'll kill me and everyone else who loves you.
Do you get it?
Do it for yourself.
Life has too much to offer.
Don't get yourself killed before your time comes.
Life's already way too short.
Don't pout.
I'm telling you because I love you.
What a speech.
Bullshit.
You ll just blow it off, like we all did at your age.
That goes for you, too.
I m talking to you as a son.
I m not going back.
What?
I won t play again, it's stupid.
Son of a bitch.
What a couple of smart little assholes.
There's no room.
There isn't a free spot anywhere.
It's full. But look.
This is so cool.
It's not colorful, but...
-And this one?
-Much better.
It's the same but a profile.
It's beautiful.
Javier.
What are you up to now?
Nothing. Heading home.
I need some help.
Could you stay a little longer?
Sure.
Set up the chair.
Alfredo, Pablo, come here.
Sit here, Pablo.
Take that off.
-What for?
-Take it off.
Ready?
Wait.
Hold still.
Let me see it.
-See you later.
-Bye.
Mom...
Why are you so late?
-Where's Grandma?
-She went to bed.
Sit down.
Can't you ever be on time?
I got tied up.
Right.
-What's this?
-It's food, that's what.
Go on, eat.
Where have you been?
What do you mean?
Don't pull that shit with me,
I'm not one of your little friends.
Where have you been?
At school, where else?
Where?
At school, I said.
You're lying!
I'm not lying, I was at school.
I went by.
Where were you?
I asked you a question.
I skipped the last class.
Skipped the last class?
Then where were you?
Answer me.
Are you deaf?
I said answer!
Don't hit him, please.
You stay out of this.
I m waiting.
Did you hear me?
I was at the tracks.
Really?
What the fuck were you doing?
-Nothing.
-Nothing?
Are you lying again? You want me to tell you where you were?
Do I have to?
Where are you going?
Did I say get up?
Sit down!
Next time I see you with those people I'll rip your head off!
Sit down!
You hear me?
Answer me!
Answer me!
-Answer me, you asshole!
-Yes.
What was that?
What did you say?
Speak up!
Don't start, please...
Speak up!
You son of a bitch!
I hope you die!
Let him go.
Please don t hit him.
-Let go of me!
-Please, Mariano, please...
Stay the fuck out of this!
You spit on me?
On your father?
You're fucking dead!
You fucking spit on your father?
Stand up. Get up.
Manolo, open the door!
Open up!
He'll kill him!
Where are you going?
Come back here!
You going to cry now?
Come out of there.
Get the fuck out of there, asshole!
Come out, you fucker!
I said come out here!
Son of a bitch!
Where are you going?
Mariano, let go of him!
Calm down.
Are you crazy?
Pablo! Where are you going?
Wait!
See if he spits on me now.
Calm down.
Pablo...
Pablo!
Pablo, come back!
Where are you going?
Come back!
That son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch!
Motherfucker!
I hope you die, you son of a bitch.
Leave me alone. My son...
-We're about to eat.
-Just one piece of chorizo.
You'll get fat.
Very funny.
-You want chocolate?
-Yes.
You have to finish your plate.
Okay.
I'll get it!
-Okay, but then you'll eat.
-Okay.
Who is it?
Pablo!
-Alfre, is Pablo good?
-Of course he is.
-Then why does his daddy hit him?
-I don't know.
Laura? It's me again.
Call me when you get the message.
No matter how late.
Call me back.
It's about Alfredo s friend.
Still no answer.
-You want a drink?
-No, thanks.
You sure?
I want a coke.
I didn t ask you,
I asked your brother.
What will we do now?
I don't know, we ll see.
See what your dad says.
-Does it hurt?
-A little.
Jose.
What?
Can I stay with you tonight?
Sure, don't worry about it.
I don't want to see my dad.
Don't think about that.
Size 5.0 stitches.
-And a tetanus shot?
-Yes.
You promise?
Relax, it ll be fine.
Promise me.
I promise. Now try and relax.
We'll talk later.
Lie down, please.
Take off the gauze.
This'll hurt a little.
Don't move.
Hold his wrists, please.
What s your name?
Pablo.
Can I have your hand?
Hang in there.
Hold still...
Are you dizzy?
What if that asshole beats him up again tonight?
Can you be sure he won't?
I'm not sure of anything.
What I'm saying is how things should be done.
If my idea sounds stupid to you,
I ll leave it all up to you.
How is he?
Fine. He wants water.
-Tell us if you need anything.
-Okay.
He clearly doesn't want to go home.
Jose, it s not up to him.
We have to call his parents and tell them he's here.
-Why?
-Because we do, shit.
The police could be looking for him.
We can't hide him here.
I'm not hiding anyone.
Jose, you've had a minor since 10 P.M.
It's 2 A.M. and you haven't called his parents.
If you don't by tomorrow, they could charge you for kidnapping.
That's right.
And that dickhead father could say the kid left home unharmed.
Then we d be screwed.
Isn t there anything else we can do?
Here.
Thanks.
My dad gave it to me.
You dropped it in the hospital.
Does it hurt?
A little.
And you?
Me what?
The tattoo.
Not anymore.
What did your dad say?
He s talking to Laura.
Well?
They're going to call your dad to come pick you up.
Why?
Laura says it's for the best.
Or there could be trouble.
Your dad said I could stay here tonight.
He promised.
Maybe Laura's right and you should leave.
He promised.
He wanted you to stay.
My dad will kill me.
I swear.
He'll kill me.
It's Pablo's father.
Good evening. Come in.
Pellet!
Pellet!
Meet me in the alley next to the park!
Where s Pablo?
Son of a bitch.
Got a light?
No.
Jos... you got a light?
Here.
Here.
Thank you.
You want one?
No, thanks. I don't smoke.
He's not here.
Where's that park you hang out at?
He might be there.
Moor Park?
-I don t know. Where you guys meet.
-Moor Park.
Where is it?
Next to the church.
Let's go have a look.
You better stay.
If he sees you, it could make things worse.
He's not here.
Wait, Alfredo.
What?
Where is he?
-What?
-Where's Pablo?
I don t know.
Yes, you do. Tell me.
I don't, I swear.
Don t lie to me.
I'm not lying.
Where is he? And don't say you don t know. You can't fool me.
I can't say.
What?
I can't.
You'll let his dad take him.
I have to.
You said he'd stay with us.
I know, but things have changed.
Now he can t.
Because you don't want him to.
No, he just can't.
You ll understand someday.
I can't explain it now.
Tell me.
Alfredo, tell me where he is.
No.
You're making this hard.
Don't make me say it again.
Don't make me do something
I'll regret.
Tell me.
-Are you going to tell me?
-No.
Now tell me where the fuck he is.
I don t know.
There he is.
Pablo, wait.
Is my dad there?
What?
Is he there?
Yes, but...
Pablo!
Pablo!
Pablo, stop!
Pablo, wait!
Pablo, stop!
I won't hurt you.
I won't.
-What?
-I won t go back with him.
Relax, you don't have to.
Come on.
That s it, take it easy.
Dad.
Alfredo.
Stay with him.
Cover up.
Cover up.
I'll be right back.
Laura, come here.
Nothing, just come here.
What's up?
I'm taking the kid home with me.
-Don't do it...
-Wait, listen.
Get rid of his father.
Tell him anything.
Jose, Jose.
You could get into trouble.
You know that, right?
I'm not thinking of myself.
I m thinking about the kid.
Come on, let's go.
Pablo, stand up.
My leg hurts.
It hurts?
Come on, try.
I can't.
Don t worry. Hold on tight.
That's it. Up you go.
He kicked me, and pulled my hair.
He burned me with cigarettes.
He made me drink urine.
At bedtime he'd give me laxatives.
When I misbehaved, he'd lock me up in my room, or in the closet, and he said I couldn't get out until I felt sorry, and that he d let me die there.
He wouldn't let me see my friends, and he made me work in the shop.
He insulted me.
He spit on me.
He said that I should have died instead of my brother.
Can I say it?
Son of a bitch.
Bastard.
Asshole.
Shithead.
Motherfucker.
Pig.
Faggot.
Since you left that morning,
I've thought of you every day.
It's as if you're always with me.
You know...
Handong, your turn.
Fuck!
That damn black ball won't go in!
If this goes on, I'll eat it!
Do that and the game's over.
Then we might as well go home.
Xiao Bin!
Bring them two bottles of black-label whiskey.
That last red-label was awful.
Nice shot!
I heard you scored the other night.
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?
She had a name!
What was her name?
Ask him!
Everybody having fun?
Liu! Where'd you run off to?
Yeah, Liu Zheng.
The red label's awful and the black ball's stubborn.
It's up to you to cheer him up tonight.
Mr. Chen, your two bottles of black-label.
Don't forget, you owe me three drinks.
Pay up!
Have pity on me!
No way, let's drink now!
Drink!
Liu Zheng, aren't you joining us?
Wait a minute.
What are you plotting out there?
None of your business.
Do you work for me?
Who's that?
A friend's younger brother.
You actually have friends?
Just as many as you.
So why's he here?
College guys are always short of cash.
You expect him to make money off us?
Come on.
I want to hook him up with the big boss.
That bastard?
What for?
You ask too many questions.
Chen Handong, are you still in?
I'm coming!
Are you kidding?
He's into that?
That?
How much?
How much for what?
Don't play dumb.
1,000 yuan.
Is that all?
Is he clean?
Seems healthy.
All he needs is a bath.
Is he any good?
What are you on about?
It's just money.
So you're offering him to that bastard?
Listen, how about taking him out for dinner tonight?
Let's go.
Don't make a fuss.
What's his name?
Lan Yu.
LA is not only
Califonia largest city.
It's also the state capital or it's the largest city in the western US
The city of angels has several different areas...
Still here?
What?
It's the mix culture of these five areas that give LA it's unique...
I mean...
I thought you'd run off with all my stuff.
It's late.
Go and wash.
Sir...
Have you been to America?
What time is it?
Fuck!
Those East Europeans, they're never on time!
No wonder their countries are so poor.
Are you in a hurry?
No classes tomorrow.
Student?
Architecture.
Studying architecture costs.
Where are you from?
The Northeast.
I majored in liberal arts.
I wasn't any good.
But my company's worth more than 100 million today.
Where's all this come from?
I'm covered in it!
Wipe yourself, too.
Sleep here, tonight.
First time?
Got a girlfriend?
No.
You're hard again?
Ever kissed?
No.
Want me to teach you?
Hey, student!
I thought you'd given up and gone back home.
I don't give up so easily.
It's been a while.
How are you?
Four months.
What?
It was four months yesterday.
Right, right.
- Today...
- You...
- What?
- You first.
Nothing, really.
I thought you would call me.
I left your number in my pocket.
Then I washed my clothes.
The thousand yuan was OK.
But the note got lost.
Liu Zheng said you were a weird one.
Really?
What else did he say?
Can't remember.
I don't believe you.
You don't have to.
I just forgot.
Mr. Liu is a good man.
That implies I'm not?
Aren't you cold?
I was in a hurry.
I forgot my scarf.
Take mine.
Here.
Thanks.
Any plans this evening?
It's winter break, everyone's gone except me.
I'm here.
Not going home for New Year?
I hate holidays, eating and drinking all day.
Don't you like eating?
You really want to know?
Come to my place and see.
Happy New Year.
You were up early.
Early?
It's already lunchtime!
Go and get dressed.
We're going out?
I've booked a table in a new restaurant.
Very pricey, they say.
Endless eating!
What?
Damn you!
Come here!
I thought you wanted me to get dressed?
Come here!
Come here.
Come here.
I have something for you.
Where?
I said Happy New Year!
You just ignore me!
Happy New Year!
Your present's in the wardrobe, go and look.
You bought all this for me?
You dress like a country boy.
I am a country boy.
If I wear these to class, they'll think I'm Japanese.
I'll turn you Japanese and we'll see what they say!
Which shall I wear today?
I think... you look best without clothes!
Stop it!
You already tortured me all night long.
Tortured? Really?
The guy underneath me seemed to be having a good time.
Me...
Sorry I'm late.
How did you get here?
Bus.
Next time, take a taxi, call me and I'll pick you up.
No beer.
I have to tutor later.
You're too busy for that.
Really need that money?
That's not why I do it.
A coke and mixed noodles...
Then, what's the problem?
Who's making that noise?
Okay, let me check it out.
We're trying to eat.
Can you keep it down, please?
Stop it! Customers are complaining.
I save all the money you give me.
Good, maybe you'll bail me out if I'm broke one day.
But there isn't that much.
Lan Yu,
I think you're weird.
Right, I'm weird.
I prefer you to the girls in college.
Aren't you cold?
I'm okay.
There's a strong wind these days.
It's okay.
What do you smoke?
These? Want one?
Sure
Mercedes?
Don't see many of them around here.
I'm waiting for my brother.
Your brother?
It's winter vacation.
The dorms are all empty.
You seem hungry.
I didn't eat.
No time at the site.
The site?
Mr. Liu got me a construction job.
Doesn't pay much.
I wasn't supposed to tell you.
Liu Zheng is always plotting behind my back.
Doesn't he know I'm his boss?
He admires you a lot.
And you?
What do you think of me?
Me? Nothing in particular.
Why wasn't I supposed to know?
About that construction site job?
I was afraid you'd be angry.
Really...
And why were you afraid of that?
Listen, we were destined to meet.
But it won't be for a lifetime.
We'll stay together as long as it feels right.
When it doesn't anymore, we'll just break up.
Me, I feel good.
When two people know each other too well, it just doesn't work anymore.
Then it's time to separate.
You understand?
You do look kind of Japanese in those clothes.
We don't know each other too well yet...?
I guess not.
What shampoo do you use?
Make yourself useful!
Go and fetch the special tea set for later.
And don't break anything!
Why is Daning so late?
Niu Ma, is the turtle soup ready?
Another example of sexual inequality.
Why should I always be the one to fetch things?
Lan Yu, you go!
Come on, how should he know which set to bring?
If he breaks something, the old lady will blame me.
Ma, how old are you?
Someone's calling you an old lady!
I've been telling you for years not to shout!
How will you end up raising your own kids?
Ma, allow me.
Old lady?
I never said that.
Coward!
Brother! Ma! Sister!
This is Lan Yu, my classmate's brother.
That's Weidong, my brother.
Hello!
Brother, did you bring the stuff
I asked you to buy in Hong Kong?
In your room.
You like Japanese music.
All those magazines and tapes!
Sakamoto Ryuichi, like him?
I'm not into music.
Go and wash your face, then bring us the best tea set.
And be careful!
Niu Ma, is the duck ready?
The same old junk every year.
Careful,
Ma hasn't given out gifts yet.
Every year the same risk of breaking the antique tea sets.
As if it's our only set!
Be nice and get them for Ma.
If not, she'll tell her old jokes.
Evening, everyone!
Ma is cracking jokes again?
Never mind.
Go on, work for a change.
Your turn again this year?
Why so late?
Something came up.
Give him a hand.
Who's he?
Handong's friend's brother.
Madam said to serve when Mr. Daning arrives.
Niu Ma, tell Mrs. Chen
I'm sorry I'm late.
I'll drink three cups of wine as penance.
Ma's already had a few herself!
Let's get the food.
Handong... it's been a while.
I've been very busy these days.
No wonder, your business is growing.
We're doing alright.
Alright?
What about that
30 million government loan?
They've approved it?
I hear they have.
I admire the way you network.
In my opinion...
What?
Brother, Daning, dinner's served!
Coming!
In your opinion?
You know what they always say:
Better to prepare for the worst.
Let's toast to the New Year!
All these are for me?
If you like them.
You're so generous, Mr. Chen.
That stuff looks bad on most people.
But it looks great on you.
My classmates say I should model, but I have no connections.
Take a seat.
Sit
Relax.
Have a drink to warm up.
To your success as a model!
Sorry.
It's nothing. Never mind.
I'll do it myself.
Just take them off.
I hear models always walk around naked backstage.
You've got company?
I heard you talking.
Two weeks, and I've missed you.
Don't!
How come you're here?
Why didn't you call first?
I thought we agreed to meet after
I finished my course work.
You should have called first!
Think this is your place?
How's this one?
I didn't know you were busy.
I'd better go.
What's the matter?
Nothing, I'll be right back.
Lan Yu!
Lan Yu! Listen...
What is it?
It's my fault.
I forgot we had a date.
This time...
I even took a taxi.
I'm really sorry you came all this way for nothing.
Is that all?
He's waiting!
He's hot for you!
I already told you.
This kind of stuff isn't serious!
So what is serious for you?
I told you:
When it stops feeling good, we split up.
I see.
See? You don't see shit!
If not me, who would you be playing around with?
Think Liu Zheng could find you a client as generous as me?
How naive can you be!
You mean your money?
No problem.
I'll get it from the bank tomorrow.
Mr. Liu can bring it to you!
Lan Yu, not taking my money doesn't change anything.
I'm no Mr. Nice Guy!
Fuck.
Is anyone going to fix the air conditioner?
Mr. Chen, I'll bring you some iced water.
I called the company, but they said their staff is on strike, the maintenance department's collapsed.
They're very sorry.
That's ridiculous!
Strike? Why don't they just hire new staff?
Are all Beijing's workers dead or what?
Where's Liu Zheng?
Haven't seen him all day.
His wife is in the maternity ward.
He's on his way.
Any news from East Berlin?
No.
Not even a fax?
Did you check properly?
If there's nothing else,
I'll be going.
So early?
I thought we'd have a drink later.
Right, your wife's still in the hospital...
Any news?
She hasn't given birth yet?
What's wrong?
The doctor didn't say.
He just told me to be mentally prepared.
Is she in any danger?
I don't know.
I'm scared.
I'm really scared.
Don't worry.
Shiling is a lucky woman.
I hope you're right.
I've been thinking all day that I have only her in this world.
Don't worry.
You mustn't think too much about it now.
Mr. Luo is asking for you.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
I'll go now.
Give Shiling my very best wishes.
Sorry to bother you.
Daning! I wondered which Mr. Luo it was.
Come in, have a drink?
I can't stay.
I must go right away.
It's that serious?
I wanted to tell you, but not over the phone.
I'm glad you're in.
I see...
It's alright then.
"A wise man never endangers himself."
But if you have any friends on the Square, tell them to pull out now.
Things are heating up.
What?
They're clearing the Square tonight.
Shit!
Young people who want a future better stay home.
Don't say any more.
I just want to tell everyone and go home and sleep.
I must go.
I forgot...
I saw your friend Lan Yu at the Square the other day.
Keeping order in the crowd, holding a lunch box.
Lan Yu?
Haven't seen him for ages.
What was he doing there?
I saw him but he didn't see me.
Must go. Take care.
At 4:30 am, on June 4...
Tired?
Not really.
How's the car?
Not bad.
You're so ungrateful!
What do you mean?
I give you this graduation present, and all you can say is "Not bad."
You must have given expensive gifts to many others before.
Is that what you think?
I really don't know, and I don't want to know.
I just know that you're good to me.
Let's change the subject.
Fine.
What's really in your mind?
Did it have to end that way?
Where are we going?
You rushed from the airport.
What for?
I want to show you something.
Turn right at the junction.
Do you like it?
You're smoking a lot lately.
Am I?
Don't worry.
Fortune tellers say
I'll have a long life.
I'm not scared.
Is the funeral organized?
Mr. Chong took care of it.
The grieving children just have to show up.
I'm afraid
I can't help you decorate.
It'll take time anyway.
How's your mother?
Seems fine, she's holding up.
All the ministers have sent wreaths.
Your family commands respect.
What good does that do?
My father was in hospital for several years.
All that's left now is a pile of bones.
The country boy has said the wrong thing again.
I feel so strange.
I suddenly thought about the day
Chairman Mao died.
When I heard the news,
I was so upset I cried.
I cried my eyes out for days.
I just couldn't stop.
But for my father,
I didn't cry.
I was so young then, but I remember everyone in the village crying.
I'd never seen my dad cry like that before.
What's the point?
Death is death.
Everything's over.
It's not really over as long as there are memories.
Let's go out to eat.
That meal just now was horrible.
OK!
Ma, it's me Lan Yu.
Why haven't I called?
I'm real busy.
I'm doing construction work...
No, in the suburbs.
Here it's not at all like home.
Five floors usually.
Ma, when are you coming to visit me?
Who said that?
How is Dad's health?
If you have time,
Mr. Chen wants to invite you to have some champagne.
Thank you, but we'll drink together in Moscow.
Yes, we'll be meeting often from now on.
Instead of drinking champagne, they'd rather go duty-free shopping for their wives.
That's what they said?
I overheard them.
I don't want to interfere with your shopping.
That's it for now.
It's been a pleasure working with you...
Ms Lin, I wish we had interpreters as pretty as you in Russia.
Thank you, I hope we can meet as business partners next time.
Sure, I'm looking forward to it.
Goodbye.
You didn't translate my last comment, did you?
Handong.
Have they gone?
What about the champagne?
What do you mean?
I'm here, and so is Ms Lin.
Ms Lin, thanks for your help in closing this deal.
Let's have champagne.
Next time, it will be dinner.
Liu Zheng, what's the name of that new French restaurant?
Don't know.
- La Vie en Rose
- What?
The one in the embassy district?
It's called "La Vie en Rose."
The cuisine is not great, but they have the best wine list in Beijing.
Does Mr. Chen like red wine too?
Excuse me.
"Does Mr. Chen like red wine too?"
Where did you find such a brilliant woman?
I won't tell you.
Was that place alright?
Very nice.
The wine was excellent, but the lamb wasn't too good.
If I'd known you wanted lamb,
I'd have chosen a hotpot restaurant.
It wasn't that clean.
I was born in the Year of the Tiger.
So I'm destined to eat lamb.
Are you calculating my age?
No, I'm not.
I know you were.
You had an indelicate thought.
You were embarrassed to admit it.
You know what I'm thinking?
Do you read minds?
With you, I seem to.
With you, I can't.
And even if I could read your mind,
I can't understand Russian.
You imagine I think in Russian?
Masculine intuition.
Women like to hid what they're thinking.
They always worry that someone will know what they're thinking.
So you think a Russian would have an unfair advantage?
Any Russians in your mind?
No, nobody there at all.
Can I apply for a tour of the site?
The application was sent to your home.
Didn't you see it?
I'm very distracted.
My aunt told me never to trust an over-meticulous man.
When can I meet this oft-quoted aunt of yours?
She never sees people.
Not even you?
Are we standing around in the cold like this just to discuss my aunt?
Shall we talk about my mother's chickens instead?
So that's it?
You've fallen for a woman and you're going to marry her.
Don't worry about the house, it's already in your name.
I'll live somewhere else.
And you'll come to visit me when you have time?
Sell it if you like, there'd be enough money to start a company.
I see... you've got everything planned.
When a man grows up, he should marry and have a child.
I've always thought so.
You know that.
I forgot.
Finished.
Don't make this harder.
I'll wash my face.
Sit next to me for a while.
Will you?
We lived here for so long, but we never sat like this before.
When I was little, I used to sit on a hill with my mother.
Homesick?
Not... I'm not thinking of anyone.
Once I saw a huge rainbow out there.
I rushed to get the camera.
By the time I came back it had gone.
Rainbows are shy, they don't like to be photographed.
Yeah, right.
You realize
I won't be sitting here waiting for you any more.
That... I guess not.
I should have... finished decorating the place sooner.
You probably won't believe this, but I really like you.
Don't make me cry.
You probably don't know it, but I really like you, too.
Why are you up so early?
Couldn't sleep.
You're so temperamental!
What do you want? Whiskey?
Are you fucking crazy?
Ladies don't like swearing.
What the fuck do you know about what women like?
I don't, you're the expert!
So you're moving out today?
You forgot! I told you before you went to Hong Kong.
You are getting married.
No point my staying here.
Getting married is no big deal!
No big deal?
Is that what you tell your wife, too?
Listen,
I'm not driving you out of this house!
Exactly.
I'm driving myself out!
That's it.
Exit singing, bags in hand.
"I'm the one who loves you most, never dare to let me down."
Be as melodramatic as you want!
Say something!
I've spent so much money on you, when will you reciprocate?
And this is the right moment to ask me to reciprocate.
Master, in what position would you like me?
Stop it.
Pull up your pants and let's talk.
There's nothing left for us to say.
That's not true.
You should take better care of yourself.
If you run a fever or get sick, go and see a doctor.
Understand?
Yes.
When it comes to money, don't trust just anyone who asks you to invest.
If you're not sure, always ask Liu Zheng.
Okay?
Yes.
We've agreed to stop seeing... each other from now on.
But you can always come to me in an emergency.
I hope you'll call me.
I never forgot what you told me when we met.
"When two people get to know each other too well,
"it's time to separate... split up."
So I kept telling myself to love you a little less.
So that the end would hurt less.
You know...
I promise myself... that in the future...
I'll never let anyone break my heart again.
Where's Handong?
On his way.
He forgot the earrings.
He has to bring them himself?
That's what I said, but he insisted.
Can you fix Mrs. Chen's hair?
I need some help with my make-up.
Have all your relatives arrived in Beijing?
My aunt's still in Shanghai waiting for her dress to be fitted.
If I'd known,
I could have recommended a tailor.
She's very old, and very fussy!
We always say she's been spoiled by all her years in Shanghai.
You're all so cheerful.
Ms Lin speaks so nicely!
Now I know why you chose her.
What did you say?
Nothing, really.
The earrings?
Madam, more powder?
When is your flight?
At seven.
Everything settled?
Handong, remind Weidong to pick me up later.
What's the rush?
Zhao is taking me to the airport, he can drop you off.
Settle what?
The studio is ready, everybody.
Nothing special.
But if you have... any unresolved emotional business please don't bring it home with you.
How can you go abroad now?
Just to Hong Kong.
Emotional business?
Your imagination is running wild.
Not imagination, female intuition.
Handong, you can't fool me.
We're both adults.
Everyone has a past.
I thought being with Jingping could make me forget about you.
I thought I was a man who could make a woman happy.
Yes, I'm at the airport, just got here.
What? I know that.
What's the point of saying that?
We'll have to cut our price anyway.
We're fucked!
We'll make a huge loss.
Just sell them as soon as possible!
Lan Yu
I'll call you back later.
I'll catch up with you.
I'll be in the car.
Didn't expect to run into you here.
Just seeing off my boss.
How's work?
So much construction, architects must be in demand.
Alright.
No, really?
Your friend?
A workmate.
You never wear enough.
Aren't you cold?
It's alright, I'm fine.
Are you free?
I must go back to the office.
Me too.
How about dinner tonight?
- I know a new...
- I have a date.
Well, maybe another day?
I'll be busy for several months.
You still have to eat.
Take-away is okay.
I have to go now, my colleague is waiting.
Sorry, I forgot.
Bye.
How can I contact you?
I'll call you.
Dinner's almost ready.
Fine.
Here's the ashtray.
Sorry, the air conditioning's broken.
I haven't had it fixed.
Never mind, it's got hot suddenly.
I shouldn't have asked you here to suffer!
It's fine.
Thanks for inviting me.
I haven't had home cooking in ages.
When I had a wife, we always ate out.
After my divorce, I still eat out.
Was it hard finding this place?
Not really.
Are you going travelling in your holidays?
I'm saving money.
To get married?
I'm not like you, always thinking of a wife and kids.
I plan to study in the US.
America?
Eat while it's hot.
When are you leaving?
I don't know yet.
The passport and visa are a hassle.
So do you have a new boyfriend?
Yes.
Are you going to introduce him?
No, he's too shy.
That smells so good, is it curry?
He's been abroad for a while.
What line of work is he in?
He's a student.
How did you meet?
Don't just talk about me.
What about you?
What about me?
You got divorced? When?
Did you buy this place?
Or do you rent it?
The Japanese boss owns it, so the rent is low.
There's a yard out back.
I plant flowers there.
You still like flowers?
Remember when you filled our room with flowers on my birthday?
It brought on my hay fever and we had to throw them out.
Really?
Yeah, you're right.
Seems you've forgotten everything.
You even forgot my office number.
Some things, it's better to forget.
Is there any more beer?
Don't drink so much.
You have to drive later.
I wrecked my car the other day,
I came by taxi.
I was destined to have a bad year, and damned if it wasn't true!
At least you weren't hurt.
Young man, you've matured!
Young man? I'm nearly 28.
Already?
It's you?
Wake up, I have to go to bed.
Shall I call a taxi?
You still use that shampoo?
Yes.
I'd love to hold you.
You've put on weight!
Whatever made me let you go?
Get up. Time to go to work.
Morning.
I want to sleep a bit longer.
Aren't you meeting a client today?
Yes.
Damn it, why didn't you wake me earlier?
Almost winter, and you never got your air conditioner fixed?
Who?
The president of the bank's been arrested?
That was quick!
Let's talk later.
Who rang so early?
Never mind.
See you.
What?
Nothing. Take care.
Silly guy.
What now?
I'll be busy the next few days.
Okay, call me when you're free.
Okay.
Bon appetite.
- Have you had your breakfast?
- You've come back.
Yes...
Can we get the pay?
Yes, it's all done.
Don't worry.
I'll stay here with Handong a bit longer.
You put the kid to bed first.
Have a drink.
Shiling knows already?
I told her.
What did she say?
Like birds, couples fly apart when disaster strikes.
Then she asked where I would fly to.
I heard her crying in the bathroom.
You're just an employee here.
If they charge us with bribery, smuggling or illegal fund-raising, they'll only come after me.
Tell Shiling not to worry too much.
She's not only worrying about me.
If the police close us down, you'll have to make a statement.
Ask Shiling to write it for you.
Nobody can read your writing!
It's not that bad!
They'll issue my arrest warrant in the next day or two.
I'm still working on getting it delayed.
When I'm inside, everything will depend on you.
What's so urgent?
Inside, there's a passport for you.
And guarantees from local and American banks.
You still have the acceptance letter from the college?
What's this?
A business card.
The woman in charge of issuing visas.
She'll help you.
What is all this?
Who says I'm going to America?
I do!
Haven't you always wanted to study in the States?
I don't get it, is this why you wanted me to rush over here?
Make sure it's all settled tomorrow, okay?
I won't be able to see you off.
Tell me, has something bad... happened to you?
When you get there, if you have time send me a postcard.
Is Chen Handong here?
Yes, he's in.
Do you have an appointment?
We're from the
Public Security Bureau.
He's with an important guest.
Please wait
We're here on a very important matter.
I'm the accountant here, wait one moment.
I don't want Daning implicated.
Don't worry,
I signed in as relatives, not business partners.
Do you have to make a statement?
Let's not go into that.
Hong, give him the update.
The company accounts are frozen, pending investigation.
So the company has ceased to function.
Fuck!
But they don't have enough proof of any crime.
If the company has ceased to function, it's all over.
There's still a chance.
Can't get me out without cash.
We've found a way, but it costs three million.
Who arranged it?
Can you trust them?
Come in.
Wait here.
Don't ask.
I don't know anyway.
Where can he find three million in cash?
Liu Zheng mortgaged his house, but we were still way short.
Then Lan Yu heard about it.
He came over the next day with all the cash we needed.
Lan Yu?
Didn't he go to the States?
You were facing the death penalty!
How could he just leave for the States without a thought?
Where did he get so much money?
He sold the villa you gave him.
And added his own savings.
Money can be earned back, but we have only one life.
- Be quick...
- There's a lot of meat.
Come on, let's toast!
Why are you drinking beer?
I always do!
Finish that and have some of this!
Hold on...
Careful! I'm surprised that you're such a good cook!
Bring over more tofu,
- will you?
- OK.
It's better chilled.
Tofu?
Didn't I put it in the fridge?
I'll get it.
I thought we brought a lot.
You sure did.
Enough to last us all week.
If you and Handong can't...
I'll send Daning over to help, he's a big eater.
Why aren't you eating?
I'll take the tofu in.
Go back. Why stand here?
You must have starved inside.
Go and eat!
Okay, let's go!
I haven't played for long time.
- You're too bad.
- You just want to drink.
Come on...
Let's drink a little bit first.
Going anywhere for the winter holiday?
I'll be working.
A new construction site. You?
Shiling wants to take our child to watch the sunrise over Mount Huangshan.
Good idea, we went there just after we married.
You two should go there too.
Him?
He doesn't have time to go!
Do you want drink too?
What? I won, save it for yourself.
How long since we played drinking games?
When did I play with you?
She's right!
- You drink!
- You're right. Okay, I'll have this.
Handong, we haven't played for ages!
- Shall we play?
- Okay!
Keep pouring!
You lose again.
Come on, Lan Yu,
I haven't played you yet.
Let's eat first, you can teach me later.
Okay, let's eat.
I almost forgot.
We haven't toasted Handong.
To Handong...
The black cloud has gone!
Thank you!
Cheers!
Let me play with you.
Getting up so early?
I was thirsty.
It's so cold.
Did I keep you from sleeping well?
Not at all.
I keep thinking
I've turned your life upside down.
By moving in here.
Would it be better if I moved out?
You've lost a button.
Are you saying this place is too small?
It's fine for one person, but with me here...
It's too small for you?
How big are you?
Well, I'm older than you, and every part of me is bigger.
Really?
I don't think so.
What are you doing?
Seeing how big it is.
It's getting bigger!
What shall we do?
I'll tell you.
Is something wrong with me?
How come I like you so much?
The days when I was in jail made me realize something...
That you and I are destined for each other, to my great joy.
It seems like a dream to be back here.
What's up?
You usually don't behave like this.
I don't know why, my mind's in turmoil today.
Maybe you've seen what's in the accounts.
You've seen them?
The capital to be refunded, after deducting taxes and penalties and lawyers' fees, which are still being calculated...
Will be virtually nothing!
Not that bad, anyway enough for us to start again.
I was so worried that you'd quit after all this.
You won't get rid of me so easily.
I need to use the toilet, are you going too?
No.
Yes.
You know what?
Beijing is the same now as it was then.
Construction everywhere.
Buildings up and down.
Whenever I pass the site where you had the accident, I stop.
But my mind is at peace, because I feel you never really left.
Everyday I miss you so.
But I'm lonely and you don't know.
When will my beautiful dream come true?
My darling I wish to see you.
Autumn's come, the wind's blowing on my face.
I remember our past when we were in the autumn days.
What are you thinking?
Why did you leave me alone?
You are the only one I love.
How could you leave me in sorrow?
When I needed you most,
You left me silently.
You are the only one I love.
How could you leave me in sorrow?
I've been so good to you,
But you've never been moved.
Everyday I miss you so.
But I'm lonely and you don't know.
When will my beautiful dream come true?
My darling I wish to see you.
Autumn's come, the wind's blowing on my face.
I remember our past when we were in the autumn days.
What are you thinking?
Why did you leave me alone?
You are the only one I love.
How could you leave me in sorrow?
When I needed you most,
You left me silently.
You are the only one I love.
How could you leave me in sorrow?
I've been so good to you,
But you've never been moved.
Everyday I miss you so.
But I'm lonely and you don't know.
When will my beautiful dream come true?
My darling I wish to see you.
Autumn's come, the wind's blowing on my face.
I remember our past when we were in the autumn days.
"THE THREE MARIAS"
Run, kid.
- Run, kid!
- Joao Capadocio... can you hear me, damn you?
I know you're in there, damn you.
If you don't come out...
I will kill those out here with me, one by one.
I'll fire off three rounds into the air... and on the fourth, the killing begins.
Mom!
I'll kill the lot if I have to.
When I've finished killing them all...
I'll come in there and finish you off.
You'd better give yourself in.
Arcanjo, go ahead.
Come here, damn you, right out into the middle of the street.
I'm coming, can't you see?
Are you ready to die?
This bravery of yours isn't it just hearsay?
- You'll fall.
- Today you're the one who'll die.
Tranquilo, don't worry, your time will come.
Yours has come first.
I've already killed your father and brother.
One day, sooner or later, you'll be sent off to town feet first.
You'll fall.
Kneel, start praying.
I only kneel down at the altar.
You might even get to heaven, such a good little boy.
Welcome, friend. What favorable winds bring you here?
Not favorable winds this time.
Bad ones have forced me here.
This journey's the last thing I could wish to undertake. But such is life.
What are you talking about?
I can't beat about the bush, so I'll come straight to the point.
- Do so, then.
- I ask you to forgive me... for bearing bad tidings.
Please be seated, for what I have to say to you cannot be heard standing.
- Speak, now, for the love of God.
- A tragedy has befallen us.
Your husband and sons have been killed.
I shall not tell you how they died, for it was too brutal.
And the suffering would only be made greater.
So, I beg you to spare me that task.
Do not spare my pain... hide nothing from me.
I'd like to thank you for bringing me such news in person.
I'd like to ask another favor of you, if it is not too much.
Ask, madam, I'd do anything to relieve your pain.
My three daughters need me to be with them... but I cannot go now.
I would like you to tell them my wishes.
First, say that I shall be absent at the wake.
I will explain why later, when I see them.
Second... have them lay out the bodies all night... for all to see the tragedy... the terrible misfortune which has befallen us.
Have them receive condolences... but without despair.
None of them may weep.
I want mourning, not tears.
I want pain, not a flood.
Certainly, madam.
And last, arrange for the bodies to be fetched at eleven.
The cortege will go without me... but do not bury the bodies before my arrival.
Now take this message to my daughters... tell them that until then
I do not wish to see anyone.
Adieu, father... adieu, Joao... adieu, Emiliano.
May the angels light your paths.
We are left with pain... sorrow... the loss of our dears.
Where there is hate
May I bring love
Where there is offense
May I bring forgiveness
Where there is disagreement
May I bring union
Where there is doubt
May I bring faith
Where there is error
May I bring truth
Where there is despair
May I bring hope
Where there is sadness
May I bring joy
Where there is darkness
May I bring light o Master
Make me want more
To comfort
Than being comforted
To understand
Than being understood
To love
Than being loved
My daughters... you must be asking yourselves why you haven't seen me weep up to now.
The answer is simple.
You should never feed pain without first giving sustenance to hatred.
Pay attention to what I say:
No one will weep here.
Sadness is patient.
It waits.
I am quite certain that your father and brothers will not rest in peace... as long as the seeds of evil aren't crushed.
Since they left,
I have not slept... nor dreamt...
I just think of what to do to those dreadful beasts.
We must be worse than them.
While I see to the legal side of things... each of you... will go looking for a hitman.
Maria Francisca... my oldest daughter... go and find the killer
Ze das Cobras.
Do everything you can to conquer him.
And if that is not enough... do more than you can.
Maria Rosa... who is the flower of this house... find and meet a policeman called Chief Tenorio.
It will be difficult... but have faith... and do the miracle of convincing him.
And Maria Pia... my youngest... go very carefully in search... of the worst of all... one Jesuino Cruz... better known as the Devil's Horse.
Each of them will bring me a head.
I want them in front of me.
Only at that moment will this war end.
And why don't we kill them... ourselves?
Because we have a destiny in life.
And yours... is not to kill.
Do everything you can to conquer him.
And if that is not enough, do more than you can.
Good morning.
Looking for somewhere to stay?
There's a place near here, clean, good and cheap. And no whores.
All right, but first
I must find someone.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Do you by any chance know a man called Ze das Cobras?
Ze das Cobras is that man sitting eating at that table in the back.
But you might as well know:
He doesn't speak to women.
How come?
Ever since he read in the Bible the story of Adam and Eve... he's been thinking about snakes... and to this day has a thing about women.
Things got worse after his mother died. He never spoke to a woman.
- But I must speak to him.
- Well, if you insist...
I advise you to do so through him.
That 's Catrevagem.
Thank you.
Did you hear what the man said?
Let 's go and talk to him.
Afterwards I'll pay you.
Speak to him.
Tell him:
Ze das Cobras, destiny has brought me here.
I've come because of your services.
Speak to him. Tell him: Ze das
Cobras, destiny has brought me here.
I've come because of your services.
Can you hear me?
I said, can you hear me?
Why won't you speak to me?
- Tell her to sit down.
- He said for you to sit down.
You remain standing.
- Ask her if she wants to eat.
- He asked whether you want to eat.
Tell him I'm only hungry for revenge, that 's why I am here.
My father and my two brothers were killed by the Santos Guerra.
My father was hanged by his own guts.
My older brother was burned to death... and the youngest one, they took out his eyes and heart.
Tell her... that if Eve betrayed Adam because the serpent told her to... why should I trust her?
I don't know.
- Go on, Catrevagem.
- I didn't understand a word.
Tell her it 's no use looking at me like that, I'm not giving in.
He said it 's no use you're looking at him like that, he'll not give in.
Tell her I'll do the job.
Ask her what she'll pay me for it.
- I only take cash.
- She heard everything.
I'm not saying anything else before
I eat a mouthful of roast snake.
Well if you won't talk to her, nor will I.
And when I close my mouth I don't open it again. Not even for a snake.
You're to say everything we say.
Repeat what he said or you'll die.
Let go, I'll talk.
He said that he agrees to do the job and you have to pay cash.
- That wasn't all.
- I've forgotten the rest.
So... the deal's off.
You fool, he said:
"I need money.
Tell her I'll do the job.
Ask her what she'll pay me for it.
And it has to be cash." Say it.
He said he needs money.
He'll do the job.
He wants to know how much you'll pay for it.
And it has to be cash.
Arcanjo.
The angel of death.
It will be difficult... but have faith... and do the miracle of convincing him.
POLICE STATION
Good afternoon, I wish to speak to Chief Tenorio.
He's out hunting Azedo, a dog which has gone mad and is attacking folks.
No one sees him, the animal hides like a secret.
If you'd like to tell me what it 's about...
But if it 's a private matter, then wait for the Chief.
You can sit over there on the bench.
Thank you.
You can go. Next.
I had a basket of beans on my head.
When I saw it, the beast was tailing me. I ran, he chased me.
I skidded and slipped on the ground.
I was resting when I heard screams.
I thought: "What the hell is that?"
Someone's got to take care of that beast.
Go very carefully in search... of the worst of all... one Jesuino Cruz, better known as the Devil's horse.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- I'm a relation of Jesuino Cruz.
- And what do you want?
Jesuino's mother is dying. She'd like to see her son one last time...
...even if it were just in a photo.
- So?
If you'll let me, I'd like to take his picture to take to her.
Wait here a minute.
You can come in.
Take the lady to the inspection room.
Take the pants off.
And the panties.
Now open your legs.
Go down three times.
- Horse?
- Who is it?
It 's about time you got a visitor.
Go on in.
- Who awaits me out there?
- My name is Maria Pia.
And what is it you want?
I want you to kill a man for me.
You go straight to the point.
Put your hands up.
Only speak to me in this way.
I have no weapons or anything.
I only came to hire you.
What 's in it for me?
I get you out of here.
I am God's Vulture.
I'm the Devil's Horse.
I relieve God of carrion, and give the devil something to eat.
Those I kill...
I cut in half... split in two, so that there is no arguing between Satan and Jehovah.
I want the head of a man.
You can do whatever you like with the body.
Young lady... to get out of here,
I'd do anything.
You just tell me your problem and I'll solve it... because as far as I'm concerned all men are fit to die.
- What do you need?
- Money.
Just say how much you want, and I'll bring it to you.
Visiting hours are up.
Did you take a picture of the ugly beast, then?
- It 's over.
- No... it 's not over.
A love like ours is never over.
Everything ends.
No.
Every child you had by that man... was like a stab in my back.
Filo!
Father?
What 's it, father?
Don't think that all Filo is doing is mourning for the dead.
I've known her for a very long time. We must be cautious.
Very cautious.
Never.
Never.
I'll never forget that woman, even if she dies.
Never.
BOARDING HOUSE
That 's it!
That 's it, folks.
Catrevagem, tell her I'm leaving.
Tomorrow morning I'll wait for you.
I have good news for you.
Go call the folks.
Go, Zezinho.
Call your mom.
- It 's Azedo, folks.
- Chief... if you have the strength to face Azedo... kill the Angel of death.
- What Angel you want me to kill?
- Arcanjo, who killed my family.
Calm down.
Calm down and wait inside for me.
Now I must explain everything to these folks.
I've been hunting that mad dog for a week... and I'll not hunt him a day longer, for the animal is dead.
I killed Azedo.
Lady, get up, for I've never been a saint.
I'm a sinner who drinks liquor, suffers, loves, and even kills.
- You needn't do this. Get up.
- The man who killed my family.
His name is Arcanjo Santos Guerra.
Listen.
If I were to do that which you ask...
I would be destroying the law which
I spent my whole life defending.
To this day I've only killed within the law.
What I ask of you may be against the law of men.
But not against the law of God.
And it is He who will judge us all.
What I ask of you is to repair a wrongdoing.
The only thing which can save my family is a miracle.
Miracles are not done by men, but by saints.
Only a man with his own sense of justice... and therefore beyond good and evil... can act, not as a man, but as a saint.
No men are left in our family.
But courage remains.
Courage for anything, and that includes asking you such a thing.
- But what you're asking...
- What I ask... is for you to be a saint and grant a miracle:
The death of Arcanjo
Santos Guerra.
Let 's get out of here.
I'm very tired, I need to sleep.
- And what about Arcanjo?
- Tomorrow.
I'll decide tomorrow.
- You've a place to stay tonight?
- I have nowhere to go.
A few days ago,
I was bitten by Azedo.
I received no treatment.
I know the worst is to come.
Azedo's sickness is nothing other than death itself.
I will wash your body with water and soap, you will get better.
Don't worry about me.
The worst pain has passed.
Easy. Easy, Chief.
Easy. It 'll pass.
- Where does it hurt? Keep calm.
- Here.
Azedo did that with his teeth.
Keep calm. Keep calm.
It 'll help you.
"And the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people... and much people of Israel died.
And Moses made a serpent of brass, put it upon a pole... and if any man had been bit, when he saw the serpent of brass, he lived."
That which kills also cures.
Salvation and perdition.
The woman and the snake are blood relations.
"Having been the cleverest of all the animals... and having seduced Eva's virginal chastity... he was filled with the desire for bestial coitus... and all impudence and all mankind's prostitution."
What did you say? That 's simply not true. Catrevagem... run and tell him he can't do such a thing to a woman.
If he abandons me, it will be the end of me.
Jesuino has toothache.
He'll go to town to see a dentist who looks after the prisoners here.
It 'll cost two thousand reais.
Paid in advance.
I'll leave you another thousand reais as a tip.
Now take me to the Devil's Horse.
What happened?
Why do you turn your back on me?
Life is not straight.
It is full of crossroads.
Every man is divided.
One day his face, another his back.
And one or the other is what he shows.
- Never both at the same time.
- All right... but if you want to save all of you, not just half, pay attention.
Soon the men will take you to the dentist.
Everything has been arranged.
Here is the photo of the man you must kill.
Bring me his head.
The rest you can cut in half or do whatever you want with.
I'll watch you for a while... in order to feel the anger filling up inside me.
When it is big enough...
I want to feel it devour my heart.
Catrevagem, can I ask you a dumb question?
But of course, Ze.
Know anyone dumber than me?
- Do you know how to talk to women?
- Yes, I do.
Will you teach me?
If you give me a snakeskin coat.
What the hell do you want a snakeskin coat for?
And what do you want to talk to women for?
If I ask you something curious, will you get angry with me?
Fire away with your question.
Tell the girl, Catrevagem...
Catrevagem.
Say not to bother laying any traps.
Ask, Catrevagem, whether he ate all those snakes...
...with flour and with liquor?
- Was it with liquor?
One by one, I ate them, and all of them with liquor.
The mixture enters the bloodstream and kills off any fear there is.
A man who does this has no fear at all.
Rattlesnake with Caprichosa, good liquor from Minas.
Jararaca with Marimbondo, from Paraiba.
Anaconda with Pitu, from here in Pernambuco.
Grass-snake with Mare Alta, from Rio de Janeiro.
I even lost count of how many snakes and liquor I've had.
I've got a strong nerve.
I'm not even scared of the Devil, nor the wild beast, or anything.
After I've had a coral snake with
Nega Fulo, the Devil's scared of me.
There is where the coward who killed my father lives.
The bedroom on the right is the condemned man's.
Catrevagem, tell her to wait here.
Bite the bastard.
Inject all your venom into his blood.
Send him to hell.
Go on, beauty.
Where's the girl?
Disappeared.
You see, Catrevagem?
That 's why I don't trust women.
Let 's go. I have to deliver this parcel for her.
This is the last killing
I do for money.
Easy.
Did you know... cats lick their own wounds?
And that their saliva... has some sort of... antibiotic?
Catrevagem, tell her:
Here is the job your daughter Maria
Francisca asked to deliver to you.
It 's delivered, now you must pretend you never saw me before.
Here is the job your daughter
Maria Francisca asked...
You need say no more.
The delivery is made.
You may go.
This isn't Firmino.
They killed the wrong man, my God.
Firmino is alive.
The bastard is alive.
Filo...
I'm a widower now.
Stay with me, come on.
Firmino, I have nothing to do with your life anymore... nor you with mine.
Say you're mine, say it.
What we felt towards each other was a long time ago.
It 's over.
It 's been over for 3O years.
My God!
Where is my daughter, my God?
Where is my daughter, my God?
Where are my daughters?
"Man... that is born of a woman... is of few days, and full of trouble."
Job...
14, first verse.
Do you know why
I've come to kill you?
I know.
But dying is not something
I'm afraid of.
I've killed,
I've seen death... and I know how much it costs.
- How would you like to die?
- Man... with two bullets in the head, so as not to feel anything.
Do you think you deserve such a death?
I'll do with you... what I've been doing recently.
If it 's heads...
I'll kill you.
Tails... you can go.
Every man has his price.
I'll pay ten times what you've been paid... to let me go.
Destiny makes mistakes sometimes.
Only me... you...
God... and the Devil... saw the mistake.
Look!
It wasn't heads.
It was tails.
She's been like that ever since she received a package... brought by two strange men.
Misfortune never hits just once.
Mother.
My daughter.
Mother!
Firmino is alive.
I don't believe it.
They killed the wrong man.
Oh, my God!
And Francisca?
No one knows where she is.
I think Francisca is dead.
Maria Francisca.
My daughter.
What happened?
Miss.
Miss. Wake up.
Wake up, because Azedo's rabies is eating me up.
Destiny's been keeping this for us.
I killed the dog with one like that.
Take it.
It 's yours.
I don't know how to use that.
Yes, you do.
Take it.
Find the Angel of Death.
Teach him to die.
With a knife like this one, you don't need my help.
It kills silently... and when it goes in there is no remedy.
Look!
It wasn't heads.
It was tails.
"Man is consumed by his own rotten core... as a garment eaten by a moth."
- Job.
- 13, 28th verse.
Take the coin and do it again.
If it 's heads...
I'll kill you both.
If it 's tails...
Catrevagem.
Tell her to wait here.
Catrevagem, don't say anything.
- Nice house, Firmino.
- Thank you, Senator. Come in.
- Do you want a drink?
- Firmino, I must sleep.
I'm dead tired and have an early start tomorrow.
The trip was hard.
You can have my bedroom.
Of course. Yes, it 's the best in the house.
There's really no need.
It 's not every day one has a Senator to stay.
This way, please.
Here. Make yourself at home,
Senator. Good night.
Good night.
Go on, beauty.
Senator, is everything all right?
Is anything wrong in there?
Arcanjo. Tranquilo.
Arcanjo... Tranquilo...
Get me out of this house!
Where are my henchmen?
Where are my dogs? My dogs!
Filo!
Is it you, my little Filo?
I knew you'd be a long time... but that you'd come.
I know.
You always wanted me.
My darling.
I have waited...
I have waited my whole life for this day.
We have a destiny in life.
And yours is not to kill.
The sentence was accomplished.
Our dead were revenged.
An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.
But the way things happened... escaped my control.
Destiny cheated me.
I know for sure that none of us will ever forget what happened... but our pain... must be consumed in the deepest silence.
THE DOG TRICK
Simon here.
Oh, is that the time?
I'm on my way. I'm just going to watch... I mean, get dressed.
I've just had a shower.
But I am coming!
Right. See you.
Wrtten and directed by
Christian Eklöw & Christopher Panov
Why can't he let it go...
But maybe they'll recognize him.
Recognize who?
It's been about five years!
- Two years.
- OK. Two years since he was in...
Robinson Survivors.
It's me - Survivor-Micke.
- Hey... I'm a star.
- I haven't got time.
I realize this is a stressed scene for you...
A couple of friends from out of town, who haven't done Stockholm...
Famous or not, everyone queues here.
Go to the back.
- But...
- To the back! Now!
Did it do the trick?
No. It makes no odds, famous or not.
Everyone has to queue.
No shit!
- How's things?
- Great.
- Lot of people this evening...
- Shit!
I thought he'd broken my neck.
The frigging idiot!
- When you called him 'Belgian Blue?'
- Whose side are you on?
- Simon, you're on my side, eh?
- Well, I feel...
See? Simon's on my side.
Mario here.
Hi, sweetheart.
I'm at some dump with Simon and Robinson-Micke.
Love you too. Kisses. Bye.
How long have you two been going steady?
- Three years.
- Three?
Bloody hell.
- Still in love?
- You bet we are.
Hey, Mario.
Same chick for three years.
- Problems?
- Not that again!
Simon, come by work tomorrow.
I'll buy you lunch.
- Bye. Say hi to Sanna.
- See you, Micke!
Right, Mum's gone.
Now for some booze.
- I'm tired...
- One more beer, Simon.
Simon here.
What d'you fucking think!
I'm getting the beers.
Four?
You're insane!
I'm nearly unbeatable at survival.
- How long since Big Brother?
- You mean Survivor. Since Survivor.
- It wasn't kid's stuff like Brother is.
- I meant Survivor.
A year or two back.
- Were you in the papers?
- Quite a bit, for a while.
Were you?
As a star you've got to watch your intrepidy.
Too much media can make you a 2nd class star.
You've got to stay on top...
...if you see what I mean.
- Yes!
- Can we see your Survivor tapes?
- Watch some?
Of course you can watch Survivor!
Micke, please. We've seen it so many times. Not again.
Well... no.
Forget it, then.
It tickled...
I'd better leave. I've got to go to workin the morning.
- I enjoyed meeting you.
- Yeah, me too.
Bye, then...
Bye, Emma.
Listen... lf you want to watch it
I can put it on.
- If you want to.
- I couldn't give a damn.
But if you want to...
No. Okay.
- Simon! Was it you?
- Eh?
- Must you?!
- Ooh, Roblnson!
Just a quickl ook, then.
- Right, I'm off out. Have a good time.
- Thanks. See you.
Welcome to the first new episode of Survivor.
You viewers will know...
He's absolutely gorgeous.
I mean, he's much better than the new guy.
- I'll tell you something about him...
- That's you!
You bet.
So you're rearing to go.
And your single possession is:
A condom.
So cool!
But if you want to roll round in the sand more than once?
Easy-I'll recycle it!
"Recycle! Recycle..."
Did you see that? Oy!
Jesus!
...a winner. In this year's
Survivor series there's a new game... lf it hadn't been for that bastard...
Let's say it's gonna be muddy.
- Watch Sports Newslastnight?
- No... I was out.
Hammarby could well move up.
- I'll be getting tickets.
- That won't be easy.
But you can always get hold of some.
So Micke got the usual going after the party, did he?
Yeah.
A bit of heavy kissing?
Yeah.
Rather, not me.
But Micke got the heavies.
The chick Iw as with was a bit... shy.
She was shy?
Well, it was me that was.
Christ, you know what I'm like!
- I'm like a...
- You needn't get angry with me!
Honestly, Simon...
...Iove- "the Hollywood life," as you call it- can't be found in a bar.
You're hardly going to find someone any old how.
But you don't have to go chasing disco chicks with Micke.
I'm sick of being single.
I want to meet someone, fall in love.
Sooner or later you'Il find someone.
Look at me.
The local grocery, three years ago.
- You forgot your ketchup.
- And?
Otherwise you'd never have met Sanna.
- Coincidence... It happens.
- But all this waiting!
Did he put Survivor on?
Staff to dell counter, please...
Hi.
- Hi there!
- Hi.
I've only got a little ketchup and stuff. Could I go first?
- Go ahead.
- Really kind of you.
I... think I forgot my ketchup.
Have you taken it?
Eh?
- My ketchup, you haven't got it?
- Ask him.
Hey, your ketchup!
- In your bag maybe?
- It's at the check-out!
When were you last really in love with someone?
Let me tell you about "love."
Chicks... they can fall in love.
But guys can't.
Lay off.
I really want to fall in love.
I've never had a real relationship.
I want someone to share everything with, all the fun, all the rough going.
- Just like Mario.
- It's an illusion.
You were in love with Bella.
You and Mario know what love is...
I wasn't in love with her. I wasn't!
I was too young to know any better.
- Sure...
- Today I know better.
We both know it's just not true.
You just say that because you got so dumped!
Look at me, how I'm hung!
I can have any girl I want.
It was a stupid teenage love affair!
You were stunned for two years by a "stupid teenage love affair."
Know what your problem is?
You're in love with love.
- See?
- At least I'm in love with something.
- Yippee!
- Good. That takes care of that.
- Let me thrash you at Tekken.
- I've gotto go...
- I've got a French lecture at 8 a.m.
- Shit...
- Could you lend me my bus fare?
- In my jacket.
- Thanks for the pizza.
- Okay. See you.
- Teenage love affair...
- Have you found my wallet?
Thanks. See you.
Oh, shit! Hi there, Micke!
- You're upset...
- I'm sorry!
...but this isn't what you think.
- Shut up, Pontus!
Micke...
Let's get started:
Sweden v. Yugoslavia. You're gonna get good 'n'thrashed, Mario!
- Remember last time?
- I've deleted that from my memory!
- Hiya.
- Hiya.
- Have you already started?
- No.
- You're Brazil?
- Of course.
Why are your pants down?
- Ask Mario.
- Get your pants off!
- Sorry?
- Did you come on the Tube?
- Yes?
- Get your pants off, then!
What d'you mean?
How many junkies used your seat before you did?
The filth they leave gets sucked up into your pants...
- "Sucked up!"
- And then dumped in my new sofa.
Get'em off!
- I'm serious. Get them off!
- You're sick. You need help.
- Please remove your pants!
- No.
- Let's skip the rest.
- It's the final...
Let's go out and have a beer and then see.
I said I was going to rent a video.
Lay off.
- Simon... Sippy?
- Quit it.
- One beer!
- Quit it!
Fuck! What is it?! No,
I'm not coming. I've got reading to do.
- Goal!
- Re-run! That wasn't fair!
- You needn't get so worked up.
- Don't interrupt, then!
I won't bother talking to you again, then, ever.
- Hi, guys!
- Hi, Sanna.
- Hello.
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi, Simon.
- Mmm.
- What's the score?
- It'll soon be 6-0.
- And... Are you watching? There!
- For Christ's goddam sake!
So frigging bad.
That's enough humiliation for one day.
- Hi, Sanna! - I'm off home.
See you tomorrow.
- Hungry, sweetheart?
- Abit. Shall we make some food?
- How about you?
- No thanks.
Erik Jansson?
- Here.
- That's you then, loud and clear.
Giorgos Astrapopolis?
There!
Dad's a cop, is he?
I mean 'police'-
'Astropo-police'...
Emma Larsson.
- Emma Larsson?
- Here I am.
Simon Svensson.
Simon Svensson?
No? Svensson's a deserter.
- Cross him out, then.
- Here!
You didn't hear me call your name twice?
- But...
- Or at least once?
Perhaps you think I mumble.
Perhaps all the others just guessed I'd said their names.
I doubt it.
D-a-n-i-e-l K-a-r-l-s-s-o-n.
K A R L S S O N.
Hi, Micke. It's Simon.
Guess who's at my French course.
Emma!
No kidding!
So what happened?
- Micke.
- Unbelievable!
Micke, lend a frigging hand!
I've gotto go.
Mario called.
We're playing a TV-game at eight.
- Okay?
- Micke! Shit!
See you.
- You can certainly talk on the phone.
- I'm sorry...
...that mymum's in emergency.
Forgive me, if I'm a bit worried about her health.
Hi.
I feel so frigging afwul.
What's happened?
- I've got such a hell of a problem.
- Come in...
I'd rather stay put. Such a terrible problem because I can't...
...make my mind up as to which of these wonderful girls I want.
- Feel at home.
- No, Micke...
Don't spoil it all now.
The redhead's got a wicked crush on you.
Got any beers?
Little sis been watching a tear jerker?
Go easy on Simon.
He's never been in love-
- so he escapes into Hollywood movies.
- No picture in my wallet...
- Don't mumble!
At least I don't have a picture of my only, old love in my wallet.
Have you been snooping in my wallet?
Shit-face.
You call... just to hear her on the answering machine...
He got out of bed on the wrong side.
We're off. The party's over.
I'm sick of you always moaning.
- Always?
- Yes, always.
Always belly aching: "Look at Mario...
I wantto be really in love."
Snap out of it!
How can you meet a girl if you're home watching Pretty Woman?
Right, girls! We're off.
- Simon. I've got this great thing.
- What thing?
I'm talking to Simon.
Simon!
- Don't walk across...!
- I'm only going to say it once.
- Say it, then!
- Right!
This friend of mine has had a girl problem like yours.
But now he's got so many girls, he can't make his mind up.
- Do you know why?
- Please. I'm bursting to know.
- Okay... The dogtrick.
- What?
The dogtrick:
Buy a nice pup.
Walk it in the park and the girls'll all be hanging round your neck.
You mean he's got to buy a dog?
Or borrow a damn dog.
Who cares whose the thing is.
It's fresh, solid girls - none of your disco chick types.
And how would you know,
Mr. Expert?
Dogs bring out the mother in women.
They see you patting the dog-
- and think: "He'll be sweet to our children, too, if we have any."
You really believe it works?
It's absolutely nuts.
I don't care.
It says so in 'IIlusionated Science.'
Professors have written articles and proved it.
- And it worked for your mate?
- His wedding's in a month.
- Oh, that guy with all the girls?
- No. That was Jonas.
- Has it worked for lots of people?
- For everyone! It can't fail.
- Even for you, Simon.
- Why not try it yourself, then?
You know I don't want the cozy suburban life.
- Right.
- I pick up chicks at bars instead.
Gotcha!
Luck.
Hey... Sanna's sister's just got a dog.
- You are kidding, aren't you?
- Of course I'm kidding.
- What a lovely little dog!
- Isn't it.
- And where are you going?
- To the vet.
Is he not well?
He's going to be run down...
I mean put down.
Oh! Whatever for?
He's a schizophrenic. He thinks he's a cat, scratches and meaows. Listen!
- Poor thing!
- It's terrible.
- Oh, no! He's having one of his fits.
- Get him away from me!
Run for it! Or he'll bite you!
He's attacking! Run, lady!
Let's go.
- Sorry!
- It's quite all right.
- What a sweet dog!
- Dachshund. It's a dachshund.
Hi. - What it's name?
Fido.
- He seems to like you.
- Yes...
- Love at first sight.
- Yes. Really.
I'm Simon.
Hi. Maria..."Mia."
- Are you going that way?
- What? Yes! I am.
Good. We can walk together.
- Do you live round here?
- No...
Well, yes... not too far off.
- How old's...
I meant the dog.
- Oh... er... It's 25 - dog years.
- The same as you, then.
Yes. Same as me!
Unbelievable! Everything was great between us- it all came together.
- Okay! Didn't think it'd work, Micke.
- My ideas always do.
- When's your next date, then?
- Dunno. I can't call her.
- Don't you dare?
- No. I mean yes...
We never swapped phone numbers.
- What did you say?
- It's so stupid...
...we talked for hours and then...
You meet your dream girl and you don't swap numbers! You're nuts!
I come along, I put the ball on the spot and Itie your boot laces-
- but how do you thank me?
By shooting over the bar!
- You're worse than the Yellows!
- Oh thanks. I feel much better now!
Worse than the Yellows
Worse than the Black 'n' Yellows
Mia.
Mia... Wait!
Hell! Mia, wait!
Get a move on!
- To Odenplan...
- No pets.
- He's ill. We're in a hurry!
- No pets in the cab.
Wait!
- Come on!
Wait there. Don't go away.
- Drive towards Odenplan. Hurry!
- What address?
Listen... that bus has got the girl of my dreams in it. Okay?
I might never see her again.
So, foot down!
Just like in the movies!
Right, we'll tail them like Miami Vice.
I'm Tubbs and you're Crocket.
Great!
Look at this, my friend.
- Beautiful, isn't she!
- Yes, she is.
But she's gone, for good.
- I'm sorry.
- I'll never forgive myself, myfriend.
- Oy!
- It's a crosswalk!
Just drive, please!
My friend's beloved is in that bus.
Thanks for ruining his life!
Thanks a lot!
People have no respect for love anymore. No respect!
The bus. See it? There!
Letme off here and I'll run.
- Is 100 enough?
- No problem.
Thanks, Tubbs!
What the...!
Shit-the dog!
The French verb can be compared with to have.
It's conjugation stems from the basic form: Avolr.
- Sorry...
- Beg pardon?
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Late? Really?
Perhaps this lot were 15 minutes early.
Turn that cellphone off!
Or is it my head buzzing?
Where was I?
The basic verb form is av...
Sorry I'm late.
Not to worry.
Would you step forward here, please.
Come on... up front!
- Hi.
- Hello.
- I'm Roffe.
- Mia.
Could you help me read this, loud and clear for all your mates here?
- Shall I...
- Read it!
'The basic verb form is... '
'... avolr.'
Just read it.
- Don't let me bother you. Just read.
- I can't...
Read louder and clearer so all your friends can hear you!
- Hard going, was it?
- Yes.
Get the gist?
Be on time in future. Sit where you want, I'm feeling generous.
For Christ's sake!
Hey, you!
Come here a sec!
It's really weird, our doing the French course.
I started late. I was fifth reserve...
Why are you doing French?
- I worked in Paris for six months.
- I see.
Then you must be fluent.
Afraid not!
You forget it very quickly.
- There's a soccer game this evening.
- What?
I've got an extra ticket... if you'd like to come.
I'd love to. How did you get tickets?
They sold out days ago.
- Contacts.
- Okay. Yes, I'd love to.
- 6 p.m. At the south gate?
- Right. Great. See you there.
- Great. Bye.
- Bye.
Thank you.
- Hi. Two for the game, please.
- Sorry. Sold out.
- Eh?
- That guy bought the last ones.
Oh, shit!
Hey, you! You've got to letme buy your tickets...
- Never. Never, mate!
- Hang on...
...I mean it, I'll give you 500.
- No. I've been waiting for this game.
A thousand-two for a thousand.
Help me out! Please!
- Yes.
- It's a deal. Okay?
- Each!
Three thousand for a soccer game.
You're nuts.
But I told her I had tickets.
- Shit, it's too small, isn'tit?
- Tight's cool.
But I don't look...
...I don't look faggy, do I?
- Well, yes, actually.
- The scarfll have to do, then.
I was joking. You look great.
- No kidding?
- No. Girls like the feminine touch.
Very funny.
Let's get going, then.
Won't you need these?
- Hi. Sorry. Have you been here long?
- No. I've just got here.
- Hi!
- Hi!
- Big crowd.
- Yes, but then it's...
Two Stockholm clubs, yes.
But in any case it'll be... fun.
Cool T-shirt.
So's yours!
Shall we... get in the queue?
Yes, why not?
35 D. Still with me?
Over here!
- Great position!
- Are you're sure this is right?
- Are you sure it's right?
- Yes. 35...
...D.
YELLOWS!
YELLOWS!
YELLOWS!
Filth ytackle! Warn 'im!
Christ, how cool!
Christ, howcool! Great!
- Where's Simon?
- Not coming.
- Not coming?
- Doing something with Mia.
- But Wednesday's always boules!
- He's in love.
Leave him be.
You know what it's like.
- I'm not playing with him again.
- Lay off! Let's get going.
Don't be so grumpy.
What's the one with... Debra Winger?
- An Offlcer and a Gentleman.
- Isn't it great?
Wicked! The last scene's brilliant, everyone doing a standing ovation.
- So wicked!
- A pity it only happens in films.
Yes.
- Don't say you like that film, too!
- A real favorite...
- You can't mean it!
- It's true.
So beautiful...
...with Julia Roberts in the car, crying, looking out of the window!
And they play 'It MustHave Been
Love'- Roxette. It's so beautiful.
It's so sad...
Though you know from the start it'll end okay.
- And yet you cry.
- Yes, each time you see it.
I always think the last scene's when they aren't going to meet...
...but then the real end comes.
- Richard in his white limo...
...with a bouquet.
- Her knight on a white horse...
...that she's dreamt about all her life.
So beautiful.
Go for it!
Are you trying to kill me?
- 40- love. Match point.
- It was out!
- What?
- It was In, partner.
Shit, it was about six inches out.
- You can still see the mark...
- We're 5- 0 down.
Does it matter?
Just play!
If they want to win by cheating, that's cool. Great fun.
- Leave it now! We're winning!
- Can we play? It's getting cold.
40- love. Match point.
Yes, match point.
Bloody cheat.
Come on, Mario! Think "love all."
This is our point. No problem.
Shit!
- Cool down!
- She fucking aimed atme!
- Bloody unsportsman like!
- Thanks for a very exciting match!
It was an unbellevably fun game of tennis.
Thanks a lot.
- He's so...
- Why can'the...?
Sorry we're late. Micke's hair needs...
Hiya, Sanna...!
- Hiya.
- Hi.
- Want a ride?
- You bet.
- We're going out tonight. Okay?
- Eh?
No... No, I can't.
We agreed to.
I know, but I've got things to do.
Study and stuff.
Forget it.
Want a ride to the Tube?
- No...
- Walk? -We'll walk.
Thanks anyway.
- What's the problem? Let's go!
- Get going. We'll walk.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Nice to meet you, Mia.
- Same here.
Mia here.
My mum.
No, he's still believes it all.
Why, has he said something to you?
No? Then what's the fuss!
I amg oing to end it, but I can't just leave, now!
All right, all right.
I promise this is the very last date.
Yes! Right. Bye.
- What did she say?
- Nothing.
Can we go on watching?
The moment we've all been waiting for this evening:
The prizes!
I can't hear you... The prizes!
Will the winner be
Miss Rinkeby- SubiZimseck?
- She's great.
- Or Miss Alby- Gabi Bolopa?
Or our own honeybunch,
Miss Kista- Linda Johansson?
One of these ladies is about to become 'Miss Suburb, 2002.'
The big question: Who has won?
And it says here:
The winner is...
Can you feel the excitement?
The winner is:
Miss Alby!
Dead right!
Wicked!
All right!
- Hiya.
- Hi.
- Is Sanna at home?
- No. She's on night duty.
- Can I sleep here?
- Yeah, but...
...what's happened?
She's there, kissing...
...well she's getting in close with that idiot from Survivor.
Micke...
About to shove his hairy tongue down her throat and choke her.
Micke, I know this sounds a bit like a cliché...
...but you've got to forget her.
- I can't.
I know it's really hard...
...but she has really hurt you.
- Yes.
Wait a sec. Put it this way:
If she was to come back to you, do you really think it would work?
- Yes.
- Honestly?
Well... yes. I think it would...
Listen to yourself, you're hesitant.
Yes I am.
So what the hell do I do?
- Mario...
- Yes?
Don't mention this to Simon.
You mean about our sleeping head to tail in my super-narrow bed?
Precisely.
Simon.
Hi.
I can hear who it is!
What's cookin'?
Come here and chill out, then.
Just zap around a bit.
There's someone on the other phone.
I'll come over to your place later.
Bye.
Mia here.
Bonsolr, honey. What are you doing?
Listen, I've spoken to Olivia at Air France. She said...
Exactly. Which day would suit you best? Friday?
Yes...
No- I'm about to go out.
Can't we discuss it tomorrow?
Call me around ten.
Yes. Great.
Kisses.
Love you, too.
Right. Bye.
- It's piddling down!
- I can see it is. Hi.
- I bought some food.
- Great. Put it there.
- I'll get you a dry shirt.
- Thanks.
- We need to discuss something.
- Just coming.
Oh, my God...
Well, I thought...
- You're...
- Wonderful.
- Crazy!
- Thanks!
- You did say you were hungry.
- But all this!
- What's in the envelope?
- Open it and see.
- Say...
- Open it!
- Jesus, how great!
- Dlrector's cut.
I can take my sister.
She loves Pretty Woman.
Oh... Okay.
I'm pulling your leg.
Of course I'll see it with you.
Right!
What's the matter?
- She just left.
- And?
- I don't see... Everything was great.
- Didn't she say anything?
Just got up and said she was sorry.
- Why did she say sorry?
- No idea.
She said: "Sorry, Simon.
I can't explain it," and then... left.
- You've called?
- Answering machine.
- Cell?
- Same there.
- Hell! What can I do?
- You can't do anything about it.
The ball's in her court.
It's up to her to make contact.
Shit!
Always fucking tilting!
Three wonderful weeks...
- Call, put some pressure on.
- Buthow long can I do that for...?
Could that be her?
It could be Mia!
Where the hell's my cellphone?
- Christ, it's her- Mia.
- Answer, then!
Simon here.
Hi.
Whatthe...!
Mia, my battery's running out.
Can you call Micke's cell?
Did you get...?
She's going to ring yours.
That's for me! That's for me!
Take it easy!
Micke's phone. This is Simon.
Hi.
Yes.
Ofcourse.
In an hour?
Bye.
- Did you sort it out?
- I don'tknow.
- Why's Mia's number on your cell?
- Her mates dug Survivor-Micke...
...so I offered to date them.
- I see.
- What did she say?
- She sounded so weird.
- She said we had to talk.
- About what?
- I don't know.
- She didn't say?
I just don't get it.
See you later.
- Wish me good luck.
- Good luck.
Good luck.
High score!
- Where are you off to?
- See the boss. It tilts all the time.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Has something happened?
- Let's walk a bit.
Simon...
Yes?
I think it's been really fantastic, meeting you.
But?
But...
...there's something I haven't told you.
What is it? What's happened?
Nothing's happened. Well, yes, something has happened, or rather...
I don't know how to tell you.
I've got a boyfriend.
What?
It sounds pretty rough, but it's not rough really.
So it's not rough?
Well what the hell Is it, then?
He's in Paris. I'm not sure we're still steady. Well we are...
...but we never see each other...
- Why didn't you tell me?
I would have, but I didn't want to spoil what we had going.
As if you hadn't spoilt anything now!
Fuck...
Okay...
So what happens now?
What happens now?
I need to think about what I really want.
Fooling around a bit until you leave for...
- It wasn't like that!
- What was't like, then?!
I really like you, Simon.
But I need time to think. Okay?
Take all the time you want. I don't care what the fuck you decide!
Wait a min...
A vodka- cranberry.
A beer, please.
Are you on your own this evening?
Eh?
You ordered just the one beer.
So?
If you'd been with friends or your boyfriend, you'd have ordered more.
- The beer's for my boyfriend.
- Woops. Is he French?
Goodbye.
- Hi, little sis'!
- God, how I've missed you!
And I've missed you!
- Is that all you've got?
- Thailand next.
- Are you kidding?
- No.
- How long will you be there?
- Six months.
- I can't face it!
- How are you, then?
- I'm fine.
- Are you?
Just a bit hungry.
Let's go home and have something to eat and a glass ofwine. Okay?
How are you, love?
You're so quiet.
I can see something's up.
I've made such a fool of myself.
Is it that bad?
What's happened? Is it Andrés?
No.
- I've been so damn stupid.
- Oh, sweetheart.
So damn stupid...
It'll be okay.
- Are things serious, you and...?
- Simon.
- How did you meet?
- That's the... problem...
There was this conspiracy- our meeting had been planned.
- A blind date?
- Well, not really. It was a bit...
I met an old friend at a bar-
- and I bet him I could get this friend of his to fall in love with me.
So stupid. But I thought it sounded a bit of a laugh.
I was moving abroad anyway.
But I started seeing this guy and...
- And you fell in love with him.
- Head over heals in love.
So you won't be moving to Paris.
I don'tknow.
No, I'm...
I might as well move there.
Simon hates me now anyway, so...
Could you answer?
Mia's phone. This is Lisa.
Hi, Andrés.
Fine. And you?
No. She's notin.
Oh... Hang on a minute.
B J H, okay.
Yes, I'II tell her.
Bye.
What did he say?
Hey... tell me what he said!
He's booked your flight.
- I've got the number.
- Oh, fuck!
Hi, Simon!
Hello.
Hello.
Want to see Simon?
There was some blond chick here but she just split...
For God's sake! Mia!
- Who was that?
- Eh?
No one.
- I put your T-shirt on the bed.
- Thanks.
- Hope we meet again some time.
- You bet.
- See you.
- Bye.
Bye!
Why did she have to turn up just then?
- Why? Is that a crime?
- But she's already got a guy...
...so she's playing it wrong. Not you!
- Perhaps she came to say...
...that she'd dumped the French guy.
- That's just your imagination.
Forget the whole thing.
Yeah, maybe.
What if I've ruined everything due to a stupid one-night stand.
All you can do is find out how she feels about it all.
- That'd be heavy shit.
- But it could hardly make it worse.
Forget her now!
That's my opinion. She's been lying to you. You deserve better.
The bloody soap stings!
- We've got to talk.
- Well... come in.
- You mustn't let Simon in on all this.
- I've got to!
- Don't. It'll onlym ake things worse.
- Maybe...
...but I can't go on lying.
- Notlie, just say nothing!
- You're not seeing him anymore.
- No?
- But you're moving to Paris!
- Micke, don't you understand?
- I'm in love with Simon.
- In love? Correct me if I'm wrong...
...but, only yesterday, didn't he screw some other girl?
You've won your 2,000.
So now it's over.
D'you think I'm stupid?
To hell with the bet!
- Who's that?
- It'll be my sister.
- How old is she?
- Shut up!
Just a joke... just fooling.
Simon!
- Why are you here?
- Can I come in?
What?
I think we ought to talk.
Yes, but... can't we...
Can't I come over to your place this evening? I've got so much...
- Right. About eight?
- Great.
- Is Micke here?
- How come?
That's his jacket!
- Hiya... Simon!
- Hiya, yourself!
- What are you doing here?
- What I'm doing here?
Well, Mia... borrowed one of my CDs.
ACD?
I thought I'd just... pick it up and...
...well, I'll be going.
I'll call you later...
"Meditation."
And when did you start meditating?
- So you didn't know I did?
- Quit it, Micke, for God's sake!
There's something we've got to tell you, Simon.
That girl with a crush on Survivor-Micke is nuts...
Shut up, Micke! Let Mia speak.
- I've got to split...
- Stay here, you!
Well? Out with it. Let's have it!
I met Micke down at the bar and we started talking a bit-
- and he told me about a friend who'd never fallen in love. That's it.
- Really? And?
- And...
...so... he bet me I couldn't get you to fall in love with me in two weeks.
- What?
- We bet 2,000.
We set it up like a Hollywood movie.
Right, Micke?
Like a what?
You wanted the Hollywood movie life.
I thought I'd help you.
- You're fucking crazy!
- You weren't meant to find out...
How kind!
So that justifies it all?
It's... just not true!
- It's so crazy!
- I'm really sorry, Simon...
That dogtrick...
Was the whole thing fixed?
Yes, it was.
Yes...
Jesus, Mia, you're so damn...
It's so goddam sick!
And you, Micke...
You can go to hell!
My back's hardly turned and you're screwing someone else!
- Who's got a boyfriend!
- I don't screw around!
I'm damn glad I screwed her!
She didn't get paid.
Or have you fixed that, too,
Survivor-Micke?
Christ, couldn't you goddam see
I was so in love with you?
Simon here.
Please leave a message.
Hi, Simon, it's me... Mia.
I just want to say I'm very sorry about what's happened-
- and I'd like to talk to you.
Would you give me a call, so I can explain? Please let me do that.
I miss you.
Goodbye.
- How could you be so fucking stupid?
- I wanted to help him.
Can't you try and explain to me...
As a friend, how could you think up something so idiotic-
- without realizing it might end in disaster?
- Well, I thought she might...
- You didn't think at all, it seems.
- You've got to sort it with Simon.
- Don't you think I've tried?
I've been over there, but he won't open. He won't answer the phone.
I even went to his college, but he's not been there for days.
God knows what you can do. But, if
I were Simon, I'd never forgive you.
No...
Hi.
Oh... 2114.
I always thought it was 1421.
I've only been getting your answering machine.
Perhaps your cell's been playing up...
Sorry.
I'm sorry... I wanted to help you feel what it was like to be in love...
...as you never had been.
I thought you might think it was cool.
Listen to me! I'm apologizing!
At least you could...
Hi, Simon. It's me, agaln.
I would really Iike to talk to you, but you're not at home, or...
...maybe you'd rather not talk to me.
Simon, I'm...
Never mind. I'm at home.
You can call me. Bye.
I might as well move.
Simon'll never forgive me...
Andrés may feel far off, now.
But, once you're in Paris...
Do you honestly believe
I'll think anyless about Simon there?
But you've hurt each other so badly!
It'll be good to get away, so you can long for each other a bit.
But...
...I don't even know if I'm going. First
I want to sort things out with Simon.
And Andrés?
It's a damn pain. Get it?
- Eh?
- What's the time?!
Mia... Look at this, it's way out!
I'm going...
I am going to Paris.
Bella!
What's happened?
It's over. Well, we've had a fight...
...and Pontus, he's...
- Come inside and have some tea...
...if you like.
Shall I see if the tea's done?
- Do you want a sandwich?
- Yes. But...
No butter and only one cheese slice.
I haven't forgotten!
I'll see to it.
Hi, it's me.
Did I wake you?
No... It's just that it's a bit late in the evening.
Good.
No, I was just...
I'll be there on Sunday.
Brilliant. Okay, then. Kisses.
Bye.
Who was it?
Just my mother.
- This is cozy.
- Yeah.
- Excuse me, Micke, but...
- What?
Have you ever thought...
...what it would be like if it was still you and me?
Well... I have thought about it on and off.
With Pontus it was never like it was with you and me.
- Wasn't it?
- No.
- Micke... do you know what I believe?
- No.
- This is fate.
- You think so?
We're meant to be together, you and me.
Yes.
I've missed you so much.
- I've missed you, too.
- Have you?
What do you want?
It doesn't matter where I am, as I'm not...
What?
Do you really want that?
Ooh!
You're not kidding?
Okay, I'll be there.
You are fantast...
Kisses!
I've gotto go.
It was Pontus. This is crazy... but he wants to get engaged!
"Hi, Simon, as you won't talk to me or see me"-
- "this would seem to be the only way to get through to you."
"I'm really sorry about how it turned out. It wasn't meant to go this far."
"And I wasn't meant to fall in love with you, either. But I did."
"When I realized I was falling in love,
I wanted to explain."
"But suddenly it was all too late."
"I could understand your never forgiving me."
"You will always be in myheart."
"I won't be bothering you again.
Today I'm flying to Paris, to Andrés."
"Just as well, after all that's happened."
"Forgive me, Simon.
Mia."
"PS Don't be too hard on Micke.
He means well."
Mia.
Mia, it's Simon. Open up!
Mia, please, open the door!
- Hey...
- What?
No point in knocking.
They're not home.
- D'you know where they are?
- Left... for Taiwan.
- When?
- An hour ago... more or less.
Damn!
- Hi... Howmuch to Arlanda Airport?
- I can run you out for 400.
- Yup.
Forget it!
- How are you feeling, sweetheart?
- I'm okay.
Mario.
Hiya, Simon... What?
Cool down...
Okay...
Now?
Mia!
Faster, Sanna, please! If we don't make it... You're only doing 20...
Cool it! We're doing the best we can.
What's that?
- What are you doing?!
- There's a queue, Simon...
I just don't believe this is happening!
For Christ's sake!
Why the hell's she moving to Paris?
Could someone please explain!
- You're sure you'll be okay now?
- Of course I will be.
But things'll be great in Paris!
Yes, I suppose so.
I'll miss you.
I'll come and visit as soon as poss.
Hi. Listen...
Forget that now.
Micke, we can talk later.
When's the next Paris flight?
What! In 15 minutes?
We won't make it.
It's Mia.
Right... of course.
Listen, Simon...
We'll talk later. Right. Bye.
- What are you doing?
- Christ!
Who's that idiot, honking?
Hey, you!
Christ, it's him!
- Hiya, friend!
- You've gotto help me... The airport!
I've gotten minutes.
- Is it the girl?
- Yes.
We'll be there in five minutes.
Jump in!
See you at Arlanda.
I'll explain later.
- Hi, man.
- You're a hero.
Passport and boarding card, please.
- Bon voyage.
- Thanks.
They're chasing us.
The police.
Hell! Could've known!
- Stop, then.
- Are you crazy?
- It's the cops, for God's sake!
- But she'll be gone if we stop!
- Remember my Vinnie?
- Eh?
- The girl in the photo.
- Yes.
She vanished, because the cops stopped us. But they won't this time!
- They're getting closer.
- Cool it. Just you wait!
- Move! Run!
- But the police...
Forget it. I'll deal with it.
- I'll never forget this, Tubbs.
- Give her my best!
Damn!
- Information.
- Sorry?
- Where's Information?
- Down there.
Hi. Can I help you?
- I'm sorry?
- Gate 2.
- You want Gate 2?
- Gate 2. Quick!
Down to the end, then right.
Don't mention it.
Hi! Can I help you?
Well... Hi, there...
..."Veronica C."
Ready for me?
- What's the time?
- 1.25 p.m.
Really? I thought I'd be on a flight to Geneva at 1.25 p.m.
So sorry. There's a one-hour delay.
It's fantastic for me to know you're so sorry. Do you follow?
Knowing you're sorry will get me to
Geneva much faster. Or am I wrong?
- Get in the queue!
- Slow down! Wai there!
- Passport and boarding car...
- My girl's waiting in there.
Passport and boarding card.
Please!
Micke, baggage handling, Survivor-
Micke... Open the door for God's sake!
Showme your passport and card, or go to the back of the queue.
- You're a frigging idiot!
- Just doing my job.
- Straighten your tie.
- Next.
- Hiya!
- Hiya, mate.
- Is this the Paris load?
- Yup.
- Hi!
- Hi, there!
I found this little guy over there...
...crying.
He must have lost his parents.
Poor fellow.
Lost your mummy and daddy?
Have you?
- No...
- Yes. Right. They must be around.
Can you look after him?
I've got my flight.
- Gate 2?
- Right.
Come round.
There now...
What the...!
- Sorry. I've gotto do this.
- Don't close... Open it! It's a break-in!
Can't anyone help? Security, come here! God, you take your time!
- What is it?
- Break-in!
- He works here?
- No!
Come out of there!
Mia! It's Simon. Are you listening?
I've got somethingto say.
I was drunk.
Itwas so stupid, so idiotic.
What in God's name's he up to?
Don't leave because of that, Mia!
I know I haven't answered when you've called-
- but I've needed time.
I'm still angry with you and Micke, and you are with me.
Forget it all, Mia!
Because I'm deeply in love with you.
I realize now it's you I want, only you.
So, Mia, if you can hear me...
Don't get on that plane!
Paris isn't for you, I promise you.
We've got to give love a chance, you and me.
Mia...
...I love you.
I want to be with you.
Hollywood movies aren't like this, they don'thave unhappy endings.
Great stuff, mate! Great stuff.
- Thanks.
- You'll have to come with me.
What are you up to?
Have you gone nuts?
I'll call Micke, so he can sort it out.
Are you okay?
Simon!
Go on, feller!
It's cool.
- You came!
- Of course I did!
- How did you know I was here?
- I got your letter.
What d'you mean? What...?
What is it?
Great, man!
Aren't you Survivor-Micke?
- Yes. That's me.
- Could I have your autograph?
I should think so.
- What's your name?
- Emma.
There you are, Emma.
- Thanks.
- That's okay. Emma!
You can have this, too, seeing as I like you.
- There you go.
- Thanks. Great!
Bye!
Mario doesn't know about our little bet, eh?
What are you going to do now?
Nicolas, I asked you something. 
I was scared to death. 
You screamed as if your throat was cut. 
What did I shout then? 
- I don't know. Idiot. 
Here you are, this is a starter to begin with. 
Are you new? 
- I'm a stand-in. 
What are these? 
"Amuse-bouches". Freshly made. 
I understand that it is not frozen. 
I asked if you know what's inside. 
What is this? 
- I will have to ask. 
No, taste it please. 
As you wish. 
Is there any problem, Mr. Delamont? 
- No, not at all. 
What is it? Cheese? Fish? 
Neither. It's minced white meat,
I suspect young rabbit ... mixed with bits of black olive. 
A delicious combination, I think. 
Very tasty. 
What's your name? 
- Nicolas Riviere. 
Thank you very much. 
Bon appetit. 
He has pianist hands. 
Did his nose caught your eye? 
- Not really. 
What struck me was his look. 
He seems very intelligent. 
The desserts for table 5. 
- What was that? 
Who is this guy? 
- One of my best customers. 
Totally crazy. 
- A little respect, please. 
If you want to get out of this bussiness, call me. I might have something for you. 
Sit down. Doctor Ferrieres will come soon. 
The summer edition of Burning Lust, please. 
Unfortunately, that is sold out. 
Can I offer you Hot Nights? 
You rather help me to clean up. 
- How unromantic you are! 
That's kind of you. 
How do you mean "kind"? 
I am your anti-depressant. 
The sun that brightens up your day.
Your Romeo. 
Shakespeare, put that rack inside before everything gets wet. 
Visit him in prison? 
That's not possible. 
During preliminary examination that is not allowed, sorry. 
Why not? I can help him. 
You help him best by helping me to understand what happened. 
I'm cold. 
You are beautiful as drowned cat. 
- Drowned pussy, you mean. 
I have to change at home. 
- Aren't we going to eat something? 
If you take care of me when I get sick. 
I got a call of somebody called Flavert. 
Frederic DelaMont wants to talk to me tomorrow. 
The man from the restaurant? Really? 
- He's not the pope. 
He's a hotshot though. 
- The head of Delamont International. 
And very rich. I've read about him. 
You get a kick out of that, don't you? 
- Absolutely not. 
They are all murderers. 
I do not know him. 
But he is kind of strange. He wants me to have medical checks first. 
Are you the personal physician to Mr. DelaMont? 
- Yes, that's right. 
He's not an easy patient, I suppose. 
Lie still now and remain silent.
This is a Japanese battle-axe. 
The samurai went at each other with these. A bloody affair. 
You are punctual. That's good. 
I have the results of your medical tests. 
Nothing wrong with you. At least, almost nothing. 
Affected bronchi as a result of tobacco use.
Do you smoke a lot? 
It depends. 
One and a half to two packets a day. 
How tall are you? 
- 1 meter 76. 
I thought so. 
Turn around please. 
My shoes are taller, so we are exactly the same length. 
How much do you weigh? 
- 70 kilos. 
I weigh 76. I must put myself on a diet. 
Shoe size? 
Unbelievable. 
What kind of job did you want to offer me? 
I want you to be my taster. 
Your taster? 
- Yes, maybe it sounds a bit strange. 
My own cook takes no risks. 
At home nothing can happen to me. 
But I need someone for my business lunches and dinners. 
Use this as an ashtray. 
First you will make sure that 
I don't get cheese or fish down. 
I cannot stand those. An allergy. 
Pretty simple, right? 
And second? 
- Everything in its time. 
I take you three months on trial. 
I'll pay you 35,000 francs. 
That seems reasonable. 
And why me? 
Physically you're the ideal person. 
In good looks as well as in appearance. 
Appearance is something mysterious. 
All six candidates I had selected, he pointed down. 
Too big, too small, wrong hands. 
He was very fastidious about that. 
He was horrified by thick fingers. 
And the mouth was important. 
One guy was exactly right. 
Length, weight, hands ... 
But he thought his lips were too thin. 
Not enough Burgundy. 
You talk as if it's normal to hire a taster. 
Have you never thought that this is a little bit strange? 
He had strange ideas but he was a special person. 
Indeed. 
And Nicolas Riviere? 
I thought him an unpleasant person. 
Already when I saw him in the restaurant. 
He had a fake smile. 
Read it well, line by line. 
For that salary I expect you to be constantly available. 
Even at night? 
- Yes, 24 hours a day. 
Also take a good look at paragraph 7A. 
I demand absolute discretion. 
Too bad you're not mute. 
Where are you now? 
- At paragraph 10. 
That goes too far. I can not stop smoking in one blow. 
No? 
- What I do at home, I want to decide myself. 
Then here our ways seperate. 
You realize that damaged taste buds are not of any help?!
I will try. 
- No, I want to be sure you quit. 
Will you let somebody shadow me? 
- That will not be necessary. 
I'll watch a picture of your lungs every month. 
My last one. 
You get new clothes and tomorrow you will be picked up at eight o'clock. 
I have a dinner appointment. 
I wonder how you will do. 
Is it a stained-glass window? 
It reminds me of Mexico, or actually of Beatrice. 
I met her there. She led about a group of elderly tourists. 
And since than we are together. 
Consider the following picture. 
Do you think I'm crazy? 
I want to understand. And to help you understand what happened. 
I must remember well what is said during those business dinners. 
It is a strange guy. 
Thoroughly neurotic. 
Here. 
- No, I want to stop. 
He can not stand it? 
- It's not that. 
Didn't you hear me this morning? 
I'm getting an aversion to it. 
And, how do I look? 
Look at me. 
You do not kick into that trap, huh? 
- Why? 
I don't know. 
All that money, the life of luxury ... 
It might go to your head. 
Where do you take me for? 
I'm just curious. 
Isn't it still a fun job? 
You earn a lot of money. 
That changes a man. 
No, because then you won't have anything to say to me anymore.
Your limo is here. 
Damn, I got a boner. 
You have to sit in the back. 
I want just as soon in the front. 
- That is not what Mr. Delamont wants. 
Do you already work a long time for Delamont? 
- Six years. 
You know, Francois ... isn't that your name? 
Please call me Nicolas. 
I am just an employee. 
According to Mr. Delamont you're not. 
What did he say then? 
- That you count... that you may not lack anything and that nothing should happen to you. 
"Pot-au-feu de pigeon". 
Taste it. 
Delicious. 
- I do not ask that. I know this dish. 
I wonder whether you taste something special about the sauce. 
I taste garlic, onion, a hint of lemon. 
There is a special ingredient inside. 
You have a lot to learn. 
Philippe puts verbena in his broth. 
Listen, I want our taste buds to be perfectly in harmony. 
If we have "mouton musette" to eat within a few months... 
I need nothing more to ask. 
Then I will see from your eyes that we have the same sensation. 
Can I ask you something? 
Call it professional interest. 
Where does your dislike for fish and cheese come from? 
My father was a wholesaler of cheese. 
One day he went to Corsica with some business associates. 
They got on the boat in Marseille and at night he drowned. 
Did the boat sink? 
- No. 
He was seasick, leaned over the railing and there he went. 
A month later, fishermen found his corpse. Eaten by the fish. 
That was very traumatic. 
I was six years old. 
Terrible. 
Now my appetite is gone. 
- I'm so sorry. 
You shouldn't believe everything I tell you. 
If you take everything for granted, then it's not going to work. 
Do I look like the son of a cheese maker? 
Not really. 
You can act very well. 
Don't lick my boots. You're not a waiter anymore. 
The relationship between Delamont and
Nicolas Riviere was quite unusual. 
Why exactly? 
How shall I put it... 
It struck me ... that Riviere had a huge influence on him. 
I have here a copy of your employment contract. 
You were hired as a cook and dietitian 
I understand that Delamont was scared stiff of certain foods. 
Fish, cheese. 
It was more subtle, Your Honor. 
Because of his delicate taste he made high commands on the preparation. 
Good cooking is an art. 
Couldn't it be an act?
A way to humiliate people? 
They share an apartment with five persons. 
Nathalie Guibert, bookseller. 
Felix Violet, political scientist, works for an advertising photographer. 
Marco Fanfani. He ... 
- I want to know who she is. 
Beatrice Simonin, born in Angers. 
Studied English. 
Father was a shopkeeper and deceased two years ago. 
She was a tour guide and now has a kiosk. 
She's his girlfriend since one year. 
How are you doing? 
- Good. 
Have a look. 
Did you buy it? 
- Company car. 
Delamont doesn't want us to go by subway. 
That goes much faster. 
He says the subway can lead to all sorts of diseases. 
That guy is crazy. 
- Lucky for us! 
Get in, princess. We go for a ride. 
Do you know the boss of the supermarket opposite the kiosk? 
That asshole with the loden cape? 
He has exactly the same car. 
He is lonely. 
Therefore I have a weak spot for him. 
If you distrust everything and everyone... 
Or you hire a confidant. 
- What are you actually doing? 
In my contract it says "personal adviser". 
Let me see. 
- Don't you believe him? 
What kind of advices do you give? 
Lately we were having dinner with some Japanese. 
I noticed that he hesitated about an investment ... because of the Asia crisis and all. 
Did you talk him round? 
I would never dare, although I studied economy. 
Once you will be the ruin of him. 
They are just jealous. 
Soon nobody wants to know us anymore. 
You better take care. 
There hides a capitalist in everyone of us. 
Nothing can happen to me. 
Kiosk owners will never be rich. 
Why don't you try to find another job? 
My idea!
It pays poorly, but I want to feel free.
That's the way I am. 
No problem. Please tell Delamont
I'm on my way. 
Do you have to work overtime? 
What I don't understand is that Nicolas withheld so long from you... what he did for Delamont exactly. 
Did he feel ashamed for the kind of work he did? 
This is Nicolas Riviere, my taster. 
We are honored to finally meet you. 
Let's order. 
No, leave it up to him. 
What do you advise us? 
The rice is excellent. 
Perfectly cooked, full flavor, slightly spiced with ginger. 
I'm afraid that the chicken soufflé with
Thai basil is a little too spicy for you. 
I would recommend the tenderloin with fine herbs. Very delicate. 
For you I advise the king prawns and grapefruit with seafood. 
But please keep it away from Mr. Delamont. 
That's how we do it here, gentlemen. 
What sauce shall I take? 
- Not that one! 
Are you crazy? 
- I'm sorry. 
Let's forget it! It was an accident. 
I was too hasty. 
Awful.
Do you know what that is, "nuoc-mam"? 
Fermented fish extract. 
- Exactly, the worst there is. 
But perhaps it's only my imagination. 
Smell it. 
It's like cheap soap that smells of carnations... but absolutely not "nuoc-mam". 
Here you are. 
- You want me to taste it? 
For spirits and wine I do not need you.
Cheers. 
To our cooperation. 
Do you know who Rene Rousset is? 
A chef who works for me now. 
He will soon take you under his care for a crash course. 
We go to the house where I was raised.
It will be for a couple of days. 
Do you live alone? 
I never wanted to live together with someone. 
We look alike a lot. 
- Yes, indeed. 
Did you have a pleasant night? 
- Certainly. 
I have not been here for 15 years. 
It is the home of my youth. 
I was never able to sell it. 
Too many memories. 
It is difficult, but fasting is good for you.
You will get hardened. 
As a child I sometimes fasted. 
Did you eat here with your parents? 
- Rarely. Father was away many times. 
Mother was suffering from her nerves and preferred to remain in Lyon. 
She was admitted to hospital later on. 
I talk about this in a rather cool way because I had little contact with her. 
Your bean-salad was a masterpiece. 
Thank you. 
- It's no ordinary appeaser. 
It's full of vitamins. 
Do you want a dessert? 
- No. 
I don't want to put out poor Nicolas' eyes.
I will stand by you. 
We have to share both love and sorrow. 
Rossignon. 
Are you deaf? 
Your blood pressure is normal. 
When I woke up, I felt oppressed. 
An anxiety attack. I will give you something. 
- I had that same nightmare again. 
I'll be back right away. 
- No, I'm okay now. Sit down. 
It's because of this house. 
I was always afraid of the dark. 
They always put on a night light for me. 
As soon as Lili, my governess, had closed the door... 
I counted to one hundred and then switched off the light. 
Then the slimy monsters arose from the floor. 
I could see them in the dark. 
And I still see them. 
There was a plank across the room, like a bridge. 
I pulled myself together, went out of bed and walked across the plank. 
A misstep and I would be engulfed. 
On one night ... 
I heard my mother sobbing. 
She wailed like a wounded animal. 
Then I stepped wrong and fell off the bridge. 
The door opened, Lili entered and asked: What are you doing? 
I was terrified. 
My father had just died. 
I'm completely cut off from the world.
I find it difficult.
I'm sitting here for ten days, locked up, without being able to call. 
It is a detoxifying treatment. 
I want your body cleansed. 
In the city you just come into temptation. 
But why am I not allowed to call? 
- It is a retreat. 
And I'm here to support you. 
Because of this reason I have canceled my appointment in Tokyo. 
Is anyone worried? 
- Not really. 
Caroline could call somebody for you.
Not your parents, I presume? 
Don't look so depressed. 
Do you drink two liters of water a day? 
- I piss like a horse. 
You should drink as much as possible. 
My stomach is swollen. 
Flatulence? That is normal. 
That's because of those hunger suppressors. 
If you have cramps, you take one of these tablets. 
No excessive constipation? 
- Are you kidding? 
But where is he exactly? 
And you can not give me his number? 
Unbelievable. 
Precisely, he should call me. 
Who I am? 
That's none of your bussiness. 
Excellent, I'll wait for your call. 
And? 
- What a bitch. 
"You don't have to worry". 
"Our rule is that students are not allowed to call private".
Bullshit. 
What are you afraid of? 
Nothing. 
I just want to talk to him. 
Is that so weird? 
Where is he? 
Nicolas, nice to see you. 
We celebrate in style that you're allowed to eat earthly food again. 
Follow me. René has prepared a surprise for you. 
After this difficult but useful Lent you may eat the forbidden fruit. 
My punishment for what I did to you. 
When I look at this, my stomach turns upside-down. 
I think this is not a pleasant sight, but I quite understand you. 
I let myself go a little. 
Take it easy, there's more to come. 
What more is there? 
- Poached turbot with butter sauce. 
Regional cheese specialties and apple-pie for dessert. 
How is that Condrieu? 
Excellent. But everything tastes fine, even the breadcrumbs. 
My food phobias are known to you, but what about yours? 
I like everything. 
Really everything? 
Except offal. 
- Funny. 
I am very fond of that. 
Especially tripe. 
That's because of my father.
He would commit a murder for a plate of tripe. 
About the only thing we had in common. 
Do you like tripe? 
- No, I think it's disgusting. 
I'm feeling sick. 
You've eaten too fast. 
If you have fasted, your stomach has to get used to food again. 
This will make you feel better. 
How are you? 
I spent the whole night vomiting. 
- It's my fault. 
No, shouldn't have been eating so gluttonously.
- Take a good rest, that's best. 
That's bile. 
Rossignon will take care of you. 
I have to go to Paris. I will be back at the end of the week. 
Take some rest. 
You had put an emetic in his food to make him take an aversion to cheese and fish. 
This was done by Rossignon, at the request of Delamont. 
But you knew about it. 
How long has he been sick? 
Three days, I think. 
But Rossignon said that no harm could be done. 
When Delamont came back, he confessed coolly what he had done. 
Were you there that day? 
Do you know how we call this? 
Complicity of attempted poisoning. 
Do you hear that? Poisoning. 
We can stop now. 
I'm willing to pay you compensation. 
That's normal in business life. 
It's up to you. I give you a check and we stop. 
Or we continue our cooperation. 
Is that clear? 
- Completely. 
You are a bastard. 
But I will go on with it. 
This is a milestone. From now on we dislike the same food. 
Your training is over. 
We have put a major step. 
To celebrate that, René made one of his specialties. 
Tripe according to an old family recipe. 
Believe me, you'll feast upon it. 
And? 
Delicious. 
Watchman, Santa Claus, garbage collector. 
Regular work was not your cup of tea. 
Therefore I do not understand... why one day you gave up your freedom. 
I wanted to know how far I could go. 
A kind of test I imposed myself. 
I was on the other side. 
You look bad. 
- I've worked hard. 
Have you had anything to eat? 
You're skinny. 
There was nothing wrong with the food, but I had a bad stomach. 
How are you? I wanted to call, but that was not allowed. 
Who else was there? 
- There were 15 students. 
Yes, that's what Caroline said. 
Did you call Caroline? 
After I didn't here from you ten days long,
I started calling. 
I found the number in the telephone book. 
You shouldn't have done that.
It's part of their method. 
They can go to hell. 
You live only for Delamont. 
Did you say who you were? 
- Yes, so? 
You can't do that. 
- Now it is quite clear to me. 
You are becoming a filthy rat just like the others. 
Like who? 
- Toadies you called them. 
You despised them, remember? 
This guy goes to work the clever way. 
I don't recognize you anymore. This has to stop.
I don't want this kind of life. 
Where are you going to? 
- Leave me alone. 
Much better than whiskey, huh? 
- Yes, very nice. 
Mouline, a "Cote Rotie". 
The oldest chateau in the country. 
It reminds me of my youth. 
You have improved a lot, Nicolas. 
Usually I admit nobody into my private life. 
It proves that I trust you. 
Everyone is jealous. 
Flavert walks around sulking, 
Caroline doesn't understands a bit of it... and my staff thinks you know too much. 
And? 
What do you have to tell me? 
I've lied to you. 
About what exactly? 
I find this very hard. 
A lie is easily told, regret comes later. 
There is someone in my life. 
Yes, and? 
- I should have told you straight away. 
But when you asked me, 
I answered what you wanted to hear. 
I care about her very much and I do not see a reason why it would interfere with my work. 
Beatrice Simonin, born in Angers. 
She runs a kiosk in Saint-Jean. 
These photos were made at the railway station. 
It looked very passionately. 
What a dirty trick. 
- Don't exaggerate now. 
What should I do with someone who is lying to me? 
Never heard of corporate espionage? 
Luckily I have a good security service. 
Maybe, but you have lied. 
I assume you have told her about me, about us. 
She thinks I'm your private secretary. 
- You're lying to everyone. 
But I have done that consciously. 
- Worse is that you lie to yourself. 
You don't want to admit that you are a taster. 
That's beneath contempt for you. 
So you've understood nothing. 
That is nonsense. I have always joined in the game.
It is not a game, Nicolas. 
Tomorrow I'll write my resignation letter. 
Who is calling at this time now? 
I'll take it. 
We can't just stop here. 
That's beneath us. 
This is what I wanted to tell you by all means. 
See you tonight. 
We have dinner for two. 
And you were right, maybe it's better that Beatrice doesn't know exactly what you are doing. 
That is our secret. 
That was Delamont. 
What did he say? 
- He will not let me go. 
And what will you do now? 
I do not know. 
I've been thinking. If that job has any future, you have to go on with it. 
Do not worry about me. 
I love you. 
"That leg of lamb was not 7 but 8 hours on there". How dare you?! 
Was I right or not? 
- Yes, of course. 
The wine was fantastic. 
I take the stairs. 
Better not. 
One day we should really visit La Belle Etape.
All wines under 100 francs and all beautiful. 
I want out of here. Let me out. 
Nicolas, do something. 
Let me through. I want out of here. 
Luckily you were there. 
Are you okay? 
We take the stairs. 
He had mysophobia.
I had to disinfect his phone every morning. 
I emptied his garbage can a few times a day. 
And he was very punctual. 
In seven years he was never too late for an appointment. 
I find that commendable. 
Was he afraid of poisoning? 
- Food poisoning. 
He didn't assume that someone would deliberately poison him. 
Shall I tell you what I think? 
- That's why you are here. 
He carried around with him a big sorrow, but he didn't let it appear. 
Did he tell you anything? 
Some things you can feel. 
And that taster thing was nonsense.
That was a cover. 
A cover for what? 
I do not know. 
He had everything: power, money ... he was lacking nothing. 
Only a Nicolas Riviere. 
It is terrible what has happened. 
What about Nicolas Riviere? 
Please answer honestly. 
It sounds crazy... but they seemed to be made for each other. 
Hello, Flavert. 
- Mr. Flavert, please. 
Okay, if you stop saying Nicolas. 
Isn't that the way waiters are addressed? 
Do you have an appointment? 
- In my case that's not necessary. 
He storms at everyone at the moment. 
- Not me. 
No, with slaves that is not necessary. 
He has hit me. You are witness. 
I'm going to accuse you of that. 
Where is he? 
- On the telephone. 
I don't care. 
He bumped his head against the elevator. 
He is furious, and I'm afraid he will remain like that. 
He was provoking it. 
- Sure. He is extremely jealous. 
Jealous? 
You have a unique profession. 
There are millions of Flaverts and hundreds of Delamonts. 
But there is only one Nicolas Riviere. 
I envy you more and more. 
Tell me...
Tell me everything. How was it? 
What? 
I have so often wanted to hit someone, especially Flavert. 
But I've never dared. 
Tell me... what kind of feeling does it give? 
The pleasure... is intense, but only for a short while. 
It's a strange sensation. 
And it hurts. 
I almost broke my wrist. 
And further... 
Perhaps that is personal... but the kick was inside the moment where I decided to hit him. 
When I walked out the elevator, I was not planning to do it. It happened very quickly. 
Incredible. And who pays the rent? 
The house is his own. 
It's a service apartment, so to speak. 
And if you get the sack? 
- That's out of the question. 
When do I get to see this Mr. Delamont? 
- Soon. 
Come on, let's go inside. 
How should we ever settle in here? 
Frederic knows a guy for that.
He will settle everything. 
What's the matter? Don't you like it? 
- Sure, it's stunning. 
Is this marble? 
- I suppose. 
And the taps are certainly made of gold? 
You think I get a kick out of this, but this luxury is repugnant to me as well. 
Don't talk nonsense. 
- Really, I haven't changed. 
I gather as much money as possible and then I quit. 
Then we will see what's coming next. 
Do you know how much I earn? 50,000 net.
A starting salary, he calls it. 
You get addicted to that money. 
- Please trust me a little for once. 
Why you see everything so negative? 
Everything I do is wrong. 
He twisted him round his little finger and got Delamont into his power. 
He deceived him until the end. 
Until the bitter end. 
It's incredible that Delamont let himself be manipulated that easy. 
Everything suddenly went wrong. 
- Also business? 
Yes, of course. 
Three weeks after Nicolas entered service, 
Delamont started to make mistakes. 
He lost his head completely. 
Like someone who is in love? 
- Exactly. 
He was like a mistress who takes over power little by little. 
Frederic, I jumped. I was in a funk like crazy, but I did it. 
What a fantastic experience. 
The wind in the parachute is deafening. 
Do you see me? 
I hope you see me. 
I pull the line, and make a turn. 
You don't know what you miss. 
That was great.
I really had the jitters about you. 
I am also proud of you, Frederic. 
You were really brave as well. 
Somehow I knew he was totally crazy. 
But I wanted to join in his madness. 
One step further more and more. 
I loved Beatrice, but it was predictable. 
With him I felt as if I was sucked into the unknown. 
It was scary... but it also gave me a kick. 
You drink too much. You talk nonsense. 
- No, I mean it. 
She is happy. Isn't that where it's all about?
I don't understand the both of you. 
If she would have a real vocation, to be nurse or something like that. 
It is not about money. But selling newspapers all your life: is that all there is? 
That's ridiculous. 
Or do you want to pull my leg? 
That's it, isn't it? 
Don't go on and on about it.
What's wrong with you? Leave me alone, okay? 
Nice house, just a little impersonal. 
You have changed a lot. 
I don't recognize you anymore. 
Tripe, prepared according to an old recipe. 
Do you serve out yourself? 
It's his specialty. You got your first star for this, didn't you? 
Indeed. 
What's so funny? 
Don't mind me. I have failed. 
Shall I tell you something? 
You are a bunch of losers. 
It's not about money or status ... but to appreciate beauty. 
You ridicule everything. 
Go away if you do not like it.
Everyone has his own lifestyle. 
Come on, let's go. 
You're right. 
Everyone has his own lifestyle. 
Have fun in your fucking kiosk. 
And? 
- Beatrice left furiously. 
I want to hear everything. 
Is Beatrice not here? 
- The regular saleswoman? No. 
When will she be back? 
No idea. I had to replace her for a week. 
Marco? This is Nicolas. Do you know where I can find Beatrice? 
Are you happy? 
Don't be so gloomy. I mean: are you happy with our cooperation? 
I love surprises, and that's fine with you.
I never thought I would ever be able to share so much with someone. 
This memorable event has to be celebrated. 
I have exactly the same one. 
From now on our watches truly tick alike. 
Could I have a few days off? 
Already now? 
- A couple of days. I have to arrange something. 
Beatrice? 
She doesn't understand, huh? She is not on the same wavelength as we are. 
As far as I am concerned, you go away with her for a week... but not until ten days from now. 
I need you at present. 
Aren't you going to put it on? 
Golding is a major customer from the
United States. 
He wanted to decide about the menu. 
He thinks he is Lucullus. 
Sing praises about the food. 
A large contract is at stake. 
Flavert, halfway the meal you start talking about the new design. 
Then, I will take over and settle it. 
Here we go. 
This is already a bad start.
Sally here is a wine connoisseur. 
- That's eveident. 
She has continued her studies for it. 
Please sit down. 
My wife had the same disposition. 
Men are less gifted in this matter. 
I'm going to surprise you. 
- With pleasure. 
You did it perfectly. 
You are a terrible liar. 
May I ask you something? 
- Go ahead.
Have you really been married? 
- Is that a strange thing then? 
I was acting the husband for two years. 
She was beautiful and a great skier. 
But we had little in common. 
Moreover, she had cold feet. 
Doesn't anything strike you? 
Do you see that we resemble each other more and more? Although I am a little older. 
Amazing, huh? That's a good omen.
We are on the right road. 
I go to my American. 
See you at the bar. 
You have managed that rapidly. 
She is beautiful. 
And intelligent. She is an interpreter. 
Did you just chat up with her? 
With a sultry glance? 
I do not know. 
Sometimes it happens of it self. 
I will just say goodbye to her. 
- Why now? 
You are simply going to desert her? 
Isn't that rude? 
That's true, but ... 
- Aren't you allowed to have an affair? 
Things haven't come to such a pass yet between Beatrice and me, happily. 
I think you have half a mind on her. 
Go ahead. I will book a suite for the both of you and arrange everything. 
Come on, go for it. You will do me a favour. 
You are welcome to it. 
What are you doing here? 
- Make sure you do not catch cold. 
I asked what you are doing here. 
- It's your task to taste, not to consume. 
And, how is she? 
Does she have cold feet? 
This can't be true. 
Go to the suite next door. 
Nicolas, don't think that this is purely a perverse fantasy. 
It's something different, something more subtle. 
We play the same music, four-handed, without a false note. 
It was all orchestrated, to continue his metaphor. 
Anyone would have resigned after such a trick. But not you. 
Didn't you think of it as abnormal? 
To be honest... 
I admired him for that very reason. 
That I don't understand. 
Do you know what he once said? 
That he would have committed suicide, if he wouldn't have met me. That's what he said. 
He had seen it all. 
Power, money. 
I am Frederic Delamont. 
I want to talk with you about Nicolas. 
Go ahead. 
- Not here. Shall I take you home? 
In your Mercedes? No thanks. 
There is a café further on. Is that okay? 
I will close and go along with you. 
- Please give me a Paris Match. 
14 francs. - You're beautiful.
Nicolas is a man of taste. 
Have you come for this kind of crap? 
Nicolas will not appreciate this, but I had to. 
I've often asked him if I could meet you ... but he never replied to that. 
It's off between him and me.
What do you really want? 
Very simple. Since you have left him, he is not his old self anymore. 
He is allways late, absent-minded, and doesn't sleep well. 
Poor guy. 
Im afraid that he loves you. 
And you, wouldn't you also like to make up again? Or am I wrong? 
He and I have completely drifted apart since he works for you. 
Because he never told me what he was doing. Out of shame. 
That is wrong, and therefore 
I have come to see you. 
It's in all the magazines:
"Industrialist employs a taster. " 
I can't believe it. 
And you pay him 50,000 francs to taste your food? 
60,000. I raised his wage last week. 
I do not get it. 
Or does he have to fuck you? 
That's out of the question. I don't feel attracted to men. 
You are completely beside the mark. 
- Well, well! 
I don't understand a bit of it. 
I'm tired. 
- I understand. 
I will let go of him if need be. 
I want you to make up again, really. 
But I'm not sure if Nicolas still wants to make up. 
I have no idea. 
Why are you doing this? 
What do you really want to say? 
That I can jump into the lake as to him? 
Do you ever look into the mirror? 
Everything about you is fake. 
Your face, that smile of yours 
I loathe both of you. 
- I just want to save your relationship. 
Too bad we misunderstand each other. 
Did he really say that? 
But I am the one who was not allowed to tell you anything. 
Nonsense, it's the other way round. 
He can no longer live without me. 
Beatrice, I miss you. 
And ten days later you moved in with Delamont. 
I could move into the apartment above his, with a private entrance. That's why. 
Didn't you realize that doing so, you completely delivered up to him? 
What time is it? 
- Two o'clock in the morning. 
I need to talk to you. 
Come to my office. 
Tell me. 
How did it go without me? 
Why do you look at me like that?
- I don't understand well. 
Suddenly you leave without a word.
As if I do not exist. 
Maybe you do not exist without me, indeed. 
It's a Hungarian one. Would you like a glass? 
Do you know why I just left without you? 
- It was the first time. 
To see if I could manage without you.
The answer is no. It was terrible. 
I missed two contracts. 
That is not in my line. 
Don't get me wrong. 
I never wanted to be dependent on something or on someone. 
I'm afraid we have rushed matters too fast. 
Why? 
If a relation gets close to an addiction, you will have to kick the habit fast. 
That's what we are going to do. 
Come over here. 
Thursday you'll go to Tunis. 
From there you'll fly on to Tozeur, at the edge of the desert. 
What should I do there? 
You're going to taste loneliness for me.
We will come out stronger, both of us. 
Didn't you bring me a souvenir? 
A desert rose or something like that? 
He does know that I'm back, doesn't he? 
- I've passed the message. 
With Tunis Air to Orly-Sud, arrival at 6.30 p.m. 
Why was Francois not there? 
- He didn't have time. 
Where is Mr. Delamont? 
Go to sleep. 
You look tired to death. 
I ask you: where is Frederic? 
Answer me, damn it. 
I'm back. 
- I see. 
Sit down. He just came back from North Africa, that's why he is so tanned. 
He is our man in the Maghreb. 
It's better that I leave. 
- No, why? Sit down. 
Please give him a cover. 
This is Vincent Granet, my taster. 
Mr. Granet, how is the chicken? 
What is your opinion? 
Very subtly marinated in honey. 
And perfectly done to a turn. 
Excellent, then we can eat. 
You have a great taster with him. 
Befor this interruption, I was talking about an American style campaign. 
We are willing to invest in it significantly. 
Mr. Riviere, would you like glass of Mouline? 
You let me languish in the desert and then you give my job to this jerk. 
We are not married. I am free to to hire and fire. 
Granet's contract ran until the day you came back. It's simple like that.
Simple like that? 
I know it has been hard for you and your logbook was very moving. 
But trust me, I have also suffered. 
Has he really left? 
- Of course. He could not match up with you. 
You are jealous. 
So, you didn't kick the habit completely. 
Let's hope the loneliness caused that. 
Listen, Nicolas. I know that I'm not mistaken in you. 
Your behavior in the restaurant, your onset of jealousy ... are false notes which may never happen to us again. Mark you: us! 
Do you agree? 
Yes. 
This weekend we go skiing together 
The mountains will do us good. 
You want it medium-rare? 
I'm so glad to be here that I do not care about a failed omelet. 
These are my only pleasant childhood memories. 
I came here often with my governess, Lili. 
I loved her. She had enormous breasts. 
She died last year. 
I felt safe with her. 
Delicious. 
- It's nothing special. 
Don't be so modest. 
Tomorrow we go skiing at eight o'clock. 
Then the snow is still untouched. 
How was it? 
- It's a tricky slope. 
A bluff downhill and a lot of unevenness. 
And then? 
- A bluff downhill again. 
Ice? 
- I didn't notice anything. 
But is it wise that you start with such a difficult course? 
Is it bad? 
- My leg is broken. 
Let me see. 
- No. 
Tell Rossignon and Francois to collect me with my plane. 
Hurry. 
I'll never forgive you this. 
He complained of dizziness. 
Sometimes he experienced severe balance disorders as well. 
I thought of a disease of the inner ear, but there was nothing wrong with it. 
Then I understood that Riviere suffered from depersonalization. 
There were symptoms of a progressive psychosis. 
I can not stand any longer that you are living upstairs, Nicolas. 
You go to a hotel and await further instructions. 
I have no use for you at the moment. 
How can you possibly feel what I feel? 
You have two healthy legs. And I? 
A shin-bone fracture. That will definitely take two months, plus rehabilitation. 
But can I still taste for you? 
Rene planned to prepare tripe voor you. 
The body is a unit. 
I'm just a broken leg. 
I breathe, I think and I piss with my leg. 
And you frolic cheerfully around.
We live in two different worlds. 
And what if Rossignon would put my leg in plaster as well? 
Is that all that what you are after?
That you pretend? 
Sad. 
Pack your bags. 
Francois will bring you to the hotel. 
Beatrice, it's me. Don't hang up, please. I need to talk. 
I fear that I'm going crazy. 
No, I no longer live with him. 
I'm in a hotel. 
Please listen to me. 
It has ended with Delamont. 
Really, believe me. 
He is still a bit hazy. 
It was a double fracture of the leg. 
But he will be fine. 
It will heal completely. 
Thank goodness! 
Do you have much pain? 
- It's not that bad. 
It was pure insanity. 
- You may well say so! 
It's madness. 
You should never have done that. 
But I've done it for you. 
That is exactly what I regret: that you've done it for me. 
After everything we have experienced together. 
Did you forget about that? 
Our dream of perfect harmony became almost reality. 
We were so close by.
It's a great pity. 
You should have broken your leg sooner. 
I expected that of you. It seemed so obvious to me. So simple. 
Do you understand? 
What you have done now... appears to me like an empty gesture. 
An empty gesture? 
I loved you. 
More than I ever loved someone before.
An almost perfect love. 
A perfect symbiosis. 
I believed in it, really. 
This can't be true. 
You see? If you would be attuned to me, you would say what I thought right now. 
That we have gone as far as possible. 
And that it is time to separate.
Peacefully. 
You will get a one year's salary. 
Rossignon will take care of your recovery. 
Don't try to contact me again. 
You know, Nicolas... for me this is also terrible. 
Then I landed into a black hole. 
That's what We call a depression. 
A divorce depression, in your case. 
You got into a clinic where you received high doses of anti-depressants. 
Maybe. Nobody told me anything. 
Rossignon visited me only once. 
He said that nothing was wrong, except my leg. 
I asked how Frederic was doing, and he said that everything was fine with him... but I didn't believe him. 
I knew he was in low spirits. 
Why did you think like that? 
Because you hoped that he was struggling, just like you? 
Maybe. 
One day I read in the newspaper that the 
Delamont shares had slumped. 
That was a cold comfort. 
Don't I look like an idiot? 
- A little. 
The doctor said that you have improved a lot. 
You have contact with reality again. 
Hopefully you are able to stop your medication soon. 
Felix found a job for you.
A simple job at a record office. 
It's very kind that all of you want to help me. 
Come on, let's go. 
I don't know what is wrong with me.
I'm afraid. - That's is normal. 
A glass of champagne maybe?. 
Not exactly, with all that medication. 
- Only a little bit. 
Anyway, you look good. 
What do you think? 
No, am I right? 
- Yes. 
Great. You please yourselves, as soon as I have turned my back . 
Pick up the phone. 
- No, I'm not able anymore to call. 
It will do you good. 
Just say 'hello'. 
Hello, this is the madhouse. 
Okay. 
Who was that? 
Frederic. 
- What did he want? 
He wants to see me. 
- No, that can't be true. 
You are not going, are you? 
Call a taxi. 
I want to know how he is doing. 
Are you all alone? 
Rousset has gone. 
I just wanted to take a bath. 
Come inside. 
What do you have say? 
Beatrice is waiting outside. 
Did your nurse come along? 
I wanted to know how you are doing. 
And I know now. 
You have completely changed. As if nothing ever happened between us. 
Unbelievable. 
I think you have put on flesh. 
That's because of the anti-depressants. 
- Yes, of course. 
You are drinking whiskey nowadays? 
You are not the only one who has changed. 
Sit down. I have pain in my back. 
I had a bad time during the past months.
Because of you. Very annoying. 
And then you fall into bad habits. 
She will grant us a couple of minutes, doesn't she? 
Sit down. 
I've missed you very much. 
And I know you've missed me. 
I can read your mind. 
I hear your heart pounding.
We are nothing without each other.
I'm leaving now.
- You won't, you know better than that.
Otherwise you wouldn't have come.
If I would ask you to kneel for me... and lick my feet, then you would do it.
Come.
Come here.
Lick my feet, Nicolas.
We will start all over again.
You're a poor bastard, Nicolas.
A loser. A gutless fool.
Do you hear me? A gutless fool.

53 thousand Afghan refugees
live in Shamshatoo camp...
at the city
of Peshawar in Pakistan.
They first arrived in 1979 fleeing
the Soviet invasion of theircountry.
The most recent came to escape
the US-led bombing campaign...
which began on October 7th,20O1.
Many of these children
were born here, like Jamal.
He is an orphan.
He works in a brick factory.
He gets paid
less than a dollar a day.
It is estimated that 7.9
billion dollars...
were spent on bombing
Afghanistan in 20O1.
Spending on refugees
is far less generous.
The daily food ration is
48O grams of wheat flour...
25 grams of vegetable oil
and 60 grams of pulses.
Every family is given a tent,
a plastic sheet...
three blankets and one stove.
Who"s moved my clothes?
L"m going, okay.
- Ask your uncle to help you.
- Okay.
Be careful.
Think carefully and don"t...
Don"t worry.
L"II tell him.
Wait for me!
Share the bread.
Eat like a human, slowly.
The meat is too tough!
I want to send my nephew to London.
- Do you want to go to London?
- Yes.
I know a man that can help.
- He can arrange it?
- Yes.
We can talk to him.
- How are you?
- Good.
- How"s Emal?
- He"s not here now.
- Where is he?
- Kilburn High Road. He loves London.
This is my uncle, Wakeel.
This is my father.
I want to help him to a good future.
- Are you sending him to America?
- No, can"t.
L"ve told him already, London.
Uncle, who will go with him?
Because he can"t speak English.
It "s a good price.
It "s a very good price.
He"II have to go overland.
Death is everywhere, we can"t hide here or there.
Allah bless you.
Allah bless everyone.
Allah is great.
That "s okay, leave it.
Wakeel from Peshawar?
You want Jamal?
Jamal, your uncle called. He wants you to meet him in Peshawar.
- My uncle?
- Yes.
- Who"s going to London?
- These two.
- Both of you?
- Yes.
You"re better off in your own country.
- Are you going by plane or by land?
- By land.
It "s very dangerous to go by land.
No, it "s not dangerous.
- L"II give the money to you?
- Yes.
- It "s in Dollars and Rupees.
- That "s okay.
Okay.
When you get to London, you phone me from there.
Then l"II give the money to him.
Here"s your receipt.
Don"t lose it.
He won"t give me the money until they phone.
That "s dad.
He"s on a plane.
It looks nice.
Look at you!
So you don"t forget us.
Okay, l"m going now.
Look after yourself and phone us sometime.
Bye, Aman.
L"II phone you.
Go home...
Go home, Aman.
I told you to go home!
L"II give you a slap!
Go home!
There you are!
Where were you? You"re late!
- The bus is about to leave.
- L"m sorry.
Here are your ID cards.
This is your ticket, and this is the number you ca when you get to Quetta.
There are 14.5 million
refugees in the world.
More than five million live
in Asia.
Almost one million of
these live in Peshawar.
Many of them want to leave.
Every year, one million
people in the world...
put their lives in
the hands of people smugglers...
Some arrive safely at
their destination.
Many get caught
by the authorities.
Some die along the way.
Where can I phone from?
From the public call office, down there.
Ayub, bring my phone!
L"m flying my kite.
Hello.
Fine, how are you?
Who"s this?
Enayat! How are you?
We are at the station, the bus station.
Enayatullah?
I want to ask you something.
- What are you going to ask me?
- Just a question.
If I know the answer, l"II tell you.
If I don"t, I can"t.
Okay, you know the music?
Who made it, and where, and when?
I have no idea.
Okay, l"II tell you.
There was a husband and wife who were always fighting.
Once they threw things at each other in the kitchen... and the music came from that.
They were fighting and throwing spoons at each other... and they sounded...
That "s the answer?
That "s all?
Yes, that simple!
Look at the view!
Look at the snow on the mountains.
- It "s a nice place.
- Yes.
You"re late.
We"ve been waiting for an hour.
Hurry up. Get on.
Enayat, in English
"ghro" is "mountain".
"Mountain" for "ghro".
Do you know the English for "wawra"? It "s "snow".
Snow?
You"II get it in four days!
Why do you need it?
- Give me your money!
- I don"t have it.
Why do you embarrass me in front of all these people?
Are you Chaman Ali?
- I want to talk to you.
- Wait in the car.
Where are you going?
Dalbandin.
Show me your license.
- Where are you going?
- To Dalbandin.
- What for?
- Shopping.
We"re buying clothes to sell in our shop in Quetta.
Come with me.
It "s just my clothes.
- What "s this?
- It "s a Walkman.
Let me hear.
It "s a gift from us to you.
Good luck.
Why did you give him my Walkman?
- He would have kept us there for days.
- You have no right to take my things.
Do you want to stay with him?
You gave away my Walkman!
It "s just a Walkman.
Want to change some money?
There it is!
- Hi. Is this the Jamal Sher Hotel?
- Yes.
- Hi. Do you know Farid?
- No, we don"t.
- Do you know Farid?
- No, but sit down.
- What do you want with Farid?
- That "s private.
Have your tea.
Farid will be here later, God willing.
- So you"re going to Iran?
- No.
Don"t lie to me. If you want to go,
I can guarantee your safety.
If you"re going to Iran... you must change your money from Rupees to Rials.
Give me your money.
- Is this the right amount?
- Yes.
- Okay, I trust you.
- No, count it.
How do you know l"m a good person?
If you have a visa to Iran... you just go over there and queue.
If you don"t, you come with me.
Behrooz, telephone!
Okay, l"m coming.
I speak Pashtu.
I need to contact Behrooz.
Can you speak English or Farsi?
I don't understand Pashtu.
We"re waiting.
We don"t know where you are.
Speak English.
Jamal, talk to this man in English.
So, is it your first time leaving Pakistan, eh?
This is your first time?
Ah, you went to
Afghanistan once.
Okay.
Jamal, don"t tell him everything.
Be careful.
- What did he say?
- He doesn"t say...
- Sorry?
- He doesn"t say anything.
But he said something.
He was just saying that..."What is he asking?"
Oh, right.
You know, I build a new pad.
L"II show you later.
This is just too fucking like chicken. You know what I mean?
No.
Why do we have to change our clothes?
I don"t know.
He says we should.
What d"you say?
He said, "Why are we changing clothes"?
Ah, because you have to be like,
I mean, you know, I mean... you have to go to Tehran, you have to be like Iranian.
With these clothes you attention everybody, so... you have to change your clothes.
- Okay.
- Look like Iranian.
Hey, Jamal, this is a fucking long time, man. You not coming?
Did you finish?
All right.
It "s much better.
Okay.
They"re your trousers?
Here is your coat. Okay, well, you give me your cap, okay?
This is much better, okay?
And, your cap...
And this is shit.
Why does he want our clothes?
What did he say?
What did he say?
He is saying that
"Why is he getting his...
But, I mean, this is bloody fucking shit, you know what I mean?

Okay, it "s about ten thousand Rials per day, okay?
How much?
Ten thousand Rials.
You have to pay by yourself, okay?
You take care now.
Bye, bye, take care.
I don"t trust him.

Right, Jamal, listen, try not to talk... with everybody on the bus, okay?
If they ask you... what you do in Tehran, you can say...
Can you repeat that after me, okay?
What is he saying?
Don"t be far from me, Jamal.
Here they are.
Hey, he"s my friend, okay?
He"s gonna care about you.
And that "s the telephone of my colleague in Tehran. Okay?
You call him, he"s gonna take you.
Very comfortable seats.
Don"t speak Pashtu, speak Farsi.
Where are you from?
Where are you from?
- Are you from Afghanistan?
- No.
- Afghans? Can I see your IDs?
- We"re not Afghans.
You"re not Afghans?
We"re working in construction in Tehran.
In Tehran? I think you"re Afghans.
If not, you should have IDs.
- Do you have any IDs?
- No...
- Are you Iranians?
- Yes.
- Any ID?
- No.
- You?
- No.
- I think you"re Afghans.
- No...
How do know that you"re not Afghans?
Come with me.
- Where did they get on the bus?
- In Zahedan.
- I think they"re Afghans.
- No, we"re not Afghans.
Are these your things?
No.
- What are these?
- Just cassettes.
Okay, we"re off. Bye!
Hello!
What are you doing here?!
That money you paid has been used up for the last trip.
Give me more money and l"II take you again.
- How much more do you want?
- 3,OOO Rupees.
- For two?
- No, for each of you.
- Do you take dollars?
- Dollars?
You don"t have any dollars!
- Which dollars?
- They took all our money.
- Where did you get that?
- He hid those!
"Send me to America."
"No, l"II send you to London and then to America."
"Okay, l"II send you to both."
Enayat, let "s have an ice-cream.
Why did you get such a big ice-cream?
You should have taken a smaller one.
He just gave me a big one.
You should have asked for a smaller one.
Hello.
L"m Jamal.
We"re in Tehran now.
Say something, l"m bored.
Why are you sitting there silent?
- What "s the matter?
- It "s nothing.
Nothing.
Come on!
Hurry up!
Quickly! Run!
L"m not getting in.
L"m not going up there!
Leave me alone!
L"m not going up there!
How many hours will it take?
How, how long will it take?
Yes, your food is here, too.
Leave it here, don"t drink it now.
We have a long journey ahead of us.
- But l"m thirsty!
- Wait, we have a long way to go.
What are you saying?
What are you saying?
I don"t understand you.
What?
Do you understand my song?
What are you talking about?
Where are we going?
Welcome!
Thank you!
Hello.
I feel sorry for him.
God bless you.
They have come from afar.
It "s Okay, we can help them.
Can you speak English?
English?
I used your money to buy you some shoes.
He bought us some shoes!
I needed new shoes, the other were totally worn out. Thank you!
You"re a good boy.
Give me your hand.
One day Mullah Nasrudin was walking down the street.
He saw an Englishman who had fallen down.
Poor Mullah went to help him and the Englishman said, "Thank you."
Mullah got angry and said, "Are you going to send a "tank you" after me?!"
And then he pushed him back down.
"You"re going to send a tank after me?!"
Then he just turned around and walked off.
Laugh!
OK, that was a good story...
Bye.
Take care.
Which way are we going?
That way.
Over there?
Yes, that "s right.
I hope we get there soon.
Yes, may God be with us.
What "s that?
What "s that?
How do you do?
There"s a patrol down there.
Be careful.
Stop!
Stay down.
Let "s go back.
Where are you going?
Wait!
"Let"s go, my friend.
Let "s go to Turkey."
Turkey... l"II go to Turkey... l"II go to Turkey...
This is delicious!
I can almost taste it!
Very delicious.
How do you do?
Hello.

Stop!
Let me out!
Enayat, speak to me!
Let me out!
Speak to me!
Enayat!
What has happened to you?
- Two for a euro.
- Take this.
Two for a euro.

- No, thanks.
Two for a euro.
Still or sparkling?
One ticket for Paris.

Slowly, slowly.
Relax.
I gave him already.
How many you want?
How many do you want?
This is Turkish.
It "s no good.
- Euro. Turkish no good.
- No good. No good.
You want a cigarette?
You smoke cigarettes?
No, no.
- Come sit.
- Why?
- I want to talk to you.
- Why?
- How old are you?
- Me?
- Yes. How old are you?
- I am 16.
- You"re 16?
- Yeah.
- You"re by yourself?
- Me?
Yeah.
You know my name?
It "s Yusif.
Your name?
Yusif?
Jamal, Jamal,
Jamal.
Look at the boat.
Forget the boats.
Play football.
Come on.
No goal!
No goal!
Goal!
Once, a greedy man found a watch.
You see, he saw that it was not moving.
He saw in... in that watch, there was a... a mosquito.
He said, "Oh, his driver is dead."
He took that out, a live, a live mosquito and said:
"Ay, to work now, the driver is..."
It "s a very silly joke.
A box of Benson & Hedges, please.
You must be punished!
Okay, get ready.
You know, I used to work in London.
Oh. What is this?
This is from the restaurant.
L"II give you a job when we go.
- I was assistant manager.
- Okay.
Assistant manager, me.
Tomorrow I will be back in my restaurant.
Where are the plank?
Planks?
They put them here.
Put your jacket properly.
Shut up.
Police!
Come on!
Speed up, my friend.
Speed up.
Faster, faster.
This is Jamal, calling from London.
Yes.
Yes, I got to London.
Enayat?
He"s not here.
He"s not in this world.
Can you hear me?
Hello?
All right!
Yes! From home to the hospital in under seven minutes! We did it.
Yes, the hard part is truly over.
No, but come on, we're off to a great start, aren't we?
I knew I'd get here fast, but this has gotta be some kind of a record!
-Oh, you made it!
-Hi.
-How the hell did you beat us here?
-We took a cab. Did you guys walk?
No, we took a cab too.
But I did test runs..
Hey, you made it!
Okay, is there some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?
Ross, you stay here and talk.
I'm gonna go have a baby.
Okay. Hi, this is Rachel Greene.
I'm Ross Geller. We called from the car.
Right. We have a semi-private labor room waiting for you, so..
Oh, whoa! I'm sorry. Semi-private?
We asked for a private room.
Yes, I see that here. Unfortunately, we can't guarantee a private room.
-And, currently, they're all unavailable.
-Man, if only you'd gotten here sooner.
I'm sorry. Semi-private rooms are all we have.
Okay. Just give us a second. Ross?
Yeah?
-Give her some money.
-I really think they're out of rooms.
They're not, Ross. They're just saving them for important people!
Okay? What if I was the president?
Well, then, we'd be in a lot of trouble.
You don't know where any countries are.
Okay.
Say, would you mind checking again?
See if any private rooms may have opened up?
This is a hospital.
Okay, I see.
Could we please talk to the manager?
There is no manager.
Just nurses, doctors and semi-private rooms.
Okay, you know what? I have to say,
I don't really care for your tone.
And this is not the only hospital in this city, and we have no problem.. Oh, gosh!
-What? What?
-Contraction!
-Would you like to see a semi-private room?
-Yeah, it couldn't hurt to look.
Well, you're only two centimeters dilated, and we need to get to 10.
-It'll be a while.
-Oh, okay.
-I'll be back in an hour to check you again.
-Thank you.
Oh, wait, Dr. Long.
Can I ask you something?
Is labor really as painful as everybody says it is?
Oh, look at that.
My beeper's going crazy.
Hey, don't.. You know what?
You're gonna be fine.
-I guess we have some time to kill.
-Yeah, guess so.
Oh, check these out.
Never done this before.
Doesn't feel good.
Yeah, well, it looks great.
Thank you very much.
I think we're ready to..
Hi, I'm Ross. I'm here to ruin this magical day for you.
Oh, no, not at all. It's okay.
Marc Horger. This is my wife, Julie.
-Hi, Julie. This is Rachel.
-Oh, hi, Rachel.
-Is this your first?
-Yeah, it is.
Well, little Jamie here is our third.
So if you have any questions, or you need anything at all, just holler.
-That's so sweet.
-Yeah.
-Let me give you guys some privacy.
-Nonsense. We're all in this together.
We are gonna share every moment of this with you.
-I think we're gonna have some fun.
-Yeah.
-Oh, okay, I guess.
-Hey, smile!
-I don't know if..
-I really don't want any..
Oh, thank you.
Oh, Ross!
Here comes another contraction.
Okay, just breathe.
-Oh, honey, I think I'm having one too!
-Oh, my God!
Hey, look at this.
-Here you go!
-Oh, no!
Oh, wow. Three hours and still no baby.
The miracle of birth sure is a snooze-fest.
-Hey, you wanna see something?
-Sure. What?
This is gonna be fun.
Watch me freak out Chandler.
-Honey?
-Yeah?
Listen, I've been doing some thinking.. and I don't know whether it's because we're here.. or Rachel's giving birth.. but I think we should try to have a baby.
Okay.
What's that now?
Okay. I've been thinking about it too, and I think we're ready.
Are you kidding? You think we're ready to have a baby now?
This is fun.
You're ready to have a baby?
My boy's all grown up!
You said you were ready too.
Yeah, but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird..
Like mine is now!
Yes, but haven't you wanted a kid, like, forever?
Yeah, but no one ever wanted to have one with me. I mean..
Now I'm just gonna have a baby if I want to. Oh, what are you doing to me?
I'm sorry I brought it up.
Okay, then, back off, mister!
Because I am ready to have a baby.
I just want Joey to be the father.
-What? Are you crazy?
-That's it, right there! That's all I wanted!
I am sorry. The doctor insisted on closing the curtain for the exam.
Oh, that's very..
Really, very, very okay.
Julie's cervix is dilated seven centimeters. That's about four fingers!
-Doctor let me feel it myself.
-Have you felt Rachel's cervix, Ross?
-No, I don't.. We're not gonna do that.
-We won't be doing that.
Well, if you like, you could feel
Rachel's, then feel mine to compare.
-Am I interrupting?
-Yes! Thank you! Later.
-No, you can't leave me alone with them.
-Oh, I'm sorry.
No, Ross? Ross? Ross?
My child has no father!
I'm so glad you're here, but it's gonna be a while. I wish you'd called first.
That's all right.
I'm coming back later with your father.
-I needed to talk to you before the birth.
-Okay. What's up?
Ross, I want to talk to you as your mother.. even though I know that you and I are also very close friends.
I really don't know what you're talking about, but okay.
I brought something that I want to give you.
Assuming, of course, that you want it.
Ma, you're asking me to marry you?
This is your grandmother's engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.
-Mom, no. Come on. Thank you.
-Just hear me out..
No! Okay? We've been through this.
We're not gonna get married just because she's pregnant. Okay?
Honestly, Ross, this isn't just some girl you picked up in a bar and humped.
You think young people use that word more than we actually do.
Ross, a child should have a family.
You know what? I can't deal with this right now. I'm sorry.
Go.. Hey, go talk to Monica.
She got a new haircut.
You'll hate it.
Just think about it. If you don't,
I'll talk more about humping.
Give me.
-Hi, dear.
-Hi. Thank you so much for coming.
Ross, get in here!
You wanna see something funny?
Monica.
Okay. All right, stop it.
You're freaking me out.
Do it again. Do it again.
Hey, Rachel had the baby.
-What?
-Really?
No.
I don't know why
I thought that'd be funny.
You said hi to Mom before she left, right?
I thought that was her.
Yeah, I called her name, and she ducked into a stairwell.
Well, you know what?
Consider yourself lucky.
She pulled me out of the labor room to ask me why I'm not with Rachel.
-Oh, my God.
-How annoying.
Yeah.
-Why aren't you with Rachel?
-You're kidding, right?
Look, we're not gonna be together just because we're having this baby.
And I know she's not just some girl I humped..
Oh, humped?
Come on, Ross.
But it just seems that you two belong together.
Okay, stop it. I can't deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby.
Right. And with who again?
He's crazy. Why doesn't he wanna be with Rachel?
I know.
Seriously, she's like the perfect woman.
I mean, I know she turned me down.. but if she hadn't and she wanted to be with me..
I would take her in my arms and..
I haven't bummed you guys out like this in a while, have I?
-Hey.
-Hey.
-Who's that?
-New people.
What happened to the Disgustingtons?
They're having their baby.
It's not fair, Ross. I got here first!
Right after you left, they wheeled her off into delivery.
Oh, but not before she gave me a nice, juicy shot of little Jamie crowning away.
Wow. Sorry.
So how are the new people?
Well, they have some unusual pet names for each other.
Including "Evil Bitch" and "Sick Bastard."
-Oh, gosh, a contraction.
-Yeah? Okay, okay. Just breathe.
-Are you looking at her?
-No!
-Don't you look at her, you sick bastard!
-Honey, I swear I wasn't looking at her!
She's in labor. You like that, you sick son of a bitch?
I'm just gonna..
See? It's because you were looking, you fat pervert.
No, no. I'm sure no one was looking.
Just want some privacy.
You miss your girlfriend?
Just ignore them.
-You okay?
-Yeah.
-Ross.
-What?
-He's looking at me.
-Hey!
You wanna live to see your baby?
Don't you talk to my husband like that, you stupid bastard!
Oh, good God! If you want a baby so bad, just go steal it!
Oh, don't worry.
These babies are far too ugly for us.
What is going on with you.
Since when are you so crazy about babies?
I'm not crazy about babies.
I'm crazy about us.
What?
We've always talked about having babies someday, not now.. but I'm starting to think that we can handle it. We're good.
We're really good.
We are pretty good.
But nothing has to happen until you're ready.
Well, maybe I'm ready now.
I mean, it's a little scary, but maybe it's right.
What? It's not right!
We're not ready to have a kid now!
-What?
-I'm kidding. This is gonna be fun.
So we're gonna try?
I mean, we're trying?
We're trying to get pregnant.
I'm not comfortable doing this in front of the babies.
-So when do you want to start trying?
-All right, hold on a sec.
-Period math?
-Yeah.
Well, we could start trying now.
-Right here?
-No, not here.
Maybe here.
It's perfect. We got a lot of time to kill, and we're in a building that's full of beds!
And it's so clean!
Come on, you stupid machine! Come on!
-It ate your money?
-No.
-I'll see you downstairs then.
-All right.
Hey, I got one! I got one!
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Oh, up or down?
-Oh. Down, please.
I hate to be a ball-buster, but can I just do it?
-Could you press up too?
-Sure.
-I feel bad. I broke my leg once too.
-Yeah? How'd yours happen?
Well, it's a long story, it's kind of embarrassing.
Let's just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual.
-How about you?
-Car accident.
Some idiot on a cell phone wasn't paying attention?
Yeah. Me.
-Sorry.
-Oh, no. No, don't be.
Nobody else got hurt.
And I was pretty lucky.
Well, I, for one, am glad you made it.
Are you sure?
I mean, you don't know me.
I could have been sent from another planet to destroy Earth.
Couldn't press the "down" button.
I think Earth's okay.
Oh, hey, that's me.
Hey, I take it you're just visiting someone.
Well, if you have some time and you wanna visit someone else..
Yeah, I would like that.
-Great. I'm in room..
-Wait! What? No! Elevator! No!
You gotta press the button.
The nurse said they're bringing in another woman.
Oh. Is she pregnant yet?
She doesn't need to be.
She'll still have the baby before I do.
-Oh, Ross! Another contraction.
-Oh, okay. Here, here.
That's it.
-Oh, that sounded like a bad one.
-Yeah, it was.
Mine haven't been so bad.
Oh, here comes one now.
Oh, that was a big one.
That was, like, the biggest one yet.
Are you okay, honey?
I'm okay, honey.
Well, I got some bad news.
It gets worse.
And when you get to the end, they get really big.. and they come, like, every minute.
Well, mine are pretty close together.
I think..
-Excuse me.
-Yeah, that's quite all right.
Oh, by the way, my name's Johanna.
What's yours?
Excuse me, could you help me with something?
I'm looking for a man.
Well, who isn't?
You. You aren't.
Good for you.
Anyway, the patient
I'm looking for has a broken leg.
He's in a wheelchair. He's early to mid-30s, very attractive.
Even you would think so.
-I know who you're talking about.
-Great! What room number is he in?
I'm sorry.
Patient information is confidential.
No, I'm not gonna bother him.
We were talking earlier..
Ma'am, I'm sorry. That information is restricted to hospital staff.
-She's with me. Dr. Drake Ramoray.
-Dr. Drake who?
Ramoray. It's Portuguese.
We need that information. I'm a doctor.
-A doctor at this hospital?
-Damn it, we're losing precious time.
You want this man's blood on your head..?
-Hands.
-Hands!
It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room he is staying in.
He's a patient of mine.
I've treated him for years.
-He's in room 816.
-816. Thank you.
-And what is his name?
-No.
-I think we found a place.
-Okay.
Wait. Wanna set the mood a little?
Hello, Monica.
-Not like that.
-Oh, okay.
-We'll dim the lights.
-Okay.
Or turn them out altogether.
No scented candles.
Okay, here. There we go.
Okay, okay.
Making me sterile, but okay.
Okay. I'm sorry. Oh, wait.
Do we have a condom?
Oh, right!
Yes, 98.6. You're gonna be fine.
This is it!
-That's him!
-Great. Go get him!
Wait a second.
Or maybe you could go in first.
He's not really my type.
Not you. Dr. Ramoray. Ask him questions and see what he's like.
-People tell doctors everything.
-You said he was this great guy.
All the guys I meet seem nice at first, then turn out to be big jerks.
-You do attract some stinkers.
-Yeah, I know.
Dr. Long, I've been at this for 17 hours.
Three women have come and gone with their babies.
You gotta give me good news. How many centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?
-Three.
-Just three?
I'm dilated three!
We are moving along just slowly.
Don't worry, you're doing great.
-I'll be back soon.
-Thank you.
You know what? I'm not waiting.
I'm gonna push this baby out.
I'm doing it. Three centimeters.
That's gotta be like this, right?
-Actually, it's more like this.
-Oh, stupid metric system.
We're gonna need to take you straight to the delivery room.
Oh, for the love of God!
It's coming! It's coming!
And here it is!
Oh, come on!
I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray. I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.
Really? I've been dealing with Dr. Wells.
I know. I'm a neurologist.
Just to be on the safe side..
Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview. So he sent me.
Dr. Wells is a woman!
That was a test. Good response.
-All right. Full name?
-Clifford Burnett.
-Date of birth?
-November 16, 1968.
Age?
-Can't you figure that out?
-I'm a doctor, not a mathematician.
-I'm 33.
-Okay.
-And are you married?
-No.
Oh, really? So 33 and single? Would you say you have commitment issues?
Are all the questions this personal?
Yes.
Well, if you must know, I'm a widower.
-Oh, that's terrible. I'm really sorry.
-Yeah.
I lost my wife five years ago to a mild cardial infarction.
-A heart attack, doctor.
-Oh, yeah. Well, yeah, mild car..
Are you experiencing any dizziness?
No.
-Has the pain been getting worse?
-No.
Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
-No.
-Excellent. Excellent.
And finally, are you into any weird stuff, you know, sexually?
-No!
-Wrong answer.
-This room's available.
-Okay! Wait, you listen to me!
Since I have been waiting, four women.. that's four, one higher than the number of centimeters I'm dilated.. have come and gone with their babies.
I'm next. It's my turn. It's only fair.
If you bring in one more woman who has her baby before me, I will sue you.
Not this hospital. I'm gonna sue you.
My husband is a lawyer.
-Rach?
-You get back on that case, honey!
I don't think the next patient is very far along.
Okay. Well, then bring her in.
Oh, my God!
I can't believe this!
And yet, somehow, it's true.
I mean, this is so great.
We're gonna be baby buddies!
Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby's ears.
-Hi, sweetie!
-Hi, sweetheart.
This is my husband, Sid. I don't think you've met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid.
I nabbed him a year ago at the dermatologist's office.
Thank God for adult acne!
I still can't believe it.
I'm the luckiest guy in the world.
Really?
What'd he say?
You have to speak very loudly, he's almost completely deaf.
-Oh, there you go.
-Of course he is.
Congratulations, you two.
I didn't even know you got married.
-Oh, we didn't.
-What?
We're just having this baby together, but that's all, you know.
Why?
We're just not in that place, you know?
But we're very excited about this.
Oh. Well, then shut me up.
Just tell me how.
Oh, I feel another one coming.
Sid, you lucky, deaf bastard.
-What else? What else?
-He's 33.
A widower.
He seemed like a standup guy.
And he's not into anything weird sexually.
Enter Phoebe!
Should we tell Rachel there's an empty private room right next door to hers?
We could. Or we could have sex in it.
Well, let me think about that while I remove my pants!
Okay, mister! Fertilize me!
Does that sound like Janice?
If it's not, then there's two of them.
And that would mean it's the end of the world!
Hey.
-Hey.
-Hi.
I can't believe this is taking so long.
How you doing?
Not bad. You know that feeling, trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?
And soon someone will call her "Mom."
Weirdest thing. Did I hear..?
Mother of God, it's true!
Chandler Bing!
Janice.
Not just Janice. Janice in labor.
Contracting and everything.
Oh, this should be easy.
I have a very wide pelvis.
You remember, Chandler.
I feel so bad for you.
She's your ex. And I have Richard.
Janice, I didn't even know you were pregnant.
Who's the unwitting human whose essence you've stolen?
It's you.
This is yours.
What?
Look how nervous he gets!
We haven't slept together in years!
That's funny. Does it hurt?
Does the labor hurt?
Okay, I've got one for you.
If you had to, which would you eat?
A Seeing Eye dog or a talking gorilla?
I'd have to say the talking gorilla.
Because at least I could explain to him that you're making me eat him.
-Oh. Somebody went to college.
-Yeah.
Wow. What is it? I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. My foot itches like crazy.
Oh. I'll get it.
I usually get to know a girl better before I let her spoon me.
Relax. It's not like we're forking.
When. When.
Thank you. Listen.
You seem to really know what to do with a utensil.
Would you like to go to dinner sometime?
-Yeah, I'd really like that.
-Yeah?
Yeah. And I promise I won't make you eat any remarkable animals.
I was thinking..
I'd kind of like to make a move.
But, you know, with the leg.
Oh, yeah.
Maybe a little help.
Okay.
Let me fix your pillow.
Cliff, you're so forward.
Oh, it was really nice meeting you.
Sid!
That's the first time I heard her voice.
I didn't care for it.
Oh, that's five, Ross.
Five women have had five babies.. and I have had no babies.
Why doesn't she want to come out?
You know what I think it is?
I think you made such a nice home for her.. over the last nine months that she just doesn't want to leave.
Oh, look at you making up crap for me.
-Oh, God.
-Okay. Okay.
Twenty-one hours. You're a hero.
Doctor, you gotta do something!
Get me drugs.. or light a fire up in there and just smoke it out!
Actually, I think you're ready to go to the delivery room.
What?
Ten centimeters.
You're about to become a mom.
Oh, my God. Okay.
Beat you, sucker! Oh, baby.
Is this the same spoon that was in my cast?
You know what?
This one is.
Oh, my God! That's the doctor who was in my room before.
Well, it must be one of those closed-circuit hospital channels.
No, no. That's a soap opera.
This is a very dramatic hospital.
I'm telling you, the guy from that show was here.. asking me all these weird questions.
Okay, Mr. Percocet.
I swear to you, that's the guy.
Okay, Cliff.
Do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?
What probably happened was you were watching this, you drifted off to sleep.. and you dreamt he was here.
Rachel's having her baby!
Which is of no interest to me as a neurologist. I..
That's him! You know him?
Wake up, Cliff!
What is going on?
Okay. Okay. I.. Okay.
I sent my friend, Joey, in here to find out stuff about you.
If it.. You know, if it helps, you came off great.
A lot better than I'm coming off right now.
I don't believe this. You got him to pretend he was a fake doctor?
Fake? Excuse me? Hello?
-You tried making me think I was crazy?
-That was wrong. I'm so sorry.
It's just that I liked you so much.
Can we just start over?
I don't think so.
If I may? You told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right?
Now, maybe it would help if you knew some personal stuff about her.
She was married to a gay ice dancer.
She gave birth to her brother's triplets.
Her twin sister used to do porn.
-We're trying to dial down the crazy.
-Right.
We don't really know each other, so it'd be easy to forget about this.. but there's something between us.
I don't know about you.. but that doesn't happen to me a lot.
-It doesn't happen to me either.
-Me neither!
-The baby! Rachel!
-Right, right!
Oh, I love this scene.
Okay, look. I gotta go too.
But.. What do you say?
Can we just have that dinner?
The triplets.
You and your brother didn't..?
No! No, they implanted embryos.
-Then dinner sounds great.
-Great! Okay.
All right, then I'll see you later.
Our friend's having a baby.
-Her own?
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.
No, she's really old-fashioned.
Push. Push. We're gonna push for five more seconds.
Five, four..
Three, two, one! Oh!
The next contraction should be in about 20 seconds.
-I can't push anymore!
-You're doing great.
Oh, God! Twenty seconds, my ass!
Here we go. Okay, keep pushing.
-Come on.
-Push. Wait.
-I see something.
-What, you do? You do? Oh, my God!
-Don't say "Oh, my God!" What?!
-What is that?
The baby's buttocks. She's breech.
-I thought she had two heads.
-Oh, God!
Is she gonna be okay?
-She's gonna be fine.
-Okay.
She's in a more difficult position, so you have to push harder now.
-Okay.
-That's it. Push. Push.
You're gonna have to push even harder.
-I'm sorry, I can't! I can't!
-Yes, you can. I know you can do this.
I had no idea.
Please, you do it for me!
Let's go. One more time.
One final push. Ready? One, two, three.
Good.
Keep pushing!
Are you okay?
You have no idea how much this hurts.
Keep going! Keep going!
Here we go!
She's upside down, but she's coming!
-Oh, God!
-Oh! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, she's here.
Oh, she's perfect.
Oh, wow! Oh, she's so tiny.
-Where'd she go?
-They're just wrapping her up.
Okay. Well, be careful with her, she's really tiny.
Here she is.
Oh, thanks for coming out of me.
I know. Oh.
She's looking at me. Hi. I know you.
-Do we have a name yet?
-No, not yet.
That's fine. For now we'll just call her Baby Girl Greene.
Oh, no. Baby Girl Geller-Greene.
Hello, Baby Girl.
-Can we come in?
-Oh, come on in.
-Oh, there she is.
-Oh, she's so beautiful.
Here.
Oh, my God. She's amazing.
Oh, I'm so glad you guys got drunk and had sex.
It's incredible. I mean, one minute she's inside you.. and then 47 hours later, here she is.
She looks so real.
You know what I mean.
She's this whole tiny little person.
And she already has eyelashes and knees and..
-What?
-Oh, no, no. It's okay.
For a second, I counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand. So we're good.
-Okay, my turn. My turn.
-Aunt Phoebe.
Oh, baby. Oh, you're so cute!
Oh, I could squeeze your little head.
I won't.
-Honey, what's the matter?
-Nothing. I just can't stop crying.
The doctor said it's normal, with all the hormones, plus you're sleep-deprived.
So. You guys are all sleep-deprived.
I don't see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet.
Oh, God.
-What's the matter now?
-I was reliving it.
Do you know what you're gonna call her yet?
Wait, it's not gonna be Baby Girl?
I thought that was so original.
Actually, we've narrowed it down to two names.
And you know what? I love them both.
So just pick one, and that'll be it.
Wow, okay. Everyone.. this is Isabella.
-Hi, Isabella!
-Hi.
What?
That's not her name.
I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel like an Isabella.
So then I guess Ferdinand is out.
-What was the other one?
-Delilah.
Oh, great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.
So I guess we're back to Baby Girl.
What are we gonna do?
-It's okay. You'll find a name.
-Easy for you to say.
You already know what your kids' names will be.
-You do?
-I had them picked out since I was 14.
Oh, no, it's gonna be named after some snack or baked good, isn't it?
-Well, tell us, what are they?
-Okay. If it's a boy, it's Daniel.
-And if it's a girl?
-I don't wanna say.
Oh, stop. Tell us.
We're not gonna want it.
Okay. It's Emma.
Emma.
See, I don't want it.
Do you have any other totally perfect names that you're not gonna use?
-Take it.
-What?
She's clearly an Emma.
Oh, honey, but you love that name.
Yeah, but I love you more.
Besides, nothing goes with Bing.
So I'm screwed.
Hi, Emma.
Yep, that's you.
You're our little Em.
What's that, honey?
What?
Oh, you want a little cousin?
You want a cousin right now?
Do I look like a giant sperm to all of you, or..?
-That was amazing.
-I know.
Hey, do you realize that we may have just changed our lives forever?
We may have started our family.
In nine months we could be here.. having our own baby.
And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
I love you so much.
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.
You wanna do it again?
This time just for us?
Probably.
Aaron Lipman-Guralnick would like to say hello to his future bride.
Wow, he kind of takes your breath away, doesn't he?
He's a keeper.
Look at the little munchkin.
Don't you worry. By the time you're old enough to date him.. he's gonna have a different nose.
-How you feeling?
-Oh, I'm fine.
I really admire what you're doing.
Just raising her all alone.
I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.
Sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?
Well, then he gets a divorce.
It's Ross.
I'm telling you, Rachel, listen to Janice.
They all say they're gonna be there, until they start their real family.
-That's never gonna happen with Ross.
-That's what I thought.
I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend a weekend with her father.. and little Miss New Boobs.
Really?
I hate to be the one to say it.. but, honey, you two are on your own.
Well, that's.. You know, that's..
We've been alone for the last
20 minutes and we're doing okay.
Maybe we won't be alone.
Because lately things have been happening between me and Ross.
And right before I went into labor, we had this kiss. You know?
So it might be the beginning of something.
-Hey, Janice.
-Oh, hi.
Who's this little guy?
-Aaron, your future son-in-law.
-Oh, no, no.
No.
-I'm gonna leave you three alone.
-Okay.
Man, you see the kid on that nose?
You know what I was thinking about?
That kiss before we left the apartment.
That was something, huh?
Yeah. Yeah, it really was.
But we.. We gotta be careful.
We.. You know, we can't let that happen again, you know?
Right.
-We don't want to go down that road.
-No. That's why I brought it up.
-They didn't have any sodas?
-Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
I was talking to this nurse.
Completely forgot.
And so it begins.
She in there?
Yeah. She's putting her down now.
That's her.
Isn't it amazing how every baby is beautiful?
Except that one.
What is this? A petting zoo?
Look. Look at Emma.
I can't decide who she looks like, you or Rachel.
Oh, what, are you kidding?
She's gorgeous! It's all Rachel.
I'm sorry. For the last time, why aren't you two together again?
No, I know.
Because you're not in that place.
Which would be fine, except you totally are.
It's complicated, okay?
Yeah, that's true.
You love her, you always have, you have a child together.
There's no right answer.
Look, we've been together.
Then apart. Then together, then apart.
And now we have a baby.
It's just, if we got together again and it didn't work out..
I could never do that to Emma.
I mean, she came into this world thinking everything.. Now me.
What, do they put something in the water here?
It's just, Rachel and I, we're doing really well now.
I know. If you try to make it more, you might wreck it.
-Yeah, exactly.
-Right.
Or you might get everything you've wanted since you were 15.
Hey.
I saw a woman breast-feeding twins at the same time.
It is like a freak show up here.
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.
What is it? Hey.
-Really, it's nothing. I'm..
-Rach, come on. What?
I've just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
What are you talking about?
What about Ross?
Please. He'll be with his real family.
The twins and little Miss New Boobs.
Okay, how long was I watching that woman?
I'm just saying that, you know.. someday Ross is gonna meet somebody.. and he's gonna have his own life.
Right?
Yeah, I guess so.
I just never thought I'd be raising this baby all by myself.
That's pretty dumb, huh?
Hey, you listen to me. Listen to me.
You are never, ever gonna be alone.
Okay? I promise
I won't let that happen.
Joey. Oh, sweetie, what would I do without you?
You don't have to worry about that, okay?
Could you grab me my other box of tissues?
-They're under Ross' coat.
-Sure.
Oh, my God!
Joey?
Oh, my God.
Okay.
I've... I've done that bit.
- Got your end?
- No. A bit more.
- Got your end?
- No. Right, got it now.
- Here, John, just pull this .
- Andy, there's only one coming through.
Hang on. Right.
It's stuck on summat.
Well, I need another two of them.
One on the up, lads .
Come on, look sharp .
Mick, off the track. Come on.
John, shift yourself.
Mick, s pade.
Oh, bollocks !
Mick!
- (Train horn)
- Mick, leave it.
- Mick! Leave it!
- (Shouting)
Come on, get off the bloody thing!
Come on, Webby, get up .
There you go, Paul,
I've put you in a piece of lemon cake.
Oh, thanks, Tracy.
- Have I got some?
- You don't like it.
Yeah, I do.
See you later.
- See you, pal.
- Bye.
Come on.
Cheers .
What's all this, then?
That's you.
We're railwaymen, us .
That's what you're gonna be called from now on.
- What, all of us ?
- All of us, aye.
When's that come in?
Well, that's what we're gonna be called now.
Morning, lads .
Er, you'll be pleased to know you don't have to go out straightaway.
- (Chatter continues )
- Oi! Oi!
Excuse me,
I've got something important to tell you here.
There's a briefing I'm gonna tell you about.
Because, er, it's about your new company.
East Midlands lnfrastructure. All right?
I've got a briefing about it here.
So, if you just listen carefully,... er, don't interrupt.
You know, just for once, try and...
- Morning.
- Oh, aye, where've you been?
Toilet.
Toilet, oh. You're not late, are you?
- No.
- No, been here ages .
- Have you clocked on?
- Yeah.
All right. Well, sit down and listen. All right?
Thought it were girls who were s'posed to go to toilet together.
- He won't wake up in the morning.
- I was knackered. Your settee's crap .
- She'll not have him. Too much sense.
- Thank you, Fiona.
Right, now. Hang on, hang on. Listen, lads .
Now then, if there's anyone here not actually based at this depot, because one or two of you lads are on loan from Woodburn depot, aren't you?
So, hands up all those who are on loan from Woodburn.
OK, I'm sorry, lads , but this information is not for you, OK?
So I must ask you to go outside, all right?
- What's he talking about?
- (Laughter)
What are you laughing at?
What is it? Why?
Why have they got to go outside?
Why? Because they're a different company now and I don't want them s pying on us...
- (Laughter)
- ..and pinching our jobs .
Who d'you think we are, James Bond?
Oi. Oi! Oi! Oi! What the hell are you laughing at?
Come on. Keep it down.
- (Muttering)
- Come on, lads .
What, they've got to go?
- Yeah.
- (Chatter)
This is... This is daft, this .
- Listen, British Rail is gone now.
- I'll tell you what he says, lads .
- It's not...
- It's daft, this .
Listen, hang on. It's not like that any more, Gerry. British Rail's gone.
Woodburn depot is now Northern lnfrastructure and they're gonna be competing with us .
All right? Er,...
A... And look, it's all in this briefing.
- All right? Have they gone? Right. Fine.
- They've left door open, they might hear us .
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, come on.
Listen, you're not rail workers any more.
Er, you're now East Midlands lnfrastructure.
For now, anyway.
Er, you don't work for British Rail and we've got to win contracts from the, er, Railtrack company.
Er, and we've got a managing director to... to win the work for us, all right?
- Who's he, then?
- Because now, in the future, just...
- Who is he?
- Just... All right, all right, listen.
Just doing the job is not gonna be good enough in the future. Right?
You've gotta do it well, if we're gonna succeed.
And we've gotta advertise our skills and we've got to have a mission statement.
- What's a mission statement?
- Mission lmpossible.
- (Some laughter)
- Missionary position.
- (Laughter)
- All right, all right, keep the banter down, lads .
Let's keep it serious. This is important stuff you've gotta... you've gotta listen to here.
Look, a mission statement is where we say what we're gonna do...
Er, and then we have to do it.
- I'm off to work.
- (Laughter)
- All right.
- I'm going for a shit.
- (Laughter)
- All right! Come on!
Listen! I've got bloody more important things to do than bloody go on talking to you lads like this .
- I'm going for a shit.
- All right, now come on.
That's the way things are gonna be done in future, right?
Now listen. Because to succeed in the marketplace, we've gotta sell our wares p... carefully.
- And we've gotta...
- (Laughter)
We've got to look after the customer if we're gonna keep 'em.
All right? And we've got to have safety written into the contract.
Er, because if we don't work safely, well, we don't work at all. All right?
- We do work safely.
- And, er...
- Eh?
- We always work safely.
Well, you try, but it's not as safe as when I used to do the job, I'll tell you that.
- Ta(!) That's right on...
- You might bloody scoff, but it's bloody true.
Some of the old lads, I wish they were still here.
Show you bloody lads a thing or two, I'll tell you.
Old Len knows what I'm talking about.
He was one of the lads .
Old Len ha'n't... 'Ere, Old Len ha'n't a bloody clue what you're talking about.
Oh, now listen, hang on.
Now this really is important.
All right. We've had a bit of fun, lads , but now come on, get serious now.
Look, deaths have got to be kept to an acceptable level.
Oi! Hang on! Shut up. Shut up .
- What's an acceptable level?
- Er,... two a year.
- But nobody's been killed for past 1 8 month.
- (Laughter)
- Any volunteers ?
- (Laughter)
- That's daft.
- If you're third one, you're sacked.
Look, I'm just bloody telling you what it says here, right?
Listen. Now then, the final thing is... there's a letter here for each of you.
I want you to read it carefully.
- What's it for, that, then?
- It's about redundancy. If...
- You're going to make it compulsory.
- No, it's not compulsory.
- It... It's up to you whether you accept it.
- Have you got one, an' all?
Gonna buy us off, then. Gonna buy us off.
- That's it. Sell us down the river again.
- Aye.
Are we all getting one of these?
Should do, aye. There's one for each of you.
Are you getting one?
- Michael.
- I don't need one, lad.
- Why, has he got sack?
- John.
- Is this what they call fucking hand-outs ?
- Eh?
- Paul.
- I ain't been here long enough to cop for that.
Come on then, let's be having you!
- Come on, lads .
- We can't do owwt in this, Len. It's wet.
- Easy on them brakes, mate.
- It's raining on me, as well.
Come on. Let's get for'ard and have a look at job. Come on!
He's a bloody nutcase.
Oh, for Christ's sake!
- Morning, ganger, what's job?
- Bloody ballast tamper's packed up again.
- Tamper's broken down?
- Yeah, so it seems .
- What are you having to do? Lay it all by hand?
- All by hand. Sorry.
- There's nowwt we can be doing, then?
- No, no, we gotta hand-pack it.
- How long?
- About an hour. Go and get a cup of tea.
About an hour. Righto. See you in a bit.
- That's it. You got it. There you go.
- Screw it on, then.
- Eh up, lads. Harpic's here, look.
- Ah.
- Oh, there's summat on horizon, anyway.
- (Chatter)
Refit? What've they found?
Right. Right, I want a word. I just want...
I'd just like to know what's going on.
What d'you mean, "What's going on?"
We're getting on with job.
Oh, good, l... I'm glad that.
But, er, what's he doing here?
- Working.
- What d'you think I'm doing?
Working? But he shouldn't, should he?
Because he's not in our company now.
Don't you remember? We are now
East Midlands... er, lnfrastructure.
He... He's Northern lnfrastructure.
Completely different unit. He shouldn't...
He's one of lads. Been wi' us four month.
- Get your... Get your tackle. You've got to go.
- He can't go.
- What d'you mean, "He can't go"?
- Why d'you think he can't go?
- I've signed for this, so I take it. It's mine.
- What...
- Can't do job without meter.
- The meter?
- No, all right, no problem. I'll bring one back.
- When?
As soon as I take him back, I'll get another one.
- At this time of day, with traffic? You're joking.
- I can only do me best.
If he goes... If he goes and takes meter, we might all as well go.
- Well, I didn't know he'd got that.
- Well, somebody let him have it.
I didn't let him have it, did l?
I didn't know he'd bloody got it.
- Look, come on. Come on. I'm sorry.
- I'm off. I'm off. See ya.
Have you got anything else? ls that all you've got? You've got everything?
- No, I've got some stuff on t'van.
- Right, well you better get that, then.
- See you later, pal.
- See you.
- See you later, mate.
- And then there were six.
Might as well get off, then.
- Well, I'm not doing that without a meter.
- He's a prick, him, i'n't he?
- All right, lads ?
- You all right?
- What's going on?
- Leaving, mate. Taking the money.
- What about working your notice?
- Taking us holidays .
If you ha'n't got no holidays , you can take unpaid leave.
- Bloody hell, lads, that's a bit cquick.
- What, and all your gang's took it, an' all?
- Most of us, yeah.
- Eh, Gerry, come and listen to this .
All Walt's lot's took it already.
- You're joking.
- No. He's here now.
- Can't believe that.
- What's all this, Walt?
There you are, Gerry lad. British Rail conditions of service. It's no good to me any more.
Where are you gonna get another job now?
I've no idea, but I'm not sticking it here.
Not what went off this morning.
- Decided already?
- Aye.
Should've waited and had a word.
- Have you signed it, lads ?
- You were a bit hasty there, weren't you?
- Not really, but...
- All the best, lads .
- See you.
- See you later. Take care.
- Loads of service, him.
- What, you've all signed it?
- Aye.
- Well, it's good money for us, innit?
We're not getting any younger.
- See you, Len.
- I'll see you later, Joe.
OK, Len, mate.
Lisa?
(Lisa, very cquietly) Stay there.
- Go... Paul, go away, will you?
- Lisa.
- Lisa!
- Will you just go away?
- Will you open the door?
- No, I'm not. You're not coming in.
- Eh?
- You're not coming in. Will you go away?
I wanted to see the girls, that's all.
I told you, if you wanna see the girls , you've gotta take 'em somewhere else.
- Right, girls, d'you want to go upstairs ?
- Have you had your tea?
- OK.
- Come on, up you go.
- What have you had?
- What about pudding?
You can have it in a bit.
Don't worry, Daddy's not stop ping.
And once he's gone, you can have it.
I'll call you down. You go upstairs. Good girls .
- Lisa!
- Will you just go away?
- I brought you some flowers, love.
- I don't want your flowers, Paul.
Eh? Just open the door so I can give 'em ya.
No, I don't want any flowers from you.
- Just go away.

Look at this. Are we getting a new sign every couple of weeks now then, or what?
Hey, Gerry, what's this frigging notice they've put on t'clock?
- What notice on clock?
- They've put a chuffin' notice on t'clock.
Harpic's just banged it up .
- Harpic has ?
- It's getting fucking ridiculous .
- Oh, fuck.
- What's it say?
You've got a right number, ha'n't you, lads, eh?
Money for nowwt.
Bloody hell.
That's our bloody part-time job gone down t'drain.
- Can't believe he's done it again.
- What about my allotment? I'm in a right state.
- Look at this .
- "All staff must clock off as well as on."
Bastard Harpic. He can't do this .
He should have consulted me first.
- That's what I said.
- I'll go and sort it out.
- What's he done, Gerry?
- That bastard, Harpic.
- What?
- Eh?
Is that Harpic a bastard, or what?
Are you gonna tell him, Gerry?
Are you gonna sort it, cock?
He won't get away with this one.
You tell him.
Oh, hello.
Hello, Gerry lad. What can I do for you?
- This notice that's on t'clock.
- Yeah, well, what's wrong with it?
You know full well you can't just bring in changes like that.
You're sup posed to consult it in first.
Look, Gerry, I mean, you're already here.
We're just asking you to clock out so we know when you've finished.
It's on the time sheets. It was agreed years ago we didn't need to clock off.
- Look, Gerry, we don't want any fraud.
- Are you accusing us of fraud?
Er,... did you not consult this in, Mr Jackson?
Er,... well, no. I didn't think it was necessary.
- Gerry, can you just give us a minute, please?
- Yeah, I'll wait outside.
Thanks .
- (Door closes )
- Bill, I'm only doing as I'm told.
Well, yes, I know.
Um, but it's... how we do it, isn't it?
Hey, Gerry, what did he say?
- It still stands, but I've got us a concession.
- What?
Don't have to clock up on Sunday now, we can go straight to job.
But we don't clock on on Sundays .
That's no bloody concession, is it?
- We don't clock on on Sundays anyway.
- Best I could get.
- Bastard, he is .
- Listen, lads, we can't refuse to stay to time.
- Hey up, lads .
- Chips up, lads .
Forget about it for a minute whilst we have us dinner.
- Maybe we should...
- Gerry. Gerry, just have your dinner.
'Ey, another tin of sardines here.
Bloody hell, you were right, Paul.
- Another tin of sardines, mate.
- Ah, you see, what did I say?
He's a great lad, i'n't he, down at that chip py?
A few bags of chips, free tin.
- Free tin of sardines again, Jack.
- I'll have them. I've nowwt for me fucking dinner.
Tha's joking, mate.
I've been for 'em, I keep 'em.
- Like a bit of sardine, don't you, Jack?
- You, you're a greedy bastard!
(Whis pers) Oh, come on, Trace.
(Whis pers) I don't want to. Paul might hear us .
You shouldn't be thinking about Paul, you should be thinking about me.
- I don't want to.
- Yeah, but I do!
He can't hear us .
You said... that you could hear him moving about.
So he must be able to hear us
He's probably asleep by now.
- (Crash)
- What was that?
Come on, let's get on t'floor.
It'll be cquieter on t'floor.
Look, I just... I don't... I don't want to.
Yeah, but I want to!
(Sighs) Let's just...
Let's just try and go to sleep, eh?
Go to sleep?! How can I get to sleep ?
Fucking hell!
And then, if the... if the... er, if the other men work the overtime in the week, and then we change it around the week after.
So if we go on a rota basis...
Well, obviously we'll have to check these figures ,
Bill, but it looks OK at the moment.
Um, just on more general note, how are things going here?
I mean, is everything on schedule?
I... yeah. I thi... Yeah, I think so.
D'you, er,... D'you think the men are on board?
Er,... well, yeah.
I mean obviously they're... they're a little concerned about the way things are going and...
- Have we met all the troublemakers yet?
- What troublemakers ?
The union men. You know what I mean.
Er, well, we... we've got the, er, the union reps, of course, but...
Usually they follow the agreements and...
I don't normally have any trouble with them.
Can I stop you there, Bill?
There are no agreements .
The slate's been wiped clean.
Er, but we've got local and national agreements that... that go back a... a long way.
- They go back a lot of years and...
- Look, I just said there are no agreements .
It is a clean sheet.
OK? D'you understand that?
(Chuckles) But these...
But these agreements go back...
- Bill...
- ..go back a long... a long way.
Bill, we're wasting time. Anyone who stands in the way of change is out.
OK?
They're out. They can either go voluntarily or they can just go.
(Other man) We... We will give them the choice.
Choice? What choice?
We've got agreements that go back a long way.
We... We... These... We've got agreements for... for promotion and redundancy.
- We have conditions...
- OK.
- Fine.
- I mean, it's...
I understand what you're saying.
No, I understand what you're saying.
Right.
I've signed it already. If you'd just like to write your letter of resignation above that, and I'll accept it this afternoon.
Well,... I...
- This is...
- OK. You don't want to do that.
- Of course not.
- All right. Do this .
That lot you've got down the yard.
What are they?
Signals and telecoms or something, isn't it?
- Signals, yeah.
- You brought in clocking off. Is that right?
- With a bit of a concession.
- I did, yeah.
OK, well tell them the concession's been withdrawn.
- I've only just negotiated it.
- Bill, it's a win-win situation.
You get to keep your job.
I get to know you're on board.
But I need to hear you've done it.
Or that letter gets filled out.
All right, come on, get cracking.
Right. Oh, hello, Jack. Hello.
Right, lads. You're all here, are you? Right.
I've got something pretty important to tell you all and,... er,...
I'm not sure whether you're gonna like it or not, but it's about the clocking procedure.
The Sunday. I'm afraid... that concession's been withdrawn.
- Oh, 'ey.
- I'm afraid so.
Yes, look, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, you've just got to accept it.
- No, you agreed.
But an agreement, well, it could be just a... a... a... an understanding
- which might have been misunderstood.
- You're talking bollocks .
- Oi!
- Just refresh your memory for you, shall l?
- I'll just refresh your memory.
- Oh, here we go.
- Gerry and his famous bits of paper.
- Except on Sundays. Right?
You agreed. Right? It's in the minutes .
- And what's more... is that your signature?
- Yes .
- Is that your signature?
- It is. I'd recognise it, yeah.
That means you signed it.
You have signed this agreement.
OK. I may have done.
But what I'm saying now...
What d'you mean, you may have done, you blind git? Look, that's your signature!
Can you just watch your language, please?
- Well...
- I'm saying that that was my signature then
- Time...
- Have you swap ped it now?
All right, it's still my signature on an agreement.
- He's swap ped his signature now.
- (Sniggering)
- What I'm saying is...
- You didn't mean it, is that what you're saying?
There's something different now. And it's just one of those things you have to accept.
No, we don't have to...
We don't need to accept it because you've already agreed.
All right, Gerry, you don't need to accept it then.
Just go and get your bloody cards .
- (Worker) They're gonna sack you now, eh?
- What about, er...
If you don't wanna accept it, you know what to do.
- Hang on, hang on. Health and Safety.
- What d' you mean, Health and Safety?
- Health and Safety.
- Yeah, well, what about Health and Safety?
That clock shouldn't be in here.
This is our mess room.
Gerry... But that clock is not a Health and Safety issue!
Look, we're entitled, right, to a place away from the workplace, right?
Right. Yes .
- Yes, I agree. Yes .
- So that clock shouldn't be in here.
But it's not gonna poison you, for Christ's sake!
It's not a Health and Safety hazard, is it?
Look, we have to have somewhere to eat, right?
Away from the workplace.
- Yeah, well, this is it, innit?
- What if I ring the Railway Safety lns pectorate?
- Oh, come on, that's ridiculous !
- No, it's not.
You're gonna bring the whole bloody tribe down on us, are you?
Might well do. Unless that clock's shifted.
- That's what I'll do.
- Oh, this is getting ridiculous .
- I don't care what you say.
- I think I've heard enough now.
It's no more ridiculous than you signing that and telling us it's no good.
I can always rely on you, can't l?
You are... You...
I don't believe it. This is beyond reason.
This is absolutely unreasonable. Unreasonable.
- Un-bloody...
- Get up there. Tell them to come and shift it.
Un-bloody reasonable! Read my fucking lips !
Oh, Mr Jackson!
You've upset him now, Gerry, haven't you?
- He signed that bloody thing.
- Who wants a cup of tea?
- I'll have a cup .
- I'll have one, Webby.
Coffee for me, Paul.
See veins sticking out of his forehead there, eh?
Well, I'm bleeding starving.
Does anybody want any chips ?
- Aye, I'll have some chips, Jack.

You know, that section that they mentioned, that they couldn't maintain any more?
We'd have to, er, he'd have to pay to renew.
Did they ever come up with the money for that job?
No, I thought they hadn't.
Have you been on to the lawyers yet?
Right. Get on to them soon as they get into the office.
- Are you in charge, mate?
- Depends. What did you want?
Well, we've been sent up to find out what all t'damage is about.
- And who d'you work for?
- Same as you, Gilchrist.
- You can look round but don't disturb anything.
- All right. No worries .
- Is anybody doing any work round here?
- Come on. We are. Let's get going.
Not meant to be a bloody Cruft's dog competition, is it?
Whatever competition it'd be, he wouldn't fucking win it.

- My, a likely bunch of workers I've ever seen!

- It's a damn sight more than we're getting.
- That's for being in charge, an' all.
- It's more than he got for being in charge here.
- Yeah, but it were a regular wage.
Yeah, on bare time!
I haven't got any money, have l?
Eh? I've gotta buy a flat. I've gotta get furniture.
They've just taken 1 1 0 cquid off me.
I can't live on that, can l?
I'm signing it. Gi' us a pen, Jim.
- You can sod off. I'm not giving you a pen...
- Just give us a pen!
..to sign for voluntary redundancy.
Any road, what gives you right to sell a job?
Gi' us a pen, John.
- What about you, Mick?
- Oh, I don't know, Webby.
It's a big step chucking a job.
It takes some thinking about.
- Well, I've been thinking about it.
- Aye, me an' all. Give us that pen after you.
What's tha want it for?
Tha's not been here long enough.
Look, a few thousand cquid's better than nowwt.

And, on top of that, twice hourly rate.
- Are you gonna sign it or what, Mick?
- Paul, you know I can't just pack a job in!
- Why not?
- I've been made redundant twice before!
You know that!
I'm just beginning to clear me debts off!
Yeah, but if you take your redundancy, you'll be able to clear 'em off!
I've only been here three years .
I haven't been here as long as you.
- I'm due about two-and-a-half grand.
- I'm gonna hand it in.
- Are you coming, or what, John?
- Yeah.
- Listen, think about what you're doing. Just...

- I'll tell you what you're giving up .
- No, hang on, hang on, hang on.
Hang on, hang on. There's five of us here and there's not enough work for us .
But there's plenty out there getting enough work on double pay.
How... How many times have you s poke to us about how low us wages are? A lot.
- Just let me...
- And we can get double wages .
- Don't you think that's an improvement?
- You might only get 1 0, 1 5 hours a week!
And we might not. You might get nowwt here!
- Are you coming, or what, John?
- I'm coming!
- Mick, are you gonna sign it, or what?
- I've got to think about it.
I'll tell you what I think. I think that you're playing right into their bloody hands .
- This is exactly what they want us to do.
- Exactly.
They want us to leave.
The... They're putting us in a position now

- Exactly. We've got no choice.
- Are you coming or what, John?
- Yeah.

- Where are you gonna go when you leave here?
- I'm gonna get a job, aren't l?
- You won't have a base or anything.
- I don't need a base, Gerry.
- What makes you so sure you'll get a job?
- What have you got there?
- Redundancy money.
- How much? And how long's it gonna last you?
- 9, 670 cquid.
- I don't know but I'll get another job like Len.
- Paul, Paul, please!

Jack, you better listen to this. It could affect you.
Right.
- All right, Jack?
- Hiya. All right?
Hiya. (Hums )
Right... Lads, I've a bit of bad news .
I've just, er,... I've just got this fax from Bill, er, Hemmings and, er,... (clears throat) the depot's just about to close.
He said we're not viable. Er, with a small workforce we can't attract the work and... I'm, sorry, but you're all on 1 2 weeks' notice.
Thanks(!)
So, er, redundancy's, er,... voluntary so long as we volunteer?
It's not my decision, Gerry.
I mean, I'm just the messenger.
This affects me, as well.
I don't know what I m gonna do.
Mind you, there are some Railtrack jobs down at Nottingham, Derby.
Nottingham!
But, like, you've got to use your own vehicles to get there, and in your own time.
- You can't just finish us .
- Mick, there's no choice. We're not viable.
Viable! We're not viable?
But we wanna work! I'm not gonna be efficient on t'dole, am l?
But, Mick, that's not how it works, is it?
I mean, you've been to the same briefings as I have.
And what they've said...
If we're not viable, we're not efficient.
And if we're not efficient, we don't attract work.
And at the end of the day there's no jobs for anyone.
So what you're saying, we accept being out of work, otherwise we're out of chuffing work?
- Gerry, are...
- Is that what you're saying?
Are you deliberately misunderstanding me?
What I'm saying is, there's no work and you can't get paid for doing nowwt.
What about this ecquipment we're smashing up ?
Yeah, well, that's OK. But I mean after that...
This is it, it's finished. There's nothing after that.
- So do we still have to come in every day, like?
- Yes, course you do, Jim.
I mean, they're not gonna pay you for sitting at home, are they?
- Well, what about clocking?
- Yes, you're gonna have to clock on and off because, you know, they expect you to put a full day's work in for a full day's pay.
Don't be bloody stupid! We haven't got a full day's bloody work.
Gerry, it's company policy.
We're trying to raise productivity!
Productivity! Produc... Sat in here for 1 2 weeks on our arse, doing nowwt, only chuffing clocking on and clocking off!
Productivity, my arse, Tom!
Gerry, it's about being efficient!
Efficient? Fucking efficient!
You and your fucking clock!
I'll fucking shove it up your fucking arse, mate, you fucking knobhead!
- Hey!
- D'you know why he's fucking management?
Because you were fucking useless on t'tracks !
- Hang on a minute, hang on!
- Fucking tosser!
Mick. Whoa, Mick.
Well, that's fucking charming, innit(?)
- Fucking charming. You do your best for them...
- Hang on, hang on. Look, hey, hey.
- Does this mean everybodys going, or what?
- Yes. Everybody.
Oh, shite.
Jesus Christ! I've just bought a new fucking mop and bucket!
Fucking hellfire.
Brand fucking new, as well.
- (Sighs )
- Have to get a fucking refund on it.
Aye. Me and you, lad.
...you know, travel and do different, er... Ievels of work.
Well, I don't mind doing that but I'd rather, you know, I'd rather do...
Yeah, well, we'll make that as priority.
You know, I'll just put that on your form.
What else d'you get, apart from that?
- I don't understand. What... What d'you mean?
- Well, what else d'you get apart from your pay?
You know, like, er, holiday money, travelling expenses, allowance for work gear.
Er, well you get a contract setting out your pay.
And the hours of work, you know, when we've got the work for you.
- Yeah.
- Er, but that's it. No holidays .
- No?
- And you have to provide your own work gear.
What about sick pay?
No. Then again, if you can't work, then we don't pay you. It's as simple as that.
It's like if you want to go on holiday.
You're not available for work.
- So you don't get paid for that, either.
- Aye.
Er, d'you have a Personal Track Safety card?
- Yeah.
- And a Lookout card. I need to look at those.
So have you got a lot on, then? ls there a lot on right now?
No problem. Yeah.
Thank you. Are you a Sheffield Wednesday fan?
- Yeah.
- I'll not hold it against you.
- Er, that's PTS and that's, er, Lookout card.
- Yeah. Right, just need to write these down.
Now, these have only got a few months left to run.
Um,... now when they do expire, we can get you on the courses .
- Yeah.
- And that's just for P200 each. Each course.
- What, I have to pay that?
- Yeah.
So you're a non-smoker.
So, a non-smoking environment. Fine.
Allergic to house dust.
Yeah. Yeah. I... I start sneezing if I do any dusting.
- Is it a problem?
- No, I don't think you'll be dusting in this job.
I generally wear an 'andkerchief over my face when I'm cleaning the house, but...
- And Elastoplast. Allergic to Elastoplast.
- Yeah, it brings me out in a rash.
- And you recycle plastic cartons .
- Yeah. Don't you?
- No.
- Why? It's important, isn't it?
And kit... kitchen waste all goes on t'beans .
And you were in the Scouts for eight years .
As a sixer.
Yeah.
Well, I thought that would show, um,...
Ieadership potential, cqualities, you know.
- But you don't like doing overtime?
- No. Well...
Er, I've done it. I don't like getting paid for it, cos... I don't think it's fair, really, when there's people on the dole.
Well, that could be useful.
- 'Ey up, Mick.
- All right, Stu?
I'm in t'right place, then?
- All right, Phil? What we doin'?
- Replacing rotten sleepers .
- All right, Don.

- What's wrong with that? It's bloody hard work.
No, no, we're not getting at you lads .
Big day's grafting.
OK, lads? No time to waste.
- You said there were gonna be ten of us .
- Yeah, the agency's let me down on that one.
So, er, sorry about that, lads .
But the sooner we crack on, eh?

You're saying that, mate.
I ain't telling you nothing.
Come on, lads .

If you all get round it, we'll shift it in no time.

Well, there's only six of us, in't there?
Hey up, mate. Come and give us a hand with these sleepers, will ya?

Anyway, you need eight men to lift a sleeper.

I'll go keep a lookout, all right? You get it shifted.

Straight across, mate.

Come on.
Um, well,... you see, I've got me little girls and it's a bit difficult for me, getting anyone...
Downstairs, love. That's it.
Quick, cquick, cquick, cquick.
Just bear with us one second, darling, will you?
Hang on! Let me...
Let me just open the door, love.
- There you go. In you go.
- Shall I go in with her?
- Yeah, you go in with her. That's it. OK.
- What about...?
Right, well, you see, it's five o'clock in t'morning, love.
You know, it's really difficult for me cos I've got my girls, you see.
Um,... right, well, I'll just have to send them back to their mum's .
No. I won't let you down, no.
All right, love. OK. Right. B... Bye.
(Whis pers) Fucking hell!
(Sighs) Bollocks !
(Tracy) I'm here.
Hiya. (Hums )
- (Baby cries )
- Shh.
(Whis pers) It's all right. Shh. It's all right.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, that's it.
Shh, you have a sleep .
What are you doing?
When I asked you to clean it,
I meant give it a wipe round.
Oh, aye, it were filthy, Trace.
(Sighs) Look, can you just... budge out the way for a bit while I sort this shop ping out?
- But I ain't finished.
- Just go in there for a bit, all right?
Look, Mick, we're gonna have to sort something out.
I've got to go and pick Jamie up from school in half an hour and then I'll have to get his tea.
- So what d'you want me to do, then, Trace?
- You're gonna have to put it back together.
- Well, I would if you'd give me a chance!
- Well, all right, then.
You go sort that out and then...
I think when you've done that you should go down to agency and just show your face.
They know me face down that agency, Trace, and they don't like it.
Oh, Mick, I asked you to bring the... stupid washing in!
- (Sighs )
- Well, I got involved wi' cooker, didn't l?
I were only gonna gi' it a wipe and it were that filthy!
Oh, all right!
Have you never cleaned it?
When's the last time you cleaned it?
Look... Please, try and sort something out for yourself, will ya?
I can't do with this, it's driving me mental. OK?
We're gonna have to do summat, though, aren't we? Eh?
You're gonna have to get something
I don't know what.
Go back to doing summat you were doing before.
(Scoffs) Trace, I don't know if you've noticed, like, but steelworks are nearly shut.
Or they're mechanised. All right?
Look, I've been phoning up every morning and I just don't get it.
I know there's loads of work cos all t'lads I used to work wi', they seem to be getting plenty.
Well, the problem is, Mr Williams, you've been getting a lot of bad reports from site.
- Have l?
- You have.
- About me?
- Yes .
I might have been involved in a couple of misunderstandings .
Well, on more than one occasion, the contractors have rung in and s pecifically said not to send you to site any more.
- Have they?
- They have.
That's why you've not been getting the work.
Well, I think... I think that's because
I've misunderstood how things are now.
Well, we can't afford to get a bad reputation as an agency.
I know that. But look, I haven't worked for weeks and I need to work.
I'm... I'm gonna learn... to fit in.
Look, just gi' us another chance.
(Whis pers) Oh, shit!
- (Door opens) Hiya, Gerry.
- Hi, Fi.
- Message from Mr Jackson.
- Harpic? What does he want?
A job up at Holmes, clearing out troughing.
Bit of a rush.
- Troughing job?
- Mm-hm.
There's a lot of work in them.
I'll have to think about that one.
Well, ap parently, contractors haven't turned up .
They've got four men coming from agency tomorrow but you'll have to meet 'em there.
- Oh, I might ring in sick.
- Didn't hear that one!
- So you'll be there tomorrow, then?
- Might be.
Right.
Oh, have you, er, seen or heard from Paul since he left?
No, I haven't. No.
Nothing. Don't even know where he's living.
All I know he's moved out of Mick's, though.
- Just wondered, that's all.
- Oh, right.
- Er, who's winning?
- Checkmate.
- Checkmate? What's that mean?
- Whatever move you make, you lose.
Story of my life.
Fucking 'ell! It's Mungo Jerry!
- Gerry!
- Bloody hell!
- What are you doing here, you mup pet?
- You re not agency workers .
- Who are we?
- You're you.
- Bloody hell! Who's... Who's put you together?
- It's is our new gaffer, innit?
- Gets us all t'best jobs .
- (Chuckles) What a team to...
- I'd sooner have Three Stooges as you lot!
- Get out of it! Chuff it. Anyway, what's job?
Right. What's hap pened, one of t'banks has slip ped, right, so it's knackered all troughs .
Some are broken, some are filled up .
So what we need to do is get cables out, right?
Once you've got cables out, any we can reuse, drag 'em clear. Dig a new bed.
All right, lads, mind your backs. One on.
Oh, one on, Paul.
All right.
Mind your backs, lads. One on.
Clear the cess there.
Lads, hey, listen. Gotta tell you this .
- (Train horn)
- Listen to this .
(Gerry) ..and he come out of the office with his face like a tomato!
Toilet! Toilet! Lads !
- Oh, fuck!
- Fucking 'ell!
Fucking 'ell!
- Fucking 'ell, Jim!
- Yeah, fucking 'ell, Jim!
- Sorry, lads, I shouted "toilet"!
- You blinkin' long streak of piss !
- I'm full of shite.
- I shouted "toilet"!
If you weren't gabbin' so bloody much, you'd've heard me!
- We were only ten yard away from you!
- You're covered in it, Gerry!
- Chuffin' 'ell!
- He's covered in it!
- There's shit and everything in this lot!
- (Laughs) You stink!
- Look!
- You stink!
Gerry, don't go sticking your head out of window, they'll think we're in a bloody horsebox.
Shut your face!
- (Coughing)
- What a stink that was !
(Gobs) D'you think they're gonna let us in?
- Hey, where d'you think you're going?
- For a pint.
- Forget it, mate. He thinks he's coming in!
- Oh, don't be daft!
You're in... You're in charge of a motor vehicle, mate.
- Oh, sod off! You can't pull that one on me.
- Get in the van.
Oh, you lousy bastards! Come on!
I'm not drinking alcohol.
- Hey!
- Get in the van!
- Thanks for that, Karen, love.
- You're welcome.
- Towels are in a bit of mess, like.
- It don't matter. No problem. Thank you.
I dunno.
- Who got these?
- Now then, lads...
- Did you clean it off?
- Come on, then. How's work going, then?
- Eh?
- How's work going?
- Not too bad.
- Had about... two week off since I finished.
Yeah, we're doing all right, mate.
Better than I thought we would, I'll tell you that.
So... if I want more work,
I'll have to pack in work?
Well, I sup pose...
You should've come with us when we came out.
Ah, but what about gaffers ?
Are you keeping them in check?
Well, it's not the same, is it, Gerry?
You know, it's a different situation, all that.
What about tha, Mick?
Have you had to assault any of them lately?
Well, tha knows what it's like, Gerry.
We used to get away with murder, but...
It's like Paul's saying, things have changed.
Things have changed. But I'll tell you one thing, there's plenty of money to be earned out there if you're willing to put yoursen for'ard.
I know there's no sick pay nor nowwt like that, but you know what lads used to be like, taking t'mickey. Odd coupla days, odd coupla days .
It worked out about two weeks a year, they used to swing lead.
- No, I don't agree with you.
- Oh, it's right, Gerry.
Same blokes who wanted set hours at depot.
Them same blokes were same blokes insisting on their rights were same blokes that didn't want to do job in first place.
But I'll tell you what, now, you be flexible like these lads , put yoursen out a little bit, and there's top dollar.
- What time d'you call this ?
- Got a bit held up, didn't l?
(Chuckles) I'll bet.
- What's job, then?
- Huh?
- What's job?
- Oh, concreting a signal base.
- Ohh...
- Aye, I know. Boring graft.
All right, Jim?
I've also been told, while you're all here together, that... if this job is successful and you do a good job of it, there's a lot more work coming off along this line.
So obviously it's to your benefit, and mine as well, that we do a good job.
- We'll get a load more work.
- So how are we gonna get mixer down there?
Well, you can t get mixer down there.
You're gonna have to... mix your concrete here, into buckets, and then rope it over the top of the bridge, down to the track.
- Well, that's gonna take some time, innit?
- There's no other way of doing it.
We looked at actually putting a trolley on the track and it was gonna work out so expensive that we couldn't go that way.
We wanted to be the cheapest bid to get the work. That's why we're doing it this way.
- But there's not enough of us to do it that way.
- Of course there is .
- There i'n't.
- There's gonna be one doing the mixing.
There's gonna be one passing the bucket on the rope down to the bottom of the track.
You'll have a guy then take it from there to the shuttering and you can have a guy putting it in the shuttering and laying the concrete.
That's four. There's four of you.
Jimmy!
All right, lift.
- All right, there?
- You all right, mate?
- There you go.
- Where d'you want it?
- Right.
- You're doing a fine job.
John! John!
- Bloody train's just gone past!
- You're joking!
Good job I didn't have bucket over the edge.
I never heard it.
- Fucking keep your ears open.
- Uh?
- Keep your ears open!
- I know.
- (Shouting)
- What?
- (Shouts )
- John! Knock it off. Paul's shouting summat.
- He's been hit!
- What?
Mick! It's Jim! He's been hit!
You're fucking joking!
Shit! Shit! Bollocks !
Shit!
- Shit, what's hap pened?
- I don't know, I think he must have been hit.
- Just hang on, I'll get a torch.
- Are you all right, Jim?
- Is he all right?
- Oh, fucking 'ell!
Come on, Paul!
Shit!
- Paul, what hap pened, man?
- I don't know.
How the bleeding hell's this hap pened? Oh, shit!
He must have been hit by summat hanging from t'train.
Oh, shit!
Christ almighty, I'll get an ambulance.
- John, John, hang on a minute!
- What d'you mean, "Hang on"?
- Just think about it!
- Think about what? He's injured, man!
- They can't find him here, can they?
- What d'you mean, "They can't find him here"?
If they find him here we're fucked, aren't we?
Think about it. If they find him here, they'll know we've not been working safely.
He's more important than that, than fucking working safe!
- Yeah, but we'll be fucked!
- What are you talking about?
If they find him here, they'll know we've not been working safely. We've had it!
Who d'you think's gonna cop for this ?
Not that subcontractor, Kevin Brown.
- We re gonna cop for it, mate.
- He's worth more than that, mate!
- D'you wanna lose your job?
- Fucking hell! We'll get the signal post!
- Where? Which way? Which way?
- Oh fuck! I don't know!
- Mick, he could be dying!
- I know he could, mate.
- So get an ambulance! Mick!
- John, just listen!
If there's an incquiry, if that control box signal bloke gets involved tonight,... we've had it!
I don't know what you're talking about!
John, just go and get an ambulance!
The man's gone fucking mad!
- Yeah, but if we get him back up there...
- If there's an incquiry, we've all had it.
He's right, mate. And if we get him back up there, mate, he'll get taken care of cquicker.
- We'll get him up here cquicker, mate!
- You might hurt him!
But we can't get an ambulance crew down here till we've got possession!
We don't even know where signal post is !
- He's right, Paul.
- Nobody's checked it.
- You get an ambulance, we'll carry him.
- We'll get him up there cquicker, mate.
- Go on, Paul.
- No, no, I'll do it, I'll do it!
- You go! Go on!
- Are you sure, mate?
- Don't fucking let us down.
- Please! Just go!
Come on, get the shoulders .
Get the shoulders, Paul.
Mick, I can't do it, man!
- Paul!
- I can't do it! I can't do it, Mick.
- Paul, come on, man!
- I can't move an injured man.
- Look, I know we shouldn't...
- We shouldn't move an injured man, Mick.
There's a lot of things we shouldn't do!
I shouldn't be hanging a bucket off that bridge!
We shouldn't be working wi'out a lookout.
But we have!
- How are we gonna explain that?
- Mick, you might kill him!
- He might die if he fucking stays here!
- But you can't go moving him, can ya?
Fucking... Hey! Look... !
- You don't know what damage has been done!
- Paul! Paul! Just help me get him up there!
- But you might kill him!
- He might die if he stays here!
- We'll get an ambulance in two minutes !
- But at least an ambulance'll see to it properly!
Hey, we're gonna lose us jobs .
Paul, you got me this job, didn't ya?
I've only been on it three years .
I've just been six weeks without earning a penny, mate.
I don't know what to... I don't know...
I can't move him, can l?
Paul, listen, if we get him up on there, we'll say car hit him.
What the fuck does it matter if a train hits him or a car hits him?
- It don't matter!
- You can't go fucking saying a car's hit him!
- Why not?
- Because you haven't got a story.
So what we gonna do, then?
Are we gonna get signalman involved?
Incquiry?
Paul, we ain't even got a lookout patch wi' us tonight. I don't know if there's one in van, even.
An ambulance crew's gonna be ages before we get possession.
But you're gonna hurt him if you move him.
- He's already hurt, mate.
- You might even kill him.
- Yeah, we might kill him if we leave him.
- Think about it.
We might kill him if we leave him.
- Oh, Mick... We shouldn't be doing this .
- I know we shouldn't. I know we shouldn't.
We shouldn't be doing this .
- Come on, let's get him up. Yeah?
- All right. Come on.
Come on, Jimmy. All right, Jim.
- (Jim groans )
- Steady with him, Mick.
Come on, Jim, we'll have you up in two minutes .
Steady. Steady.
Yeah, I'm under his legs .
All right, one, two, three...
- Are you all right, Jim?
- I've got him. Just try and be careful.
It's all right, Jim, mate, we'll get you up here and get an ambulance.
All right, Jim.
Come on. All right, Jim.
Steady! Steady, steady.
Go on.
Oh, fuck! Oh, it's tangled up .
- (Jim groans )
- Have you got it?
Oh, I've got it! Oh, fuck!
Get on that grass bit there. It's too muddy.
Fucking hell!
Fucking hell, he's a heavy bastard!
- Give us a hand, John.
- They'll be here in a few minutes, mate.
- Is he still breathing?
- Yeah, he's all right.
Just put him down here.
Come on, just here, just here, just here.
- Steady, steady.
- (Breathe heavily)
- Shit!
- Just watch his head, watch his head.
Right.
Jim... Jim were up here...
..mixing concrete.
And you were coming down with a bucket of stuff...
(Breathes heavily) You heard a car s peed past... and you heard a thud.
You shot back... and you found him lying like this .
- John? Yeah?
- Yes .
- That's all you know.
- Aye.
- Paul? Paul?
- Yeah, mate, yeah.
Good. Right then.
Jim, if you can hear me, mate,...
..you were hit by a car.
You weren't down side of track.
You weren't hit by a train.
You were hit by a car. All right, mate?
Just hold on, they'll be here soon.
- Oh, here they are, look, here they are.
- Thank Christ!
- You're all right now, Jim.
- Just watch him. I've got him. Watch him.
You all right, Jim?
Here you go, mate.
You all right, lads ?
- All right.
- All right, Gerry?
- What a bad do, eh?
- Terrible, mate. Terrible accident.
So, er,... when's funeral, then?
Tuesday morning, mate. Eleven o'clock.
Up at, er, up at City Road cemetery.
Is, er,... there gonna be an incquiry?
Nay, there's no need.
Well, they know what hap pened, don't they?
What? Hit and run?
Yeah, mate. Yeah.
So, er,... where were you lads when it hap pened, then?
- Working.
- We were working down embankment.
So... where were Jim? On his own?
- Yeah.
- He were up top, on bridge. Mixing cement.
- So nobody got number plates or owwt like that?
- No.
I've got his bag anyway, look, Gerry.
There's his pen in there, an' all.
I thought somebody could take it to his mother's .
I thought it could be you.
- Well, why don't you take it round?
- He res pected you more than me, didn't he?
Yeah, but she's... she's gonna as k some cquestions, you know.
- She should talk...
- She'll still be in shock.
We'll see her after t'funeral.
- Is that Harpic not about, then?
- There's nobody here now. Just me, that's all.
- When do you finish, then?
- Next Friday.
- He's still here, then.
- Don't see him much. Not seen him for ages .
- Now then, Bill?
- Hi, Gerry.
Hiya.
I've... just had a phone call this morning about Jim. Is it right?
- Yeah, it's right.
- Tragic, mate.
What a waste.
Did he... Did he know anything about it?
Was he... aware of it?
No.
He were a good mate.
You know what, we s pend all this time and money and effort making the railways safe and he gets hit by a car.
- Yeah, the roads were really bad that night.
- Yeah, yeah. I know, yeah.
Terrible.
Look, l... I'm sorry, lads, but I've got one or two things to wrap up in the office...
- Yeah, we've gotta go.

- See you later, Bill.
- See you on Tuesday, Gerry? Gerry? Tuesday.
You will take it round, won't you, Gerry?

Hi. 
Hi. 
How are you doing? 
Fine. 
I'm sorry I didn't
show up yesterday. 
It's okay. 
I missed you. 
But what for
What for so much sky
What for so much sea
What for
What good is the wave that breaks
In the morning breeze
What good is the morning
Useless landscape
Forget it, Pedro Paulo.
It's over.
- Things don't end this suddenly.
- Yes, they do.
No, they don't.
Look, I don't know if things end this way or not... but what we had together is over.
We'll go on Saturday, then.
For one night.
You can choose a romantic inn.
Pedro Paulo, my darling.
Former spouses don't travel together to romantic inns.
Technically speaking, we're not former spouses yet.
Technically speaking,
I wouldn't travel with you... if my life depended on it.
MasterJockstrap won't let you go?
If you break into my apartment again...
- Our apartment.
- My apartment.
And you're forbidden to go in when I'm not there.
Does theJapanese guy look sexy in his jockstrap?
He's notJapanese.
He's Chinese.
These Orientals are perverted.
Has he asked you to perform any strange acts yet?
There are no "strange acts" for people with open minds.
Don't let him tie you up in bed.
These guys will steal your furniture.
What do you mean "these guys"?
Have you gone mad?
Japanese always travel in groups.
Give me back the key.
Come on.
I'm sorry.
- I was swimming.
- No problem.
Good morning, Miss Simpson.
- How are you doing this morning?
- Fantastic.
In English, please, Nadine.
You're not going to ask me about Gary?
Yes. Your Internet romance.
How's it going?
- Yesterday he said he loves me.
- What?
Really?
He signed off,
" Love, Gary."
Nadine, you mustn't read too much into that.
Americans use the word
"love" very casually.
We say "I love you" like you say "Good-bye."
" Hi. You must be Gary.
I'm Nadine.
I came all the way from Brazil to see you only."
Just to see you.
- Okay. Just to see you.
- Right.
"I know that I don't know you very much."
- Very well.
- Thank you.
No. I don't know you very well.
- " But you don't know me either."
- Ei-ther.
" But I am sure, deep inside my heart... that you are the person of my life."
You know, you don't say
"person of my life."
You'd say "man of my life."
I think "soul mate" is more romantic.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.
Vermont Associates.
I'm sorry.
Who are you?
Your new law intern.
It must be some mistake.
I don't have an intern, old or new.
Is this Mr. Pedro Paulo's office?
That's me, but at the moment
I need no intern.
New Resolution #5, 7 83/99 requires that... five percent of the payroll of law firms be made up of interns.
Yes.
So you're my five percent.
I ranked third among the 23 candidates for this job.
Your first assignment:
Take these papers to Mr. Juan Alvarado, my father... and return with them signed.
Copacabana,
534 Duvivier, suite 902.
I'm not a messenger.
I'm a law intern.
For your information, my father is a client.
I'm defending him in a lawsuit in divorce court.
Aren't you going to write down the address?
534 Duvivier, suite 902.
"Alvarado Custom Tailors
Refined Clothing Since 1 938"
Senor Juan, please.
- Who would like?
- Who would like what?
Senor Juan.
I would like Senor Juan.
Who would like to speak to Senor Juan?
I have some papers for him to sign.
He's with a client.
You can leave them with me.
Sorry, but I have instructions to bring these papers back with me, signed.
You can wait, then.
- I don't need the Internet.
- You think you don't need it.
- I don't need one of those, either.
- Soon you'll say you don't need man.
Well, for the last two years.
Two years?
No man?
- Or the Internet.
- The best place to find a man.
What ever happened to dinner and a movie?
A guy who spends his nights in front of a computer has to be a good date.
He's not married, and he doesn't sleep with a lot of girls.
Maybe there's a reason he's not married.
Maybe there's a reason he doesn't sleep with a lot of girls.
Maybe... he's not even a man.
How do you say...?
- Don't knock it till you've tried it.
- Yeah, that's it.
Tonight come by my house and we'll go into a chat room together.
- I don't think so.
- Tonight. Promise.
- We'll see.
- Okay.
I'm sorry.
I thought it was a robbery.
Nadine, I'm sure you recognize Acacio... and this is Gordo, his manager.
Gordo is more than my agent.
He's my buddy.
In English, please.
- Sorry.
- Hi. How's it going?
Acacio's going to play in England.
I know. I saw it on TV.
Speculation.
Nothing's signed yet.
- Twelve million is cheap.
- You're crazy!
Acacio was the top goal scorer in the last two Rio championships.
If I were him,
I'd only sign for 1 5.
Acacio was the top goal scorer in the last two Rio championships.
She's right.
Twelve million is too little.
Acacio is a great player.
Thanks, but I don't need anyone to defend me.
You watch and see if he's not the best.
Senor Juan.
That's me.
Can we talk for a moment?
Of course, Mr. Vermont.
Have you finished the American contract?
Not yet.
It's almost ready.
You know, Americans are sticklers for details.
I come from three generations of tailors.
- Details are my specialty.
- I know.
It's just that you...
This piece of junk is really badly designed. Sorry.
You seem tired lately.
As a lover of justice, you should understand... that I'm going through a difficult moment.
- Recent separation...
- Four months is not so recent.
Right, it's not... but then there's my father's case against his latest wife.
The judge is going to rule this week.
Juan. How is he?
He's all right... but I want him to stay away from all the dirt in the case.
Welcome to England, Acacio.
Are you going to miss Brazil?
Yes, I am.
And what do you think you're going to miss most?
Especially you.
What have you got to say to your new fans in Manchester?
Hello, Manchester people.
I love you.
Sorry to interrupt, but this is the fourth class that I've been at.
Your grammar is perfect, but I disagree with the subject.
Really?
Gordo wants to change the program.
Wants.
Adapt the curriculum to Acacio's basic needs in England.
And these basic needs are?
Trash talk.
Yeah. The bad is good, teacher.
The English play an Anglo-Saxon-style soccer.
He won't last five minutes on the field... unless he can tell his opponent what to do with the ball.
And what, exactly, do you want to tell your opponent to do with the ball?
To put in their ass.
Inside of their ass.
At least up his mother's ass.
"Shit" is merda in English, right?
Right.
Go to shit.
- No, that doesn't really work.
- No?
Don't you have anything with "ass"?
You can "kiss it."
Kiss it my ass.
Better. What does it mean?
Oh, shit.
I don't know. Acacio asking an English player to kiss his behind?
Trust me. No one's going to think it's an endearment.
How would you say
casa do caralho in English?
I know.
I look in the dictionary.
It's "home of the dick."
Right?
You need something with "fuck" in the middle.
How do they say it?
" Motherfucking."
No, "motherfucker."
In American films it's "modafucka"!
Who's the teacher here?
Him or me?
Sorry.
Fat, wait for me in the car.
The good old ear test.
How are you doing, son?
My fingers, my eyes can deceive me... but never my ears.
The fabrics speak to me.
I can't hear a thing.
I know. That's why I didn't insist that you follow in my footsteps.
The fabrics tell you what type of clothes they want to be.
You'll never forgive me for not being able to listen to the fabrics.
Who am I to forgive anyone?
I don't defend universal truths.
I defend my own truths... but look where it's gotten me.
It's made you an extremely elegant old man.
What good is elegance... in these days of jeans and T-shirt?
Women don't look for elegance anymore.
They only look for money.
Four wives... my mother in the '50s, yours in the '60s... another one in the '7 0s... and he ended up in trouble with this one in the '90s.
If Veronica ends up with this shop...
This place is my life.
- We're going to win, right?
- Yes.
What do you want?
No rush.
It's just that...
High quality.
It would make a nice suit if it weren't for the color.
But Dad, my idea was to make a Campari-colored suit.
If the cloth cries out to be a suit, it can make a nice suit... even if it was born Campari.
Excuse me.
May I help you?
In English, please.
The lady that went in the elevator...
Is that a student?
No.
I think that I know her family...
No, no. She's a teacher.
Hi, sweetheart!
Ready for cyberspace? 
I just got in a very exclusive chat room.
A friend has just arrived.
She's an Internet virgin.
You do this every night?
No.
On Thursdays
I eat at my mother's... then I come home and take a Valium.
Wouldn't you rather meet someone live?
In a real place?
Like at the beach?
And compete with those teenagers who live at the gym?
No. Thank you.
By any chance... do you meet live people in real places?
No... but I don't want to meet anyone.
Everyone wants to meet someone.
I already met the person
I was supposed to meet... and I married him.
Are you divorced?
No. Widowed.
I'm sorry.
No, Nadine.
It's not like I'm some traumatized madwoman.
Okay, but I am.
Must be Gary.
" Love is a virus... that infiltrates itself... in the system of two lovers.
Yours, Gary"
He didn't sign off"love," but there are two "loves" before.
It's good, no?
Remember me?
Of course.
My public defender.
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- What?
Far out.
Can I try it?
Far out.
I need to tell you
that I love you
I could win or lose you
But I need to tell you
that I love you
Beautiful.
You have mine.
I have yours.
Miami I can get you for $7 50.
It has to be New York.
Can I just buy a one-way ticket?
There's a flight with stopover in Paraguay for $650.
$650... It's still a little high.
No, thanks.
You can't get a hotel in New York for less than $7 0 a day.
I'm staying with my boyfriend.
- He has a loft in Soho.
- Can't he lend you some money?
No, he doesn't know me yet.
Your boyfriend doesn't know you?
No. What I mean is, not in person.
I see. He's just heard about you.
We have an Internet romance.
The Internet. Really?
It'll be six months in April.
You're my second client who's found someone on the Internet.
There was a girl from Goias State, not bad-looking... rather provincial, who married a French computer professor.
Gary is a visual artist.
An artist makes a lot of money in the US.
Americans respect artists.
Yesterday he told me that he loved me.
I get goose bumps talking about these things.
6'2", waist-length hair.
Any tattoos?
He only mentioned one: a huge tribal symbol on his back.
You're going to meet this Gary.
I'm going to give you a discount
I wouldn't give my own mother.
Fifteen percent.
Thank you.
" Marjorie and Jo-Jo live and work in New York City.
They have been married for one year.
- They have a big dog called Rex."
- Settle, people.
"They live in a very big apartment on Fifth Avenue."
Fifth.
Shut up!
Shut up, guys.
She said, "Shut up!"
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Welcome.
Thank you.
- Son of a "beetch. "
- Son of a bitch!
- Good!
- What's the difference?
Bitch is a female dog.
Beach is the sand by the ocean.
- English, please.
- Asshole.
- Fuck you, slut!
- Up yours, dickhead!
- Eat my shorts.
- Blow me!
- Motherfucker!
- Cocksucker!
Shit, that's very sexy.
For that... the referee will give you a red card.
It's a big soccer game tonight.
The national team is playing.
It's on the TV.
- Is Acacio playing?
- I'm sure.
Well, let's get started, then.
Why don't you open to page 3 5 and read?
Do you prefer on the top or below?
I beg your pardon?
The reading.
I should read on the top?
You mean, should you stand up?
I'm sorry. Yes.
- Stand up. Do you prefer?
- No, you're fine.
" Marjorie and Jo-Jo love romantic evenings... and romance in New York City always starts on Broadway."
" Marjorie and Jo-Jo love romantic evenings."
Sorry.
"They enjoy fine restaurants."
I've been searching for a fabric
the color of this bay... 
for some time now. 
I'm serious. I love this color... dirty green.
You're putting me on.
Wow!
Your eyes are the color of this bay!
Man, you're weird.
They are! Look at me.
Look at me.
Let me check.
Incredible.
Exactly the same color.
You're the first person that says they're green.
But they are... dirty green.
I think so too, but everyone else thinks they're brown.
No.
That guy who works with your father...
- Which one?
- The one from Niteroi.
Roberto.
He's not gay, is he?
No.
Not as far as I know.
Why?
I don't know.
He's just weird.
He's my brother.
Don't worry.
He's just a half brother.
Then I just half embarrassed myself.
Mr. Pedro Paulo's office.
It's Sharon.
Sharon, the intern.
Hello, who is this?
Since when do you have an intern?
Jealous?
Me? Jealous?
Are you mad?
I'll be right with you.
Take a seat.
I just called to check something.
I'm filling out a questionnaire in a magazine.
Did you ever make number two in front of me?
What?
Number two.
You know, in the bathroom.
Poop?
No, of course not.
I knew it. 
Thanks for clearing that up.
Good-bye.
Seven years of marriage... and we never made number two in front of one another.
Really?
Seven years and not once.
Cool.
And how about you and Gary?
What? Poop?
No, silly, your virtual romance.
Enough virtual.
No more talk.
Cock.
How long does it take to get a visa?
" New York City is the financial capital of the world."
World. Roll your "r."
" Downtown, on Wall Street... is the World Trade Center... and the Staten Island ferry."
Staten.
- Miss Simpson?
- Yes?
- Who's it from?
- I just make the deliveries.
Thank you.
"On Wall Street is the Stock Exchange."
Let's start from the beginning.
" New York City is the financial capital of the world."
Good.
" Downtown, on Wall Street, is the World Trade Center... and the Staten Island ferry."
So, what's the growth rate?
About five percent per year.
They say that after a certain age... your belly becomes your wealth index.
That explains why I'm always broke.
Everything went well downstairs.
And the girl?
Is she pretty?
Very pretty.
- Good night.
- Bye, Mrs. Simpson.
- Very good.
- Thank you.
Here we are.
Let's get in.
- Are you coming?
- No, it's full.
- We'll squeeze in.
- You count for two.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Beautiful blouse.
- Thank you. It was a present.
Your boyfriend has good taste.
No, I don't have a boyfriend.
I'm guessing it was from a pupil.
- What?
- Pupil. Aluno. 
Someone from our class?
No, he's a private student.
Dr. Vermont.
What are you doing here?
Learning English again?
I would like to introduce you to my girlfriend, Mary Ann.
She teaches English here.
It's a pleasure.
Ricardo was a pilot.
I was a stewardess.
That's how you met?
Flying together?
No. We worked for different airlines.
I met him at a party.
A month later we were married.
Love at first sight.
It happens.
It just happened to me.
How did he die?
Plane crash?
No. He drowned.
The current was very strong that day.
It's a funny thing.
I used to be afraid of the ocean.
I never learned to swim.
Now I swim every day and I'm afraid to fly.
Crazy, huh?
- Waiter, another caipirinha, please.
- Right away.
I'm scared to drive.
You're kidding.
No. Never learned.
Never wanted to.
My wife said that's because
I am without ambition.
That I have no direction in my life.
If it's any consolation...
I think ambition is highly overrated.
Are you all right?
Just can't drink like I used to.
I like the sand.
It makes me feel grounded.
- I have a confession.
- What?
I have to make you a confession.
- What?
- The blouse.
I sent it to you.
You?
It's the first women's clothes
I made in my life.
I'm not sure I finished it right.
Wait, wait.
You made the blouse?
My father has a tailor shop.
I didn't pick up the scissors for 20 years.
You made this blouse for me?
Really?
I'm an attorney.
Attorneys don't lie.
Not outside the courtroom.
You're okay?
Great.
Is Mary Ann in?
Yes.
I'm her student and I dropped by to clear up a question.
- A question?
- Yes. An English question.
You know, those questions that keep you up all night?
No.
Well, I woke up with this question pounding in my head... and decided to drop by.
She's inside looking for the grammar book.
Did you found the grammar book?
Are you an old student of hers?
No. I just started this week.
Cute, isn't she?
Who, her?
I didn't really notice.
She has a marvelous little ass.
A beautiful ass.
Don't tell anyone... but some really crazy shit has gone down between us.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Always at the end of class.
I see.
What type of
"really crazy shit"?
The first time,
I was about to leave.
She came up from behind me...
and took me to school
with her tongue. 
The second time, I told her
about this knee injury. 
That night, against Argentina...
Three to one.
You scored a hat trick.
Miraculous tongue.
Better than Ben-Gay.
Did you found the grammar book?
Teacher, let's go.
Fuck.
- Fuck your mother.
- Fuck your mother's mother.
Kiss my dick!
Absolutely not.
I told Gordo an apartment with an ocean view.
Yes.
Is there at least a lake or a lagoon?
All right, then something with a river view.
I need to speak to you.
About last night...
Did something happen between him and you?
Okay.
How am I supposed to know
London's not on the ocean?
- How do they say that?
- I'll explain tomorrow.
No, no, tomorrow
I talk to English people.
The next day, then.
Speaking of meetings,
I just remembered.
May I use your telephone?
My client has the final say, or the deal is off.
Okay. I'll see you in court, then.
Good-bye.
Lawyer?
- Do you do contracts?
- It's my specialty.
- See you.
- Who's the suit?
Another student of hers.
Good people.
He's gonna take a look at the contract.
Lawyers, lawyers.
- Hi, Pecanha!
- Hi, miss!
Hey, where do you think you're going?
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome aboard Mary Ann Airlines.
Destination: Heartbreak City.
Fasten your seat belts, folks.
It's going to be a long and lonely ride.
Pilot's dead, crew's out to lunch... but, hey, have a nice flight.
Son of a bitch.
You left me.
Why can't I leave you?
Calm down. Concentrate. 
Use the Silva Method. 
- The what? 
- The Silva Method of Mind Control. 
Silva's Mind Control.
You place your three fingers like this and then concentrate.
Is that by that Chinese guy?
The Silva Method.
Haven't you ever heard of it?
- No.
- Everyone knows the Silva Method.
Everyone but me.
The little blue book,
The Silva Method. 
It was the rage back in the '80s.
I've never heard about the fucking method, all right?
I'm sorry, Tania.
It's just that...
I heard they give freelancers a hard time.
Relax. You don't look poor.
Just stay cool.
I'm gonna say... that I'm a very sought-after professional.
And that you would never work as a waitress in a foreign country.
Only use that if he gives you a hard time.
What if they ask how many dollars I have?
Lie. Tell them $3,000.
What if they want to see the $3,000?
Me?
Hi. How are you?
What is the purpose of your trip?
Do I need a purpose?
I didn't know that I needed a purpose.
- Purpose?
- Where are you staying?
In Gary's loft.
Who is Gary?
- My boyfriend.
- Is Gary an American citizen?
Yes. I believe he is.
I don't know.
I'm not sure.
What is Gary's address?
W-W-W dot...
Excuse me, honey.
I'm her travel adviser.
Is Sylvia, the Consul's secretary, in?
We belong to the same gym.
May I have a word with her?
You eat too fast.
It's bad for your health.
Hello?
You won't believe this.
I just got an E-mail from Gary!
- He's coming to Rio! 
- When?
Tomorrow! He wants my phone number so he can call me when he arrives.
Did he say what time? 
Nothing. No arrival time, no flight number.
It says he's coming
for 'professional reasons. "
But he signed it, "Love, Gary. "
Well, if it says " Love, Gary," then...
Can I call you right back?
Tania, are you okay? 
Do you want to spend this weekend with me?
I do. But tomorrow I have to pick up a gringo at the airport.
You don't want to travel with me anymore.
That's not it. It's just...
And theJapanese guy?
What? Soup. What soup?
Wait a minute.
"3:00 p.m. at the offices of'...
I'll call you later. The judge is going to render a decision in Juan's case.
- Should I notify your father?
- No. I'll talk to him later.
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
Is Juan with a client?
Yes.
Sharon?
Did the judge rule in favor of Veronica?
I told him I wasn't an expert in these types of cases.
Okay, I'll see you next week.
"Never give all the heart... for love will hardly seem worth thinking of... to passionate women, if it seem certain... and they never dream that it fades out from kiss to kiss.
For everything that's lovely is but a brief, dreamy, kind delight.
O never give the heart outright...  for they, for all smooth lips can say... have given their hearts up to the play.
And who could play it well enough if deaf and dumb and blind with love?
He who made this knows all the cost... for he gave all his heart and lost."
In English, please.
Is my class finished already?
Your class finished early this evening.
The teacher wasn't feeling well.
- Miss Simpson is not home yet.
- Are you sure?
She went to the English course.
She'll be back later.
I know, but...
Thanks.
- Mr. Collins?
- Yes.
- Trevor Collins?
- Yes. I said yes. Do you speak English?
Yes. My name is Pedro Paulo.
Yes. You speak English.
And what is your name?
- Pedro Paulo. Peter Paul.
- Nice to meet you. I'm Trevor.
- It's my laptop.
- That one, maybe?
No, no. It's okay.
I can handle it.
- First time in Brazil?
- Yeah.
I've been to Colombia and Venezuela before, but never Brazil.
Brazil is not like
Colombia and Venezuela.
They speak Spanish.
We speak Portuguese.
They invented mambo.
We, bossa nova.
- Hi.
- Miss Simpson isn't back yet.
- Did she go swimming?
- Yes.
Dad?
"With his feet in London, but his head in Rio"
Hello, my friend.
Isn't this Pedro Paulo's office?
Yes.
Gordo, wait.
He told me to drop by so he could look at my contract.
He'll be back soon.
He's picking up a gringo at the airport.
We can't wait.
We have a very important meeting.
1 1:30 a.m. with the English at the Sheraton.
It's all here.
These papers are too much.
- Too much.
- Too much.
I think your first mistake was to agree to meet at their hotel.
It's the enemy's territory.
An important meeting like this should be held in a neutral place.
It should be at a steak house.
Not bad!
Then you could stuff the English with sausages and caipirinhas...  then get them to sign a clause of transitory irrevocability.
- Please, have a seat.
- Thanks.
That would mean one million dollars more by the end of the contract.
Do you speak English?
Does the rain in Spain stay mainly in the plain?
I'm not usually this stressed, 
you know? 
It's okay.
I'm a little bit stressed too.
Sorry about the air conditioning.
Cookies, cookies.
Take two, pay for one.
Thanks.
It's good.
I'm supposed to meet someone here in Rio.
A girl.
- Brazilian girlfriend?
- No.
Not a girlfriend yet.
Just an incredibly hot cyberspace pen pal.
- Is she pretty?
- She was the "Girl From Ipanema."
Excuse me?
She said she won the "Girl From Ipanema" contest five years ago.
- Then she's very beautiful.
- Really?
- Not that I care about that.
- You should care.
Garotas de Ipanema are very exceptional.
Well, Internet lovers.
You know, people can say anything.
I told her I was a Soho artist and my name is Gary.
Why did you say that?
So I could attract the kind of women that Soho artists attract.
Wild.
Outrageous.
Erotic.
Hip, cool chicks, you know?
I know.
Corporate law isn't exactly a babe magnet.
That's true.
Do you think she'll be disappointed?
No.
This clause is a trap.
Let's cut it.
This one can stay, as long as they pay in case of annulment.
Sharon, something happened.
Roberto, call me in 20 minutes.
I'm with a client. Bye.
This clause makes no sense.
Only in their fucking dreams.
Are you an attorney?
No, Gordo.
She's a manicurist.
Keep going.
This is a recording.
The number you have reached has been disconnected.
Oh, my God!
Is she gonna be okay?
Take a look at it.
" Unless one of the parties stipulates a clause to the contrary."
I dig.
Is it my impression... or are you rubbing up against me?
It's your impression.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Please show him out.
Excuse me, but who are you?
Gordo.
I can see that, but why are you standing there?
Private meeting.
- Hi, Vermont.
- Tania, what a surprise!
Everything okay?
- Who's that man?
- He's Acacio's bodyguard.
- Is Pedro Paulo in?
- I think so.
Pedro Paulo, it's me, Tania!
I need to speak with you.
- Call the police!
- I'm gonna go in.
- Let me in.
- I'm calling the police.
I can't believe this.
This is incredible.
I got a cramp in my leg, and I couldn't swim.
- It's all right. Relax.
- I wanna go home.
The doctor wants you to stay an extra hour for observation.
- You want me to call someone?
- No, there's no one.
Nadine, what would I have done without you?
You look so beautiful.
I have good news.
What?
Gary's coming to Rio.
All the things people say about Brazil... the violence and such... they exaggerate, because Brazil is also friendly...
- You have to let us in!
- This is absurd! It's my firm!
Dr. Trevor, welcome.
How was your flight?
Very good.
- What's going on here?
- Pedro Paulo is in a private meeting.
- I'm Pedro Paulo.
- Remember that.
- Isn't he Acacio, the soccer player?
- Hi. What's up?
Were you fooling around in my office?
- I was here with your partner.
- What partner?
Sharon.
You can't invade my office, put your goon outside... and jump my intern.
I saw them fooling around.
May I use your phone?
You didn't have something crazy with Sharon too, did you?
You can't have crazy flings with every woman in town.
Hello?
Who is this?
Mr. Peter Paul's office.
Please...
- You speak English?
- No.
Please tell him...
Juan is in the hospital.
Lagoa.
Emergency.
Sharon is not authorized to speak for the firm.
Someone named Juan...
Excuse me!
Someone named Juan, I think, just had a heart attack.
Calm down.
And I hung up the phone on him!
It's not your fault he had a heart attack because of the bakery.
Tailor shop!
- Mary Ann?
- Pedro Paulo.
How did you find out?
He's in intensive care!
Nadine, do me a favor.
Find out why those people are here.
Excuse me.
- Do you speak English?
- Yes, fluently.
- You're a friend of Peter Paul's?
- Kind of.
Are you all right?
I mean...
- I'm fine.
- Good.
Could I borrow a quarter?
I've just arrived in Rio... and I will try to get a hold of you at your other number.
Bye-bye.
Excuse me.
I need another token.
I am so sorry to bother you again, but I need to call this girl.
- Girlfriend.
- Love is a virus.
Hello.
- Hello. Nadine? 
- Who's this?
It's me. Gary.
Where are you?
I'm right behind you.
Pedro Paulo, what's wrong?
Nadine, what are you doing here?
That's Gary.
So you don't work in the multimedia area.
Almost.
I'm in mergers and acquisitions.
And your loft in Soho?
New Jersey... and I don't think technically it could even be called a loft.
I lied too.
I'm not the "Girl from Ipanema."
Really?
For when we leave this world...  we actually do not leave.
We remain in the hearts... of those who loved us.
That is why... the dead sometimes seem so alive... and the living seem so dead.
Juan Alvarado, my old friend... you left us... but you remain inside us.
How dare she come here!
She must be riddled with guilt.
Excuse me.
Want something to eat?
- Do you have a beer?
- I have Kirin.
What?
Kirin. Japanese beer.
That'll do.
Everything will be fine.
Yes.
- What did you tell him?
- TheJapanese guy?
Chinese.
I told him I was going back to my husband... and that I still loved you a lot.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Let's open to chapter 3 5.
Who would like to start reading?
London.
I'm gonna make a tape.
I realized I might never hear these songs again.
Piaf was infallible.
Mother said I was conceived during " La Vie en Rose. "
For me it was Charles Trenet.
" Que reste-t-il? "
No woman could resist
Juan's songs.
That wasn't why
I was making the tape... but I'll try it someday.
It will be a beautiful tribute.
Yes, it will be.
Drink?
I'll have one.
ToJuan.
"Dear Pedro Paulo... 
here's the Tom Jobim album
that I promised you. 
So sorry about your father... 
but glad you and your wife
have resolved your differences. 
I am very happy
that we met. 
I bid you farewell. 
Affectionately, Mary Ann"
Okay. I'll call you later.
Excuse me.
What's the meaning of
"to bid farewell"?
It means "to say good-bye."
Did you notice whether Miss Simpson left?
Yes, she did.
- Are you sure?
- Half an hour ago.
You saw her leave?
She took a cab to the airport.
She is taking a trip.
Hundreds of angry fans have gathered
here at Tom Jobim Airport... 
to protest against the sale
of soccer star Acacio. 
There is much gossip
about the young girl... 
who was seen leaving with him
for the airport. 
On your arrival in London, you'll have a press conference.
According to the contracts, you must wear a Nike cap... and the Manchester jersey, and you must drink Diet Pepsi.
- You got that, Gordo?
- Of course.
- Diet Pepsi, NikeJersey...
- Team jersey.
That's right. Nike cap.
There's a sponsor, a beer company called...
"Winterbreath."
They have the right to tape a commercial.
You at the airport, bottle in hand, saying:
"I'm here for Winterbreath."
- Did you know that, Gordo?
- Of course.
Then say it.
"Ladies and gentlemen...
I'm here for Wintergrass."
What vinaigrette?
It's not a sauce, it's a beer.
"I'm here for Winterbreath."
- You should be going with me.
- Me?
- Gordo, get her a ticket.
- No, you can't be serious.
The flight's sold out.
Filled with reporters.
Give her your boarding pass.
You come tomorrow.
I can't. No way.
You can't just hand over a boarding pass.
Tell the English I'll only go if she goes.
No. You're crazy.
She doesn't even have a passport.
Well, by coincidence,
I happened to bring it.
Mercenary! Mercenary!
Acacio is now on his way to the Tom Jobim International Airport...
This way.
A five-year visa.
It's like being approved by the Vatican to get into heaven!
What's she saying?
Of course, Gary had to go to the consulate.
- Trevor, please.
- To me you'll be Gary forever.
You'd never guess by the way he looks... how good he is in bed.
- Come on, now... in English!
- No, no.
Look, I'm really sorry about the mix-up at the hospital.
- I hope your fiance's forgiven me.
- My fiance?
Is he still mad?
My fiance is fine.
He wanted me to apologize to you for his hot temper.
Acacio is now on his way to
the Tom Jobim International Airport... 
where he'll be boarding
for London. 
A group of angry fans
are waiting for him at the entrance. 
Mercenary! Mercenary! 
Mercenary! Mercenary! 
Acacio, how does it feel to leave Brazil?
I feel sad and happy.
Sad because I love Rio.
I'm going to miss this city, my friends, the ocean... because London has no ocean.
What are you doing here?
- I came for Acacio's farewell.
- Me too.
It's a very important moment in national sports.
Very important.
- Sharon!
- I'm glad I ran into you.
I'm officially resigning my internship.
I need to talk to you.
Excuse me.
Here, listen to this.
- Who is this?
- Charles Trenet.
Who?
Let's go.
I love it.
Thank you.
Miss Simpson.
- Please, don't go.
- Don't go where?
Don't go anywhere.
- What are you talking about?
- Where are you going?
Nowhere.
Nowhere.
Nowhere?
Yes, nowhere.
I'm going nowhere.
I was just seeing Nadine off.
How. 
Godallejezus.
You have time.
- Mooney, come on.
Mickey, what are you doing?
- Jesus ...
I want to design clothing.
Fashion is the new rock & roll.
Just think of Gucci,
Armani, Versace.
Doyle, wake up.
From each other, guys.
Yellow card.
- I hit him once.
That will do.
I have not touched him.
I am a missionary.
Good move and kill people for money.
Come on.
In hell.
I want to be a professional footballer.
Football is not a question of life or death.
It is much more important.
What do you usually except football?
There is nothing else.
Maybe I'm old-fashioned,
Mitchell ...
... but focus should still score?
I know, but I everything to my head.
Is that so?
I hope for a proefwedstrijd.
Otherwise I am not a professional footballer.
Belfast United is my first choice.
But they are Protestant ...
... so they will never see.
I do not like, but ...
You are good ...
... but you would be even better if you use it.
So if you do not quickly improve your game ...
... I can not select more let alone United.
It is unnatural.
Boys and girls must work together at school.
How do you meet them otherwise?
Who determines the length of their skirts?
Do you just clothes?
I do not believe in clothes.
I think of fashion.
I ga the most beautiful women dress in the world.
And then I dress them again.
Bullshit. Footballers get the most beautiful girls.
Wait till I play for United.
Good night.
Would they keep bondage?
What is bondage?
Brazilian star to Belfast
H you. Cams.
H Rudi.
Do you think he is?
The Brazilian striker Carlos Rega
By Belfast United signed.
United hopes that in the team what southern temperament can provide.
What do you think of Northern Ireland?
My family in Brazil is worried.
They hear scary things ...
... but I think it is fantastic.
Everyone here is so nice.
United is a Protestant club.
You are the first Catholic player.
For me football is the only religion.
I give him a week.
Why did manager Frank Mallin this man have?
The boy has rhythm in his blood.
In Brazil is all about rhythm.
We all dance the samba before we can walk.
If we play football ...
... we do not dribble with the ball ...
We dance.
If we play football ....
... we do not dribble with the ball ...
We dance.
An opportunity for Rega.
Ga by Carlos.
Goal.
- Yes.
Did you know?
What says he?
- He plays for a Protestant club.
If you're English is even talk you might find a job.
If my son plays for United, there are two Catholics in the team.
What should it?
Here Sid McLoughlin.
In all my do-it-yourself stores ...
... I paint fantastic offers.
Quality for little money.
Everywhere accommodate.
For inside and outside.
So for all your paint ...
Do-it-yourself with Sid.
In all my do-it-yourself stores.
It is true.
Carlos dancing with the ball.
You've seen Riverdance yet?
So what's your excuse?
Abracadabra.
That word is not Irish.
Why do you think Brazil the best team in the world?
They have balls.
- No, rhythm.
Carlos Rega says that in their blood.
Just as the Protestants.
Those marching.
The only rate that we Catholics have, as we love.
Here ...
Look at this.
Latin-American dance?
Not so hard. Nobody knows
I want to learn dancing.
What?
- Listen.
If I can improve my game.
Latin rhythm, samba.
I ga learn dancing on the field,
Like Carlos.
But the point is, Mickey ...
I need help.
Really.
Mr keep the elbow bent.
If you do not have clothes will bear.
Keep your head and focus.
Flexible knien.
And ... two ...
Enter your partner along.
Is this your card?
Jesus. What are they doing?
The samba.
- The samba?
Of course.
Shit.
Spike.
- What is it?
This is meaningless.
I got professional help.
Have your new dancing slippers?
- Yes.
What color?
- Black.
Sorry.
- Black?
And very nice beenwarmers.
Pussy.
Come on, kids.
God has given your hips.
Cradle it.
Closer, Oliver.
Against each other.
Very good, Lucy.
Very good.
Ok people. Just break.
Hello, darling.
Mrs. Burns.
- Danny Mitchell.
I would like to enter.
Have already done?
I practiced at home what.
I would like to learn the samba.
The samba.
The rhythm of Brazil.
That I mean.
Is it expensive?
Men receive discount.
I have a shortage of men.
My whole life al
Finally someone who does not dress wear.
Oliver.
- Danny.
I do this for her.
Most men do not.
We train for the regional championships.
Lucy wants to win per se.
And she always gets what she wants.
So you play on ten?
- What?
Oh yeah, that's right.
I play also in the forefront. I am captain of the school team.
So ...
I did not know that St Joseph had a team.
I thought you only
Celtic football played.
And what was that game with stick again?
Hurling.
- Oh yes.
Ok people. The samba.
I see you.
And ...
Basic ... basis ...
And aside. Basis.
You're a natural talent.
And there we go. Very good.
And ...
Cha-cha ... baby of mine ...
And ...
Are we to that tapas bar go?
A friendly game?
Collegiates at St Joseph?
Ok ...
Can you still learn.
Football or soccer.
The name does not matter.
It is a British sport.
Our boys do only
Irish sports.
Hurling and Gaelic football.
- But they want to play football.
Therefore, a team you assemblies.
You have your times.
But what I do not like ...
... is that you Collegiates play.
Well, they are slapjanussen.
I understand that a mixed school.
Right. Protestants and Catholics ...
I mean the sexes.
Ah, I understand.
I have nothing against girls.
And our greatest saints from the female side.
But I'm afraid our boys ...
... be affect by the presence of large numbers of ...
... the other gender.
We have a C. .. O. ..
... Double L. .. E. ..
... G. .. I. ..
... A. .. T. .. E. ..
Collegiates.
Come on, guys.
Chiffon would brill are beautiful.
She likes me.
I see it.
See that thing? Recognize it?
They call it the target.
The opponent.
Shoot them in it.
Since we are again, Danny.
Here. A memento to us.
Good. Thank you.
From us.
Blocks. In hell. Blocks.
If you play football or pool?
You know how "Fuck you" spelled?
Yes ...
My foot.
Sorry, pal.
I am so sorry.
You get yellow.
- Call someone.
What are you doing?
- It was an accident.
Blind, he touched him again.
The first aid.
I told you. West Belfast.
Sign in Braille?
Make sure I get red.
- What?
Do it now.
From me you can send him out.
He only gets a warning.
I know where you live.
Come back.
Beware of my foot.
Can I help?
- No.
It was really by accident.
Are we still?
RECTOR
Tomorrow it's all over.
Good. Mooney, will you the waist take something broader?
No problem.
- Thank you.
Daniel, you know what you biblical namesake happened?
He was cast for the lions.
- Yes.
Unfortunately I have no lions.
But you can come back Saturday.
And now go to the hospital ...
... your excuses to offer.
Let him see that we are not barbarians.
Mitchell ...
That dream of you to be a professional footballer ...
Mr. ...
Forget it.
McCutcheon.
I'm not done with you.
I ga the team change.
No, I must continue to train.
What you need is discipline.
It is really better.
To as long as you are the permanent benchwarmer.
Excuse me.
It is for your own good.
Excuse me ...
Are you the.
Come on down.
Mother, this is Danny.
He sits on the St Joseph.
Have you done this?
Excuse me.
I'll make it up to you ...
We can sue you.
- Mother.
Put the flowers in the same somewhere.
I just saw a great waste.
How's your foot?
- It is an old ski injury.
Oh, my God.
Everything good?
I call security.
- No, he will make his apologies.
Really?
I thought your car to the garage was.
My father has brought me.
What the doctors say?
- They want some tests done.
Maybe I should be operated.
And the danswedstrijd then?
I die in pain and you think just to dance.
I want to win.
- Mrs. Burns is a reservist.
How can you call me?
- I could do nothing, remember?
Sister, where is the patint?
Dad.
- Day, Mr McLoughlin.
You are quite toegetakeld, but not as bad as the other, h?
What?
- That is the other one.
Do-it-yourself with Sid.
I like him already
Pupils of St Joseph to each other.
Have you been to St Joseph?
- I was 16th, 20 years ago.
The lovely Lydia.
- Mr. McLoughlin.
Phil is still in the bins?
- Waste disposers.
He is in China for a large contract with the government.
Ah, China. Very nice.
I ga, otherwise I miss the bus.
Are there still buses? I thought you all were burned.
Yes, we give him a lift.
I am not been in years.
Do you love?
Do not be such a snob.
Danny, what will you do if you
St Joseph is off?
I want to be a professional footballer.
Maybe I get a chance at United.
Very good. You should always set the bar as high as possible submit.
But I do not know whether they
Catholics take.
They have Carlos Rega.
This is Catholic.
And also a board member.
He has convinced Rega he had to sign for them.
I so.
Are you on the board of United?
- I am their evil dream.
A Catholic with money.
I want to ask if they once you are watching.
I just can not proefwedstrijd promise.
That would be nice.
Thanks, Mr. McLoughlin. I see you.
What is all this?
I totally do ga.
Lucy is looking for a new dance partner.
I ga me in its report.
You have nothing in common.
It is a rich broad ...
... and you are a poor sloeber.
- Money is not everything.
Wait till you reject United.
That dancing can be very good for my game.
I can excel.
You do not to your game.
Good afternoon, welcome to
DIY with Sid.
You wanted me?
- Come on.
Let me show you an idea.
What you see here?
A football?
- More?
Dad ...
A stage.
The competition is more exciting than ever.
If United win the last game ...
... we play next year in Europe.
And?
- And ...
This means that the last game on the TV.
Instead of the usual band ...
... we invite a celebrity off.
Someone who can show an increase in the center circle.
The stage.
What songs, a few jokes.
The fans will enjoy.
And the board also.
And we get our publicity.
What do you think?
- Sounds good.
Good, then I with it.
By the way ...
What do you do after your exam?
I know yet.
I have more to offer than one side.
I will think about it.
This may be your future.
Think of the footwork ...
... and hips.
We will dance the samba.
The rhythm of Brazil.
Ok people.
And ... two ... samba.
Very good.
You dance with me.
Does not, Mrs. Burns.
My partner is already
Hello there.
Or should I say buenos das?
What?
This Brazilian thing is addictive.
In Brazil they speak Portuguese, no Spanish.
Oh yes ...
Such shoes should I also have.
Are they expensive?
What are you doing here?
I would just learn to dance like you.
Maybe you can help me.
You have my chances of
Championship ruined.
I wanted to ...
- I would certainly win.
Yes, but ...
- Do you play football but now ...
... or something, ok?
All fell on your knien than I have not you dance.
I never beg.
- You surprised me.
Your dad is right.
You're a snob.
Keep moving. Consistent.
And ... two ... move your hips.
Leave me your samba but once.
Oh ...
That's just a samba.
Goddamn.
Need Help?
Yes ...
"Please."
Please.
Again.
Is there still petrol?
You think I'm stupid?
Is there a garage in the neighborhood?
- End of the road.
Ten minutes walk.
Where are you going?
- Home, eating ..
It's pretty scary.
They leave you alone.
Hold on.
Will you come with me?
- Then I miss the bus.
I give you a lift.
Please.
Have you received from your father?
- No, it is the case.
Do you work for him?
Only on Saturday.
Not a bad job.
You fill down many subjects.
I am in management.
Ok you have heavier than me.
Should I feel ashamed that my father richer than yours?
I do not know, my father has been Pleite.
My parents are divorced.
So we are both from a broken family.
We have something in common.
- Oh, God.
These are but the British.
They are already a few years.
I know, but I have no road tax paid.
My father's fault.
- Say that but at the court.
Good evening, sir.
Is this vehicle from you?
- No, it is the case.
Look ...
- We are looking for a restaurant.
Right, honey?
Yes, dear. I am starving.
Are they here somewhere tapas?
- No, only misery.
Ok row on.
That was at the last minute. Thank you.
- No thanks. And this guy is lying.
I know a great eettent.
Rudi, you've no tapas, h?
Tapas?
- Yes, those little happies.
I want a little impression.
Ok no problem.
Look.

But I ...
Well, I do not tapas.
But I do have the best ice in West Belfast.
A banana split for you ...
... and a section for your pretty girlfriend.
Of the case.
He can not help it.
He is an Italian.
Your father is really ok. Go after your school with him in the case?
Maybe. I know it yet.
My mother lives in London.
Maybe I go ga.
All my friends and acquaintances go away. null, "responseDetails": "invalid result data", "responseStatus": 404
You know what it is.
Do not you leave?
- No, not really.
All my Gabber live here, and my mom is not gone ...
... except if I have a big house for sale when I play for United.
What's so special about football?
- It is a cool game.
Is that all? "A cool game?"
- Yes.
And if you make payment, it is the best game in the world.
You know, if you get to the football gets injured ...
... , a reservist in.
Yes ... ?
I know what it is to be raider.
Do you want me to

You're the boss.
- Good, you learn the al
Say no to drugs.
Okay, kids. Well. Fine.

Look straight ahead.
Smiles, baby.
If you look so grumpy you never win.
Think about your girl.
Stylish, Mooney.
Very stylish.
Well?
Brazilians games with an S.
Jesus. Armani did not such difficult customers.
What is that?
I can in my schooluniform dance.
We do well or not.

Pay me back as a footballer you are.
Good afternoon, madam.
What do you want?
I hear from her.
You have your shirt in your underwear sew.
Then it is not always creeps up.
I know someone.
You see a little revealed for a Latino.
That can cost you points.
Will we have a week to
Barbados go?
I bruiningscrme, that works fine.
You're on my foot.
Think of your footwork.
Sorry.
- This is nothing.
We have no chance. And
Championship is next Monday
Find someone else.
You are best.
Come on, let 's see what.
Stop. Stop it.
The passes are okay, but anyone can.
Where were you with Oliver too. But
Latin dance is more than technique.
I want to see emotion. Passion.
Just if you're in love with each other.
Come on, wind me up.
Let me blush.
Only on my feet.
These shoes are extremely expensive.
- Ok.
How does the bikini?
Her name is Lucy.
And she is your toughest competition.
What?
- That chick is premier division.
But you're the third division.
Or the second, if you wash your hair.
Did you ask her out?
- We dance alone together.
She says that? Listen ...
Fred Astaire was the fourth division ...
... but he always scored a girl.
I blush.
Finally you love.
I gotta go.
Tomorrow same time.
Honey, I'm so proud of you.
Forward. Come on.
Do I need it?
- Not yet.
All Jesus.
No, guys.
McCutcheon, moving.
Mooney, come out.
I told you.
Brother Xavier is right.
We have Celtic football games.
I've never seen something worthless.
What are you doing?
You guys look like little girls,
Nobody is concentrated.
Jesus, that is Frank Mallin of United.
What is he doing here?
Look at me when I talk.
A brother school soccer.
Can it even crazier?
We can still be a Catholic use.
For Carlos.
Carlos is not a Catholic but a Brazilian.
Ok. Come on, guys.

To me.
In hell.
Thanks, Gabber. Thank you.
You can manage.
Thank you
You deserve an Oscar.

Would you like to?
Fantastic.

Oh yes ...
And I can not. I to Oliver. He is back home.
Another time perhaps.
We are so glad that he did not surgery need to be.
Only a little physiotherapy.
Saturday I give a party in honor of his homecoming.
Good idea.
Do not overdo it, dear.
Please.
- Thank you.
Where were you?
I missed you.
How's your foot?
- Fine.
Nice ...
You know, this was good for me.
I can think about us.
Is that so?
I think you after your school not here so far.
That case of your father is nothing for you.
You must leave.
Your wings spread.
Ga study, somewhere in England.
Near me.
You are everything for me.
We are a good team.
Actually I would Danny need to thank.
Is he better than me?
- What?
Your new dance partner.
He is different than you.
Good, because I want my come back to.
What?
I know that the championship important to you.
So if you want,
I dance with you again.
We can win.
You and me.
What do you say?
Well.
By ga.
Hello?
Where are you?
We are waiting for you.
Why?
I got it.
I think a big mistake.
Dare you do not agree in person?
Sorry, but I've decided.
It was so good between us.
It was also good between Oliver and me.
Say it plain.
You can find me min
That is not true.
Oliver is right.
"Lucy always pushes its way through."
Say that's not.
- It is, h?
Danny, listen.
Oliver is my friend.
I am his girlfriend.
Friends do things together.
They make plans together.
That is that.
Plans change.
And friends too.
I gotta go.
I ask you something ...
Shit.
I wanted to know what time the party by Oliver begins tomorrow.
Do you?
Love, eat on.
You must be strong.
Good evening, Mrs. Parr.
- Oh, my God.
Who's there?
Day, Ollie.
Who invited you?
- Well ...
I did.
You wanted him to thank remember?
Oh yes, that is.
Would you like me no more as Ollie.
Not arrive. This is antiques.
Sorry.
Beautiful dress, lady.
A Gucci?
Is this your card?
- Yes.
So you come from West Belfast.
You ever shot someone?
Do you have a dash?
A tip.
I meant it.
I think it is really a beautiful dress.
You have taste, young man.
You would have to see what I bought yesterday.
Come take a look what I bought yesterday.
Where are you, Mickey?
Yes, Lydia.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
Do you see that.
I knew you would find beautiful.
Is not it divine?
Would you do it? For me?
Nice house.
Have you already been in the kitchen?
On the floor is sailing and the marble is not marble.
And the Italian tiles in the bathroom ...
Not Italian?
Dad sells them too.
He retrieves it from Bulgaria.
Cheap junk.
You are really cut for the case of your dad.
I can study in London.
Very good.
It is a difficult decision.
It may change my whole life.
Oliver wants me to do.
My father wants me to stay here.
And he is not alone.
And you say after what I have served you?
Nobody is perfect.
You know why I dance champion want to be?
Oliver and Sophie always say that my father arranges everything for me.
That they needed to say.
They did the same.
But I totally dance itself.
I have achieved this on its own merits.
I want to enter the dance floor, in the spotlight ...
... and show what I can.
Do you love?
I did the same with football.
I think this is a good number.
Want to swim?
I do not swim well with me.
Me neither.
Dirty bastard.
Your friends and you can go.
I get you later, Danny.
It is cold, h?
Oh, my God.
Excuse me.
Would you like to dance tomorrow?

Do not be late.
Guys, you see.
Perverse man.

Ready?
Think of me as your rich and famous are, h?
Sure.
Belfast.
Belfast.
I want to say that I am your have inspired.
I have the samba learned.
In order to learn the rhythm.
Rhythm you can not learn.
Since you are born.
Along the line.
- Breed.
Free.
Very good, boy.
Here, Carlos.
Well played, mate.
Well played, guys.
Beautiful spicy.
Beautiful, Carlos.
Class boy.
Well played.
You hear from us.
I blew it, h?
- Absolutely not.
I am proud of you.
I have to pick up Lucy.
Can I give you a lift?
Thank you, Mr. McLoughlin.
- Come, my name is Sidney.
See you later.
Come on.
Oh, damn. Damn.
This is a fucking club.
The money sucks.
I hate it here.
I see you.
Ladies and gentlemen ...
... Welcome to the Northern Ireland
Latin-American championships.
Yes, we will have a look who this year, the champions are.
This magnificent trophy ...
What time is it?
- Calm down. He is really so.
Is he there yet?
- No.
Shit.
If the dancing floor to go for the samba?
Thank you.
I killed him.
That I do not see.
- Oliver. Thank God.
Where is Danny?
- He is not.
Want some for me?
- Oh no.
Do I dance with you?
What do you, Sophie?
You must ignore.
Oliver, please.
Lucy, pray do not fit with you.
I am.
Danny, you too long the solarium located?
Come on.
Remember, love overcome.
You have no number.
- No time.
Laugh now.
What is it?
- Nothing. By ga.
Jesus.
You ruined everything for me.
- Me? You can still.
Do you love?
You look terrible.
Since I know you are all wrong.
It is always another.
This is done on purpose.
- Absolutely not.
Why I dance with you?
Because you need champion wanted to be.
I hate you.
- And I hate you more.
Try not.
I want you never see.
Mutual.
She's just her mother.
Danny, dear.
Look at you.
Was that intended?
- Ma ...
Five ... six ... seven ... eight ... nine ... ten ...
Ten ... two ...
I ga. I see you guys later.
Look, Belfast United.
I is expected Saturday morning.
I'm not going to a Protestant club look.
Danny, ga but run.
I must tell the rector.
Never come back again on Saturday.
I have to work.
- Bet.
Mr. Mallin, previously I was always in the forefront.
But I can also as ausputzer player.
About polish speaking.
I want to see them this afternoon glow.
Here you must prove ...
... and then see what we do position you end up.
Understood?
The contest is next week.
We need to have entertainment.
What do you think they are not to Belfast dare? It's secure.
You do not read newspapers?
Believe me. Just listen.
Are you shot?
Hold on.
Our fame is not.
All such advertising. What am I doing against the other board members?
If I do not come, they laugh at me.
Then they throw me out of the board.
What am I gonna do?
Papa, I should tell you something.
You could settle.
- It is good, Frank.
I think another piece of entertainment.
It's your guess. The board expect something very special.
Some had doubts about the adoption of a Catholic.
Give them no reason for you to pop out.
Everything good?
This does not look like my dream.
That goes for everything.
Lucy is studying in London.
That she wanted to please.
I once knew a boy.
They also dreamed of professional footballer should be.
He had talent, just like you.
He had perhaps saved, but we will never know ...
... because he was scared.
He dared not guess the car.
He took no risk.
And you know ...
Since that time he takes every opportunity he sees.
He takes risks everyone advises against him.
As if he has something to do.
Not make the same mistake as him.
Seize the day, Danny.
And the rest may fall dead.
Another, Rudi.
If you have not had enough?
Do not be so depressed.
You should be grateful.
The risk is much smaller
I fashion is king ...
... or Gary magician in Vegas.
But you gotta start somewhere.
I know.
Do you still her?
You would not suit her.
Your differences as silk and nylon.
We had some, but now she goes to London ...
... and I see her no more.
I must give her a reason to stay here.
Like what?
- I.
Say that he should use his mind.
Use your common sense.
There so many fish swimming in the sea.
Oh, and that is your opinion?
Do you have an opinion?
Then, I'll give you an opinion.
If you want girl, you should surprise her.
They love women.
Like what?
- A gift.
Something she always wanted.
Something big.
Larger than my biggest coupe.
I'm broke.
But can you show that you love her.
Thank you, doctor. Will you now.
Wait. You're right.
There is something that they would like to ...
... and I know who can pay.
That she would find the end.
Rudi, you're a genius.
Ok you've had enough.
You are looking for a piece of entertainment for the rest, h?
Yes, the stadium is full.
It is Lucy's greatest wish everyone to see ...
... how well they can dance.
More public will never get.
It's a big surprise.
Mickey regulates costumes.
You mean Mickey Mooney's
Fashion House.
Why are you doing this?
I am sure that the other players you go it fun.
The risk I take.
Say what you need.
That is not necessary.
Calm down, please.
Papa?
Because you're successful, I have a big surprise for you.
What then?
- United against City.
A football game?
- But not just one.
The big game.
I want you here.
Can I bring someone?
Sure.
Is now quiet.
What do you Lucy?
That is a surprise.
I hope they keep surprises.
The moment of truth.
Dave, an important night for United.
Sure, Jackie.
United must win ...
... to Eurocup Football package.
It is very exciting.
City is doing very well.
Brother, my collar to see?
Everything is ok.
What are they doing here?
- I have invited them.
Brother Xavier has not changed.
That Sid McLoughlin has changed into something terrible.
I do not stand for the anthem.
Shut up.
It says nothing about the number in the rest.
What have you organized?
- That is a surprise.
I thought that someone would take.
Could he not?
- It 's al
Hello, Sidney.
Come on United!
What if they say no?
- Calm down.
Everything is good.
Make you're not busy.
Look.
What do you think?
A masterpiece.
- Thank you, man.
Where are Lucy's stuff?
- That has Sidney.
When will he say?
- I think now.
So I thought: You and Danny ...
Samba.
No.
- Everything is arranged.
Then you luck.
I do not want you to arrange everything for me.
I bring you home.
You're my employee.
- I quit.
Surprise.
This was your idea, h?
Yes.
- I knew it.
There is a lot at stake.
My future depends on it.
Do it now before you guv.
Then I will never interfere with you.
Then you can do everything.
- How can you call me?
This was my idea. I thought I this could make you happy.
And you would continue.
But I was wrong.
Excuse me.
Why?
- Why?
Because I love you.
You're really too far gone.
Well, I do it.
- Thank God.
But then you dance with me.
We are a team, remember?
Sorry, Ollie.
I am now in a different team.
Come on, it's quiet. Good luck.
I am nothing.

Aren't you going to eat?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi. Here, take your newspaper.
- Why didn't you come to our place?
- I was out with Mahboub.
- Are you coming to the lecture with us?
No. My brother Abbas is home.
By the way, they said they're not accepting computer ballots this year.
Thanks a lot.
My old radio was coming to pieces.
Where are the others?
Mahboub's in that room.
Ahmad cut off his sister's hair, and she ran away.
My sweet baby is depressed.
Change your clothes, I'll get dinner ready.
Don't you tell your brother!
I'm talking about taking Hamideh back home.
- I'll tell him!
- Don't you dare, girl!
He keeps abusing her, and you keep begging them to take her back!
Don't you raise your voice!
This is life, you can't just call it quits!
So what we have, you call it life?
If you don't like it, study to become a teacher, so you can be independent.
- Where's Hamideh?
- Hi! Where else? Mom...
Mr. Rahmat came and sincerely apologized.
He begged her to go back.
Just like always, right?
It wouldn't have been so cruel if...
Come over here and see what I've brought for you.
Get going, and don't look so sad!
Ali, come put this on and see if it's your size.
Wow! A sports jacket!
Come put it on and see if you like it.
My royal mother, please bless us with your presence for a minute!
- It's, of course, not worthy of you!
- It's wonderful!
And I got this for Hamideh, dad.
- You spend so much money, dear!
- You look great!
Thanks. Would you get Sumayyeh a wedding gown from your factory?
- Sure, I'll get her one.
- God bless you, my dear!
Now, for the irritable Miss Mahboubeh, but first promise not to laugh!
Come here and see what it is.
Here!
Why does it look like that?!
In the stockholders' meetings, you only need a brigade to stop the fights.
What are you doing here, Mr. Abbas?
One thing we have too many of in this country is doctors and engineers.
He's not that valuable. Fire him.
- The people I have to deal with...!
- Don't take it too hard, doc.
The bastard doesn't know how to talk politely. Besides, it's all an excuse...
It's his style. He gobbled up those ten shares, and now he wants the rest.
We must have accountability here.
How can I get this through his head?!
Let him think he's such a big shot.
Just keep cool.
Please... Please...
Abbas? Let's go!
That's a lot of money. What for?
For my visa, sir. I told you about it.
To tell you the truth,
I'm reluctant to sell my father's house.
You know how I've put everything I have on this damn building...
Won't you mind if I ask Mr. Marandi?
Marandi? That bastard is loaded, but he's a miserable penny pincher.
Yes, but he's awfully rich.
You think he'd turn me down?
Keep on the right track, boy.
Marandi is fishy business. He claims to be an exporter, but there's more to it.
While everyone imports clothing from
Turkey, he exports wedding gowns.
The son of a bitch is lying.
Don't get close to him.
You hear me?
Did you talk to her?
You didn't give her the present, did you? God! You're such a moron!
The day I fell in love with Etsoko,
I went and told her:
"Kawai anoko, ai asishiteru...
"watashi to keko ishti mashka?"
Anyway, I told her I loved her, and asked her to marry me.
Just wait till I get that visa stamp on my passport. I'll go to her and say:
"If you'd just wait for me one year,
I'd come back with my hands full."
Will you wait for me, Ms. Sarvenaz?
- Yes, Mr. Abbas!
- Get out of here!
Lt'll work out, you'll get it.
Mr. Nasser isn't helping any.
I wanted to ask Mr. Marandi, but I got scared. He's into illegal stuff...
- Smuggling?
- I don't know.
- My mother wouldn't budge, either.
- What does she say?
She's scared.
The builder says he'll pay half the money up-front.
We'd have 10 days to move out.
The important thing is for you to get to Fukuoka and go to Ushidareh.
He finds out that you're there for honest work, and you got yourself a job!
Damn, things would have been different if I'd stayed there for two years.
But I never was lucky, they deported me right on the sixth month.
What if I'm deported, too?
You won't be. Things have changed.
Now, if you don't get into fights, and stay away from the police, you're fine.
What are you waiting for?
Move it, man!
- Please, Mr. Builder...
- Thank you very much.
Hurry up, Dad.
Mr. Abbas, our friendship aside, you still have to move out on the deadline. Okay?
- Of course. I've already found a place.
- I very much hope so.
Where are you, father?
What's taking you so long? Come on!
I'm coming, I'm coming! I found it.
God, please let us not regret this!
- Let's go.
- Let's go, dear!
- Is Ali home?
- He went out again before I knew it!
Come to bed.
I'll sleep in my own bed.
Abbas isn't coming either.
Go to sleep, don't be silly!
I just wanted a few words with you.
Ms. Maryam? Are you coming?
My sweet little thing. Why are you so bent?
They all give you a shove before passing by!
- Hi, Ms. Zamani.
- Hello.
Here are the two checks.
Please give me a receipt for these two checks.
- May I see the boss?
- He's not in.
When should I come for my passport?
In two weeks at the latest. But if your money isn't ready, we can't help...
Don't worry about that. I'll have it.
Ms. Zamani, here is the receipt.
- Here you go...
- Thank you.
- In two weeks, it'll be ready, right?
- Absolutely!
Thank you very much.
Hey, watch out! Watch where you're going!
- Is it for me?
- It's just a small gift.
Thanks a lot.
And that must be for...
You want me to give it to her?
It's nothing, really...
Bravo, Mr. Abbas! Good job, man!
Ms. Tuba, come and see what I have for you here!
- Do you like it?
- Beautiful!
It's so pretty, I hope you bring one home for your own wedding, soon.
Let me see...
All I need is to wear a wedding gown!
I love you, dear!
My dear mom, don't be upset with me.
Just wait and see what I'll do for you.
Miss Mahboubeh Rahmat-Abadi, please come to the principal's office.
Rahmat-Abadi?
Please open it.
Regulations say we should give letters to the parents...
It's just that I thought that it might be from Masum.
- Any news from her?
- No, ma'am.
- What is it?
- It's blank, ma'am. A practical joke!
With your permission, ma'am!
"Ten o'clock... Mellat park... Wednesday..."
Hamideh?
Come get your kid... why don't you pay any attention to your child?
Gentlemen, be kind enough to move to the men's section... Please!
Let the ladies be comfortable here. Please!
- I'll see Masum Wednesday.
- What?
- I swear! I got a letter from her.
- Where is she?
I don't know. We're supposed to meet.
Why are you crying?
Don't you just sit there! Give me that...
Though I don't know how to play it!
Come on, everybody...
Mother of the groom insists to see the bride's sister and brother!
What? What is it to her?
Ignore her! If she keeps insisting, tell her they're visiting their sick aunt.
Don't worry, I'll bring her back.
Just don't tell your mom, let's surprise her!
Somayyeh, run!
Ziba, run! The cops are coming!
Masum, run! Go! Run!
Get out of here! Don't stop!
Masum, wait! Masum?!
You finally did it!
Alas!
Ms. Tuba, nice to see you here!
Long time, no see!
How could you? Didn't I ask you not to buy the house from them?
When he wants to sell, what difference does it make? There are other buyers.
Strangers would have bought it, but I didn't expect you to do that!
It's not like I twisted his arm, or ripped him off, you know?!
I desperately need the deed today,
I swear I'll bring it back.
I don't have it on me.
I hope you regret it. There are so many houses in this damn city, why ours?!
For God's sake, go bring your man.
I don't deal with womenfolk!
Thanks a lot, Mr. Abbas!
I used to carry stuff on my back, moving from one rented house to another...
Now, at this old age, when all I needed was some peace, you had to do this?!
Fine, that's fine!
Well done!
Good job!
Where are you going, anyway?
What? You think we'll let her stay there with a bunch of criminals?
Without a deed?
I tried to bail her out with the deed, when I found out!
- I'll get her out myself.
- Myself... myself!
Yes, what? Is it none of my business?
You think I don't care? I'm a disgrace?
- Don't raise your voice!
- Why do you yell at her?
You and Father did whatever the hell you wanted, what do you want from her?
Didn't we count? Didn't our mother count?
Why don't you come out? Aren't you our father? Come out! Do something!
- Calm down!
- Don't come, I'll get her myself.
Tuba? Mrs. Tuba?
Come inside! It's cold. You'll catch a cold!
This is no time for laundry.
Come!
- No. I'm not giving it back.
- Why not?
The house is mine, why should I have to give it back to you?
- I'll pay you damages.
- No. Unless you pay 1 million tomans.
- Won't you take half a million?
- No. No.
- You won't take half a million?
- No, I won't! Why should I?
- You won't take half a million?!
- No... 1 million tomans, no less!
Let me go, god damn it!
What the hell do you want from me?
Let me go. Get the hell out of here!
- Hi, Mahboubeh.
- Hi.
Tell your brother Ahmad to come.
Ahmad? Mahboubeh wants to see you.
- What?
- Do you know where Masum is?
Do you have any idea where she's been?
Can you even understand?
Do you know how many nights she's spent in public lavatories?
Do you know how many times she's vomited blood from hunger?
- Do you care how she's survived?
- Shut up, you bitch!
- It's all because of your attitude...
- It's because of you sluts!
I don't know, it's like everybody's gone mad.
Mother attacks the builder...
Mahboubeh slaps Ahmad in the face... and Dad isn't talking to anyone.
And I slap you in the face.
It's all my fault.
I wanted you and Mahboub to study so you don't end up like me...
And she doesn't end up like Hamideh.
Don't you two feel the cold?
Come on in, for God's sake!
I've made up my mind.
I'll take back the money I paid for my visa.
I'll sell my bike and pay the builder the damages he asks for.
And forget about all those headaches... those detailed plans?
I'll start over... but on a different route.
This is one price I will never pay.
But Sarve...
Don't break the door, there's no one in there. They took the money and ran!
They swindled people's money and ran away. They fled the country!
Have you gone mad?
Don't break the door, there's no one in there. They took the money and ran!
- Is Mr. Marandi in?
- What's wrong, Mr. Abbas?
Nothing, I have to see him.
Everything will be all right, once I get back from this trip.
I'll get the house back.
I won't let you go to work anymore.
The reason I wanted to leave... was that I really wanted to do a lot for you.
But...
Now, I'll stay right here and fix everything.
- Bye!
- Where are you going, bro?
Look after the house.
And get our things unpacked.
- What are you going to do?
- I'll go to Orumieh, I'll be back soon.
You always went on business trips, but all these things you told Mom...
- I'm coming with you.
- What?
How are you paying him back?
What kind of work pays so well?
That's none of your business.
Just stay and look after the house!
- Why don't you let him come along?
- I'm coming.
- Ali!
- I'm worried about you.
For God's sake, what are you planning?
Ali, look after her and Mom.
I'm going after him.
There is not a soul on the road...
You'll bypass three police stations and get on the main road just before Orumieh.
You know the road I'm talking about?
You're not scared, are you?
The boys will place the drugs inside the dresses, and then they'll load the truck.
All you have to do is to give them the goods and rush back.
That's all.
You don't have any doubts, do you?
Never doubt Marandi!
You're not scared, are you?
What are you doing here?
What have you done?
What have you done? What have you done?
What have you done? What have you done?
Say something, damn it!
What have you done?
What have you done? Damn it!
I don't know whose curse did all this to me.
After a life of dignity,
I now have to be thrown out of my house.
Do you know where Abbas is?
Marandi told Nasser he has to find him.
Nasser is terribly scared, he promised to find Abbas before nighttime.
I don't know what he's done,
I just know that his life is in danger.
I know what he's done.
Praise the Lord who puts one's dignity and indignity in his own hands.
Please tell me where he is, if you know.
I have to go myself.
- What have you done to yourself, boy?
- Do you want me to come along?
I've always sent him on the road, and I have to go after him myself, now.
Don't waste time.
I put a few sweaters in there.
You never know, it might get cold.
Here's your birth certificate, and here is the rest of the money from the house.
It's in travelers' checks, keep it somewhere safe. Take them.
The hell with it.
What do I need it for?
I don't need a house when my children can't be around.
- Stay here!
- Open up, boy! This is Nasser.
Open up, I said! I know you're in there.
Open the door, we have to talk.
- It's Nasser.
- Open the door!
Where should we go?
- You weren't the scoundrel type!
- Take your jacket.
- Open up, I said!
- Don't stand here! Go!
I'm not bluffing when I tell you I'll help.
Are you running away, you moron?
Get out of here, go on!
We're on the same side!
Dear God!
Dear God, I trust my beloved son to you!
- Move out of my way, ma'am!
- Kill me first! Pass over my dead body!
- I said, get out of my way!
- What? He wasted your heroin?
- I'll let the whole world know!
- Abbas? Abbas!
Message? What message, sir?!
There was a time when we complained, but you said we were fighting a war.
It was the truth, so we accepted it.
After the war, you asked us for patience, because the country was in ruins...
So once again, we put up with it all.
Now there is someone who wants to save us, so I'm here to vote...
Sorry, ma'am, we're having technical difficulties. Please start all over.
Just forget about it!
I lost my house, my son ran away, and people are all filming all the time!
I wish someone would come and film what's going on right here! Right here!
Who the hell do you show these films to, anyway?!

{14455}{14533}All accounted for, Regimental|Sergeant Major, sir.
{14538}{14597}- Casualties?|- Nothing serious.
{14602}{14662}The Colonel's wife|swallowed a prune stone.
{14667}{14715}- Sir!|- Everybody alright?
{14720}{14808}Yes. The colonel's wife|swallowed a prune stone, sir.
{14814}{14859}Bit of a mess!
{14864}{14893}< Attention!
{14898}{14947}Stand easy.
{14952}{15034}Mmm. Bit of a mess all this.
{15040}{15089}Any idea what it was?
{15094}{15140}Hut 29, sir.
{15145}{15209}- What dropped it?|- Junkers 88, sir.
{15214}{15268}Must have had one left over, sir.
{15274}{15335}So you don't think|they were aiming at us?
{15403}{15461}No... no, right. Point taken.
{15493}{15548}That was a bloody hand grenade.
{15554}{15668}You could have blown us all to bits|and saved Adolf the bother!
{15673}{15714}Yes, Sergeant.

{16629}{16686}All I want is a posting, Sergeant.

{16775}{16824}I joined up to fight.
{16829}{16910}You joined up to follow orders|like the rest of us.
{16915}{16990}It's what we do.|It's known as 'doing our bit'.

{58147}{58196}and it's not even 10 o'clock.
{58222}{58254}Merton, get in here.
{58335}{58386}Faith, you look terrible,|get some sleep.
{58906}{58970}- I can't see a sodding thing.|- Shush.
{58976}{58992}Keep looking.
{59171}{59220}Do they always shoot deserters?
{59226}{59250}We're not deserters.
{59280}{59337}We know that but do they, Sergeant?
{59410}{59417}- Do you think he's got it?|- Has who got what?
{59491}{59545}Has the Prime Minister|got the letter?
{59550}{59582}Of course he has.
{60574}{60634}- Serg, I wasn't asleep-|- Shush.
{60656}{60663}Listen.
{60810}{60817}RUMBLlNG
{60916}{60932}What's that?
{61054}{61070}What's that?
{62069}{62126}I'm so bored of powdered egg.
{62131}{62172}It gives me frightful dreams.
{62187}{62261}Yes, but we all have to do our bit.
{62282}{62314}Any word from Ken?
{62336}{62402}Still on convoys... as far as I know.
{62426}{62500}You know what they say,|'no news is good news'.
{62610}{62659}Are these soldiers' pay books?
{63242}{63283}How much further?
{63288}{63320}Two or three hours.
{63587}{63632}Bloody hell!
{63795}{63819}Take the controls.
{63876}{63920}Keep your head down.
{65264}{65314}We need to find a landmark.
{65385}{65434}DlSTANT VOlCES
{65532}{65564}What the hell's that?
{65634}{65666}It's just some women.
{65733}{65740}- They're going on about a recipe.|- What did you say?
{65841}{65932}Down there somewhere, sir, some|women are going on about a recipe.
{66075}{66082}- What?|- Speak French do you?
{66173}{66222}No, they're speaking English.
{66356}{66363}- Bugger!|- Welcome home, Private.
{66487}{66519}How could that happen?
{66541}{66620}We would have known|if we were going round in circles?
{66625}{66699}At least Mohammed|found the right sodding mountain!
{66816}{66908}At least we tried. Most people|would have given up at Cornwall!
{66913}{66945}This is bleedin' Cornwall!
{67034}{67075}We'll be a laughing stock.
{67108}{67149}We can explain, can't we?
{67185}{67226}We'll have to explain alright.
{67245}{67269}Bloody court martial.
{67322}{67363}I don't mind dying, Cuthbertson...
{67403}{67410}..but I won't be humiliated.
{67519}{67560}What a complete bloody fiasco.
{67586}{67677}We've still got the boat.|I don't mind giving it another go.
{67709}{67775}Do you want to give it another go?
{68044}{68097}WlRELESS: Then, there's half a leek,|one teaspoon...
{68169}{68218}WlRELESS: Have you got that?
{68223}{68311}WlRELESS: Half a leek,|one teaspoon of mixed herbs
{68316}{68402}and a teaspoonful of salt|and then there's two ounces...
{68407}{68414}Psssst!
{68461}{68468}Psssst!
{68584}{68648}Ah! Sergeant?
{68794}{68826}Was that you, Sergeant?
{69000}{69032}What are you doing?
{69072}{69096}There's a German!
{69126}{69217}There's a German!|There's a sodding German!
{69222}{69271}# FLANAGAN & ALLEN: Run Rabbit|Run
{69276}{69313}# Run run run
{69318}{69404}# Run rabbit run rabbit|Run run run
{69409}{69458}Shall we go back and kill him?
{69463}{69562}I haven't come all this way|to shoot a Kraut who likes cooking!
{69608}{69657}He's probably gone by now anyway.
{69700}{69757}At least we're here,|that's the main thing.
{69891}{69940}Open wide, Adolf!|the dentists are coming!
{69972}{69988}Cuthbertson! >
{70026}{70042}Sorry, Sergeant.
{70080}{70189}# So run rabbit|Run run run. #
{70234}{70316}You don't have to tell me|if you don't want to.
{70354}{70403}If you must know...
{70408}{70520}..it's cold, wet with more rats|than you can shake a stick at.
{70544}{70551}Blimey.
{70598}{70739}For 28 days you were bored to tears|and then on the 29th - boof!
{70744}{70839}The sky lit up, you got your head|down, ran like the clappers
{70844}{70928}and hoped some other|poor bastard got it, not you.
{70933}{70965}Now, go to sleep.
{71047}{71104}Didn't you save the life|of a General?
{71118}{71167}Oh, yes...
{71192}{71241}General Sir William Hyde.
{71246}{71301}I was his driver.
{71306}{71313}- What happened?|- Nothing.
{71364}{71388}Go to sleep.
{71512}{71561}My dad was in the trenches.
{71619}{71635}At Amiens.
{71698}{71797}He was one of the lucky ones,|he came home in one piece.
{72020}{72052}What are you doing?
{72095}{72111}Tapping. Sorry.
{72149}{72215}- It's a habit when I'm nervous.|- Well, stop it.
{72396}{72412}Did he...
{72480}{72579}..say much, your dad...|about the trenches?
{72595}{72637}- My dad?|- Yeah.
{72708}{72757}I thought you wanted to go to sleep?
{72762}{72811}I do...
{72822}{72885}..but I'd rather you talked|than tapped.
{72979}{72995}Not much.
{73033}{73157}He was killed by a tram when I was|three so I never really knew him.
{73189}{73255}He was just a face|at my bedroom door.
{73385}{73476}My mum always showed me pictures|and I do think about him.
{73612}{73669}He tells me off in my head.
{73692}{73716}Not always though.
{73768}{73809}Sometimes I make him laugh.
{73937}{73984}Can I ask you something?
{73990}{74006}What now?
{74167}{74208}Why did you choose me?
{74237}{74311}Who else would be daft enough|to carry the grenades?
{74641}{74673}He would like this.
{74731}{74772}It would make him smile.
{75246}{75314}- Can you reach it?|- I would if you stood still.
{75351}{75396}Here.
{75460}{75517}Here. You do it.
{75548}{75603}- It was your idea.|- Really? Thanks.
{75891}{75965}Bloody hell?|How many of those buns did you eat?
{76013}{76071}- How many shall I cut?|- Cut them all.
{76085}{76134}Keep your voice down.
{76298}{76347}It's a lot harder than you think.
{76377}{76419}Did you see that?
{76424}{76537}You could have your eye out with|one of those. I've got a good idea.
{76543}{76641}We'll make a list of the things we do|and then keep it as proof.
{76758}{76840}We could tot up the damage.|How much are these lines worth?
{76845}{76889}Five quid each?
{76895}{77020}Well, that's one, two, three...|.. that's 25 quid the lot.
{77025}{77074}< Depends what's on the other end.
{77133}{77177}That's a point.
{77183}{77299}So, supposing these go to like,|the hospital or the Resistance even?
{77304}{77353}Just suppose you get on with it.
{77471}{77575}Still, 25 quid is 25 quid, isn't it?
{77771}{77836}Well, it's not actually,|it's only ¡ê20.
{77855}{77903}What do you mean?
{77908}{77947}- I left one.|- What for?
{77971}{78020}In case of emergencies.
{78241}{78296}- How much does cement cost?|- What?
{78322}{78384}If we were blowing up|a gun emplacement...
{78389}{78450}I was trying to work out|how much it's worth.
{78455}{78516}- What for?|- Well...
{78521}{78628}We put the damages on the left|and what it's worth on the right.
{78633}{78682}Are you a bloody accountant now?
{78688}{78830}No, listen. I had a mate who bought|a Riley Roadster before the war.
{78835}{78948}He polished it every Sunday, but the|birds kept crapping on the bonnet.
{78953}{79008}So, what he did was,|he bought a garage.
{79015}{79109}The only problem is he reckons|the garage cost more than the car.
{79114}{79165}Has this got a point, Private?
{79170}{79223}Yeah, yeah, the point is,
{79228}{79350}I reckon that two garages costs|the same as one gun emplacement.
{79418}{79462}Sergeant?
{79467}{79511}To put it another way,
{79516}{79605}one gun emplacement costs the same|as three Riley Roadsters.
{79626}{79691}You've got a head|like a toy box, Cuthbertson.
{79783}{79827}When are we going to eat?
{79833}{79907}Hello? Hello? Hang on, sir.
{79913}{79962}Africa,|that's where we stand or fall.
{79967}{80014}He's on the line now.
{80019}{80062}About time. Put him through.
{80067}{80183}I want answers yesterday, Merton.|Lose Africa and we lose the Med.
{80214}{80313}Hello? No-one here, Faith.
{80319}{80366}One moment, Prime Minister.
{80372}{80454}< He's on line three, Prime Minister.
{80471}{80543}Hello, Monty.|How are you, old cocker?
{80561}{80631}Jolly good.|Now tell me something, General...
{80649}{80720}..what do your knees|look like in shorts?
{80852}{80926}'Sleep during the day,|travel by night', you said. >
{80931}{81013}That's alright.|So far, it hasn't been necessary.
{81070}{81119}'Crawling with men and machinery'.
{81148}{81247}Thanks, Private. All we need do|is find a road or a signpost.
{81264}{81344}To where? There's nothing to do.
{81368}{81482}It's not a problem. There will be|plenty to do when we get there.
{81487}{81526}< Get where?
{81557}{81625}There's no-one around,|the whole place is shut.
{81693}{81761}Hello? Anyone?
{81766}{81827}We're here! We've invaded!
{81832}{81871}Shut up!
{81941}{82021}- I'm starving.|- I'm Sergeant King, how do you do?
{82026}{82129}Well, maybe we could get|something to eat or something.
{82134}{82241}- Maybe we could steal a car.|- Oh, yes. Good idea (! )
{82246}{82367}Which one of the many fine vehicles|would you care to requisition?
{82519}{82657}First rule of survival behind|enemy lines: live off the land.
{83047}{83091}Oh, I'm sorry. Oh...
{83107}{83146}I-l-I'm English.
{83167}{83225}Er... English?
{83543}{83582}Bloody hell!
{83752}{83842}I'm really sorry. I-l-I'm just|so hungry. I-l-I'll put it back.
{83868}{83911}Look, see?
{84260}{84305}Emportez-le.
{84328}{84377}Emballez-le, emportez-le, allez-y.
{84525}{84571}Emportez-le, allez-y.
{84638}{84678}Wrap it?
{84684}{84738}Er, do you,|do you want me to wrap it?
{85073}{85115}Can I go now?
{85334}{85426}Thank you. Thanks very much.
{85431}{85463}Attendez.
{85590}{85632}Vivement la liberation!
{86098}{86148}I was only getting some food.
{86184}{86239}I don't know what the problem is.
{86244}{86300}You said get some food and I did.
{86305}{86354}Anyone could have been in there.
{86359}{86418}The whole Third Reich|could have been in there.
{86423}{86472}- We should be so lucky.|- What?
{86510}{86616}- Can we eat the pie now?|- Don't you get lippy with me, son!
{86621}{86680}I'll knock|the living daylights out of you.
{86685}{86772}- Can we eat the pie now?|- You've jeopardised this operation.
{86777}{86833}You've been like|a kid on a school outing,
{86838}{86902}buying buns, waving stockings about,
{86907}{86963}cosying up to your|little Cornish pasty.
{86968}{87046}Then when I send you|to get some food, what do I find?
{87051}{87168}You canoodling up to some French|tart, practically slipping her one.
{87173}{87212}- Piss off.|- Eh?
{87257}{87306}- Piss off!|- Don't tell me to piss off.
{87311}{87335}No!
{87366}{87412}Everything you've asked, I've done.
{87418}{87480}Every order you've given,|I've followed.
{87500}{87551}Where has it got us? Nowhere.
{87576}{87623}Now, I'm a deserter.
{87628}{87679}I've nearly been drowned.
{87684}{87737}I'm tired and I'm hungry.
{87759}{87832}Whether you like it or not,|I'm going to eat this pie.
{87977}{88026}I can't believe you've done that.
{88155}{88217}No, I take that back.
{88235}{88279}I can believe it.
{88304}{88343}Look at you.
{88372}{88427}You know why|you're called the Kaiser?
{88454}{88544}You're a jumped-up, washed-up,|over the hill has-been.
{88549}{88586}- Finished?|- No!
{88634}{88673}You know what?
{88678}{88778}Back home, you command about|as much respect as a fly on dog shit!
{88783}{88857}Smart-arsed little turd!|I gave you a chance.
{88862}{88963}Nobody else would be stupid enough|to give you a gun, but I did.
{88968}{89073}I thought you had guts, but the only|thing you're good at is whingeing.
{89079}{89182}It's a good thing|your dad died when he did,
{89187}{89254}so he never saw|the whining tosspot
{89260}{89317}that his son had become.
{90555}{90617}Can you see anything?
{90654}{90720}- Nothing.|- A sign or something?
{90762}{90856}- No.|- We've got to find out where we are.
{91322}{91366}I'll see what I can find.
{91500}{91573}I didn't mean...
{91597}{91646}..what I said about your dad.
{91738}{91782}I'll stand guard then.
{91860}{91892}Sergeant...
{91897}{91958}They don't all call you the Kaiser.
{91963}{92012}Yes. You stand guard.
{92074}{92118}(WHlSPERS) Yes, Sergeant.
{92200}{92244}(WHlSPERS) Yes, Sergeant.
{94281}{94330}BUZZER
{94689}{94738}(MlMES) Kill him.
{95105}{95157}I-l-I'm sorry, Sergeant.
{95162}{95211}I missed him. He just got past me.
{95434}{95468}It's a train.
{95550}{95605}- It's stopping.|- It's waiting for the signal.
{95611}{95650}Well, which one is it?
{95756}{95800}Must be one of these.
{96138}{96191}It's full of bloody Germans!
{96218}{96258}Heh! Was ist hier los?
{96406}{96450}Warum mussten wir anhalten?
{96921}{96961}Ist jemand zu Hause?
{97121}{97162}They're on their way up!
{97219}{97273}There's got to be a lock.
{97277}{97338}- Wir haben nicht viel Zeit.|- Sonst kommen wir nie nach Brest.
{97370}{97394}Now try.
{97544}{97588}In Ordnung, kommt wieder runter!
{97941}{98014}Danke.|Naechstes Mal 'n bisschen schneller.
{98880}{98912}Supplies.
{98979}{99065}What shall we do with him?|He'll tell someone he has seen us.
{99238}{99288}Drunk in charge of a signal box.
{99300}{99349}They won't believe a word he says.
{100102}{100126}Mind the string.
{100197}{100276}How much do you reckon a|railway line's worth? About 70 quid?
{100281}{100354}- More.|- ¡ê80.
{100370}{100414}Put that away.
{100498}{100542}Ready?
{100670}{100708}RUMBLlNG
{100713}{100783}- What was that?|- What's wrong?
{100807}{100862}(WHlSPERS) I think I heard something.
{101012}{101069}Nah, it was nothing.
{101346}{101390}- Bloody hell!|- Gordon Bennett!
{101501}{101563}I think I've gone deaf. Have you?
{101637}{101686}Looks buckled to me.
{101692}{101736}Does it look buckled to you?
{101765}{101814}Yeah, definitely.
{101841}{101890}Loose as old knickers that is.
{101920}{101966}I wouldn't fancy travelling on it.
{101972}{102019}One grenade in the right place.

{102949}{102993}You've got the matches.
{103095}{103169}- Is that cheese off?|- Nah, it's French.
{103195}{103244}Do you want some?
{103250}{103351}No, I want you to strike a match|so I can see what I'm doing.
{103488}{103537}Closer. That's better.
{103583}{103657}Now then,|there's the railway line so we're...

{105282}{105326}Sorry about the cigar ash.
{105332}{105386}He was on one|of his nocturnals again.
{105392}{105437}This belongs up here, I think.
{105465}{105514}How are we supposed to run a war
{105519}{105576}when the Prime Minister|keeps interfering.

{106918}{107004}Of course it's crawling|with Germans, that's why we came.
{107067}{107116}I don't believe this.
{107140}{107222}You were going to blow up|the Scharnhorst with one grenade.
{107227}{107286}Destroy St Nazaire single-handed.
{107315}{107413}We find one piddly observation|post and you say it's too risky.
{107418}{107461}Keep your voice down!
{107466}{107515}One hand grenade, you said.
{107540}{107591}We've got a bag of the bastards.
{107650}{107705}Well, if you won't, I will.
{107710}{107773}You wouldn't last five minutes.
{107805}{107854}I'll be out in four then.
{108535}{108582}Once it's dark and I'm inside...
{108606}{108667}..I'll attach some grenades|to the fly swat,
{108684}{108770}move to the ops room with the|remaining grenades, then up it goes.
{108776}{108836}- Wait. Where am l?|- You're that pebble there.
{108841}{108914}- What pebble?|- By the fence, where we cut through.
{108919}{108980}- What am I doing there?|- Standing guard.
{108985}{109028}I don't want to stand guard!
{109034}{109099}I didn't come here to stand guard.
{109104}{109196}- I am giving you an order.|- Well, I'm disobeying it.
{109201}{109281}I'm younger and I'm faster|and I want to blow up the fly swat.
{109286}{109386}You can't! Whoever goes|in there is going to die!
{109392}{109453}Then what's the point|in standing guard?
{109537}{109591}Here. Take the grenades.
{109638}{109701}- Blow your arse off.|- You and your medal.
{109706}{109777}- It's not that.|- You can't stop being a hero.
{109782}{109843}- I wasn't a hero.|- Don't give me that tosh.
{109848}{109890}< It's not tosh.
{109896}{109951}I changed a tyre, that's all I did.
{110022}{110066}What? I don't understand.
{110100}{110207}The General was in the back seat.|A bombardment went up.
{110213}{110299}A piece of shrapnel caught|the front tyre and we got a puncture.
{110304}{110346}And?
{110351}{110435}General Sir William Hyde|told me to get out and change it.
{110440}{110528}A shell exploded to the right of us,|the jack slipped,
{110533}{110581}the car fell on my foot.
{110586}{110654}I drove some 10 miles|with a smashed heel.
{110719}{110773}So you were decorated|for changing a tyre?
{110778}{110818}Yes, I know,
{110824}{110884}RAC patrol men do it every day.
{110946}{110998}Can we get on|with the weapons check?
{111068}{111112}Two revolvers...
{111128}{111186}..and twenty rounds.
{111210}{111253}Grenades?
{111259}{111347}Five in the bag|and five in the nylons.
{111381}{111451}- Did you see any more action?|- I didn't.
{111456}{111539}I was invalidated out|and joined the Medical Corps.
{111588}{111679}So you haven't done|anything like this before.
{111739}{111788}Well, I hate to say this, Sergeant...
{111793}{111848}..but I wish you hadn't told me that.
{111867}{111922}It's fine. It's not a problem.
{112021}{112064}Four for the fly swat
{112069}{112168}and the rest for the ops room|and no-one stands guard. Agreed?
{112280}{112317}Agreed.
{112361}{112428}Hope you've got a handbag|to go with them stockings?
{114116}{114166}- Alright?|- Yeah.
{114171}{114215}Through you go.
{115220}{115260}Wait!
{115286}{115350}Cuthbertson. Mirror.
{115757}{115797}Right.
{115814}{115919}(SNlFFS) I can smell beef...|and onions.
{116484}{116535}Kaiser, komm her.
{116541}{116622}Komm her, du bloder Koter.|Komm her!
{116657}{116726}Was denkst du, was du da machst, hm?
{116732}{116771}Komm her.
{116805}{116844}Dummer Hund.
{116869}{116902}Komm!
{116907}{116941}Bei Fuss.
{117527}{117613}When you're ready, blow the bastard.|I'll be in position.
{118790}{118839}..drei Briefe gehabt letzte Woche...
{118844}{118885}- Drei?|- Ja.

{124345}{124369}Halt!
{125103}{125145}Pack it in!
{125205}{125283}Sergeant Mohammed,|it's Private Mountain.
{125409}{125451}What kept you?
{126564}{126624}- We did well.|- Keep your eyes on the road.
{126669}{126755}- You driven one of these before?|- It's not a problem.
{127129}{127191}We couldn't have done|all that, could we?
{127197}{127259}Let's get the hell out of here!
{128334}{128382}Leslie!
{128480}{128550}Sorry to trouble you. I'm looking|for a Miss Emma Fraser.
{128641}{128758}Now, Africa is the absolute priority.
{128793}{128856}What the hell|did I do with that thing?
{128861}{128949}I want to know everything|that is going on out there.
{128970}{129051}When I say everything,|I mean everything.
{129056}{129125}I don't want a camel|to so much as break wind
{129130}{129184}without it ending up on my desk.
{129190}{129229}Here it is.
{129238}{129280}There, no it isn't.
{129306}{129356}What the hell is this?
{129410}{129442}Not funny.
{129447}{129565}Now, I don't want another shambles|like Singapore, gentlemen.
{129581}{129642}ENGlNE FALTERS
{129734}{129783}Hold up.
{129902}{129947}We're out of petrol.
{130163}{130216}Cop hold of that oar, Cuthbertson.
{130248}{130292}The oar?
{130722}{130808}- Are we going to row?!|- No, we're going to knit a jumper.
{130843}{130933}It'll give you an appetite.|One, two, three.
{131879}{131938}He's depressed.|He won't get out of his cot.
{131943}{132042}- Have you tried Clemmie?|- She's dining with the Archbishop.
{132091}{132143}He's an old man, he needs a holiday.
{132148}{132197}Failing that, a victory.
{132210}{132296}Anything. Something to lift|his spirits. Good luck.
{132358}{132402}- Whose turn is it?|- Yours.
{132419}{132488}- I sat with him last night-|- Reading Kipling.
{132546}{132610}- Why don't you go home, Faith?|- Yes, I know...
{132629}{132678}I look terrible.
{133068}{133120}I promised the King victory, Merton.
{133192}{133241}Gave my word to the country.
{133336}{133385}I don't know if I can do it.
{133418}{133474}Well, would you like a whisky, sir?
{133520}{133569}No, Merton, I don't want a whisky.
{133626}{133675}I want a wander.
{133808}{133889}I don't know if this rabbit|is going to come out of the hat.
{134106}{134164}Cuthbertson...
{134170}{134219}..we've got company.
{134262}{134311}< Come on.
{134581}{134635}It's bloody following us!
{134769}{134827}Throw something!
{135402}{135498}- I bet it's one of ours.|- It can't be one of ours!
{135504}{135528}That's not fair.
{135558}{135617}Not after what we've done!
{135764}{135813}Come on! Blow, you sod!
{136297}{136336}Wie heissen Sie?
{136439}{136481}Sergeant King.
{136521}{136580}- Was tun Sie hier?|- I don't speak German.
{136586}{136644}- Was tun Sie hier?|- Sergeant King.
{137011}{137060}Private Cuthbertson.
{137116}{137165}We're dentists.
{137363}{137426}- Have we got the girl?|- She's on her way.
{137479}{137550}- Is there any tea in this pot?|- Stewed, I'm afraid.
{137555}{137604}Right.
{137766}{137804}Yes, that's Leslie.
{137809}{137882}- Are you sure?|- Positive. Where were they?
{137888}{137948}Reconnaissance|spotted them in the Channel.
{137954}{138019}- Floating on some wood.|- That was lucky.
{138025}{138125}That depends on how you look at it.|We don't take too kindly to spies.
{138151}{138213}- Spies?|- Yes. Or deserters.
{138268}{138333}Don't worry.|We'll find out soon enough.
{139293}{139334}Out!
{139729}{139778}Prisoner escort. Attention!
{139798}{139842}Quick march!
{140316}{140398}No, he said that|he had to do something dangerous.
{140403}{140467}He couldn't talk about it|as it was secret
{140473}{140541}and I might be a spy.
{140572}{140670}So I know they're not spies|because they borrowed a boat
{140675}{140724}and said they were going somewhere...
{140730}{140815}..which must have been France|which is where the war is,
{140820}{140881}so they can't be deserters either.
{140949}{140999}Sorry, do I sound a bit muddled?
{141005}{141087}Not at all. Thank you, Miss Fraser.|You may sit down.
{141308}{141347}Well, gentlemen...
{141353}{141445}Let me tell you, I've presided over|many court martials,
{141450}{141523}too many if I'm honest,|and i's not a task I relish.
{141541}{141658}Never before have I been asked|to listen to such appalling drivel.
{141695}{141741}You're deserters.
{141746}{141830}You know it, I know it,|everyone in this room knows it.
{141848}{141912}You ran away|for a coward's chance on easy street
{141918}{141995}and when your boat|sank on the way to lreland...
{142015}{142103}..you invented this fairy tale|to save yourselves.
{142133}{142184}What sticks in my throat above all,
{142189}{142304}is that even after you failed to|produce evidence in your defence,
{142310}{142419}you still persist in this ridiculous|'Boy's Own' adventure
{142424}{142503}of some personal invasion of France.
{142606}{142714}You have brought shame on the uniform|worn so bravely by so many.
{142766}{142807}You, Sergeant King,
{142813}{142862}you're beyond contempt, frankly.
{142867}{142926}Not only have you duped|an impressionable...
{143009}{143061}Begging the court's pardon, sir.
{143066}{143120}Who is this? What does he want?
{143125}{143200}I'm so sorry, Colonel, but er...
{143205}{143295}..if I might crave the court's|indulgence for a few moments?
{143321}{143402}- Who are you?|- I want to interview the prisoners.
{143407}{143484}- What?|- I'm Major Desmond Merton.
{143489}{143582}Chief lntelligence Advisor|to Mr Churchill.
{143617}{143665}Now, I have here...
{143708}{143821}..a ground plan... of some buildings.
{143827}{143884}Major, these are|official proceedings. >
{143889}{143960}These buildings|that you see here, gentlemen...
{143983}{144027}..do you know what they are?
{144033}{144083}Yes, sir. It's a listening post, sir.
{144088}{144143}A 'Cap de la Hague', sir.
{144163}{144212}Interesting. How do you know?
{144226}{144274}It says so at the top, sir.
{144367}{144406}Does it?
{144449}{144501}- Oh, so it does.|- Major...
{144507}{144565}One moment, please, Colonel.
{144570}{144640}Are you familiar|with these buildings?
{144645}{144722}- Yes, sir. I think so.|- What can you tell me about them?
{144728}{144788}Well, that's the fly swat thing, sir.
{144794}{144842}The... the what?
{144848}{144913}The signal receiver thing, sir.
{144918}{144982}It appeared to the uninitiated eye
{144987}{145060}to be a giant implement|for the swatting of flies.
{145066}{145122}I see. What about these chaps here?
{145127}{145176}They're the two teacup things, sir.
{145181}{145284}They had the general appearance|of teacups placed on their side, sir.
{145290}{145378}They were outside the perimeter,|so we left them alone.
{145383}{145432}Excellent. Right.
{145460}{145510}Now what was it that you did?
{145516}{145565}Blew up the ops room,|with grenades.
{145570}{145607}Major...
{145613}{145728}They are disgraced. They're guilty|of theft, deceit and desertion.
{145734}{145822}You're not suggesting there's any|substance to their story?
{145827}{145911}I'm merely trying|to ascertain the facts.
{145916}{146007}This operations room. Did anything|strike you as unusual about it?
{146047}{146095}No, nothing, sir.
{146144}{146196}- Apart from the smell.|- The smell.
{146201}{146281}- The smell? What smell?|- Er, beef and onions, sir.
{146287}{146350}- Beef and onions?|- Burned beef and onions.
{146355}{146402}Major, I really must insist...
{146407}{146491}Burned beef and onions! Ah!
{146525}{146566}Thank you, Colonel.
{146571}{146668}- I've heard all I need to hear.|- Well, thank God for that.
{146673}{146756}In your opinion, Major,|are they telling the truth?
{146770}{146830}No, sir. They are not.
{146904}{146955}They didn't destroy|the operations room.
{146985}{147034}They destroyed the cookhouse.
{147040}{147080}LAUGHTER
{147170}{147228}I'm not putting up with this.
{147233}{147338}Unless you can substantiate that|claim, I intend to pass sentence.
{147344}{147396}- I'm sure that I can, Colonel.|- How?
{147402}{147460}You're not going|to tell me you were there?
{147502}{147612}Not personally, no, sir, but|the 2nd Parachute Regiment were.
{147618}{147735}- The Paras where there?|- 119 of them to be exact.
{147740}{147794}There were after|those two teacup things,
{147799}{147855}which you were good enough|not to blow up.
{147861}{147952}Their task was to bring bits home|for our boffins to play about with.
{147958}{148093}There were reports of an unexpected|and very useful diversion...
{148114}{148182}..but until now,|no-one has been able to confirm it.
{148188}{148312}Initially, we put it down to|the French, but it just didn't tally.
{148318}{148417}Anyway, there we are.|Well done, gents.
{148423}{148516}Thank you, Colonel for allowing me|to clear up that little puzzle.
{148533}{148609}Oh, yes, and I nearly forgot.
{148615}{148665}Message from the Prime Minister.
{148670}{148771}He thanks you very much for your|letter. It cheered him up no end.
{148777}{148844}He apologies for the delay|in replying,
{148850}{148899}but he has had rather a lot on.
{148904}{148948}Next time you're in Whitehall,
{148953}{149024}he would be delighted|to see you for a cup of tea.
{149061}{149151}That is tea for King|and Cuthbertson, sir, not...
{149183}{149227}Well...
{149232}{149264}Oh, yes...
{149316}{149400}Here are your pay books back...
{149405}{149458}..which he has signed.
{149463}{149556}He didn't want you to go short.|As he said to me...
{149561}{149654}A few more lunatics|like those dentists, Merton,
{149659}{149714}and I can win this war by Christmas.
{150236}{150268}Cookhouse. The bloody cookhouse.
{150839}{150882}Well done, lads!
{152142}{152205}I'll see you in 28 days, Sergeant.
{152249}{152300}I'll be here, Private.

I just gonna get my tractor.
Do you and Rob fight?
No.
Why?
Well it could be the problem.
Sometimes, you know, a bit of tension or a fight, helps to bring new life into a relationship.
Baby!
What did you do that for?
- It was an accident.
- No it wasn't.
- Well, maybe I meant to.
- Yeah, I think you did.
Are you angry?
No.
- Lucinda?
- What?
What are you doing?
I can't sell this milk, it's ruined. it needs to be sterile.
Care to join me?
It's 1500$ worth of milk.
We can't afford to just throw money away!
It doesn't grow on trees!
What the hell were you thinking?
Jesus bloody christ!
- Oh my god.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Drosophila, it's for you!
Hello.
Hi.
- Really?
- Yeah!
So you were right.
Yeah, he just got all romantic, and we just...
- Where are we going?
- For a drive.
Lucinda?
Yeah?
Shouting at you yesterday...
It was good.
- Was it?
- Yea, because...
It made me realise how much I love you.
Well...
Isn't it?..
Damn!
Damn, it sounds like 78.
She's got a really sore foot.
Hey you girl.
Hey, you'll be alright girl.
I'll get you on some antibiotics.
Hello!
Goodness me!
Aren't you cold?
No. That qult, it looks a lot like one that I've lost.
No it's not.
In fact, it is mine. I'm sure.
Where did you get it?
Got it at the church fair.
It's nice, isn't it?
- There's lot of work been put into this.
- Well it's my quilt.
- No it's not.
- I want it back.
- Don't think so.
- Yes, I think so!
Give it to me!
Look what you've done you stupid girl!
Just go away!
- What are you doing here?
- What do you want?
- She's got my qult!
- Don't warry about it.
You'll only get things worse.
Just get out of here!
Wait!
I'm stuck!
What's going on?
Come on! Get going!
Hurry!
Why does she need all those qults?
She's cold!
Why do you think?
What's going on here, boys?
We caught her, auntie.
She was spying on you.
What should we do with her, auntie?
Take her away and set fire to her pyjamas!
But make it look like an accident.
I wanna... I wanna buy my quilt back.
How much will it cost?
How much have you got?
- Not much.
- That's no good.
Well there must be something...
What's the most valuable thing you own?
I might swap it for that.
It's silly.
You're silly.
Why didn't you wake me?
I thought you needed sleeping.
The cows are gone.
They've just disappeared.
Well, it's not the end of the world,
Is it?
What have you done with them?
I sold them.
Oh, well, I swapped them actually...
...for the... for the quilt.
See it's back.
Have you gone completely insane?
Where are they?
Whes my...
You allright, mate?
I wan ma ca...
What's he talking about?
He want's his cows back!
I wish I could help you, but you know, those cows are worth more of 400,000$.
Be reasonable.
He's looking a bit off colour, auntie.
Would you like a cup of tea?
- Play golf, mate?
- No!
Don't forget your quilt.
Don't you want your quilt?
Well, anyhow, I'll fix it in case you need it.
Hi, Drosophila.
What are you doing?
Nothing much.
Hey. How is it going with Rob?
Yeah... Good.
Great!
I might have pushed it a bit too far.
He's really upset.
He's just letting off steam.
Don't warry about it.
Anyway, he'll be extraloving tonight.
Maybe we should postpone the wedding?
No, no, don't be silly.
Everything's fine.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Just don't think I can face the preparations.
Don't warry. I'll get the Bhanas onto it, they're great with parties.
Do you want a ride?
I'll see you then.
It's a lovely color, isn't it?
- Is she nervous?
- Yeah, I think so.
I am... I just... just thought it'd be better if we got the Bhanas to do everything.
So it's going to be an Indian wedding.
Is that OK?
Where is he?
- Maybe he ran out of petrol.
- Two days ago?
How could he do this to me?
I'm not that bad, am I?
Damn him.
- You deserve better.
- Yeah.
Look, I... I hate to say this, but I never really liked him.
What?
Yeah. He isn't right for you.
Yes he is.
He's so right for me.
I love him.
You're overreacting.
Oh my God!
What have I done?
What have I done?
Do you like it?
The sari?
Your sari?
Yeah I am, I am!
Stop! Wait, come back!
Nigel. Where's Rob?
Find Rob! Go!
Nigel!
Look, Nigel.
You still in there?
You can't just live in the dark, mate.
It's not good for you.
Wanna come back and have some dinner?
You've got to eat.
Look, Lucinda's worried about you mate.
You got to go home.
I never wanna see her again!
You got to forgive her mate.
- Forgive Her?
- Yea.
Sorry.
How's your throat?
Thanks.
- Cooked yourself up a feed. Good on you!
- I thought you cooked it...
Oh, no thanks mate.
I just had breakfast.
Coming!
Sorry?
Have I heard of the Jacksons?
Yeah! Everybody's heard of the jacksons.
They're big!
You thought they were small?
They used to be big, but now they're small.
Why do you wanna know?
Where am I?
At home, sweetie.
Did you have a nightmare?
Yeah...
I had this dream, that you sold all my cows.
Go back to sleep.
It was my great-grandmother's.
It has sentimental value.
But that's no use to me.
Rob's not very well.
He needs his cows.
I could see he was a bit upset the other day.
I'll tell you what...
I'll give up my cows, if you will give up...
- What? Anything.
- ...The thing you love the most.
What? No.
- Hmm, this is pretty too.
- You can't!
No!
What's wrong?
Do you like it?
It's a nice hat.
- It's nice and warm.
- Is that why you're doing this?
Because I ran you over?
No, no, no, no.
I get run over all the time.
Hey! We all have to make sacrifices!
Hello.
Hello! Hello!
Hello! Hi!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Luce?
Lucinda!
Lucinda?
Hey come on, Lucinda!
You're a good girl aren't you?
Hey 115. You put on a bit of weight there girl, eh?
Don't you think I havent noticed.
I thought you, you know, gone for good.
Lucinda must be really pleased to have you back.
Rob?
You're not back together are you?
Oh no...
That's so sad.
I'm sorry.
You're getting cow shit all over you.
I'm gonna have to soak it.
I'll just get the...
I love you so much!
You and Lucinda?
I'm sorry.
It's OK.
Is it?
Oh, Rob...
How's she coping?
Well, she hasn't cancell the wedding.
Really?
Yeah, everything's on for saturday. It's all paid for.
Food, drinks, sitar player.
Rob!
Luce, are you OK?
Lucinda?
Get a doctor, quick!
Find a doctor! Go, go!
Luce?
Hey.
Just... just gonna get a doctor.
Rob!
Yeah?
I love you.
No...
...I don't.
Yes, I do!
I do love you.
No!
What's going on?
Would you stop playing stupid games?
You never loved me.
- But I looked after you.
- No you didn't.
- I got your cows back.
- Oh yeah? And how did you pay for them?
- I'm sick of your lies.
- Well, who got them back then?
The Jacksons.
Who are they?
What do they look like?
Well, you know, they're...
Oh just forget it, OK?
Wait!
He fainted.
I think it was my driving.
Oh hey!
Are you leaving?
No. These are my little shoes.
You must have quite a collection.
Yeah.
Oh Lucinda. I wouldn't go down there, if I were you. He's in a really bad mood.
Dr. Drakovich?
Feeling better?
If I knew what would make her happy, I'd do it! I'd do anything!
But she can't even be honest with me!
What does she want?
What does she want!?
What's in there?
Um... Some...
Some...
PRIVATE!
KEEP OUT OR YOU'LL BE SORRY!
Your clothes and stuff...
...that she wanted to get rid of.
Well, that's it then...
It's over.
If there's anything I can do...
Anything at all.
Hey you want another?
Hey!
Come on, wake up!
Come on.
Get that down there.
It be good for you.
Time to have some fun!
Time to wake up.
I'm asleep too long.
What are you doing this weekend?
Hello.
Get out of there.
Well looks who's here!
Thank you.
I didn't do anything.
- You gave her that necklace.
- Your granny's big diamond.
- We sold it.
- I hope you don't mind.
We built auntie a great big heater.
- She doesn't need so many quilts now.
- Look.
What happened?
What did Rob say?
Drosophila?
Oh that's my new 303.
Isn't it she a beauty?
Lovely action.
It's Bernie!
Oh my god Bernie, I'm so sorry!
Oh it's nothing, it's just a bullet.
It's just where I shot Mr. Bhana.
- There's someone else.
- Who?
What did Rob say about the suitcase?
Look, I didn't want to tell you...
He got really angry and he called you a lying bitch.
Lucinda.
Lucinda.
Who broke their promise?
It was me.
I did.
Cheer up.
- It's your wedding day.
- He's marrying someone else.
So? Do you love him or not?
Do you love him or not?
I do.
Yeah I do.
I do!
I do!
- Do you, Drosophila, take Rob...
- I do!
I do!
Back, go back!
And, stop!
- Let's get the hell out of here!
- Hey baby, we're hitched!
You alright? Dummy!
Lucinda!
I'm sorry.
I really am.
What are you gonna do?
I just want things back the way they were.
- It's your favorite.
- I'm not hungry.
Couldn't you make an effort just this once?
Just shoot me if you want.
Isn't this romantic?
- Hey. Say something nice to her.
- Like what?
I don't know.
You think of something.
Come on.
This is insane.
Tell her you love her.
I don't love her.
What's your problem buddy?
Give her a kiss.
No.
No!
Who are you?
Where's Rob gone?
What?
You're not Rob.
You see, Ro... Rob... Rob loves me.
Who are you?
Get out of here.
Get out of my house!
- Lucinda.
- I don't know you. Do you understand me?
I don't...
I don't know who you are anymore.
- Oh, sweetie...
- Are you OK?
Yeah, I was warried about you.
Is everything alright?
Yah, yeah. She finally came to her senses.
Oh Drosophila, you're so...
...different.
I can't believe Mr. Bhana offered to look after the cows.
I know. Isn't he the greatest?
They're in good hands too.
Cows are sacred in Indian culture.
It's nice here.
- No hey. Let's go eh?
- No come on! Come on!
The water's yucky!
I'm sorry.
Nigel, need your box, mate.
Come on.
Come on, Nigel.
Ni... Nigel!
Nigel!
Come on, Nigel.
Hey, it's not that bad.
Look! Come on. Take a look around mate.
It's not that bad.
Boy! Hello! Good boy!
Hey Nige. See?
It was all in your mind. Good Boy!
What the hell are you doing?
I just could've hit you.
Never mind about that.
Look...
- The nights are getting colder.
- Thanks.
You tell Lucinda she can keep it for as long as she wants. It doesn't matter.
But maybe later on,
I might want it back. OK?
OK.
Hey, I don't think we've ever met.
I'm Rob.
Mrs. Jackson.
Drosophila!
Hi!
Sorry about that.
I wasn't really concentrating.
Oh, it's OK.
She needed a wee bit of panel painting anyway.
Didn't you have a?...
Oh, yeah...
- Do you want a cup of tea?
- Yea.
- Where's Rob?
- I don't know.
- Done a really nice job in here.
- Thanks.
Lucinda! Don't shoot!
I've got our quilt.
Get away from here.
I was wrong.
I should have believed you.
It was Drosophila.
She lied to me.
I just... just found these today.
Do you forgive me?
It's too late.
Can't be too late.
It can never be too late.
Luce?
Lucinda?
No.
No!
What are you gonna do with all those shoes?
- There's quite a few of them.
- Yeah.
Well then...
We better get started then.
Nigel!
Outside!

Get down, get down...
I said get down!
My fingers aren't strong enough.
One, two... three little holes.
I want to go down to the canyon.
Do you know the way?
I don't, but my father does.
I'll tell him and we'll take you.
My son tells me you also like pulling the trigger.
Yes. I used to come here as a child.
Nice place, isn't it?
It's good you found us, it's very difficult to go down by foot.
Not even cats make it by night!
- You're going to Aya?
- Yes.
- All the way down?
- Yes.
We'll make it to San Bartolo in no time in the van.
You'll stay there for the night.
It's half way down the canyon.
Tomorrow, you'll walk down to the village.
It's very small, but you can't miss it.
There's nothing else.
So, do you have family in Aya?
Then why visit that lost hamlet?
If I'm not being indiscreet.
Sorry Dad. I'm sorry.
Didn't know it was loaded.
Be careful!
Sorry about that... Bunch of jerks.
The devil loads weapons and idiots shoot'em.
So... why are you going to Aya?
To kill myself.
All right.
Hop in the van.
Who wants some beer?
No beer for the Argentinian.
- Who shit in his pants?
- I didn't!
You're gross!
What an asshole!
You're gonna break it!
Are you okay?
Watch out...
- Come on!
- Hurry up with that!
Take this, Pablito, you fuckface!
What the hell are you doing?
Don't hog the beer!
Tell your cousin he needs a shower.
It smells like shit in here!
Forget to wipe your ass?
It smells like hell.
Have it again, Pablito!
Shut up for fuck's sake!
We're listening to music!
Fucking hell!
Goddam pig gave us a hard time.
If I'd known I wouldn't have come.
You asshole!
Good morning, Sir.
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes, thanks.
- Do I still owe you something?
- No.
As I said:
Go down, down, down...
Thank you.
You eat those birds?
Good afternoon.
Afternoon.
Afternoon.
Good afternoon.
I'm looking for a place to stay.
Metztitlan's the only place with hotels.
Who said hotels?
I want a place to stay here.
That's all.
Down there you'll find the Judge.
What has he got to do with it?
He's the people's representative.
- Down this road?
- Yes.
Thanks.
I understand why you'd come to this village for a rest.
People like you is just what we want in this place.
I don't see why not.
Really, not at all. Except that...
Not only cause it's my village but you chose...
Wait. I'm with somebody!
- You've chosen...
- I gotta water my tomatoes!
...very humble, simple people...
Wait. I'm with somebody!
So...
I told you to wait, you asshole!
So as I was saying...
Hurry up, Judge!
I don't see why not...
This is a nice village, but in any other one... you could be attacked for no reason.
So unfortunately...
It's very nice here.
Not cause it's my village...
It's the best village.
Not very touristy, but I think it's the best.
Seems our friend is gone now.
So... we were talking about Senora Ascen.
I should tell you that Mr. Vicente's wife...
Sabina... is a good friend of Ascen.
We can ask Vicente.
He's right over there. I don't think there will be any problem.
The lady is very poor,
I mustn't lie.
She's very poor and humble, but everybody cares for her.
Her house is rather remote but I don't think... there will be any problem.
She will receive you and if you like it maybe you'll stay.
My wife's coming right now!
She's with some people.
I'm the community's representative.
I was elected by the people.
Now before we go on,
I would like you to show me... your ID or some form of identification.
Here's your card.
Would you like to see mine?
Mrs. Sabina is coming!
Come here! Someone wants to ask you a question.
The man's staying with Ascen.
Take him up there!
It doesn't have to be with her, but they say she has a room.
A barn.
If you want I'll take you to her.
Please do.
Have a pulquefor the climb!
Come on, it's very good!
Wait here.
Good afternoon, Sir.
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Sir.
Come in, it's very hot.
Thanks.
Thank you, Senora AsUncion.
You're welcome.
But I'm not AsUncion.
I'm AscEnsion, which refers to Christ ascending into heaven with nobody's help.
And AsUncion refers to the Virgin Mary who was taken up by the angels.
But don't worry, here everyone calls me Ascen.
Don't they, Sabi?
But do come in... into the shade.
Fancy a little fruit?
Thanks.
- And you, Sabi?
- No, thank you.
I'll be back in a second.
- Won't you sit down, Senora?
- Thanks. I'm fine on my feet.
Now tell me, Sir, what do you need?
Sabina told me you'd like to stay for a few days in my barn.
Yes indeed, Senora.
Well, you know... I'm old now and I can't serve you.
Besides, I'm developing arthritis.
And on 3rd of March my ankles snapped off.
Why don't you look... for a better place down in the village?
I don't need you to serve me.
Besides, I like your house high up here away from the village.
But I don't have running water, it must be brought up with the donkey.
Wouldn't you mind?
No water is fine by me.
I won't stay for long.
That's fine then. Stay.
He may stay, Sabi.
Yes, do stay.
I'll stay then. Thank you.
Very good. Come now, so I can show you my house.
This is my kitchen, that's my hut.
Come now, come.
There's the barn, where I keep my corn and my little animals.
Inside is my dead husband's bed, you can sleep there.
Excuse me.
Here's some tea for you, Sir.
Why do you bother, Senora?
It's no bother.
Come on in.
You were praying, right?
I don't do that.
Not even to the Virgin Mary?
Not even.
I'll do it for you then.
Good night.
Good night.
Wait!
Please knock before coming in.
Forgive me. I'll do as you say.
Good morning, Sir.
- Can I have your cane?
- My cane? No.
Can I have some paint?
Let me by!
Can I have some paint?
Let me by!
Can I have the painting?
Thank you.
Let's go, Christopher.
Good day, Sir.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
It's bitter...
Give him more pulque.
Give the lady a drink.
She's tired from collecting nuts.
She'll go home nice and drunk!
So it's you... nosey bastard!
I saw you coming up and made some tea to cool you down.
Didn't know tea served that purpose.
It's ice tea!
Have a little fruit.
Who was that man coming down the trail?
I didn't see anybody.
If you say you prepared tea when you saw me coming up, you must have seen the man
I crossed on the trail.
Now I know who you mean.
But... he's not from here.
Great! Thanks.
Did you enjoy your first day?
Do you want some?
- What is it?
- Marijuana.
I like one of those drawings a lot.
That wasn't the question.
Do you recommend it?
What?
The little herbs.
I do indeed.
What?
Yes, Senora. Please do.
Alright.
But only to taste.
Pull up a chair.
Which is the drawing you said you like so much?
This one!
I must say I love comic books.
I even collect them, but only catholic ones.
You've seen all my pictures of Jesus.
On your altar?
And many more hidden away!
Who do you like more: the Virgin Mary or God?
I didn't know it was a matter of liking.
I told you yesterday they're all the same to me.
Here women prefer Jesus... and men love the Virgin Mary of Guadalupe.
I had a nephew in jail... and I used to bring him presents.
I gave him the Virgin Mary's holy image, but they took it from him... and thrashed him...
'cause he kept masturbating on her.
I'm glad you saw the note to come to lunch.
I thought you were gone for good.
Do you remember the man... you crossed yesterday while coming up this way?
Let's forget about that.
They want to take away the barn where you sleep.
What are you on about, Senora?
The man you crossed is my nephew Juan Luis.
He was in jail for many years.
He's the one
I used to bring presents to.
He's just come out.
And since he inherited... his grandfather's house, he wants to take it away.
Where will I keep the corn?
Without the barn, my hut will never resist the April winds!
I'll make you some of the coffee Sabi gave us.
I don't remember where the coffee pot is.
I found it.
All covered with dust.
You've got it backwards.
Try it the other way around.
No, that's not how it ended.
Go back.
There.
It didn't end there.
It didn't end like that at all.
Twist that ring.
That's it.
Let me tell you what really happened.
Sire, your bath is ready.
You're four minutes late.
I will not tolerate this slackness,
Marchand. Bath time is 10:00 sharp.
A precise routine dissolves the day, you understand?
It helps me forget the time
I've spent on this hateful rock.
England feared peace more than war.
Why? They're afraid of our friendship... our doctrines, our example.
I summoned the English ambassador and said if his idiot king wanted... to be the first to draw his sword,
I'd be the last to sheathe it.
It was magnificent.
Swords and bayonets danced in the sunlight above their heads.
The Old Guard, the Imperial Guard...
20,000 men, formed in a deep square around me.
I called on them for their allegiance.
"Do you swear to perish in defense of your emperor?"
And like a peal of thunder came the answer, "We swear it!"
I hope you're getting all this down,
Captain Nicholls.
Sir, my commander wishes to be informed as to your well-being.
Your commander's cowardice is a disgrace to his king.
You can tell him his authority stops there.
There, by that garden gate.
Captain Nicholls, you are on foreign soil.
On the double, man!
Enough of memoirs.
Let us turn our attention to the future.
A cargo ship bound for Brest has dropped anchor a mile off the coast.
By midnight, our man will be here in your place.
And I shall be on my way to France.
You will, of course, be traveling incognito and...
Incognito, yes, but in what capacity will I be traveling?
A galley hand, sire.
It is in the utmost need.
Even so, a position above decks would've been more appropriate.
Carry on.
An agent will greet you on the dock to speed Your Majesty to Paris.
Paris.
Whereupon the double will reveal himself... and all the world shall learn of your escape.
The French papers will trumpet the news.
Citizens will take to the streets.
Loyal garrisons will raze the white flag of the hated Bourbon king... and raise once more the beloved tricolor.
And then I shall come forward.
Yes. It is the only way.
So many have betrayed me.
I place my trust in only two things now:
My will... and the love of the people of France.
Red.
The prisoner is well.
Yellow.
The prisoner is well.
Unwell.
The prisoner is unwell.
Black.
Blue.
The prisoner is missing.
Might as well make a start now, lad.
Guard our memoirs well.
We shall continue them when we meet again in Paris.
I'm eager to write many new and glorious chapters.
Six years of English cooking.
Six years of gazing at these dreary walls.
And at your gloomy face.
You're quite ugly. Do you know that?
I've never had the heart to tell you.
Yes, sire.
Six years.
The mere passage of time... cannot dim the radiance of Your Imperial Majesty.
Your Highness has not changed since the day of the coronation.
Yes, well, the wait is soon ended.
Indeed. Before long our emperor will be back upon his throne... settled once more in the embrace of his people.
Reunited, one may hope... with his noble son, the king of Rome.
- My son?
- Yes, sire.
- A beautiful child.
- That child traded his destiny... for the tawdry comforts of the Viennese court.
Do not speak of him.
He turned his back on his father and the Empire.
Let the Empire turn its back on him.
Sire, the sentries will return in a few moments.
I am ready.
The eagle flies from belfry to belfry.
And to the twin towers of Notre Dame.
- What are we going to do?
- Sire?
Well, he looks nothing like me.
- Sire...
- Look at him.
He's gone to seed.
It's too late now.
We'll have to make do.
Very good, sire.
- What is your name?
- Eugene Lenormand, Your Majesty.
Eugene.
Eugene. A common name.
Effeminate.
How about Alexander?
Strong, masculine name.
I'm afraid the papers have already been made out, sire.
It's only for a short while,
I suppose.
This is a disgraceful island.
You will need strength and courage.
When I get to France, you will be relieved to announce to the world... that you're a fake, a nobody.
Until then... no one must suspect a thing.
There are so few to trust now.
Thank you, Louis.
I will never forget your loyalty.
We will meet again very soon, sire.
I hope the journey's not too arduous.
He's not a young man anymore.
You little skiver!
Get that mop working!
Where did you serve your time?
It wasn't on a French ship.
Do it on your knees.
Fill your eyes.
It's here for you every morning as sure as two and two.
Land ho!
- France!
- Yes. We're just passing Brest.
What?
Molasses is worth more in Belgium.
We sail on to Antwerp.
I'll not have my destiny shaped by petty concerns of some bookkeeper.
We must turn back at once!
Of course! I'll give the master your orders next time I see him.
Not like that!
Here. Watch me.
With practice, no doubt he will improve?
It's not the walk that worries me.
You're waddling again!
Never waddle!
General, if I may be permitted?
Good day, sire!
I'm gratified to find you in good spirits and enjoying the weather.
I'm not accustomed to being addressed from horseback, Captain... particularly by those of the lower ranks.
As to the weather...
I'm enjoying it very much.
As I was my privacy.
Good day!
Darkness comin' down.
Keep it tight, Eugene.
Like a crow in the gutter.
The eagle flies from belfry to belfry.
Take it.
Easy. Easy.
Poor boy. Good boy.
Come on.
What do you think you're doing?
Get off of the Marshall.
He doesn't like being ridden.
I must get to France.
I'm going to Brussels.
To France! Immediately!
I must commandeer this vessel!
Do what now?
Can this thing not go any faster?
The Marshall has his pace.
Even the water moves more swiftly than your horse.
One-way or return?
One-way.
This is the express for Paris?
As express as they come, I suppose.
Makes all the usual stops.
They've changed my battlefield.
The place throbs with posterity.
Did Napoleon, may one conjecture... enjoy a restful sleep here?
I've never been in this place before.
They've all gone, the others.
You've missed your carriage.
Should I bring you something from the kitchen?
No, thank you.
I'll bring you a plate, then.
Did you enjoy the battlefield?
It is much changed.
It seems so... confused.
You should have taken a guide.
They make it come alive.
I must get to Paris as quickly as possible.
There's the night mail to Charleroi.
What's your name?
Adele Raffin.
Thank you, Adele Raffin.
You have been kind.
Whoa! Whoa!
Passport check.
Your papers, please.
Lenormand. Eugene Lenormand.
Which one is he?
We've got him.
What do you mean, you got him?
He was trying to cross the border.
He's just here.
Put him with Cesar for now.
Get him ready.
Whoa.
The eagle flies from belfry to belfry.
And to the twin towers of Notre Dame.
Sire! You are returned to us.
At last.
May you forgive the unpardonable treatment bestowed upon...
I'm very thirsty.
Word came that you had missed the agent in Brest.
I had men scouring the border for Eugene Lenormand.
It was all I could think of.
I'm the end of the line here.
An outpost of one surrounded by royalist dogs and collaborators.
Come, sire, we mustn't lose any time.
Sire, you are now on French soil.
You will find transport in Cambrai, about two miles due south.
You should arrive in Paris exactly on schedule.
- What is your name?
- Bommel, sir. Justin.
Ex-company sergeant of the Old Guard.
The Old Guard.
The last faithful.
You were at Waterloo.
As the English cannon were cutting us down... you stood amongst us and said...
"You are the bravest of the brave."
They said there were tears in your eyes.
The bitterest tears are the tears of defeat.
I will require accommodations in Paris.
Yes, sire. I have a comrade,
Lieutenant Truchaut.
Nobody will think of looking for you there.
You should be safe from royalist spies, only...
Only it is far too humble a nest for the imperial eagle.
No doubt your more illustrious allies...
No. I trust none of them.
In any case,
I won't be staying long.
No, sire. Soon all of France will arise at the news of your return.
Farewell, Sergeant Bommel.
Till we meet again and the tricolor flies once more over Paris.
Long live the emperor!
You here for Truchaut?
The eagle flies from belfry to belfry.
Are you one of those crazy people from down the street?
- What?
- I'm not supposed to talk to them.
No. I'm here for Truchaut, as you said.
That's him.
I'll get Pumpkin.
You'll get what?
Are you the undertaker?
No. Eugene Lenormand.
Sergeant Artillery.
I was looking for Lieutenant Truchaut.
You found him.
- Pumpkin.
- Thank you, Doctor.
A mutual friend, an old comrade from the Grande Armes suggested...
I'm sorry. I can't hire any more veterans.
I can offer you a glass, a roof for the night if you need it... but that's all.
You spoke of a mutual colleague.
Yes. Bommel.
Company Sergeant Justin Bommel... of the Old Guard.
Truchaut had a wide circle of friends who held him in high regard.
Perhaps you'd like to meet some.
I'd be happy to introduce you.
Very kind, but I expect to be rather busy.
Pumpkin, I suggest we do not partake of any refreshment... until dear Truchaut is laid to rest.
The sun's come earlier than you said.
I hope we don't get left with a heap of rotting watermelons again.
Should've bought more cantaloupes.
They hold out longer.
We barely made it last year.
I don't think you even knew.
So many things we didn't share.
I tried.
I tried to be a good wife to you, Truchaut.
It was in the frozen wastes of Poland... that I met my true love,
Marie Walewska... a vision of loveliness with the face of an angel... haloed by little blonde curls.
She rejected my initial advances.
But eventually I... got her alone, and explained to her... what would become of her country if she didn't submit to my...
Enough!
Enough, gentlemen.
The time has come.
The emperor's surely reached Paris by now.
Fetch some more hot water, Marchand.
I feel a chill.
The time has come.
Do you hear me?
You must complete your mission.
You must reveal your true identity.
I've no idea what you're talking about.
So, Sergeant, you served with our dear Truchaut.
We were in Egypt at the same time... but in different regiments.
Egypt. The shadow of the pyramids.
Truchaut spoke endlessly of that voluptuous country.
Scorpions, the flies, dysentery.
- I wish I'd served in that campaign.
- Yes.
Perhaps you're destined for newer victories.
No. Our days of glory are behind us.
All we have are our memories.
Mmm. Yeah.
- To Egypt.
- To Egypt.
Is there no news of the emperor?
Why, yes.
"His Majesty's health is sound.
His appetite extremely robust."
My husband died on this sofa.
My husband died in that chair.
Madame Truchaut.
- I must impose a little longer.
- Impose?
Yes. The same accommodations will suffice. Perhaps a meal.
What has happened?
Two consignments of watermelons, and I have no money to pay.
Well, so be it. One mustn't let trivial matters dampen the spirits.
Trivial?
Hardship stiffens the resolve, sharpens the wits.
- They've taken everything.
- One must move forward.
I'll soon lose the house, do you understand?
I have nothing left. I have no money and certainly no bed for you.
I've no need to stay where I'm not welcome.
Good!
I'd sooner sleep in the gutter than spend one night... under an inhospitable roof.
I am a man who can be killed, but not insulted!
Please! Take the rotten fruit with you and the flies that go with it!
Sergeant! Sergeant Lenormand, can you hear me?
- Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
- Listen to me.
How many fingers can you see?
What's your name?
Emperor Napoleon.
What do you want?
Can I go now?
I suppose so.
What are you waiting for?
I have to tell Pumpkin if you had pains or lost your wits again.
Wait.
Bring me a newspaper.
And you may keep what's left.
You've had a good sleep.
Do you recall the moment just after your fall, I wonder?
It is somewhat muddled.
How long before
I'm back on my feet?
It's just a sprain.
You'll be up and about in no time.
No time's too long.
I'm indebted to your hospitality, madame.
It's Dr. Lambert you should thank.
He's given up his room.
I assure you I have no intention of staying longer than necessary.
Where did you get that?
Giving sweets to children now?
He earned it.
Here. Make yourself useful.
Can you manage?
He's taking it well, the loss of his father.
He never knew his father. I'm the nearest thing to a mother for him.
- I thought Truchaut...
- No. A stray.
What about you?
Any children?
A son. Same age.
Disappointment.
Pumpkin, we're ready to go.
You should keep your weight off that foot.
Find yourself a comfortable chair... and stay in it.
Come. There's work to do.
Let me see that one again.
Find a seat.
Settle down.
Come on. Quickly as you can.
What's going on?
Your efforts have been courageous... but confused and futile.
It is now time to prepare a rigorous plan of action.
Plan? What's he on about?
One: The time factor.
The current heat wave does not favor our campaign... since it makes the melons ripen quickly.
In reality, it also contains an element which could benefit us... and which we should exploit:
The thirst in the townspeople.
And us.
If we act swiftly... we can turn these weather conditions to our advantage.
Two: The terrain factor.
Paris covers a wide area, and we have only minimal forces in the field.
Haphazard effort will fail.
We must determine where the lie of the land works against us.
Long quiet streets... too much time lost.
Les Halles, the markets... too much competition.
We shall focus on zones... with the maximum concentration of population... and the minimum supply of fruit.
Regarding the first... we can mark the most frequently used access routes.
As regards the second, at dawn children will scout the terrain.
Remember... we conquer or perish!
Yes!
We should all sleep here tonight for an early start... if that's all right with you, Pumpkin.
You've had quite an effect on them.
It was nothing. Merely filling my time, keeping my spirits up.
An army's strength depends less...
Less upon its numbers than upon its spirit. Yes, I know.
My husband was also a great lover of talk.
- You think talk is cheap.
- No.
In my experience, talk has been very expensive.
There they are!
Yes, there they are!
There he is.
Tell them. Tell them you are not the emperor.
Tell them who you really are.
Captain Nicholls,
I must apologize.
I had hoped to keep this from you.
It seems the isolation here has proven too much for some of us... particularly those of weaker character.
I fear the general has become a danger to himself and others.
Will you get off!
You will pay for this, you traitor, fraud!
In you go.
- Unhand me!
- Come along. There you go.
It is too horrible.
The emperor is waiting.
All France is waiting.
That man is no more Napoleon than I am!
They'll all have to wait a bit longer.
What?
That man has been emperor for 18 years.
Eighteen years... while I was scrubbing the decks of his ships.
Now it's my turn.
- Remarkable recovery.
- What?
Your ankle. I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it.
Entirely due to your care, Doctor.
More a matter of will,
I suspect.
You have an interesting scar
I noticed, just above the heel.
It's similar to the one our emperor bears. Did you know that?
The one time he was injured in battle.
Austerlitz, I believe.
Are you two gonna be standing there all night?
- I'm afraid I will fail you.
- Let me be the judge of that.
I'd like to get a piano over there by the window.
Oh, you play?
I could learn.
I can afford to take lessons.
Yes, you could.
Of course you could.
I'm getting carried away.
There's still a lot to do.
A piano would be wonderful.
Come with me.
Here. Can you make it up?
I've never felt alone up here.
I always knew that in each of those houses... someone else is waiting for their husband to come home... or their son.
I met Truchaut in Holland.
He brought me to Paris.
He left for Egypt the day after we were married.
You were in Egypt too?
Yes.
I hardly saw him for 15 years.
He went all around the world following his emperor.
Then after Waterloo, we started this business.
He didn't have a head for it.
His mind was still elsewhere.
What about you?
You spoke of a son.
Yes.
I haven't seen him for six years.
That must be hard.
Especially at that age.
Every second that passes is so precious.
Left! Left!
Left, right, left!
We better slow down.
We'll have to get some more jugs in a minute.
Quickly.
Hold this.
Go on.
Come here.
Come under here.
- What's that you've got?
- For Gerard.
You put the pictures in, then magnify them against the wall.
It tells the stories of famous men.
Oh, my God!
He's chopped off their heads.
That's Bluebeard's castle.
They're all his wives.
You can't show him that one.
He'll have nightmares.
No, he'll love it.
Children love all that blood and gore.
I've bought something too.
It's magnificent.
I bought it from a lawyer who went bankrupt.
Well, that's something.
I didn't know that was possible.
Go on. Try it out.
Go on.
Yes, I see what you mean.
Very comfortable.
Go on.
Try it properly.
I want you to be happy here.
I must speak to you.
Certainly, Doctor.
Somewhat early for spring cleaning.
I've not forgotten him, Doctor, but life has to go on.
My sincere affection for Truchaut...
You were not married to dear Truchaut.
Nevertheless, I am compelled to view the way... in which he is being replaced as head of this household... as unbecomingly hasty, indecent... and it pains me to say this,
Pumpkin, a betrayal.
For the first time in my life,
I don't feel alone.
Now I have you, an old and valued friend, speak to me like this... with such spite.
I am moved to say these things only because...
I had presumed that after a decent interval... that you and I might... in due course...
I'm sorry.
What was it you wish to tell me?
Nothing.
Nothing. L...
It seems I've been offered a position.
A facility outside the city.
The time seems right for me.
I'll be leaving right away.
Doctor.
This man is not what he seems.
I'm telling you this as a friend.
As a friend, that is all I can tell you.
He did leave in a hurry, didn't he?
All that talk about a new position is sheer nonsense.
- Why do you say that?
- You know why he left.
He said you were not to be trusted.
He thinks you're hiding something.
What do you think?
I think you've been in prison.
Does that scare you?
I'm not scared.
Josephine.
My Josephine.
A perfect plum plucked from the tree of heaven.
She was to be my torment.
My soul was seared by her lips.
My guts are troubling me of late.
Perhaps Your Majesty wouldn't suffer such pains... if he did not sit around on his fat arse all day... stuffing his face like a pig.
- I wish to consult a doctor.
- Do you?
An Italian doctor.
No, German.
The best there is!
You'll have your doctor when you've done your duty, not before.
And stop stuffing your damn face!
Let us try and understand one another.
Either this is Napoleon... in which case we've all nobly performed our duties... and may look forward to a deserved retirement in England... at the expense of the British crown.
Or this is an impostor, and you men have colluded... in the most heinous fraud of our time... the suitable punishment for which I can only guess at.
While l...
I have allowed the monster of Europe to slip through my fingers... and escape from this island on my watch.
On my watch!
Gentlemen, what we have here is a dead emperor.
History shall record that
General Napoleon Bonaparte... died in exile on the island of St. Helena... at 5:49 on the fifth of May...
Oh, you're too old for that.
You're too heavy, anyway.
I've never needed spectacles. I don't know why I have to start now.
You enjoy reading.
- I like you reading to me better.
- Don't be a baby.
What are you doing?
Has everyone lost their wits?
Newspapers.
They've got newspapers.
What is it?
Haven't you heard?
The emperor's dead.
Eugene!
Pumpkin, did you ever see the emperor?
No, never.
But I did see Josephine once.
My father took me to the coronation.
I saw a golden coach go by with her sitting in it, just for a moment.
The crowd loved her.
Her kindness won many hearts.
She wore ruby earrings.
Beautiful, blood red.
Her neck was long and slender like a swan's.
Yes, she liked her jewels.
Who knows?
A man of his spirit, maybe he's better off dead than imprisoned.
Don't sit there all night.
Pumpkin?
Are you asleep?
I can't sleep.
Can you?
Yes, thank you.
When you first met me, what did you think?
Undertaker.
Afterwards?
An unhappy man.
Yes.
Now I want to tell you the reason for that unhappiness.
I've lived this so often in my head ready to tell millions.
Now I need to tell you. It's time for you to know the truth.
The emperor isn't dead.
I am Napoleon.
That's it, plain and simple.
You're sharing this wonderful bed with the emperor.
Lenormand, Eugene!
Eugene Lenormand!
I wish to see the garrison commander.
Take this.
Sign on this line here.
And here and here.
End of the corridor.
Knock on the hatch and wait.
All right,
I heard you the first time.
- Name and request.
- Lenormand.
I must see the garrison commander.
It's of the utmost urgency.
No one sees the commander.
It's a two-month waiting list to see his adjutant.
I have vital information concerning the death of Emperor Napoleon.
Do you really?
I'll put you on the list.
The eagle flies from belfry to belfry.
You don't want to go on the list?
What about Sergeant Bommel of the Old Guard?
His last posting was the border patrol at Charleroi.
Bommel?
Justin. Sergeant.
You're in luck.
He's due to be posted here in a couple of days.
Come here.
Easy, now. There.
- My dear Pumpkin...
- Get indoors. Get indoors!
My dear Pumpkin...
I came to you in need of shelter.
I found more, much more.
But the sweetness of your affection, the joy of this household... have been a diversion from my mission.
All my life, I have striven to be master of my own destiny.
Here, I feel it slipping away from me.
I have become a stranger to myself.
Has anyone else seen you like this?
Pumpkin, I know it's difficult... but you have to stop calling me Eugene.
I'm sorry I upset you.
But I want you to know that I will still need you by my side... after I've regained the throne.
No! Stop this nonsense!
I won't listen to it.
Stop this madness, Eugene!
I won't listen to it!
- Soup for breakfast?
- Broth.
Weather's changing.
It'll build up your defenses.
The broker's coming this morning about the land in Provence.
I have other matters to attend to.
What shall I tell him?
When's a good time?
Good time? How about never?
Is never good for you?
Where are you going?
Hey, turn around!
What does it say?
What does it say?
The last words of our emperor.
Very popular.
It's a bit racy in parts.
Read it to me.
"And it was in the frozen wastes of Poland... that I met my true love,
Maria Walska."
Walewska.
"She rejected my initial advances... but I eventually got her alone... and explained what would happen to her country... if she didn't submit to my desires."
Imbecile!
- You asked me to read it.
- Go on, go on.
"That night, I conquered my Poland of the flesh... and in the morning, what did she say?
'Do it again.
Yes, do it again."'
Eugene?
Would you say he displays this particular behavior?
I really couldn't say.
Then I must ask your approval to examine the man in private.
You're up.
I ran into Dr. Lambert the other day.
I forgot to tell you.
He's brought a friend.
Dr. Quinton.
A pleasure.
I didn't get to congratulate you on your new position.
- You left so quickly.
- It was nothing.
Are you staying long in Paris?
I never left.
Madame Truchaut tells us you have not been sleeping well.
Did she? How thoughtful of Madame Truchaut.
She suggests you have not been yourself in recent days.
How would she know?
What kind of doctor would you be, I wonder?
- Pardon?
- Your speciality, your forte.
Stomachs.
Dr. Quinton is a stomach specialist.
Is that so?
He was in charge of a military convalescent home outside Metz.
Really? There were that many bowel disorders and tummy upsets?
Well, an army does travel on its stomach, I suppose.
Dysfunction of the digestive tracts can be indicative... of other latent troublesome areas.
The gastric juices can become a foaming sea of torment... raging over a bedrock of mental debilitation.
A fine turn of phrase for a bowel man.
Any other complaints or disabilities?
None to speak of.
- How's your appetite?
- Healthy as a hunter.
- Vision?
- Eyes of an eagle.
No blurring, strange shapes either side?
- Did you enjoy a happy childhood?
- What?
Are you subject to melancholy, the darker humors?
Delusions of grandeur?
Coward!
Traitor!
Out of my way.
Eugene?
When I regain my rightful position...
I'll see you're rewarded for your services.
The only reward I want is for you to stop tormenting yourself... with this make-believe story.
I offer you a world... and you fail to believe me?
You have no imagination.
You have no faith.
I have faith in you, Eugene.
I am not Eugene!
Eugene Lenormand is nothing, a nobody!
He's everything to me.
I... am Napoleon.
No, you're not Napoleon!
I hate Napoleon!
He's filled France with widows and orphans.
He took my husband!
I won't let him take you.
Look at me.
Look and tell me what you see.
A nobody.
Say it.
A shopkeeper.
A smug little greengrocer.
- I am your emperor.
- My emperor is dead.
No. That's all lies.
Your emperor is returned to you.
I don't want him.
Nobody wants him.
They prefer him dead.
You know who I am.
You know my name.
Just say it.
Say it.
Who am I?
Come with me.
- Who am I?
- Not another word.
Come with me now... and you will have your answer.
What are we doing here?
Philippe, it's Dr. Lambert.
Wait here.
You there, what place is this?
Inside! Inside!
Come on!
Get in!
Come on! Move!
Get in line!
Come on! Faster!
Get in line!
You've got it backwards.
Try it the other way around.
Can we have another story?
Another day.
Just one?
It's bedtime now.
You have such delicate hands.
It'll leave a mark.
Skin doesn't heal like it does when you're a child.
Pumpkin.
Napoleon.
You're my Napoleon.
Who's that?
My son.
That was my son.
I hope he will be a better man than his father.
Pumpkin!
I surrender.
I am your prisoner.
Thank you for today.
Thank you for showing me you can be a happy man.
I have a message for Sergeant Justin Bommel.
- You wish to speak with him?
- Just a message.
And I'd like to leave this.
You were here before, weren't you?
I recognize you.
The message should read,
"Eugene Lenormand is dead."
No, not that.
"Eugene Lenormand has moved on.
He left this to remember him by."
What time is it?
Five o'clock.
Look! Your first bull.
- It'll be good.
- He looks "bragado".
You see white bellies everywhere.
A small white spot on the stomach can't be treacherous.
Wait till you know women before you say that.
You've put on a lot of weight.
Deal with the bull.
We'll talk about it later.
- Good afternoon.
- Same to you.
Winnie, what were we supposed to draw?
Animals at the farm.
- And is this a farm?
- Yes.
- What's this?
- A little girl.
Winnie, a human being can't be smaller than a dog.
I mean, does a dog eat with a fork?
No.
Can a dog draw?
No.
So?
- The dog's strongest.
- No.
Besides, a dog isn't a farmyard animal.
Draw me a duck instead.
I did.
It's very high.
Is it a wild duck?
No, it's hanging on the wall.
What's it hanging with?
A nail.
It doesn't hurt?
The duck's dead.
It's going to rain.
Carlotta Pascalini.
Carlotta,
I suppose you speak Italian?
A man is about to appear.
He just got out of jail.
He's your older brother.
You know he's a repeat offender.
You're meeting him from jail.
You haven't seen him for 14 years.
Can you tell me what he did to end up in jail?
Just to help me.
Fuck you, son of a bitch.
You needed to sense what he had done.
You protect yourself too much, you gave us very little.
Thank you.
Where are you from?
Palermo.
A beautiful city.
What are you talking about?
I'm not stupid.
This concerns us!
You're not quite right.
We started talking about the strike on bus route 67 and the risk we run each day in fighting possible death...
Don't start again.
If I drop you off, I'm coming up.
You needn't bother.
I won't tell her a thing.
She's more vulnerable than you.
A lot of men cheat on their wives when they're pregnant.
Usually after they give birth.
Really?
Are you sure?
The important thing is we sleep together because it's hormonally inevitable and because I'm...
I'm psychologically out of synch.
You piece of shit.
You hear me?
You're a piece of shit.
A bastard.
An asshole.
I hope your kid dies!
Southern Spain
- Did your father say anything?
- Yes.
He wanted to stay in the ring a little before they took him away.
He wanted to see what he had won.
When I saw the committee was awarding him the ears and the tail,
I walked over to the stretcher and said:
"Dad, they've given you everything."
And he answered:
"I can die now."
Almost there.
I'll stop bothering you.
One last question.
What is bullfighting?
Bullfighting?
It means meeting with someone for the first time and every day at sunset, looking him in the eye and, just after, telling him I have to kill him.
Thank you.
Ricardo Rossi for Radio Sudamerica.
Northern France
Excuse me.
Is there a problem with the Paris flight?
A problem?
I don't know.
A hijacking, a bomb.
We'd know, wouldn't we?
Or do we have to wait to see it on TV?
I don't know.
Why? Is it late?
I don't know. I have no idea.
In fact, we never know.
They'd tell us, right?
I suppose so.
Thank you.
You're very kind.
Are you okay?
I'm fine, thanks.
I just saw a man get transfished.
- Get what?
- Transfished.
He may be dead.
There's no such word, Winnie.
You can say he was transferred if he had to move, but transfished,
I don't understand, unless he was fished out of a tank.
Our teacher says a pike is a fish, like a sardine.
Yes. So?
He got spiked.
Not with a fish but with a horn.
Spiked.
That comes from the word pike, like a spear, not from pike the fish.
Mother!
You do that each time you hear a siren!
I didn't come home to have an accident.
And take your glasses off.
He's off to the morgue.
A morgue is for people.
Where is it they cut up animals?
An abattoir.
He's off to the abattoir, then.
The size of the thing!
How would you feel facing that?
I think it's a moment when all doubt vanishes.
If you end up facing it, it's your choice.
Hey, he's looking at you.
No, not at me, dear.
You know, I have an odd pupil.
She thinks all animals are bigger than her.
What's so odd about that?
I think she spies on me.
Spies on you?
No one can spy on you.
- I think that animal is still bleeding.
- I'm talking about a child here!
Drive, it's green.
- What's the child's name?
- Winnie.
Winnie! Are you sure she's a human being?
Welcome to the day of your rebirth.
You will learn to return into your emotions as a baby.
You're all human beings.
I can tell.
You have four limbs, two arms, two legs, a head with perhaps even a brain, and we're going to use all that to return to your primal emotions.
I'd like you to pair off into six groups of two, six couples since there are 12 of you.
13 now.
Are you enrolled?
Yes.
And why did you enroll?
I don't know.
Maybe because I want to exist.
Good answer!
The young lady wants to exist.
Perhaps she even has a bone to pick?
What kind of bone?
Something that annoys you, that prevents you from living.
A bone that sticks in your throat.
A bone that we shall try to dissolve together.
Yes, that's it.
Since there's an odd number of us,
I'll be your partner.
You can be the child. Okay?
Okay.
Mr. Orchid, have you been with Mrs. Orchid long?
Yes, I see.
Well, you're going to work with Mr. Beard.
That'll be better.
And Mrs. Beard can go with Mrs. Orchid.
Well, this is looking good.
It's lovely.
Very good.
Rock your partner gently.
Very good. It's lovely.
I can't do it.
You can do it.
I'm sorry?
Brigitte?
No, there's no Brigitte here.
You're welcome.
Brigitte? No.
Actually, this is the right number.
Brigitte is dead.
You didn't know?
How did she die?
She jumped out of the window.
Who am I?
Her last partner.
Really?
How long had you been married?
I didn't know.
She never told me.
Anyhow, she didn't suffer.
From the 9th floor.
That's why she didn't suffer.
I'm sorry.
Chips with both?
Chips with both?
- Any developments?
- Nothing.
I spilled some coffee this morning.
Where?
Here, on my sweater.
I can't see it without my glasses.
Plus it's night.
I can't see it either.
I rinsed it out right away.
Even an inch away, you couldn't see it.
She stared at the stain all day.
She didn't take her eyes off me.
- I had to hide it with a book.
- Who? Winnie?
What was I like when I was five?
Why do you ask?
No reason.
I can't seem to remember.
You were... dark.
Did I still wet myself?
I don't think so.
That's all I remember.
It happened, like with all children.
Once or twice, when you had a fever.
Just tell me,
"At 5, you still wet yourself."
Don't be silly, Juanita.
Remember when I sang
"Juanita Banana"?
You remember nothing about me.
Scissors.
Scissors.
Fred, go to bed.
Good night, Fred.
Juana wants me to go to Lille with her.
What shall I do?
You've refused so often, accept this time.
What if she asks me questions?
She won't ask anything.
She has a problem with a pupil.
It's bothering her.
She doesn't know what to do.
She won't ask you anything.
What?
Nothing.
Paco?
I need to change.
Change something in my face.
Look, this bone here has grown thicker from wearing glasses.
I sometimes feel a palpitation as if my heart was beating here.
It hurts. It makes me suffer.
Why tell me all this?
To get your opinion, my love.
Stop wearing your glasses, sweetheart.
I'll get an operation.
They'll cut me open, remove some bone and stitch me back up.
Maybe they won't remove a thing.
You don't need to go under the knife.
What's going on?
You know what?
Tomorrow,
I'm going to Lille with you.
You're getting more beautiful.
You too.
Have you seen his visitors?
- No. How many?
- Three.
- One by one, then.
- I think they're triplets.
Really?
No, not me. Them.
- They're in sterile gear?
- Of course.
They mustn't touch anything.
Why do you move like that when I touch him?
Hands up!
- Who's got them?
- You have.
You think I'm stupid?
I gave them to you.
Take a good look.
In your pocket.
Where do I put them?
Hand them over.
- What are you doing?
- I'm not killing him!
- Shall we sit down?
- There are only two chairs.
Come on, Pedro.
Sit there.
I'll sit on the bed.
But you're on the bullfighter's foot!
All right!
He looks well.
Your faces are a picture!
He can hear you in a coma.
We're here to help him, to cheer him up a little.
At least try to.
This isn't a funeral.
Look.
Victor, we've brought you the ears.
Okay, tell him your Mexican joke.
The difference between guacamole and an American bicycle?
No, not that one.
Which one then?
You don't know any Mexican jokes?
You have hundreds of them.
You tell them around the clock.
You tell them in your sleep!
- Hands off him!
- I'm not touching him.
Now I dance the flamenco?
- Tell us a joke.
- I have none left.
What do you mean, "none left"?
And who are you to give me orders?
Are you crazy? Get out!
See you later, Victor.
See you later, bullfighter.
I've got no milk for my calf.
I can give you my milk if you want to feed him.
Think he'll like it?
- My milk's the best.
- No, mine's the best.
Yours is all gone.
Take mine.
All right.
Hi, everyone.
But mine's still the best.
I was only trying to help.
What are those horns?
I made them.
You made them?
Not for school.
It's not a real school day today.
We're having a picnic.
Look.
Give your teacher the drops.
And take those silly horns off.
If I can't wear my horns,
I won't take my Valium.
Fred, you want some Valium?
Here, Fred.
- Had a nice ride?
- Yes.
We went for the same ride as the other day.
Nice, wasn't it?
Here, Fred.
Help! Help!
Where is she?
I hope I wasn't too rough with my horn.
It's okay. I didn't feel a thing.
They're keeping you busy.
I hear you're the kangaroo in the forest episode.
Me? Who said that?
You're on the schedule.
I have a million things to do.
I can't.
Why can't Veronique do it?
Her mom's dying.
Between you and me, that's a feeble excuse.
Playing a kangaroo is no fun.
You don't lose your mother every day.
If people had a real adolescent crisis, their parents' death wouldn't be so tough.
They'd be able to face death.
- You think so?
- Of course.
Until you lose yours, you can't judge.
Are yours dead?
In a way, I suppose they are dead.
I'm 29, I'm an actress,
I earn my living.
I could say I've earned my life.
I'm not saying it was easy, but the result is clear.
I'm a free woman.
You're single.
- Not by choice.
- You're cute, though.
I'm not just saying that.
Stop right there.
It's not because I can't find anyone.
I'm just too dependent sexually.
That's the problem.
It's a form of polygamy.
It frightens men.
It seems it's quite rare.
It makes me suffer.
Well, I think so.
I admire you.
In my village, when a girl drops her keys in public, she doesn't pick them up but calls on her neighbour to borrow his double.
What does that mean?
Always call on the neighbour before you go home.
Let me do it, mom.
It's for you.
- For your birthday.
- Thank you.
It's magnificent!
Mom, you didn't steal it?
Oh, really! I used the money from the boar sale.
Promise me you'll never sell it.
- Never.
- Are you sure, Luc?
I swear, mom!
- You're sure?
- I promise.
Why are you doing the belly?
Never start with the belly!
I showed you with the duck.
Look.
Arthur.
Louis.
Cyril.
Antoine. Jérémy.
That's a stupid way of doing it.
Give them numbers instead!
Look.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four and five.
Okay, mom.
That mutton wasn't fresh last night.
You know, I'm not supposed to eat kebabs.
No.
I didn't know.
You did know, Jacques.
There was red cabbage in it too.
Red cabbage can make my milk sour.
If I give birth now,
I won't be able to feed the baby.
You know how important that is for me.
You know I was never breastfed.
You want to remind me of all that?
You think too much, but there's something
I don't get, Betty.
Why didn't you leave the red cabbage?
Am I supposed to take it out of your mouth for you?
You'd just eat your kebab without noticing what I'm eating.
- You'd never notice.
- Please, Betty.
I'll be off now.
I've had the eyes from Spain.
An ox or a bull, I'm not sure.
I'll examine them while they're fresh.
It's beautiful!
I've marked the route so you can pick me up from school.
Here. You won't get lost?
Where will you go?
I'll see. I'm free, dear.
I'll be going then.
Can you help me?
Thank you.
I think it's time for my medicine.
That's right.
I thought I put it in here.
Did you do this?
Yes, I did.
My mother must have put it in my bag.
It's funny.
- I was only little then.
- You were five?
Look, did I draw people smaller than animals?
Look, I knew birds were in the sky.
They're old birds.
- Yours are stuffed.
- I thought you drew better.
But you do circles well.
That's right.
How come?
I can't manage to do them, but you could when you were little.
It's weird.
Fifty.
Fifty-two.
Fifty-three.
Fifty-four.
These are for the car.
I didn't count, but there were very few red cars.
I told you that means nothing.
It would if you looked at number plates.
Then you could compare.
- I don't care about those.
- You see, it's a stupid game.
Stop doing that Belgian accent.
I can't help it. I feel Belgian.
- Know why there's no ketchup?
- No.
Because of them.
- It's the school holidays.
- Sure.
We'll never know school holidays.
You'll never have children.
You can't say.
Don't be stupid.
Know who's going to call in an hour for your birthday?
Your brother.
Fancy that! I thought I saw your father drive by in a 2 CV.
There are no 2 CVs on the motorway.
And your father's dead, stupid.
Shit.
Blind in one eye.
How come?
Did another bull wound him?
No. A lot of bulls are born that way.
One-eyed bulls are the most dangerous.
They leave the pen and the audience thinks they're just like the others, but no.
It can't see everything.
It holds its head differently.
It must be a terrible feeling.
You realize you're alone with it and that it's hiding something from you, that its body is hiding something.
As if a good friend lost an arm.
You need to get used to it.
No. In that case, your view of him is altered.
You can still touch a misshapen body.
But in the bullring, even if you know how to fight, there's a clinical factor in the bull that shatters your bearings.
Doubt kicks in at that point.
You'll get your surprise.
Just like last year.
Only you'll get it this year.
You've got no patience!
You're sad now.
Wait! Wait for me!
One. One, two, three.
Testing.
Ladies and gentlemen, today in your hypermercado...
Bravery, passion, strength and power straight from Spain to your dog's mouth!
Today, ladies and gentlemen, the one who eats from his bowl, who guards your garden, your faithful companion, will be carried back to his primitive state by a bone!
Roll up! Roll up!
Buy a fighting bull's bone for a toothless dog!
A fresh bull's bone!
He's going to get transfished.
Put some horns in your dog's life!
Bring the bullring into your garden!
Come on, ladies and gentlemen, buy a fresh bull's bone for a toothless dog!
We could get one for Fred.
We'll take one.
This one?
Isn't it a bit big?
Can you gift-wrap it?
Jorge? Jorge?
Georges!
Gift-wrap?
We don't have any wrapping paper.
Sorry, we don't have any.
- What does "Romero" mean?
- Yes, what does it mean?
Romero?
Actually, I'm Italian.
I don't speak a word of Spanish.
It doesn't matter.
The right choice.
You won't regret it.
Let's go.
Not at all. Yesterday,
I left a message saying that Mr. H, as in "hatchet" or "Hegel," wasn't quite dead.
I just wanted to tell you that I didn't do it today either.
I'm alive.
There. Have a good evening.
You too.
No problem.
Fred's bone!
Winnie, lie down so no one can see you.
Henri, you can go now.
Are you kidding? Fetch the bone.
- You could thank me.
- That was a close call.
130 francs for the squirrel on its branch.
130 is too expensive.
Try 110.
It's mounted upside down.
No, it has all its teeth!
130 francs! It has all its teeth!
Watch things while I take a look around.
This hen's really beautiful.
It's fantastic.
Not so fantastic.
They're mine.
Impossible. They're mine.
Not possible.
The scar's looking good.
The bodywork's fine, but not the engine.
He's a blood donor.
We know his profile.
Yes. The first matching liver is for him.
If we don't get a liver, how long can he last?
Not long. Not long at all.
How shall I put it?
The liver has packed in.
But it doesn't matter.
It's all right.
Medicine has made a lot of progress.
- Maybe, but he'll need a transplant.
- Don't worry about that.
I saw loads done at medical school.
These days, a transplant is like a toothache!
He won't even notice, and the scar is tiny.
You can barely see it.
You have a liver?
No.
I have two tests to do tomorrow.
I'm making good progress.
It's very interesting.
What did you do today?
I filled the aquarium.
That's good.
Go in, Jérémy, they won't eat you.
Can you have him?
His dad and I need to talk.
Of course. Come on in.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
Should you be eating that?
Good, isn't it?
Tell me when you want to pee!
Look, it's soaked now!
I know you have problems at home, but you could let me know.
All right, don't move.
What are you doing with that?
Jérémy!
Are you crazy?
- Where's the other?
- Under there.
I have to work with those eyes!
- I couldn't move the couch.
- I'm not surprised.
Where is it?
There.
Out of the way!
You put some paper under here too?
No, I didn't!
One, two, three, four, five.
Someone wanted to buy the horns.
How much?
Who cares how much?
I won't sell.
Do as you want.
What do you mean?
You bought them for me.
I can't.
You said they were for us both.
I don't remember.
I'm going a bit batty.
You never usually change your mind.
Maybe, but there's an April moon tonight.
Let's go and find some deer.
Let me tell you something.
I never mentioned that your father was deaf and dumb.
Look, he'd go like this.
Then he'd go like this.
Like this, like this, like this, and like this.
That meant he wanted to go far away, cross the sea and build a house.
I was the only one in our village who realized he wanted to go to America.
And he married me.
He's in America?
Your father's dead, stupid!
- Hold your fork properly.
- Mom, please.
Tonight, you will be reborn!
You're going to make it tonight!
We'll find our primal scream!
Good evening.
I just came to tell you that
I know who damaged your car.
It was a shopping cart.
- You were there?
- Yes.
Was it deliberate or not?
I mean, my car's a wreck now.
It's hard to say if it was deliberate or not.
It's hard to say.
It was kind of deliberate.
I knew it!
Do you work at the supermarket?
No, not at all.
I don't do anything.
Not now, anyway.
I used to be a philosopher.
I wrote notes.
You know, those books to help with exams.
I did a few of them.
But now I skate.
Will you join me in the pool?
But you really have to be naked.
Do not hesitate to give a name to aspects of your partner.
There's nothing sexual in this.
Step behind your partner and help him or her to give the scream.
It's important to have someone behind you when you scream.
How do you choose who...?
Go on, if you want.
I'm totally out of this.
Mind my plaster there.
It's a pity you've given up philosophy.
I failed my exams but I remember those notes were useful.
I hope you didn't fail because of me.
You know, it's hard to help people in their despair.
They look at me, sitting there, on their shelves, the cause and witness of their failure.
It's hard to live with.
I can believe it.
What do you do?
Switch around!
I'm an actress.
That's why you're so comfortable with your body.
Maybe.
What do you act in?
Everything.
That's good.
I've ordered pizza.
Will there be enough?
Should be, I've ordered eight.
You never know.
What do you mean?
That's five too many.
Pizzas can be frozen, Betty.
What are you doing?
Looking for the ashtray.
I want to smoke again.
It was the pizzas.
Perhaps you don't trust me enough.
If we told each other a secret, perhaps we'd trust each other.
I'm not going to find my scream like this.
Can we switch positions?
Is that okay?
Actually, I use car registrations to make up phone numbers.
I dial the number, and there are three possibilities.
Either the number doesn't exist, or it exists and no one answers or, more rarely but it happens, someone answers.
What do you do then?
Usually, I ask for Brigitte.
They say it's a wrong number but some people actually tell me about Brigitte.
People are so lonely.
Thanks to me, they're able to make up a story.
What's your secret?
You see all these plasters?
I'm having all my moles removed.
Except this one?
My father has the same, and I didn't tell my parents.
What's your name?
Alexis.
And you?
Carlotta Ida Francesca.
I think I'm finding my scream.
I don't speak Italian.
I think I have to get out.
He's going to love this.
Look.
Who's this for?
It's for you!
Who's that?
Expecting anyone?
Here, take this.
Good evening.
I have a problem. He found you thanks to this medication.
My car's a total wreck!
I've seen you somewhere before.
You're the bone seller, aren't you?
Come on in.
I'll take the Valium.
Actually, it seems your cart deliberately hit my car.
I'm a witness.
I want compensation.
You've come to the right place.
I mean, I'm sorry.
It was me, or rather us.
We're really sorry.
What can we do?
What the hell's that?
- It's huge!
- That's Fred.
He doesn't look well.
- What's wrong with him?
- I don't know.
He's dead.
I didn't order this.
You ordered the bull.
I'll be right back.
It's my first day.
Sorry, that's not your order.
It's not beef?
No, it's bull, in a Rioja wine sauce.
A Spanish dish.
I'm sorry.
I'll keep it.
Are you sure?
It's the last helping, and that man...
All right.
Bring me something else.
Mom, you're crazy!
You'd started eating it.
I only had a nibble or two.
Here he comes again.
It's yours.
The gentleman will have a steak.
He says that he used to know you.
- Shall I warm it up for you?
- No, it's all right.
I'm sorry.
- Thank him.
- It's because I tasted it.
He's not being nice, you know.
So you know him?
Never seen him before.
Never seen him.
I don't have a knife.
- What did you have for lunch?
- A sandwich.
In the sun.
Snail
Poke out your horns in the sun
I found the drawing.
Were you pleased?
I needed something in my bag and I found it.
I drew pretty well.
- The apples looked good.
- I don't remember.
I put it in your bag as we left.
I could draw perfect circles at 5!
My teacher never said?
I can't remember.
How's your little pest?
She's fine.
She's perfectly all right.
I was just a bit paranoid.
She spotted the problem in the drawing.
Perhaps my teacher put the wrong date.
Maybe.
Is it good?
- What?
- The bull.
A bit too much wine, but it's not bad.
Juliette.
I'm sorry? I'm not Juliette.
- Forgive me.
- Don't mention it.
We've never met.
You were Anne's friend.
You lived near the music school and couldn't play the cello.
I think you had dyslexia.
I don't know Anne or the music school.
Forgive me.
I'm sorry.
I don't believe it!
Who the hell is he, the new Romeo?
That was funny.
We'll tell Dad.
He'll split his sides.
Meeting a man through a switched plate.
You mingled your saliva.
Stop it!
The start of an affair...
I'll call Dad.
Mom!
Are you okay?
You're not cold?
A cigarette?
Look.
The pretty apples.
Shall I serve you?
Dead meat in the living room is a health hazard.
After all, by now, the worms are moving in.
Look.
If you don't mind,
I'd like to have a wake.
He'll stay there for tonight.
He seemed very nervous all day long.
I don't know.
He kept drooling.
Could he have possibly had an emotional shock?
Sorry, it's nerves.
Those dogs have weak hearts.
We'd bought him a present.
Lucy was unwrapping his bone.
It's as if it was too much for him.
The bone you bought from me?
I hope it's not my fault.
No, it was just a bone.
A bull's bone!
Still got your gun?
Winnie! Don't be silly!
Are you crazy?
Unload the thing, for God's sake!
There's only one bullet and it's for...
It's for me.
All right.
There. It's empty now.
It's funny, I had a cousin who had that very same lamp.
When you stepped under it, you felt obliged to tell the truth.
The very same lamp.
We can't give your real name.
Bergé, like all our guests, has just left prison.
You're here to tell us about the book you've written,
"My Mother's Eyes".
A very moving book that teaches us a great deal.
Why call it "My Mother's Eyes"?
Perhaps because my mother's eyes were the first thing I saw.
That makes sense.
It might heal up.
To sum up your story, it began last year when your mother's head was found in your home, a head you'd kept for some years.
That's right.
Your mother died at home
5 years ago and you decided to keep her head.
That inspires a number of questions.
Firstly, what on earth made you make such a decision and, on a practical level, how did you keep it?
Mom used to take me to museums.
She loved to see big, stuffed animals in museums.
I decided to stuff her head with plaster.
Had you practiced on other items before?
No. The idea had always interested me but I'd never had a chance to try it.
It was the first time.
This was the first time.
I came home
We haven't danced for a while.
Want to dance?
And started to part her head from her body.
I'll peel the onions.
Why? We've eaten.
I'm crying.
But I'd like to put it to some use.
Want my anchovy?
- I've got olives.
- I'll have one.
You want the olives?
She wanted to donate her organs.
We found the card on her.
They've started taking them.
There.
You wouldn't think so but the cuts are quite deep.
There's one like my mother's.
It'll be the hardest one to remove.
It's midway between my nipples.
Apparently, it has all kinds of roots.
After your birth, your mother left for France.
She'd been involved in something before we met.
What are you talking about?
She killed someone.
- Perhaps not on purpose.
- You don't kill by accident.
They were both sixteen.
They were always together at the school.
One day, your mother's best friend vanished.
There was an investigation.
The police searched everywhere.
She moved her friend's body each night.
She dragged her from one room to another to foil the investigators.
That went on for eight days.
Then, in the end,
Juliette confessed everything.
Anne had broken her neck on the stairs.
They had fought.
Juliette wanted her for herself.
Mom wasn't called Juliette.
I'm the one who named her Alicia.
- When did she come back?
- When you were 5.
- I loved her.
- Me too.
You should never have entered
Another person's life
You're just a stain on the floor
That no one cleans
To reach you
We have to dig down
Deep into the heart of a new life
To tell you it can grow again
You should never have entered
Another person's life
You must look alive
To draw people to you
By moving near the dead
We can believe they still move
You wait to be spoken to
You'll know by the sound
Beneath the lava
Life goes on
You should never have entered
Another person's life
You'll understand
That you can always sleep
Closed eyes help you think
The one kissing you can't see
That his disgust isn't real
The pleasure's only yours
You'll never give it again
You should never have entered
Another person's life
And when you feel it stir within you
You'll think the monster is dead
A mere stain
With the plant growing back
Listen well
If it's your heart
You'll never burn again
You never burn twice
You live several times over
You never burn twice
You live several times over
Wait! Where are you going?
They were born at 5.
Five daughters.
Your wife will wake in two hours.
You can register the birth.
I have a question first.
How can she give birth to five babies without any family history of it?
It's very rare.
Her treatment over the last 3 years tends to lead to multiple births.
Her treatment.
For what?
Fertility treatment.
- Three years?
- More or less.
You should know better than me.
In any case, it worked.
Congratulations!
Wider.
I felt something move.
It's his heart.
Open.
Idiot.
Clown.
Jacques, have you got the time?
Lovely day, isn't it?
Yes, okay.
I didn't understand the last bit.
It's five o'clock.
I'm going
What do I owe?
I'll get it
I see
I had a great time
But Yuji, your teeth are the worst
Ruin that handsome face
Come to our dental office
I'm really good
Make you some decent crowns
Bye now
Thank you
God, she's a bitch!
She'll have a dumb kid!
Hey, wait up!
Wait!
C'mon!
From now on, just tell me to my face
Wedding Invitation
So you had the phone
I thought I'd lost it
What's that?
Oh, she called
I just saw her
Oh, really
You've been seeing her, huh?
Why didn't you tell me?
It's not...
You turned her down, right?
That's what you said
Isn't it?
Yeah, I turned her down, but...
But what? I can't hear
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
I was seeing her, but...
What comes after the "but"?
We just talked
There's nothing going on
Oh God, no
Are you by any chance bi?
No
What?
Listen
So say I'm gay
I mean I am gay, I'm gay
That's true
But then, just because I'm gay, does that mean I have to live a certain way?
I mean...
I've got so many branches
Lots of different branches, but your roots are gay, right?
That's right... but like, possibilities, or like maybe there's the possibility that I could be a father
No, maybe not, but...
You've been totally brainwashed
You know you love men
But you said so once yourself
You told me you're bored by all that bar talk about men, sex and the entertainment world
What's that got to do, to do with lying to me?
I'm sorry about that
Don't make excuses
It's not an excuse
You're making excuses
No I wasn't
Yes you were
Now my stomach hurts
Listen, what do you think of me?
I mean of our lives together?
Why can't you answer me right away?
It's kind of important
You ask me what I think, but we're actually already living together
We can split up, if that's what you want
I am completely clueless
I surrender
You were sound asleep
Oh...
I'm sorry
Go back to sleep
Oh, no
Tomorrow
Yes?
Who's getting married?
Tsukumo
He used to come by the house
He did?
Yeah
A shotgun wedding, though
Young people have it lucky these days
Unthinkable in my day
It's not that long ago
Well, it certainly wasn't about love
It was arranged, after all
But I remember my brother was all excited about it
I don't think your mother approved of me
You think?
Thank you
And this is a gift
Thank you
I was already 30 when we got married, and older than your brother
This community's fussy about that sort of thing
Well...
And you?
No one special?
No, I...
Forget everyone else
Don't settle for anyone less than someone you really love
- You been swimming?
- Nope
- Better ask your father
- Yup
Have him take you
Hey
Hey
Welcome home
Aunt Hirakata called earlier
Tell me later
Was the trip down tiring?
No
Your work?
Same old
And you?
So so, in this economy
I see
It's been awhile
Hot, here, right?
Sure is hot here
Katsuhiro san, you like sour pickles?
Just serve them
Sorry to show up suddenly
It's your house, too
Make yourself at home
Kaoru
What is it?
Help your mother
Over here
Right
What time tomorrow?
One o'clock
I'm going back right after the wedding
What's the rush, it's been awhile
Visit the graves next time
Yeah
Did you move, uncle?
Yeah
Lucky, you get to live in an apartment, alone
No Kaoru
Tell her no, Katsuhiro san
What?
Don't listen to Mom
I want to visit this summer vacation
I want to go to Disneyland
Oh... I see
Visit the film studio here
They don't even have Mickey!
You can see the samurai in action
That's no fun!
The sour pickles
Let's eat
Sister
Oh, thank you
Don't drink too much
Just one glass
Thanks
Wow, that's good
Have some fish
Yeah
You scared me!
You're the one that scared me
What are you doing?
Oh, nothing...
Too hot to sleep, right?
Drenched in sweat
That's right, you quit
I'll take one
It's been a while
Makes me dizzy
Careful, behind you
I heard a splash
Well must be flowing again
Brother
Yeah?
When I was a kid,
I poisoned this well
Poison?
What do you mean?
Remember?
What?
Back in grade school
We took a rare family trip into town together
Dad was sober for once and really excited, bought us expensive binoculars
Is that right...?
I was so happy Dad was sober
We both grabbed for the binoculars and fell
Mom's response was to make sure the binoculars were safe, instead of making sure we were
Dad could be terrifying
She was always tense around him
Dinners were the worst
Dad always got drunk and yelled
I wanted him to disappear
Ink,
I threw blue ink into this well
And Dad died right after that
Dummy
It was Dad's liver
He drank too much
I know
But they say, there's a god in every well
So I thought for the longest time, I kept thinking the well god would punish me
What's up with you?
No, it just came back to me, watching your family
- I'm going to bed
- Yeah
Cover the well and go to bed
Yeah, good night
Hey, time to eat
You hungry?
Hey, c'mere
C'mon over
It's nice to touch a living creature
What about it?
Yeah...
You know she, barges into people's territory and stuff, and she's fairly obsessive and kind of unapproachable
But I think she's dead serious about a child
So if she's serious,
I at least owe it to her to seriously consider it
All right
I understand
I'll consider it with you
I'm sorry
Don't be
Happiness
A family restaurant on Sunday
Always irritating
This one's a diary of a woman's pregnancy, there's one about a gay couple who adopt a child...
Here, here it is, around here
And this one and this one
You can skip the waterbirth video
But I'll loan it if you want
This one too
All this "how to" stuff is fine, but we haven't actually agreed yet
Oh, I know
Just stuff to think about
This one, too
Whichever one you like
Who's having coffee?
Iced tea?
Ice coffee?
Your order?
We're fine, fine, fine
This restaurant was a bad idea
Oh, well
But listen
Do you mind?
What?
You keep talking about this child, but how exactly?
Because...
We can't have sex
Like um...
Something artificial, right?
Artificial?
Thought I'd use a syringe
You serious?
Stop joking
I'm not
I just felt faint
Me too
Right?
This really works?
It just needs to get in there
Like this
Hey, cut it out
Kind of graphic, no?
It flashed before me
It's not a science experiment
It's a little much, isn't it
Definitely
Men do it into cups
While someone observes
Worse than being caught naked
Too much
Is it right to make a kid that way?
But what if it dies in the cup?
Oxidizes or whatever?
What?
Maybe the cup should be chilled?
We're not talking about a beer mug
I can't believe it
How indiscreet
We're not animals
In your 20's, you're just so busy living
Then you hit your 30's and life's fine, but it's like something's missing
I can't imagine leaving offspring behind!
For me, personally, that is!
The project budgets are in the 100 millions, but all I do is sail around model boats
Fine for what it is, but it sure doesn't feel very real
All right!
Amazing!
Hey! Wow!
Did you see that!
Have a kid? Excellent
Go for it
Want a cookie?
It's hotter than hot
I was in 5th or 6th grade, climbing a steep hill, reading a comic book
When suddenly,
I just wanted a grown-up man to hug me tight
It was intense
It just comes out of the blue
A syringe?
How awful...
It's easy enough to have sex, but actually it's really heavy
The thing is, human beings are just swarming with germs
And then we do that...
She's just a nympho right?
Kids like bunnies and bears...
Pajamas...
See...
How soft baby clothes are
Yeah
I grew up on instant food, so I won't touch it now
You see parents feeding their kids Big Macs
Unforgivable
I actually like rice mixed with instant noodles
Disgusting
God, what lousy taste
All right!
Hey, hey, hey
Watch it
How cute
You collect dolls?
Yeah
According to Katsuhiro, you're recreating your childhood because you were Ionely after your parents' divorce
What's that about?
Like he knows
How irritating
Here you were
I looked for you
Here
What?
What?
You look awkward
You do
It's not about how it looks
But, of course looks matter
If we're really going to do it,
I say, do it openly
But when the child goes to school, there might be problems
Might be bullied
Why?
I'm sure the world won't see us as a normal family
They bullied me because my mom was single
You seem to have survived it OK
That's fine, really
You don't need to wash the strainer
When you get pregnant you focus on water, kind of a nesting instinct
Fascinating
You're not pregnant yet
And also, the hair on your stomach grows
Why?
To protect your stomach?
That's right
You get a growth of downy hair, right about here
Like animals
Fascinating
You have any?
We do
It's there
That's different hair
Different hair
Cold tea, Kaoru
Thanks
I'm glad you get to see Disneyland
I just got lucky
Dad didn't tell you?
Not on the phone last night
Huh
It's a real big mess
What?
Thanks
Buy something?
Baked sweet potatoes
Here's your change
Thanks
Looks tasty
You done?
All done
What's this?
A cup for you
Really? Thanks
Aren't I nice?
We're home
What's wrong?
Let me introduce
Hase Naoya, my roommate
And this is Fujikura Asako
My brother and his wife
Their daughter, Kaoru
It's nice to finally meet you
Nice to meet you
Naoya, this mess is all your fault
What are you doing here?
I have to be here
Tell me
You just waltz into men's apartments like this?
Flying off the handle again
Let's take things one at a time
I was just explaining
They seem to misunderstand our connection
Go into the other room, Kaoru
No, it's just getting interesting
Just go
All right
Hang tough, uncle
What's...
Going on?
No, it's not...
Shall I go away?
You're involved
What are you muttering about?
It's just, about this...
It's not that we take it at face value, but it's a damaging report
We were concerned
Katsuhiro san, you're a real piece of work
Breaking that lovely girl's heart
She works with me
I know it's more than that
A woman wouldn't go this far if there wasn't a romance involved
I see through this sort of thing
Katsuhiro san, stop fooling around with my son and hurry up and get married
Everybody does it
Why don't you try it?
You keep quiet
You've no luck with men, like me
Shut up
You're being cheated
Aren't you upset?
No, my brother's not like that
Cheating on my boy with two different girls?
It's just not right, is it?
What?
In any case, that young lady begged me through her tears to make your brother put things right
I'll see this through
Um...
Excuse me, why don't we talk about this co-worker later
Fujikura san, was it?
Yes?
Here we've just met and what a fuss, I'm sorry
Oh, no
The reason we came, was to find out just how you're involved with Katsuhiro
That's what we want to know
Um...
What is this?
We're just friends
All the way to Tokyo for that?
I'm sorry, don't be upset,
Fujikura san
Oh, no
There you go smoothing things
We're not finished yet
That's right
She's absolutely right
He's your brother, after all
What if this thing eventually leads to marriage and children?
We're all adults here, and if that's what he wants, that's what he wants
We came here because that just won't do
Is that report about me?
No
It's not
Don't read it
I said don't!
Don't read it!
In any case, what's written there about me and Asako, is pure slander
Is anything in the report...
The truth?
Yes, it is
You can understand why we're concerned
It's OK you're not educated
But what happened after...
How shall I put it?
Go ahead
The suicide attempt, the years you've spent seeing a psychiatrist, all those men along the way and then, you aborted two babies
I don't like to say this, but I think it's in your blood
We don't want your kind of blood
How dare you!
Why not?
It's not for you to say
Yes it is
There's me and Kaoru, too
And when it's inheritance time?
It's already complicated as it is
Neither of you brothers cares a whit about this
I'll explain
You'll just complicate it
I agree
But I want to
I'm sorry
Please forgive us
No...
I just,
I want a child
Oh no, dear me
But it's not like that's my final goal
It's like, going to sleep dreaming of tomorrow, or vowing to keep a cleaner house, and wanting to live another day tomorrow,
I wanted to feel those things
And actually I'd kind of given up on relationships
But when I met these two,
I realized I wasn't ready to give up yet
Eating meals together, laughing and holding hands,
I wanted to do those things
I started seeing that things were beautiful or good
And so... being with them is so much fun and if there's a child down the line, well, maybe that would be just fine
I can't really say it right, but
And so I asked Katsuhiro if he'd consider having a child with me
I wanted to choose my own family, the way you choose lovers and friends
They still, right, haven't given me a good response
Of course not
How could anyone respond?
What do you say?
Thinking it over
Thinking it...
And you?
The more I see you, the more I'm considering it
There you go
First of all, you're wrong
You don't choose your family they're just there
I really understand what she's saying
Even with your parents, you may not get along
You're supposed to stay out
Sperm banks are all the rage now
Oh, yeah, I've heard about them
That expensive beef, they charge 100,000 yen per insemination
Great business
That's enough
What is going on here?
I don't want to
Disgusting
Can't we drop it?
It's unforgivable
Children are a gift from God
They're precious because we can't choose or control who they are
My mother-in-law kept telling me
"have a son",
"make an heir", but I couldn't
She made me feel defective
I was determined to have a son, just to show her
But when I finally had Kaoru, all my venom blew away
It's a child from your womb
A child you staked your life for
You wouldn't know, but it's painful giving birth
Feels like your body's being peeled away
It's not about choosing
Katsuhiro saw what you went through
This is ridiculous
Forget it, I don't understand
I wonder, maybe someone with troubled nerves just can't control themselves down there, either?
Hey, what
Just go
You'll live to regret kicking your mother out
I absolutely refuse to allow this
You have no right to be a mother
You've already killed two babies
Aborting two perfectly good babies
And now you feel like holding hands, or eating together or laughing and having fun and a child would just be fine, what is that!
What the hell!
Let me tell you, having and raising a child is a whole lot more than that
You're selfish!
And even if you do have one, it'll be abnormal!
Hey!
Enough, enough!
Cut it out!
Calm down
What is this!
That's enough!
Enough
Your whole family's crazy!
Water?
Is she epileptic?
I don't think so
An ambulance?
No, no, she's just fainted
A pillow
Sorry about today
Likewise
Sorry to worry you
His name is Naoya?
Seems like a gentle guy
You...
It's your life
Do what you want
How long have you known?
I'm your brother, remember?
Daddy
OK, we're off
Tomorrow we meet Mickey and then home
Take care
You OK?
Yeah
Want something to drink?
No
I'm sorry I dragged you into this
You don't need to...
The thing is, my mom said some pretty stupid things
She was apologizing
I'm sorry
Yeah
I'll go home
You'll be OK?
Yeah
Shall we take you home?
I'm fine
Thank you very much
Sure
See you
Yeah
If only, someone had really hugged me to death just once, when I was little,
I don't think I'd have turned out this way
When I'm at home
I only feel secure when I'm scrunched between my furniture
Maybe that's why
Bye, then
Was that...
Goodbye?
Oh, here it is
Yeah
Hey, you alive?
Hey, you scrunched up?
We've got junk food
You can see through here
Where?
Right through here
Maybe she's out
No, she's here, the meter's running
Maybe she's asleep
But she's turned her cell phone off
No answer?
What's that strange smell?
Don't tell me she died of Ioneliness?
Hey, Fujikura
Hey
What'll we do with all this food?
What'll we do...
Could you believe her apartment?
Feel itchy?
Definitely
I bet there were all kinds of dead things
Yes
Thank you for coming
Listen, Nagata san
It's a necktie
My favorite store was closed so I looked everywhere and finally found a tie to match your suit
I just know you'll love it
Listen, Nagata san
You really should stop this
You need to respect yourself more
I understand
It's really tacky, right?
But you said
I wasn't worthless
I apologize for the misunder...
That I wasn't worthless
I only meant...
You're a liar
Cheater
Her cheating rubbed off on you
Katsuhiro
Let's go home
This is pointless
Let's go
No, that won't do
You're the one that won't do
Sorry
No, you can't go yet
I want to talk more
Naoya, Naoya, I'm fine, let me go, let go
OK, OK, let's talk
Talk then
It's OK
Please, stay just a little while longer, please stay
Listen, you've got to settle this thing once and for all
Just a little, a little while
No
No, just a little, a little
I said no!
A little...
All right, let's talk about it
Cut it out
I'm sorry
Naoya, I've got to talk to her
Why are you guys doing this?
Enough!
Listen, let's go somewhere, calm down
Talk about it tomorrow
No, I want to talk about it now
This sort of conversation needs sunlight
Don't be so stupid
You've got to settle this thing
I can't leave her like this
You can't be nice to her
Why, oh, why...
C'mon, please
This is completely hopeless
C'mon now, I'm sorry
Please, this is hopeless...
Say good bye now, let go
No!
Will you hurry up and come!
C'mon!
I'll die!
I swear I'll die!
Why do you...
I have to go back
She'll be gone
I'm worried
Don't worry, she won't die, not her
The real question is why you can't just say it in situations like that
Like "Don't bother me" or
"I don't like you"
It helps the other person move on
It's actually cruel to leave things hanging
I know that you can't say stuff because you're so kind
I like that about you but in this situation, you absolutely have to make a clean break
Why do you say "absolutely?"
Don't say "absolutely"
How can you be so judgmental?
I'd like to make a clean break, too
I know it'd be easier, but I just can't
Every time you get upset,
I think "Here we go again"
When Asako talked about a baby,
I thought, "is she nuts?"
I'd love to tell my family to forget me, I'm not involved
Then why don't you?
How should I know?
I want to change, too
It's just, this is who I am
Hate me now?
Hello
Thank you for your visit
Can you hold on?
It's your sister-in-law
Hi, it's me
Yes
A message from Kaoru?
Kaoru didn't really know, she was upset by the blood
She probably made it sound like a terrible accident, but he just fell off his scooter and bumped his head
I see
Thank you for calling
Please tell him to take care
OK, bye then
Everything OK?
Yeah, just bruised
Oh, really
What a relief
I want a bath
You have 3 messages
Uncle! Daddy's split his head open! What do I do?
Hey there
The first time I've seen you laugh
Proof you're opening up to me
Rapist! Help!
How can you?
This is love, love
Hello
Oh, um, no, I can't see you
It's just, my Dad died
Just collapsed
I've got lots of funeral arrangements to make
I'm busy, later
You're the worst
Right
I'm going to split up with her
What?
I want to start dating you
Not up to you
Right
No go?
No go
I'm going to cry,
I really think I will, I will
Idiot
Right
Katsuhiro san...
It's me, Yoko
I'm sorry to call so late
Listen...
Your brother...
Katsuji san...
He died
I mean, he was laughing...
What happened?
It's just a blank
It's so sad to realize it was such a tiny piece of land
It's kind of sad
My brother was barely in his grave, when the relatives came clamoring after the land
Even my sister-in-law, who was so opposed
When it came down to it, signed the contract, took her share, and now she and her daughter moved back home like nothing happened
That the last one?
Yeah, around here?
Sure
But she's definitely strange
First we help her move and now we're fixing dinner
I mean, order in sushi
Now, now
Now she's disappeared
Now dinner's cooked
Better turn it off
Unbelievable
It tastes good
Of course it's good
She doesn't get any
Let me wash my hands?
Sure
I'm home
And where were you?
I'm sorry, I was looking for the shops
Figure that out before you move
OK, I'm sorry
Wow, dinner's ready already
You're the best
Of course it's good
Broken record
Let's eat
The beer?
Right
Turn it back on?
Yup
Really, where were you?
Couple things I needed to buy
We ordered in sushi
Really?
No, not really
Calls for a toast
Thank you
Cheers
- Congratulations on your move
- Thank you
What's that?
The bigger the better
Why does it have to be so big?
What'll you do
There won't... be... that much
How crude, Katsuhiro
We're about to eat
Sorry
Look
What do you mean, look?
What are all the syringes for?
One for each
To each his syringe?
Not for me, thank you
But seriously, what are they for?
It's Ionely to be an only child
After Katsuhiro's baby,
I'll just have Naoya's too
Unbelievable!

- No.
I just meant any damage you did to your heart is already done.
I'm gonna be okay, right?
I need you to stay overnight for observation, and stay on the monitor.
And no. We're still doing V/Qs because they keep promising us a better scanner.
What kind of bedside manner is that?
The idiot has had an MI after stenting, he stands out in the rain for eight hours.
- I don't think yelling's gonna help.
- It might.
You know, you might want to think about getting out of the ER.
That advice is only about nine years too late, but thank you.
Seriously. You never talked to patients like that.
I've had an epiphany.
Dr. Greene.
Medevac coming in. Diverting from Children's. Near-drowning.
- Did he arrest?
- I don't know.
He must be pretty sick if they're flying him in the rain.
- It's supposed to be a surprise.
- I hate chocolate mint.
- Yeah, I didn't pick it.
- You think I should stick around?
- They're going to gather everyone soon.
- Hey, you're not supposed to see that.
I'll be upstairs. Page me if anyone needs me for anything.
- I'm sure that we will.
- Carter, isn't it? John Carter?
- And you would be?
- The girl by the pool.
Oh, right, yeah. The one without the answering machine.
It broke in the move.
I haven't had time to go shopping.
- That's convenient.
- Hey, I called you.
- Did not.
- I spoke to your manservant, Harry.
Henry? The night butler?
He didn't say anything about it.
It is the 21 st century.
You can get voicemail.
- You need to get better help.
- You volunteering?
- Any benefits?
- Well, there's the outfit.
- Dream on.
- Hey, Carter.
- Hey, how'd it go?
- He did good.
Couple pounds of stool.
Only gagged once.
Yeah, those old ladies can surprise you, huh?
- Yeah. How do I know when I'm done?
- You develop a feel for it.
- Where's the stab wound?
- Should be here by now.
Call Dispatch. Make sure it's rolling up.
Gallant, you're with me.
Don't worry about it.
It will only hurt for a day or two.
Do you think
I'm mean to the patients?
- Only the ones who deserve it.
- What about the ones who don't?
- You're nicer than I am.
- That's not much solace.
Sorry.
Oh, my God.
- I distinctly heard him.
- Who?
The weatherman this morning.
He said, "Party cloudy, chance of rain. "
Well, he warned you.
Twelve-year-old boy.
One-story fall and near-drowning.
Moderate respiratory distress, crackles on the right.
- What's his name?
- Daniel.
- Daniel, having trouble breathing?
- I let go of him.
- Who?
- Joey. I couldn't hold on.
His brother.
They were playing by the river.
- Where is Joey?
- Rescue's still looking for him.
All right, let's slide him out.
Here it comes.
Must be a police car.
- Does it usually take so long in the rain?
- Shouldn't.
- You need a jacket?
- No. We won't be out here long.
- I can go get one for you if you-
- I'm fine.
Sorry I haven't looked at your file.
You're military?
- Yes, ma'am. U.S. Army Reserve.
- ROTC?
No, I did a year of active duty.
Now I'm in a scholarship program.
So work in the ER might not be so crazy to you.
I think it's a whole different kind of crazy, ma'am.
- There you are. I was looking for you-
- No, listen, I need to see you.
I'm gonna pick up my son and drive to your office.
Well, if you're not there,
I'll get another attorney.
You're damn right I'm upset.
You told me not to-
You told me not to fight this thing. Now
Roger's gonna try to hang me with it.
- Fine. I'll see you in a half an hour.
- What happened?
The DNA analysis shows that I'm not Reece's biological father.
Oh, God, Peter. I'm so sorry.
I told myself a long time ago it wouldn't matter, that I'm his father.
- I won't let that son of a bitch change it.
- I'm going with you.
No. They're getting ready to throw a party for you.
I don't give a damn about a party.
Let's go.
- Frank, where the hell is this thing?
- What thing?
- Cleo, are you done?
- I'll call to say goodbye.
- Where's the stab wound?
- I don't know.
I was sloshing around downstairs.
I'm billing you for these shoes.
- Find out what happened.
- Dr. Weaver, it's here.
Twenty-four-year-old female pedestrian, hit by a car in a crosswalk.
- Miss, can you tell me your name?
- Jill. He hit my dog.
Probable LOC. GCS, 13.
BP,100/75. Pulse, 95.
- Where were you stabbed?
- What?
- No, she was hit by a car.
- Wait, where's the stab wound?
- What stab wound?
- Get her inside.
Your dispatch needs to get it together.
We didn't know you were coming.
The one we're waiting on is over half an hour late.
Dr. Weaver, Unit 37 got slammed by an SUV in a downed intersection.
- Ashville and Western.
- Who's 37?
- Our stab wound.
- Pickman.
- Rescue is trying to cut him out.
- Is she okay?
Don't know about the driver.
The pregnant woman is in bad shape.
- The stab wound's pregnant?
- And bleeding.
- Okay. Wait! I'm going with you!
- What, you're leaving?
She could be a dropsy. Have Carter take this case. I'll be right back.
- What do I do?
- Get in.
I couldn't hold him.
Daniel, I need to listen.
He's retracting.
ABG. He's decreased on the right.

Get on the radio and make sure.
Sucking chest wound.

Elastoplast, chest tube tray, and page Surgery.
Daniel, you got a hole in your chest sucking in air every time you breathe.
We need to plug it up, all right?
BP's 110/70. Still no sats.
- Ready?
- Yep.
- That should be better.
- They find Joey?
I don't know.
We're gonna ask the firemen.
- Please, they have to find my brother.
- Everything's gonna be okay. All right?
10 blade.
Stay close to me and watch where you're going.
- You okay?
- Yeah. Both airbags deployed...
- ... but he has a bad seat belt side.
- Sir, do you know where you are?
- The middle of the street.
- Lake had a flail chest. We moved him.
- Pickman's in back with an open tib-fib.
- She conscious?
Yeah, but her patient might be hemorrhaging.
Listen to his lungs on the way in.
You might need to needle him.
Okay, got it!
You okay, Doris?
I messed up my leg bad. It's open, but I got a pulse in the foot.
- I had to move it myself.
- I need you to stand back!
- I'm an emergency physician at County.
- Good for you.
Stand back! We need to open up this can. You help us.
What's the status of your patient?
A 28-year-old woman, eight months pregnant, mugging victim.
Son of a bitch!

Gallant, help them.
You have vitals?

- Vicki.
Vicki, my name is Dr. Weaver.
Where are you having pain?
All over.
- Can you see the bone?
- Careful. Careful.
Does it feel like you're having contractions?
Brody!
No! Don't touch him!
Gallant!
Brody! Brody, are you okay?
He's unresponsive.
Get a monitor, and let's roll him.
Airway's patent.
Checking for a carotid.
He's not breathing. No pulse.
- You know CPR?
- Yes.
Start compressions.
- I'll do it!
- No! I need you to check on that woman.
- He's in my unit!
- Check on her!
Zadro, I need the defibrillator and an ambu-bag.
- Coming.
- Come on, breathe!
That was stupid. That was really stupid.
You could have both been electrocuted.
- Stop.
- Sorry. It was instinct.
I told you not to touch him.
You're okay if your feet don't touch the ground.
Guess what? It's raining.
Water conducts electricity.
- I'm all right.
- You were lucky.
- Still no pulse. Bag him.
- Got it.
- It's charging to 200.
- She's okay.
- Clear.
- The tires are insulating the rig.
I can't get in.
That hot wire keeps lighting it up.
- Is she conscious?
- Yeah. She's in labor.
You go back and tell her it's gonna be okay.
- He's one of my men!
- Do it.
Three hundred. Clear.
- He's venting.
- Got it.
- You got a rhythm?
- Yeah.

Hang in there.
We're gonna get you out of there.
Vicki, it's Dr. Weaver again.
Did you feel a shock?
- No, I don't think so.
- Is he breathing?
We got him back for now. Vicki, tell me if you're bleeding from your vagina.
The baby's not moving.
I need you to feel down there and tell me if you're bleeding.
Hold on! I'm coming in.
- No, no. I can't let you do that.
- Her baby's probably in distress.
First rule of an accident site, don't create more casualties.
Casualties?
We need an engineer out here. They're not showing fault in the power grid.
- It looks like a fault to me.
- That's what they're telling me.
- Hey, I told you not to do that!
- Just turn the damn power off!
Did you hit your head, lose consciousness?
I don't know. I remember walking in the street, seeing Gordon lying in the rain.
- Gordon?
- Her dog.
BP's 100/40.
He kept scratching at the door.
I had to take him for a walk.
- Breath sounds equal.
- No hemotympanum.
- But I wanna get a head CT.
- Is this the hit-and-run?
He didn't stop?
- Pulse ox is 94 on 4 liters.
- Miss...
- ... can you describe the car that hit you?
- It was silver, I think.
- Are you sure?
- No.
- Does that hurt?
- Yes.
- Did you take my dog to the vet?
- I'm afraid your dog died.
Full trauma panel, C-spine, chest, AP pelvis, Foley, give her 10 of morphine.
HemoCue's 9.8. Let's get an ultrasound before a CT.
- Dr. Greene is using it.
- Go see if he's done.
- What kind of dog was he?
- He was a terrier mix.
Those are the best kind.
You know, he probably went really fast.
Don't hear a dorsalis pedis pulse.
Go get me a Doppler.
Check an ICON before she goes to Radiology.
Little fluid in Morrison's pouch.
- Can we have that when you're done?
- It's all yours.
Page Pedes Surgery.
Another crit in 20 minutes.
- You want to cath urine?
- On a CPK and another portable chest.
Daniel, you're doing much better.
We need to keep an eye on you for the next couple hours...
...just in case you need any surgery.
- He's dead, isn't he?
- What?
Joey. He drowned.
- I don't know. They're looking for him.
- He didn't want to go.
- Where?
- To the river.
He was scared, but I called him a baby.
- You didn't know this would happen.
- He's only 6.
- Parents are on their way.
- They're gonna hate me now.
- They're gonna be happy you're safe.
- It should have been me.
- Watch the monitor. His heart's irritable.
- Looks like regular sinus rhythm.
- Okay, let's go! Shut the door.
- Okay.
Hey, stay clear of that rig!
- Hey, hold on.
- It's okay.
- Is she okay?
- Hypertonic contractions.
BP's dropping, 68/40.
That's way too low, right?
- What?!
- Nothing, Vicki.
I need you to be quiet.
I just need to listen.
- What was that?
- It's the power line!
- Fetal heart tones are 70.
- Is that bad?
Maybe the transformer will blow out and kill the line!
Dr. Weaver!
I need your help.
Can you get in here safely?
- Yeah, I'd have to jump.
- Okay, then jump.
Got it.
Search through the cabinets.
Find me an amp of cardiac lidocaine.
- Lidocaine?
- Just do it.
Vicki, your placenta is detaching.
It's bleeding into your uterus.
Oh, God!
Hey! I told you to stay away from the damn vehicle!
She's bleeding out!
Why is the power still on?
There's a crew on the way!
The only way to stop the bleeding is to deliver your baby surgically.
- It's too early.
- it's not. Thirty-six weeks is full-term.
Take me to the hospital!
Honey, I want to. I want to, but I can't right now, all right?
Shut it off from the plant!
It's supposed to burn through on its own.
They need to authorize the shutdown.
Vicki. Vicki, I need you to listen to me.
I'm an emergency physician.
I'm trained to perform a C-section only after the mother has died.
And in about 15 minutes, that's what's gonna happen.
Meanwhile, your baby is in danger.
But I might be able to save you both...
...if we take the baby now and stop your internal bleeding.
Are you willing to take that risk with me?
- I think so.
- You sure?
- You've observed a C-section?
- I haven't done OB before.
- Well, you'll be ahead of the curve.
- Lidocaine.
- Know how to take a blood pressure?
- Yeah.
Okay, take one. I need it every couple of minutes.
Squeeze that saline bag... and find me every 4-by-4 and bandage we have.
Okay, Vicki. Vicki, hang in there.
I'm gonna give you a shot in your spine that will numb your belly and legs.
All right, find me a 10 blade.
That's a scalpel.
When's the last time you've done this?
- Peter, the DNA test was inevitable.
- There has to be a precedent.
Not in a custody battle between two men without genetic ties to a child...
...they raised.
It's stepfather versus stepfather.
- I'm not his stepfather. I'm his father.
- Sorry. Father.
Until Carla died, Roger never questioned that Peter was Reece's dad.
- Irrelevant.
- She put my name on the birth certificate.
If she were alive,
Carla couldn't contest the paternity.
- But Roger can?
- Ironically, yes.
Peter, you are going to have to allow
Roger to resume partial visitation.
- No. No way.
- As we speak...
...Roger's attorney is drafting a pre-trial motion for visitation...
...until this is resolved.
You don't stipulate now, you'll lose that hearing and be painted as the heavy.
I'm the heavy? He's trying to take my son from me and I'm the heavy?
You need to be seen by the judge as someone who's interested...
- ... in Reece's well-being.
- I am.
Good. Then you need to listen to me.
You have to stay focused on the endgame.
And not let anger or fear impede that goal.
Vicki, stay awake.
I need you to stay awake.
- BP's dropping. 50.
- Spike another liter.
- "Spike"?
- Take the pointy end of the bag...
...and hang it up.
Hey, you! Firefighter!
- Lopez!
- Lopez, I need more light!
Scotty! Scotty, turn up the brights!
I need you over here. Get out.
- You're doing a vertical incision?
- Yeah.
Be ready with that hemostat.
We're gonna clamp the big bleeders and pack up everything else with gauze.
All right, here we go.
I need you to put your hands there and pull back.
- Where?
- Just do what I do from the other side.
Vicki, you feel that?
- Just some pulling.
- Okay.
Okay, fascia's exposed.
Okay, separate the rectus, down to the fascia.
All right, more retraction.
- Okay.
- Pull back.
- My baby.
- Hang on. Hang on, Vicki.
Okay. I'm into the peritoneal cavity.
Here's the uterus. Give me the scalpel.
You want me to let go?
- Scanner 1 will be ready in 10.
- Do a sound on the chest.
They're gonna take you upstairs and scan your whole body for other injuries.
I want you to tell the nurse if you need any more pain medication, okay?
I'm sorry about your dog.
What?
- "He probably went really fast. "
- She was upset.
She could have solid-organ rupture.
The dog's the least of her concerns.
It can be traumatic to lose a pet, especially if you saw it happen.
- What was his name?
- Who?
Your dog.
Happy. He was a Lhasa apso, and he got run over by a car when I was 11.
Oh, did he go really fast?
No. Crushed his pelvis.
- In the river earlier today...
- Someone drowned?
- Brother of the boy in Trauma 2.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Did they find him?
- Not yet.
- You can't leave anything around here.
- What?
- Some derelict stole my PalmPilot.
- Maybe you misplaced it.
- I had it two minutes ago.
- Dr. Carter.
- Alger. Alger, what are you-?
It's your grandmother. I found her in the driveway. I think she broke her hip.
Get a gurney!
There's a cut on her head.
- She was driving?
- She went during the break in the storm.
- Gamma?
- Oh, John, it's terrible. It hurts.
Okay, I know it does. Just lay still.
- Did she fall down?
- I don't know.
But the right leg is shortened and externally rotated.
- I think I broke my hip.
- I think you did too.
- What happened to your head?
- I thought it was best if I drove home.
I didn't realize how much
I was bleeding, so I slipped.
- You were in an accident?
- Well, I don't-
It was raining. I couldn't see.
I think I hit a dog.
- Where were you driving?
- It was supposed to be clear and sunny.
- Retract the bladder anteriorly.
- Like that?
More. Watch your fingers.
- I'm opening the lower uterine section.
- Is that the amniotic fluid?
Yeah. I'm in.
It looks like a lot of blood.
Auto recloser is stuck open or something. He's trying to bypass it.
- I don't care. Just shut it down!
- It ain't that simple, lady!
- Damn it!
- What?
I cut a uterine vein.
Another clamp now!
- BP's dropping. 60 systolic.
- Keep squeezing in that saline.
- Doesn't she need blood?
- I don't have any blood!
- Fundal pressure.
- What?
Push the baby down towards me from the top of the uterus.
- Okay. Right here?
- Yes. Yes. Now.
- Is the other ambulance here?
- It's pulling up.
Call County General. Say we need an
O.R., OB Attending, and a neonatologist.
- Grab the bulb syringe.
- Okay.
Suck out his nose and mouth.
- Is there an exit wound?
- Sure is. Blew off his boot.
A transthoracic current pathway.
- You saw it?
- He lit up like a Christmas tree.
I need the room.
Post-arrest electrocution.
- What's open with a monitor?
- He's a fireman.
Daniel, we're gonna shuffle you to another room.
CK is normal. Tox screen tested positive for marijuana.
- Marijuana? Were you smoking dope?
- C-spine, chest, pelvis.
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.
For getting high and taking Joey out to the river?
- I didn't smoke today.
- I knew it. I knew it.
We saw the river on the news.
We wanted to see it.
- "We"? Joey's 6 years old.
- He said he wanted to see it.
- You're gonna blame it on him now?
- No, it's my fault.
- You're damn right it's your fault!
- Hold on.
I'm Dr. Greene. We need to get Daniel into a room.
Then I'll come out and brief you on your son's condition.
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- You heard from the fire department...
- ... about Joey?
- Not yet. They're still searching.
- Between these clamps, right?
- Yes.
- Vicki! Vicki, are you still with me?
- Is that my baby?
Yes, honey. You have a boy.
He's crying. Do you hear that?
He's crying.
Could be stronger.
We need to get a heart rate.
Okay, 10 minutes!
They're gonna shut the entire grid off!
Why can't they do it right now?
They have to warn emergency facilities they're going off-line.
- Okay. It's 88, I think.
- You think or you know?
It's 88.
- One-minute Apgar is seven out of 10.
- It'll get better, right?
We need to wrap him up.
He needs fluids, oxygen, maybe blood.
You said we didn't have any blood.
You need to get him to the hospital.
Nine minutes!
Vicki?
Vicki, wake up!
Damn it! She's exsanguinating!
I have to clamp off the uterine artery.
Okay, I'm going!
Get out of the way!
- No!
- It's this or I throw him to you!
- No! No! Tell him to stop!
- Go.
- Is he okay?
- I got him.
- Okay, get him out of here. Go!
- Let's go. Let's go.
Transformer just blew.
Does that mean the circuit's dead?
I'm gonna sew this up.
You won't feel anything.
You okay?
I see a lot of fathers who come in here...
...and they're upset when their kids are hurt or missing.
Sometimes they say things they don't mean.
He's not my father. He's my stepfather.
Joey's the real kid.
- And that makes you...?
- A pain in the ass.
Did it come back?
- What?
- You were waiting for a chest x-ray.
Right. Lungs re-expanded.
Tube's in a good position.
I'm repairing the chest laceration now.
- Mom?
- So he's fine?
For now. He'll need to be monitored in the PICU.
- Mom, I'm sorry.
- You shouldn't have been out there.
- Yeah, I know.
- Mrs. Pendry-
Why did you take him there?
You didn't think. You never think.
I know. It should have been me that drowned.
- Yes. But it wasn't, was it?
- Mrs. Pendry-
- It was Joey.
- Mrs. Pendry...
...I need to talk to you outside.
In here.
What are you doing?
My son is missing. No one can find him.
Right. And your other son is in there who needs your comfort and love.
This is none of your business.
You want him to feel responsible?
Guess what? He already does.
You want him to hurt?
He already hurts.
You want him to hate himself, keep it up.
- They found him.
- What?
- He's stuck down river.
- Is he all right?
I don't know.
They're trying to get to him.
It'll be okay, Peter.
We don't know that.
I see you two together. I know.
What did you do that for?
You wanted to?
Are you expecting someone?
- Yeah?
- Peter.
No, Peter! This doesn't have to go any further, man!
Look, please.
Just hear me out, okay?
Come on.
Look, Reece lived under my care and my roof for most of his life.
All I'm asking for is some kind of arrangement that recognizes that.
- It's too late for that.
- Look, come on, brother.
- You want to put him through a trial?
- I'm keeping my son.
- I guess I'll see you there.
- Yeah, you will.
There's been a search going on ever since the boy's brother was pulled out...
...earlier this evening.
Swift Water 43.
County General waiting.
- Open, channel two.
- Copy that.
- Is he alive?
- They don't know.
Frank, call the burn unit. Brodoff is going to the O.R. for a fasciotomy first.
Is that your electrocution?
Compartmental pressure is almost 60.
Otherwise, he's lucky.
- Anyone want anything from the store?
- It's pouring outside.
Malik and Yosh don't like the lounge coffee. It hurts their stomach.
- Grande vanilla cappuccino.

He's in arrest, but they're flying him in.
ETA,15 minutes.
- Does he have a pulse?
- P.E.A.
Luka, our new med student's coming in BOA.
Weaver opened up a pregnant woman trapped in an ambulance.
- Opened up?
- C-section.
- In the field?
- She'll have some explaining to do.
- Can I get you something, Abby?
- Nope.
- Cigarettes?
- No, thanks.
- What's that?
- What?
- What time is it?
- Seven.
- What's wrong?
- Give me your bag!
- Let me see inside your bag.
- No!
What are you doing?
My PalmPilot alarm goes off at 7 to remind me to take my Vioxx.
- Come on, let go of her bag.
- After I see inside.
- Frank!
- For chrissakes.
Fabulous! First you steal it, then you break it!
- That's not yours.
- I'm calling the police.
Hey, hold on. This is a mistake.
Oh, yeah! Yeah, my stuff just leapt into her bag!
Nicole?
And it's not just me, pal, she's ripping off everybody. Ask Abby.
Nicole!
- I need some help here! Newborn!
- Luka, the baby.
Dr. Weaver says he might need a transfusion.
Is he premature?
No. We gave him O-2. He needs an IV.
Elevate her legs. Cycle the dynamap.
Tilt the monitor toward me. I got it.
- I said, I got it. How bad is that hand?
- It'll keep.
Sats are plummeting.
She's not moving air.
Stop! Airway blocked!
- I thought you had to move her!
- Need to protect her airway.
Cricoid pressure.
Cover!
Exposed flexor tendon.
You're gonna need a hand surgeon.
I need to control the scene.
Get somebody else.
All right, I'm in.
Bag her! Let's go!
Draw a milligram of epi and have atropine standing by.
- Get in!
- No, I'm good.
- No, you're not!
- Go on, get out of here. Come on.
People think kids don't listen to their parents, but they do.
If they tell you you're nothing, you think you're nothing.
- How cold do you think that water is?
- I don't know, 40.
Hope it's colder than that.
- You got a pulse?
- No. No pulse.
No spontaneous resps.
GCS, 3. For real.
- How long was he under?
- I don't know.
We found him in debris a mile from where he fell in.
- I thought it was P.E.A.
- No. Asystole the whole flight.
Hey, Gam.
Does it still hurt?
- On a scale of one to 10-
- It hurts, John.
- Did she get the full amount?
- In two doses.
- Give her four more of morphine.
- Okay.
But I'll put her on the monitor.
Well, Gam, you definitely broke your hip.
Looks like an impacted fracture of the femoral neck.
Please speak English, John.
I need to get a more sophisticated scan to determine if you need surgery or not.
I should have listened to you about the car. I'm sorry.
Gamma...
...I think you hit more than just a dog.
You also hit a young woman.
She's okay.
We're taking care of her here.
I called Mr. Stern in case you need an attorney.
- I hit a girl?
- Yeah.
- I left. I drove away.
- You didn't know.
But I should have checked to see.
Oh, my God!
Gam, you were confused, okay?
It's crazy out there. Visibility's terrible.
I'm gonna be right back, then I'll take you for that scan.
- What's wrong? What is it?
- Nothing. It's just another patient.
- Page Surgery. I need a HemoCue.
- What happened?
- Dropped her sats in the elevator. 88.
- Any chest pain?
No. Just passed out. BP's 80/60.
I can't see the cords.
I need a fiber-optic scope.
ABG, set up the ultrasound, and mix up 7500 units of heparin.
There's a lot of fluid in here.
Could be pulmonary edema.
Grab the thrombolytics box.
DIC panel. Troponin, CK, EKG...
- ... and a portable chest.
- Two large-bore IVs.
Nuke the saline in the microwave.
Get that collar off him.
- We'll need a bear-hugger.
- Coming.
- Tube's out.
- God, he's blue.
Number 51/2 uncuffed ET tube.
Suction.
Still no pulse.
Asystole on the monitor.
- Joey, wake up. Baby, wake up.
- Ma'am, you need to back up.
- Oh, my God!
- What is that?
- What is that?
- River water.
Cords are closed.
I need a fiber-optic laryngoscope.
Prep the neck.
I might have to crike him.
Daniel, get back to bed.
I'll come get you.
Can't get a line, and he's totally clamped down.
Two cutdown trays.
Daniel, now. Lily, can you...?
- You heard him, out! Get out of here!
- You too.
- What?
- Out!
Cross-match her for 6 units.
Two units FFP.
Stick her and send a clot.
- Is the O.R. ready?
- They're waiting for you.
- I have an emergency C-section.
- No kidding. I can see that.
Coburn called me, screaming.
I said she must have heard wrong.
28-year-old woman trapped in an ambulance, abrupted and hemorrhaging.
And ER docs don't perform C-sections until the mother arrests.
- She will if we don't get her upstairs.
- BP's up to 90.
Have dopamine standing by.
Add a coag panel.
I got it from here, Kerry.
Go back in the ER and stay dry.
I don't want you dying of pneumonia before your public flogging.
- I could've let everybody die.
- That's the safe play.
Now if she lives, you're a hero.
If she doesn't, I don't know you.
The baby.
Chuny, where's the baby?
He's pinking up.
They're waiting for the NICU fellow.
Nice save, Dr. Weaver.
One milligram of vitamin K, I.M.
Erythromycin ophthalmic ointment,
0.5 percent.
Good neuro check?
Moves all four symmetrically.
Lungs are clear. No retractions.
- You get a heel-stick?
- Glucose, 70. Pulse, 120.
You did it.
Okay.
CBC, lytes, BUN, creatinine and a bilirubin.
Luka?
Can I talk to you?
- Bradying down to 60.
- Hurry up, she'll arrest.
I'm in, I think.
Sats are falling.
There's too much edema. Is Mark done yet? I need that fiber-optic.
- Air in the stomach.
- What are you doing?
Try to suction the cords.
Inflate the balloon.
- Keep it in, you'll have a better shot.
- No, just- Pull back really slowly.
There we go. Slowly, slowly.
Little more.
All right, there are the cords.
Give me the tube.
Open a crash cart. Draw one of atropine and an amp of epi.
Got it.
Come on, hold on.
Pulse ox is climbing.
Good breath sounds. Nice work.
Saline's running.
Dilute two mgs of atropine and one mg of epi down the tube.
How high does the temp go on that vent?
Forty centigrade.
Set tidal volume at 200 on 100 percent.
Still no pulse and no pressure.
All right, keep warming him.
We got to get that Foley in.
We're gonna irrigate the bladder.
We're gonna save this one.
- You want me to...?
- No, no, he can stay.
Cycle the lavage fluids.
Repeat the temp, max out the blower.
- Cardiac activity on the monitor.
- What?
- Looks like P.E.A.
- That's good.
Amp of bicarb.
Charge the paddles to 60.
- We don't have anything to shock.
- We will.
- Pacing pads.
- Good lung sounds.
- Come on, Joey. Come on.
- V-tach.
Yeah, baby, let's go. Clear.
- Polymorphic.
- Okay, charge to 120.
Check for a pulse. Clear.
Bingo. Normal sinus.
Thank you, God.
Fem stick him for labs.
Full trauma panel, ABG and an art line.
Get a second cutdown.
Eighteen-gauge angiocath.
- Anything after the line?
- Wait and see.
-10 blade.
- Hey, it stopped raining.
Impaction with mild or no displacement.
Probably a type 1.
The fracture line traverses straight from the greater to lesser trochanters.
What do you think, orthopedic surgery?
Depends on the orthopod, but I'd try to keep them away from her.
One third of the elderly who go under the knife for these kind of injuries...
...die within a year from post-op complications.
She's panicking. Heart rate's up.
BP's falling.
Get her out!
- Gam?
- John.
- John, are you there?
- I'm here.
I want to go home.
- Not quite yet.
- Call your grandfather to pick me up.
I want to go home.
- Grandpa's not here.
- Get him.
Grandpa's dead.
- Where am I?
- You're in the hospital.
You were in a car accident.
Remember, Gam? You broke your hip?
Oh, yes.
Of course.
I hit a dog. I hit a dog.
He was in the middle of the street.
Is she okay?
No.
Not really.
That baby okay?
Yeah.
Dr. Greene revived a drowned hypothermic boy tonight.
Came in ice-cold and not breathing, no pulse, and he got him back.
It was a miracle.
You all right?
What is it?
- She's pregnant.
- Who?
Nicole.
I see.
- Is that why she was stealing?
- No. That's a-
That's a habit. She doesn't know how to trust people.
Trusting people isn't really the problem.
Her father kicked her out when she was 16.
She's had to learn to live on her own.
Her father?
She panicked, I guess. I don't know.
I was just trying to help her.
I didn't think I'd be with her.
It just happened.
You sure it's yours?
- And that she's really pregnant?
- She's not like that. You don't know her.
Do you?
We gave him what's called an EEG, which is a brain scan.
Everything looks completely normal.
- So that's good?
- That's good.
You're gonna get your brother back, Daniel.
- Thank you for saving him.
- You're welcome.
Is my mom with him?
Yeah.
They're gonna move him upstairs...
...and you're gonna be up in the same room soon.
I'm gonna tell you something, but you can't tell any other kids, okay?
Okay.
Parents don't always know what they're doing.
Just because they're adults doesn't mean they know what's right.
In fact...
...some adults are wrong most of the time.
- I know that.
- Good.
And I want you to promise me something.
What?
Don't listen to them.
Don't believe that you're not just as good as your brother.
Just as smart.
Just as special.
One day they may realize that...
...but you can tell them it doesn't matter because you already knew.
You knew before they did.
Dr. Weaver, Dr. Romano is looking for you. The mother came out of surgery.
They had to perform a hysterectomy, but she's doing all right.
Yeah, I know. Thanks.
He also told me that I should try to stay away from you...
...if I'm gonna survive med school.
Well, nobody actually listens to Dr. Romano down here.
Yeah, I figured that.
It was pretty amazing what you did out there.
I was a little out of my element.
Well, you wouldn't know it.
Thank you.
Why don't you go up and take her baby to her?
- They'd let me?
- It's one of the perks.
- She's gonna think you're an angel.
- Yeah, well...
- ... she did almost see me glowing.
- You did great.
I mean, you took a risk, stayed focused, listened.
You did what was necessary.
That's an ER doc.
I was scared out there for a while.
- Gallant, I was scared the whole time.
- Right.
The fireman is sitting well in ICU.
He's gonna keep his hands.
- Cardiac activity is normal.
- Good. He got quite a jolt.
We saved everybody, didn't we?
Those people are all right now because we were there.
Some days are good days.
Yeah, I like the good days.
Enjoy them when they come.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Good night.

Welcome to Domotics Clinic.
All our lines are busy.
Please wait...
Domotics Clinic. Office seven.
Hello.
Hello.
My vacuum-cleaner robot is broken.
Yes. How did it happen?
It just doesn't work anymore.
Have you tried the self-diagnoser?
- No. It's also broken.
I see. What model?
- My vacuum-cleaner?
Yes. The vacuum-cleaner robot.
- It's an IR2020.
On or off-line?
- Off-line.
Is the discharge light on?
On the side.
- No. It's broken.
OK.
Please bring it to the shop.
OK. But there's a problem.
- Yes?
I can't go anywhere.
All repairs are done in our workshops.
Yes. But you must understand.
I never go...
I don't have time to listen.
I have other clients.
So please bring us your IR2020 or don't clean the carpet anymore.
My contract specifically states...
We do not include transport.
Goodbye.
You don't understand. I have a right...
Yes. OK. Thank you.
Hello. Mr Thomas.
- Yes. Hello.
Your insurance policy number. JM 88...
- I knew that.
So. What can I do for you?
My vacuum-cleaner is broken.
I called the repairman. but he refuses to come.
He says I have to bring it to him.
You do have a maintenance contract?
- Of course.
Apparently it does not include transport.
With which company?
- Domotics Clinic.
Let's see. I'm checking.
One moment.
I talked to a real stubborn guy.
I see. Did you catch his name?
- Yes. Gregory.
Perfect. You can count on me.
I'll take care of it.
Thank you.
Hello. Thomas.
- Hello.
How are you feeling?
- Fine.
Great.
- I did it.
What did you do?
- I talked to my mother.
She took it very well.
She will only call me once a week.
Thomas. Our session will be different today.
We have to talk.
I was controlled.
Controlled? By the insurance?
Yes. Of course.
And?
- I was almost discharged.
Wow. What's all that about?
You're good. Very professional.
I'm not the reason. The treatment is.
In fact. I asked to be controlled.
You did?
- Yes.
Globale assembled a panel of psychologists. of various expertise.
They saw our sessions and...
- Wait.
They watched our sessions?
Neither one of us owns the sessions.
They are Globale property.
Really. Thank you.
That was thoughtful of you.
So. What did your peers say?
They confirmed what I already knew.
You've been deviating.
- Deviating?
You're smart. You're avoiding.
You've invented a new patient. a virtual patient you use as protection to avoid asking yourself questions.
Isn't all that a bit far-fetched?
You don't do it on purpose.
It's subconscious.
It's alright then.
If it's subconscious. Everything's OK.
Our conclusion is that you have to be shaken up a bit.
Shaken up?
What are you going to do to me?
I've already done it.
What?
- I signed you up in a dating club.
Excuse me?
You heard me.
I gave your name to a dating club.
- A matrimonial agency?
We don't call them that anymore.
It's pejorative.
But. That's ridiculous. I...
Sorry. But I have a meeting in five minutes.
We'll talk later.
- It's ridiculous.
What am I to do with...
"Psy Workshop". Hello.
- Mr Gillon. Please.
I'm sorry. He's out.
- But he was just there.
He left 30 seconds ago. Would you like...
You could call him back.
- I don't think so.
You don't?
- He was in a hurry.
Really?
Would you like to leave a message?
No. I'll call him on his cellular.
Sorry. But he left it on his desk.
What a coincidence!
What should I do?
Do I leave him a message or not?
Yes. Let's leave him a message.
Tell him...
Tell him he's an asshole.
An asshole. Is that all?
What?
- "You're an asshole". That's it?
Well. Yes.
Shall I write your name?
- Yes.
And what is your name?
- Thomas.
Thomas who?
- Thomas.
Thomas Thomas.
First name. Thomas.
Last name is also Thomas.
I see. So it's you.
I saw your name on a file earlier.
It's rather rare.
- Very rare.

We respect all orientations.
For three years. You've had access to professional assistance.

B6 handicaps and up.
You're B8. So you have access to it.
Wait. You must be kidding.
Not at all.
Do I look like I'm kidding?
No. Do they accept to have cybersex intercourse?
They may. but you are strictly forbidden.
Really?
- Article 121. Clause 12B.
Accidents. You understand.
Electrocutions.
Yes. I heard about that.
But those fools used it in their bathtubs.
Their bathtubs?
- Yes.
I wasn't aware.
Are you interested in such a service?
Well...
We are associated with the "Madame Zoe" agency.
It is named after the agency's director.

You've never called on us before.
No.

Yes. That's right.
Male. Hetero. Homo. Or bisexual?
Heterosexual.
OK.
This is the procedure.
You will be contacted by our employees.
They will ask you if you wish to continue or not.
Do not hesitate to say "No".
Be guided by your first impression.
The first impression is important.
- OK.
So. If you say no. you will be transferred to another employee.
But if you like her. You may talk with her as you please. to see if you like her beyond your first impression.
Then you may set up an appointment at your house.
Is it clear?
- Yes.
Yes?
- Yes. It's clear.
Have fun.

Hello. Do you want to go on with me?
No.

Shit. Excuse me. I'll call you back.
Mom...
- There you are.
I told you.
- I know. I'm calling early.
We have to defuse our relationship.
But I found something this morning.
What?
- An old recording. Watch.
A recording of what?
- I'm sending it to you.
Who is it?
- It's you of course.
Aren't you cute?
I found it in a drawer.
Your uncle Frederic. Maria's husband. filmed it.
I thought you'd be happy to see it.
Thomas. Why did you hang up?
Are you alright?
No. I can't. I can't watch this.
Did you have a seizure?
You mean these images triggered it?
Yes. To see myself outside like that.
Calm down. Thomas. Calm down.
Breathe slowly.
You should rest.
That's what I was going to do.
I'm sorry. I couldn't have known.
You were so happy then.
You weren't afraid.
Yes I was afraid.
The sky. The air...
- But. Your seizures began after...
Yes. I know. Thank you. Mother.
Will you be alright?
- Yes.
I'm going to go lie down.
Are you sure?
- Yes. Goodbye. Mom.
Yes?
- Hi there.
Yes. Hello.
My name is Vanessa.
I got your number from Catch-a-Heart.
Catch-a-Heart?
Yes. The matrimonial agency.
We call it a dating club.
- Right. A dating club.
You seem rather cute.
Your face at least.
What is your problem?
- Excuse me?
Well. Why did you join a dating club?
Everybody does it.
Yes. But guys hit on you. Right?
Of course! But how do I know if he's the ideal person?
Because I'm the ideal person?
The computer selected you for me among thousands of candidates.
Among thousands of candidates. it chose an agoraphobic.
They didn't tell you at the club?
- No.
They didn't tell you!
I don't mind you being afraid of spiders.
Excuse me?
You're arachnophobic. Right?
No. Agoraphobic.
What is an agoraphobic?
It means I haven't gone out of my apartment in eight years.
You must be joking.
- No.
Eight years?
- Yes. Eight years.
And no one has come into my apartment either.
I only see people by visiophone.
Why did you call Catch-a-Heart then?
- I didn't.
My psychologist nicely signed me up. for therapy.
So. Shall we end it here?
I don't think this meeting was a real success.
It wouldn't bother you. Would it?
- No.
Perhaps. You're disappointed...
Goodbye.
Hello. My name is Eleonor.
Catch-a-Heart?
- Well. Yes.
OK.
First I have to warn you.
You'll only be able to communicate with me by visiophone.
Really?
I never leave my apartment and no one enters it.
Did you forget your code?
No.
Medical reasons.
I see.
Well. I'm sorry.
So?
So what?
Is this what you want?
To see me only by visiophone?
No. Not really.
Shall we end it here?
Hello.
- Hello.
Sorry. Roger. leave your sister alone.
Let go.
Excuse me. Wait a sec.
Well. OK.
- Roger. Let go.
Let go. Damn it.
Listen. I'll call you back.
- Yes.
Catch-a-Heart gave you my number?
- Yes.
You see. It's a mistake.
I've been married for three years.
I see.
Happy for you.
- Thank you.
Damn it. Roger!
I'll leave you now.
OK.
Listen. Gillon.
- It's you. Thomas.
What's happening? Are you OK?
Don't panic.
I'll call you back from the car.
There. Are you OK now. Thomas?
Yes.
The dating club contacted you. Right?
- Yes.
How did it go?
- What do you think?
The first time's usually a failure.
How would you know?
From experience.
From experience?
- Yes.
Personal experience?
- Yes.
You've been to such stupid dating agencies?
Yes. That's how I met my wife.
No. I don't believe you.
Most people go to dating clubs. you know.
Yes. I know. But don't tell me you believe in those dumb tests.
Sure I do.
You let a computer choose your wife for you.
The club will find someone else for you.
Well. No thanks. I'll be fine.
I have to go.
You have a lot of appointments these days.
I have busy periods too.
Goodbye. Thomas.
Yes?
- Mr Thomas Thomas?
This is he.
I got a call from your insurance company. I'm very sorry.
They explained everything.
Had I known...
We get a lot of strange callers.
You were a bit suspicious.
I'll send someone tomorrow.
When are you at home?
All the time.
Yes. Of course.
You never go outside?
- No.
You haven't been outside in ten years?
- Eight years.
You never go out?
- No. Never.
Don't you want to sometimes?
- Not at all.
Why not?
I panic.
- You're afraid?
You could say that.
Besides. I have nothing to do outside.
You like to go out?
- Sure.
To do what?
- Lots of things.
Have a drink with friends. walk with the kids.
Not me.
Sorry for asking all these questions.
It's really none of my business.
Do you want to know something else?
- No.
Seriously. How do you do it?
Stay in your apartment all day?
I keep busy with sports.
3D multimedia...
I have a hydroponic greenhouse. and a giant aquarium.
I have a passion for fish.
All that must be expensive.
- Yes. Rather expensive.
I used to conceive tridimensional circuits.
I earned quite a bit doing that.
So when my handicap became unbearable.
I was declared disabled and gave all my money to an insurance company.
Globale.
- That's right.
And I had this apartment built.
I see.
Well. I'm going to have to go.
Thanks for answering my questions.
It's unhealthy curiosity. But...
No. It's normal to ask questions.
I was happy to talk about it.
That's great then.
Well. Good luck.
- Thanks.
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

Yes... I'm sorry.
Please leave me alone.
Take someone else.
But...
Come back tomorrow. I'll be better.
OK. Then. Tomorrow.
I'm sorry. I'm not feeling well.
No. That's alright.
Would you like me to transfer you?
- No. I'll disconnect.
Goodbye.
Yes?
Excuse me?
I don't understand what you're saying.
Take off your mask.
I don't understand.
Take off the mask.
I'm from Domotics Clinic.
Why are you dressed like that?
I was told to take precautions.
No need to exaggerate.
It's for the vacuum cleaner?
Yes. An offline IR2020.
This is how we'll proceed.
First. You leave the hall.
I leave the hall?
- Yes.
I will bring the vacuum cleaner.
When the door opens. you will come and take it.
OK. So I go outside.
- Yes. You go outside.
The mask is not necessary.
Please take off the mask.
You don't need it. There's no danger.
I'll take it to the truck and check it out.
OK?
- Yes.
I'll need about half an hour.
- OK. That's fine.
Hello. My name is...
- Catch-a-Heart?
Yes. The dating club gave me your number.
My name is Melody.
- Melody?
Yes. It's not my fault.
I think it's kind of cute.
I don't.
And you? What's your name?
Thomas.
I have to tell you something first.
There's no need to be formal. don't you think?
OK. But I have to warn you.
I'm agoraphobic.
Agoraphobic.
That's when people are afraid to be outside?
Yes. More or less.
So you don't go out too often?
- No. Never.
Never?
No. And no one comes into my place.
- I see.
Since when?
- About eight years.
Eight years?
- Yes.
You're not afraid?
Why would I be afraid?
I don't know.
Me too.
- What?
I have something to tell you.
Well. It's somewhat personal.
But you told me you were agoraphobic. that's brave.
No. No need to exaggerate.
Sure. I think it's brave.
I'll tell you.
But you won't laugh?
No.
So...
Here I go.
I make video poems.
Video poems?
You've never seen video poems before?
Sure I have.
But I thought no one...
You think it's outdated.
- No. Not at all.
You would like to see mine?
- What? Now?
No. I have to prepare them first.
I'd like to select the best ones because some are truly horrible.
What's going on?
- Someone's here. I have to go.
That's alright. We'll talk again later.
Well... yes.
I have to go to my color-exchange tribe.
We're dealing with green and it's an important color to me.
I see.
Can I call you tomorrow?
You'll be home?
I'm always home.
Right.
Tomorrow then.
Well. OK. Tomorrow.
Yes?
Mr Thomas. It's fixed.
It wasn't easy. There was...
A plate was overheating.
I thought that was it. but it wasn't at all.
It was the ceramic sensor...
OK. Fine. Thank you.
There. It's fixed.
- Great. Thank you.
OK. I'm going then.
Goodbye.
Hello.
You've reached Thomas Thomas.
I can't answer right now.
I'm here. Sorry.
I don't want to disturb you.
- I was held up.
I can call later.
- No. Really. It's OK.
We don't have anything to say.
- No.
The situation's rather...
- Artificial.
Yes.
It's like when I go to sweating tents.
- Swearing what?
No. Sweating tents.
It's that Amerindian thing.
You do that?
The company where I work organizes that sometimes.
Don't you know what it is?
- Sure I do.
You've never been in one?
Me? No. Eight years ago. it wasn't so common.
I've never seen the point. In fact.
The goal is to sweat together.
- To sweat together?
It's fashionable.
- I suppose so.
It's like those dating clubs.
I find all that quite ridiculous.
It's beyond ridiculous.
Is it?
No one believes in it.
It's like...
I don't know. Like astrology.
People need it to get through life.
Incredible stuff you have to believe in.
It helps people exult their mystical function.
Their mystical function?
Heard of The Development and Creativity of the Mystical Function by Oppenheimer?
No.
I'll transfer it to you.
You too need all that stuff?
Astrology. Dating clubs. color-exchange tribes?
I'm not someone special. Thomas.
Not like you.
I'm not special.
A guy who locks himself up for eight years is a little peculiar.
People who like to go outside seem strange to me.
Do I seem strange to you?
Yes.
Do I scare you?
- No.
You think you'll let me in one day?
No. That's impossible.
I do scare you.
No. But no one comes in here.
That's the way it is. Sorry.
Too bad.
Why is it too bad?
I don't know. We could have... met each other. Seen each other. touched each other.
Make love?
Yes. Make love. Among other things.
At least try.
Maybe it wouldn't have worked out too well the first time.
With me. With you...
I doubt it. The first time...
But. Still. We could have tried.
We could make love. without you coming to my apartment.
How?
With devices.
You know. Special body suits.
You mean cybersex?
- Yes.
You're kidding me. Right?
- No.
Do you realize what you're saying?
If it bothers you. we won't talk about it again.
That's not it.
It's just a little embarrassing.
Is cybersex not in these days?
No. Not really. Not at all.
But the devices sell well. Don't they?
Yes. But no one says...
I've never heard someone say
"Look. I bought a cybersex suit".
It's kind of taboo to talk about.
Like...
Like masturbation?
Yes.
- But everyone masturbates.
Yes. Well. Especially men.
Really? Not women?
Not all of them.
Not as naturally as do men. Anyway.
What about you?
What about me?
- Do you masturbate?
You see. Thomas. That's the problem.
Were we face to face I'd say yes. Sometimes.
But like this. By visiophone. I can't.
So. Cybersex... talking about it by visiophone is hard enough... so doing it...
- OK. We won't talk about it again.
I didn't...
- It's OK. Forget it.
Don't worry. I won't forget this.
I've been asked a lot of things. but this...
It's not that I like it that way.
It's not by taste.
I don't need it. but if I have sex. It can only...
Yes. I understand.
We better stop here for now.
I'll think about it.
OK. As you wish.
It's better that way. At least for me.
OK. No problem.
See you. Then.
See you.
Hello.
- Hello.
You called yesterday. Right?
Yes. That was me.
You didn't pick another girl?
No. I wanted you.
Why?
I don't know. Maybe. because you were crying.
I see.
You get off on women who cry?
No. Not at all.
Let's stop here. OK?
We don't have to deal with perverts.
We limit ourselves to MPF.
- To what?
MPF: masturbation. penetration. Fellatio.
And yet. Fellatio only in particular cases.
We don't do the rest.
So you can go now.
Listen. You don't understand.
- Yes. I do.
You want to fuck me while I cry.
- No.
Look. I have no sexual preference for women who cry.
It's just that yesterday... I don't know...
I'm not used to calling...
For your services.
Listen closely. Mister. I'm a whore.
A medical whore refunded by the insurance. But still a whore.
We talk. You give your address.
I come over. We fuck and that's it.
That's my job. OK?
Yes. But...
There's a problem.
What now?
My handicap is agoraphobia.
You're a B8?
Yes. An acute case close to sociophobia and I cannot stand human contact.
In fact. No one comes in here.
You mean I can't come into your apartment?
That's right.
So how do we do it then?
Not cybersex. I hope.
Well... yes.
Oh. No. I don't do that.
Besides. It's forbidden.
I know. But...
- I don't do perverts.
This is not perversion.
Fucking a plastic vagina is not perverse?
It's not plastic. It's expanded carbon.
Look. I only work at home.
Why did you call me then?
There are cybersex clubs. You know?
You're good-Iooking.
- Thank you.
You could have women from around the world.
China or Africa. Anyone you like.
- I know.
There are also virtual services.
Yes. I've done that. I know it well.
But conversationwise. it's a bit limited.
I'm not a psychologist.
I have a psychologist.
But he's bald. Has a beard. and sexually. He's not my type.
You're a soft-hearted one. aren't you?
Ah. You think.
You know what you need?
A real woman.
Someone you're in love with.
And you're not a real woman?
- No.
I'm not here for love.
I'm only here for sex.
So. Join a dating club or something like it.
But leave me be.
I'm sorry. But I can't help you.
OK. OK.
Hello. Thomas.
- Hello.
How are you since yesterday?
Fine. I'm fine.
I would like to show you my video poems.
Not all of them. The best three. OK?
Sure. Yes.
I realized I had to show them to you. or there would be...
There would be something missing between us.
Yes. I understand.
I'll connect the cable with the visiophone.
There. Are you ready?
Yes.
OK. I'm sending them.
Plants
GOD
God... me...
God... me...
My Foot
My foot... my knee... my scalp... my finger... my stomach... my ankle...
My neck... my hand... my back... my elbow... my sex...
There.
What did you think?
Interesting.
You didn't think it was ridiculous?
No. Certainly not ridiculous.
But. Did it touch you?
Yes.
You can be honest with me.
Yes. It touched me because it was you.
I'm not an expert in poetry. Art. and all that. but what I saw was you.
Dating clubs may be stupid. but without them. we would not have met.
That's true.
I'm going to go.
- Where?
There's a store on avenue Compère. close to here.
I'm going to buy it.
- Buy what?
The apparel. For cybersex.
I've made up my mind.
I'm going to make love with you.
I'll call you when I get back.
OK.
I did it.
I went in and asked for a cybersex suit.
They said: "For a man or a woman?"
Know what I said?
- No.
I said it was for me.
I dared to say it was for me.
- Good.
In fact. Here it is.
Will you put it on?
- You want to?
Yes.
- Then I'll put it on.
To make love?
- Yes.
To make love with you.
You thought I'd just see how it fit?
- No.
You're going to take off your make-up?
What? My elementary signs?
- Yes.
I don't do that.
What? Even when you make love?
- Especially then.
Why?
- I'd feel naked.
Aren't we supposed to be naked when making love?
Yes. But I'd feel too naked.
I can't.
It's just make-up.
For me. If you leave it on...
It's hard enough making love wearing a rock-climbing outfit...
OK.
How do you put it on?
That's the front. Right?
- I wonder...
I have one for men. It's a bit different.
Of course.
I'm taking my clothes off.
- You want me to turn around?
Why?
- While you take your clothes off.
You'll only see my face anyway.
- You're right.
Don't you want to see me naked?
- Sure.
I mean. Yes. No.
I want to see you naked.
I'd rather you didn't.
Are you putting your suit on?
Otherwise...
Yes. Of course.
For the first time.
I'd rather not be seen too naked.
I'm usually not shy. I can be naked in front of people. at the pool or in group therapy.
But the first time. when it's sexual with a man...
I don't know.
So.
Did you put on the gloves?
- Right. The gloves.
Strange.
Are you ready?
- One second.
What do we do now?
First. You could get comfortable.
You mean on my bed?
- For example.
OK.
Wait.
OK. I'm activating.
- Me too.
And now?
- Now. I'm touching you.
Do you feel my hands?
- Yes.
I feel your hands.
They're warm.
Gentler on my breasts.
- Sorry.
Like this?
- Yes.
Like that.
Let my nipples stick out.
Like that.
You can also touch me.
Where are you?
- In front of you.
Yes. I can feel you.
I feel your shoulders. your stomach. your... your penis.
Come closer.
You are...
- Yes.
You are big.
- No.
Your suit's sensors are adapting...
Already?
- Not long enough...
No. Not for me.
- Sorry.
That's alright. It was great anyway.
It was our first time.
And for a first time. It was...
I have to think.
- About what?
I want to be alone and think.
- Now? It can't wait?
I'll call you back.
What is your code?
- No. I'll call you.
Yes. But I'd like to know your code.
Louis. Bernard. Louis. 268.
But I will call you back.
See you soon.
Yes?
- Did I wake you?
No.
I did. What time is it?
Two in the morning.
Sorry. I didn't realize it was so late.
I'll call you tomorrow.
- I'm up now.
Go back to sleep. I'll call later.
I won't get back to sleep anyway.
There must be a problem for you to call now.
So tell me what's wrong.
I've been thinking. Thomas.
I think...
I don't know.
I don't know how to tell you.
Tell me what?
- You know.
No I don't know.
It doesn't work.
Between us. It doesn't work.
It wasn't so bad last night. Was it?
Even if I was a little quick.
No. It's not the sex.
Well. Yes. It is the sex.
Among other things.
It wasn't good last night.
Really?
It was creepy actually.
I thought it was creepy.
I can't do it like that. You know.
I have to see you.
But you do see me.
You know what I mean.
I want you here with me.
I want to touch you. Feel you.
You're disgusted. Aren't you?
- No.
Yes. You are.
I understand. You being agoraphobic.
But. Me. I can't. I can't.
OK.
What. OK?
That's it then?
But I don't want to end it this way.
What do we do then?
You're being unfair. Thomas.
- No I'm not.
What do you want me to say?
It's 2 a.m.
You tell me it doesn't work.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
Thomas. I want you to go outside.
I can't.
I want to see you here. With me.
I can't.
I want to touch you.
No.
We'll talk again?
We'll still be friends?
- I don't think so.
Right.
You're right.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
I loved you. You know.
I mean...
Even now. I...
I love you.
Hello. Thomas.
- Look who it is.
How are you feeling?
Never been better.
I know about the girl from the dating club.
What?
You've been checking up on that too?
It's standard procedure.
When a therapist calls on a dating club for a patient...
Can't you leave me alone?
Must you snoop around my life like this?
It's normal for you to be aggressive right now.
You must understand...
- You enjoy making me suffer.
Living is also accepting suffering.
Amen.
That girl was a little off the wall.
But I thought it might work.
I fell in love. Like a jerk.
And now. I feel real bad.
Are you happy? Is that therapeutic?
I imagine you don't want to try again.
No.
- At least not now.
I want you to stay out of my life.
You know that's impossible.
Your contract with Globale states that as long as you don't get better...
I don't care!
Look. It's Mr...
- Thomas.
Mr Thomas. That's it.
You're lucky. I was about to close.
When it's time to go. You know.
- Sorry.
What can I do for you?
It's my vacuum-cleaner again.
Didn't I send you a repairman?
- Yes. Yes.
It should be repaired. but when I turn it on. there's a strange smell.
And there's smoke too.
We changed the ceramics?
- I think so.
Then. It's normal. There's always smoke the first time.
Don't worry.
Thank you.
You don't look too well.
- I'm fine.
The vacuum cleaner is not the reason. Is it?
No.
I have other problems.
A woman. I bet.
- What makes you think that?
Only women can make us feel that way.
She dumped you?
It's a bit more complicated than that.
Figures.
It's always complicated with them.
I say if they make you suffer. they don't deserve you.
I wasn't in love anyway.
Then. You'll forget her soon enough.
- I guess.
Don't let it get you down.
Have some fun. Go to...
I mean. Do... I don't know. what you enjoy doing.
Yes. Thank you.
- You're welcome.
At your service.
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Welcome to Sextoon.
Do you want to compose a new...
- No.
Do you want to call your...
- Yes.
Hello. Thomas.
I'm happy to see you.
I have new story lines...
- Yes.
Make your selection. Thomas.
- Number 4.
"poker game"
There. You won. I have nothing left.
But I can bet something else.
You want me to?
- Yes.
I'll bet my body.
Do you want my body?
- Yes.
You'll have my body if you win the next hand.
Or I'll take all your money. OK?
OK.
You're brave. You like to play.
I like that.
Two cards.
No cards for you?
You think you're stronger than me. don't you?
What do you say to that. little bastard?
Bastard.
Go ahead. Take me.
Go ahead. Take me.
Go ahead. Take...
Hello. Eva.
I'll call your insurance.
Why?
You've no right to bother me at work.
I don't.
- You don't want my services.
But I do want your services.
My job is to fuck. At your home.
If I report that you're harassing me...
- I need you. Eva.
No one needs me.
Especially you.
- Really?
You're just a customer.
A very difficult one.
Let's stop playing games.
- Why are you calling me?
Why me?
Because I was crying?
Why were you crying?
That's my problem.
- Maybe I could help.
Great. I've got me a Saint Bernard.
Please. Don't compare me to a dog.
I can't stand dogs and cats.
Dogs. Cats. Humans. all part of your illness?
Do you have other similar symptoms?
I have plenty of symptoms.
Look. I'd like to talk with you.
But not here. With all that make-up.
I want to talk with you at your home.
I can't.
- Give me your calling code.
I can't see patients outside of work.
- But I'm not a patient.
Listen. I... Damn. The boss.
Your code?
- I have to disconnect.
Give it to me.
- Please. The boss is calling me.
Give me your code.
- I can't.
I'll file a complaint.
No. Don't.
- Give me your code or I'll file.
I have enough problems as it is.
- Your code.
Please. Don't do this to me.
- Your code.
If she gets another complaint...
Please go.
Your code.
Bernard. Bernard. Oliver. 230.
Thank you.
Mom.
- Hello. Thomas.
It's been exactly a week.
- I'm proud of you. Mom.
But I can't talk right now.
Why not? We had said...
- I have things to do.
What things?
- I don't want to talk about it.
Even with me?
- Yes. Mom.
Call me back in a couple of days.
I knew this once-a-week thing was a bad idea.
Soon you won't talk to me at all.
- Don't be angry.
I'm not angry. I'm disappointed.
It's all my fault.
- No. Mom.
Yes. It is. No need to feel guilty.
Listen. I don't want to talk with you right now. OK?
Call me in two or three days.
OK. I'll call you Tuesday to...
- That's fine. Bye. Mom.
Hello. Eva.
I forbid you to call me at home.
But...
- You're a bastard.
You blackmailed me. You disgust me.
- No. It wasn't blackmail.
It's going to cause me problems.
Why? Can't someone call you at home?
If you don't hang up.
I'll call your insurance.
So?
They won't be happy.
They may break your contract.
No. You wouldn't do that.
Really?
- No.
I'll count to ten.
- Eva. Please.
One. Two. Three. Four... five. Six. Seven. Eight...
Yes. I know what you're going to say.
But I've been thinking.
I would like for you and I to give it another try.
We have a lot in common and with time. We may...
I'm happy that you called.
Really.
But...
I've met someone else.
Another man?
Through the club. Of course.
Ken.
Ken?
- That's his name. Ken.
He's Ghanaian.
He's in molecular synthesis.
Actually. His parents are Ghanaian.
Ghanaian. Nice.
Molecular synthesis.
That's high technology.
Do you want to meet him? He's here.
- No.
Ken...
Ken. Meet Thomas. A friend.
Hello. Thomas.
- Hello. Ken.
How are you?
- Great.
I'll leave you.
Well. I guess I better go too.
Have a nice life. Melody.
- It's no longer Melody.
What?
- I've changed my name.
I didn't like Melody.
So what is your new name?
- Françoise.
OK. Have a nice life. Françoise.
Thank you. Thomas.
You hate me. Is that it?
You must stop calling me.
File a complaint with my insurance.
I will still call you.
Yeah.
I'll never file a complaint.
It's not my style.
I wouldn't have complained to your boss either.
You don't say.
It's obvious you love your work.
What? I love my work?
As if fucking the disabled was a vocation.
No one forces you to do this.
- Yes. They do.
How can you be forced into it?
I did some things.
What things?
Illegal things.
I can't talk about it. I was given a substitution sentence.
Wait a second.
You were sentenced to being a prostitute for the disabled?
You don't have to insult me.
- No.
I'm a hostess. Not a prostitute.
I receive training.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
I didn't mean to insult you.
But how can they impose that on you?
I chose.
What do you mean. You chose?
Between a long sentence in prison and this. This was shorter.
Because...
That way. They'll give me back...
Look. I can't talk to patients about this.
I mean outside...
If they were to find me...
- Is Eva your real name?
No.
I can't use my real name anymore.
- What is it?
I can't give it to you.
Come on. It's just a name.
You don't understand.
I'm in prison. There are rules.
It's bad enough as it is. If...
Look. I have to disconnect.
Wait. They check on your private communications?
They can do it.
They always find out anyway.
What if you called from outside. from a public place.
Why would I do that?
- We could talk freely.
About what?
Take down my code. Who knows.
You may need me.
I need no one.
- It's Denis. Xavier. Bernard. 612.
And my name is Thomas.
Thomas?
That's a nice name.
Eva is also a pretty name.
Maybe. But it's not mine.
You're beautiful.
Why do you say that?
- Why what?
You can't say that.
It hurts me.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I find you beautiful. That's all.
You just want to fuck me with your damn suit.
So my being pretty or ugly. who cares?
OK. You're ugly.
You're the ugliest woman of Earth.
Everyone knows it but me.
To me. You're beautiful.
You don't know me.
When will I know you?
Enough. I mean...
In two weeks?
A year? Ten years?
How much time does one have to fall in love?
You're not in love with me.
You just want to leave your apartment.
No. I don't want to leave.
You don't want to and yet you're suffocating.
So you fall in love with the first woman who cries in front of you.
You want her to get you out.
- No. I'm fine here.
Not me. I'm not buying it.
You're not even handicapped.
But I am.
You revel in your phobias.
Of course. I revel in them.
That's what phobias are.
You think you're smarter. Don't you?
- No.
You want to manipulate me.
You're playing stupid games.
I love you. Eva.
No. You don't.
You don't love anyone.
You don't know what it means to love.
Hello. Kevin.
Hello. Mr Thomas. How are you?
- Fine.
You have my order?
- Yes.
We didn't have any Kefir Lyofi left. only Bulgarian Lyofi.
You like Bulgarian?
- Yes. Fine.
Are you sure? If not. I'll take it back.
And we'll send you some later.
No. Bulgarian is fine.
OK. Then. As you wish.
See you in three months. Then.
Yes. I'll call you. Thank you. Kevin.
Hello.
Hello.
I apologize for this morning.
You weren't so formal this morning.
I shouldn't have said all that.
What?
- Everything I said.
No. It was...
A learning experience.
Do you always judge people like that. from the start?
In five minutes. You understand it all?
It's more complicated than that.
Sometimes. I talk to someone. and feel as if I were inside them. watching them from inside.
As if there was a bond between us.
You didn't expect me to call?
No. You said you were suspicious of me. that you were afraid to call.
I had good reasons to be suspicious.
I got an MW today. A Major Warning.
Because I called you at home?
- No. Something else.
I'm sorry.
I'm used to it.
Besides. I don't care.
I don't want to cause you trouble.
- Don't worry.
Promise me you'll call in case of a problem.
What would you do?
Rescue me by visiophone?
Yes. I'd rescue you.
I love you.
That's ridiculous.
It's sincere.
- Not true.
I know what I'm feeling or not.
If you were in love. If you loved me. you'd go outside.
I can't.
Too bad then.
Wait. Wait.
Listen...
It may be conceivable.
I may conceive that you come to my place.
That you come into my apartment.
That's not enough.
But it's the same thing...
For me. It's quite something.
You have to go outside.
- I couldn't.
Yes. You can.
- No.
I'm sure you can.
OK. Where is your apartment?
Defosset Street.
Near the Luxembourg Center.
Are you coming?
You remember the park. near the old station?
On the right from Defosset Street.
I'll be waiting on a bench.
No. I couldn't.
- I'm leaving.
Eva. I couldn't.
- Do you love me?
And you?
If you can't go out for me.
I won't even ask myself.
You said there was a bond between us.
We'll see.
I'm leaving.
Hello, welcome to my home.
Leave a message after the beep.
Listen. I love you.
Really. I do.
But I'm sorry. I won't make it.
I am incapable of going outside.
No. Forget what I just said.
Hello.
You've reached Thomas Thomas.
I can't answer right now.
Please wait or leave me a message after the beep.
Thomas. Are you there?
You didn't come out. Did you?
I've been waiting for an hour in the park.
I heard an ambulance.
It wasn't you. Right?
I should have gone to see what it was. but I was afraid to miss you.
Answer me.
Hello.
You've reached Thomas Thomas.
I can't answer right now.
Please wait or leave a message after the beep.
Today is the day
Of your birthday
Happy birthday, Thomas
In our hearts you are today...
You're thirty three.
The age of Christ.
- Cheers.
Here's to you.
Bottoms up!
I bet you had forgotten.
Call us when you wake up.
Cheers.
Yes. Psychomot.
It's you. You are Mister...
Thomas. Right?
- Yes.
How are you?
I just woke up. I didn't call you.
Excuse me?
- I didn't call you.
How are we in contact?
It's normal. Do you see the small cube next to you?
It's a narco-stopper.
It calls us when you wake up.
Dr Sorensen wanted to talk to you.
I'll go get him.
Doctor Sorensen!
Mr Thomas. Hello.
I imagine you don't recognize me.
- No.
Mr Thomas. Can you tell me what you remember last?
Well. I came out of my apartment. and I walked...
My head was spinning and I fell down.
After that. I don't remember.
It's better that way.
- Why?
What happened?
Repeated convulsions that lasted about fifteen minutes.
Your heart made it. Then the ambulance brought you here.
I gave you narcotics and neuroleptics.
What? You touched me?
I was wearing gloves.
Yes. But you were near me?
How did I get here?
Listen. Mr Thomas. you had severe allergic reactions.
I don't want to shake you up.
I want to know the truth.
Did you bring me here?
You came into my home?
What about the alarms?
The insurance cut them off.
Yes. I see.
No nausea? No vertigo?
Here. Now? No. Not at all.
OK.
I'll be able to send a positive report to the insurance then.
You were lucky. But I wouldn't recommend these little escapades.
At least not unprepared.
Going out won't kill me?
Your respiratory system and your heart are very weak.
It's summer time. You were dressed for the North Pole.
Yes. Well.
Thank you. Doctor. Goodbye.
The member you require is no longer connected to Visiocom.
Shit.
You have selected Eva, but she no longer works here.
Damn!
It's you.
- I'd like to talk to Eva.
She doesn't work here anymore.
I must find her.
- You must do nothing.
You've done enough.
She lost her job.
Where can I contact her?
Look. If you continue to harass me.
I'll have to report it.
Where is she. Damn it?
- You're going too far.
Tell me where she is!
- I don't know.
Because of you. she's in the hands of a judge...
Yeah. I know.
What do you know?
- The madam called you and complained.
Indeed.
Madame Zoe is threatening to sue us.
I don't give a damn.
Think of all the consequences.
You could be sued for...
Yeah. Where's the girl?
The prostitute?
- Yes. The prostitute.
Don't you know you're forbidden to even ask the question?
I don't care.
I love her. You understand?
I'm your insurance company.
I speak in the name of the company.
OK. Enough. Thank you.
Hello. Thomas.
- I should've known.
I am no longer your psychologist.
Globale blamed you for all this?
No. Not directly.
They replaced me by Dr Moreau.
They can. With no reason.
But the girl was...
Eva?
- Yes. Eva.
What will happen to her?
She was transferred to another sector. less demanding of her body.
- What?
Another sentence of substitution. but a longer one.
What does it consist in?
I can't tell you. Thomas.
Globale forbids you to have any contact with her. And it's best.
Where is she?
You must tell me.
Listen. you know. when we were waiting for the insurance experts.
I talked with Eva.
- You saw her?
She asked me to tell you that you were not responsible.
She would have broken down anyway.
She hated being a prostitute. even a medical one.
You were just a catalyzer.
It's not your fault.
You're lying.
- Excuse me?
She would never have said that.
It's not true.
Globale told you to calm me down.
You're totally paranoiac.
I must find her. Where is she?
Why do you need to know?
You know what will happen if you go outside.
Yes. I won't be a B8 anymore.
I won't be handicapped and
Globale will lose its contract.
They pay you. So you have no interest in my going outside.
Look. We all want you to get better. to go outside. But gradually.
I want to find her!
Remember two days ago?
You almost died.
Was it fun?
You want to try it again?
You were lucky. But if you go out. you'll die like a dog.
Where is she?
She's in a place where you can never find her. Never.
Where?
Outside your apartment.
Hello, you've reached Nathalie Thomas who's not here for now, or only in this bi-dimensional, digital and pixelised version...
Hello. Mom.
You're calling me?
- Yes.
It's the first time.
No. I've called you before.
No. Really. It's the first time in eight years.
I would have called. But...
I would have come to the hospital. but they had already brought you home and said you had to rest.
What got into you. Thomas?
I was worried.
At least. You're OK.
That's what's important.
How are you feeling?
You look good.
- I'm fine.
You just came in?
Yes. I went shopping.
How is the weather?
It just started to rain.
I came in just in time.
Is it cold?
Did you need a sweater?
Why are you asking?
- Just curious.
You're not going to go outside. Are you?
- No.
You know the risks.
- Yes.
So. Is it cold or not?
No. It's not cold.
I went out like this.
OK. I'll leave you now.
Already?
- Yes.
Alright.
Good luck. Thomas.
Love you, Mom.
Le Vaillant was struck by the hypocrisy
of killing fellow human beings in the name of religion.
Especially since these people professed belief in the same God.
The Fazar, Le Vaillant's written account of his experiences in the Holy Land,
tells us he wandered the streets of conquered Jerusalem
for days after that bloody battle,
until he found the entrance of a cave
that ran beneath the length of the holy city.
Inside that cave, he began to record his epiphany,
which became the basis for a new religious sect.
An order that would combine the fundamental tenets
of the three major religions of his day.
His first converts were
Christian knights
who'd also become disenchanted by the bloodshed.
The force of his convictions even won over a number of Muslims and Jews.
Former enemies who now became willing converts to the new faith.
Many years after completing the original Fazar,
Le Vaillant had further revelations.
He wrote these down, intending them to be added as the final chapter.
Around this time he and his followers were being accused of heresy
by the crusader authorities.
On their way to Syria, he and a group of disciples were intercepted
by some of the very same crusaders he had once commanded.
During the battle that followed,
Le Vaillant died a martyr's death.
The final chapter he had written was lost.
Do you have the alarm code?
And no guards, right?
You'll be like the fox in the henhouse.
Heh, heh. Take as many eggs as you like.
Yuri, it's Russian mob.
No mistakes on this one.
My friend, this is 1000 percent.
By this time tomorrow, you'll be in New York making a deal.
And I'll be in Tel Aviv waiting for my commission.
Visual is all clear.
- Come on.
- Done.
Way to go, Yuri. I'm in.
Do you see the egg?
It's beautiful.
Yes! Yes! Yes!
I'm going for it.
- I got it.
- Yuri's the man with the plan!
- You're the man with the plan.
- I told you...
- Shit.
- Rudy?
Are you okay?
- Was that a gunshot?
- No, I farted.
Yuri, guide me out of here.
Oh, shit, Rudy. I'm sorry.
Toilet!
Hey, pal, this is a taxi zone.
You wanna get towed away?
Sorry. Watch it for me.
- Hey.
- Thanks.
Right on.
Perhaps you've seen enough stones and carvings. Come with me.
I will show you a garment.
A most controversial acquisition.
This was unearthed beneath a false storage room, situated by Theodosius as a decoy against thieves.
But often success as an archeologist depends on knowing where to dig.
Well, I can dig her. Heh.
Rudy! Would you take over?
Can I have your?
Okay, everybody, follow me.
Dad, what's up? My main man!
Why must you always attract attention?
Come on, I love people, I love life...
You love to embarrass me.
I'm just having fun, Dad.
- Anyway, you called. You want to talk?
- Yes, but not here. Come on.
Tell me, are you still involved with that same nonsense?
Hey, I'm legit now.
Straight. Import-export.
And I'm kicking ass.
Now, check this out.
Here, take it. For you.
Fancy watches, fast cars, easy money.
What does it prove in the grand scheme of things, Rudy?
- Yeah?
- You have the egg?
I've got it. Trust me, it's in pristine condition.
- Ten o'clock.
- Yeah, I'll be there.
Later, tonight. Some business.
- I hope for your sake it is legal.
- A thousand percent.
Come on.
Damn plane tickets.
They are here somewhere.
- Where you going? On a dig?
- No, an interview.
Someone I've been trying to meet for a very long time.
- Don't touch that!
- Sorry.
What is it?
The lost chapter of the Fazar.
Oh.
The Fazar happens to be the holy scripture for an obscure Middle Eastern sect.
And, yes, to answer your inevitable next question, it is quite valuable.
But only to practicing members of the Order.
What can I say, Dad?
You have an exciting life.
Rudy, we need to discuss some issues.
Come by my apartment this evening.
- Uh, I've got some business tonight.
- Mm-hm.
In fact, uh, it's time to go.
All right. Can you at least call me?
Of course.
Absolutely.
- Tonight. It has to be tonight.
- You've got it, Dad.
♪ In your new dress
As you spend your night ♪
♪ Walkin' and boppin'
Just to get it right ♪
♪ Chugging your drink
Till we break up out ♪
♪ It's a mystery to me
How you do that ♪♪
Be careful.
Mr. Cafmeyer, this way, please.
So let's see what Santa brought for me.
Mm?
This egg was designed by Peter Carl Fabergé.
A special gift to Czar Nicholas.
Look at the inlay.
Twenty-four-karat gold.
What can I say? One of a kind.
- That's why it's so expensive.
- You cannot find this on the Net. Ha, ha.
That's for sure. But stealing it from the Russian mafia, come on.
Russian mafia?
In fact, he's got some friends.
Very nasty guys.
If they found out about this, you'd end up with your balls stuffed and sewn inside your mouth.
Whoa. So the deal about...
No, no, no. Here's the deal.
I'm giving you an easy out.
I'll take this hot potato off your hands.
- And I'll assume the risk.
- Risk is my business.
You're not listening, Rudy.
Just a second, please.
- Hello?
- Rudy!
Where are you?
You promised to call me tonight!
Uh, I'm in a business meeting.
Really? Are you buying a disco?
- Dad, please.
- I can hear that music!
Hey, where are you going?
That is just what I'm trying to explain to you.
Rudy, what is going on?
Give it to him.
Rudy.
Hey, come here!
Rudy?
My egg.
Move!
Oh, shit.
My eyes!
Got a problem here?
Hey, can I make a phone call over here?
Not yet, Rudy.
Heard you had a big night last night.
How are you gonna pay for all that?
Sell your Ferrari?
Listen, I had a bad night, okay?
Why do I have to look at your face in the morning? Huh?
Is your father Oscar Cafmeyer?
Yeah. Why?
Yesterday, there was a manuscript in this case.
Last night, security discovered it missing.
So what?
Your father was last to leave the building.
This morning, nobody seems to know where he is.
A case of like father, like son?
- You're full of shit.
- Rudy, relax.
Why should he break the glass if he had a key?
Nobody's making any accusations.
We just wanna ask him some questions.
You have any idea where he is?
No.
Rudy, I've been trying your mobile, but all I get is this recording.
Oh, never mind. I will try again later.
I'm staying at an old friend's home.
Remember Walt Finley?
He is teaching at Ben Gurion University.
Now, this is his number: 972...
- Hello?
- Rudy?
- Dad, how are you?
- Thank God you're there.
- Where are you?
- Israel.
- Israel?
- Pay attention, I beg you.
I was at the police station. You know what they're saying about you?
Not now. I'm afraid I've gotten myself into some big trouble.
- What do you mean?
- What are you doing? Hang up!
Dad! Who's that?
Book me on the first flight to Israel.
Tel Aviv. Right away!
Take your glasses off, please.
Visiting Israel on business or pleasure?
Pleasure, always.
Excuse me, uh, what's the delay?
Our database shows that you've had several arrests for illegally transporting artifacts.
Does it also show I was never convicted?
Please open your carry-on.
Any artifacts which you have not declared?
Oh, the Mona Lisa.
- Hmm. You like to joke.
- They say laughter opens up the soul.
Well, let it open the rest of your luggage too.
- You're joking, right?
- Ha-ha-ha. No.
You know, this is bullshit.
No, Mr. Cafmeyer. This is Israel.
I apologize.
Security is extra tight this month.
Muslims are making their pilgrimage to Jerusalem for Ramadan.
Passport, please.
Rudy? Rudy Cafmeyer!
- Who is this?
- Walter Finley.
Professor of archeology at Ben Gurion University.
And what is your relationship to this man?
Not that it's any of your business,
I'm a friend of his father's.
I've known him since he was in knickers, which would have put you in diapers.
Now, are there any more insurmountable obstacles we have to overcome here, young lady?
Thank you for your cooperation.
Shalom.
- Good to see you.
- You too.
- Where's my dad?
- Look, let's get your bags into my car.
- Watch where you go!
- Up yours!
Ozzie Cafmeyer is a cranky old fool.
Calls me two days ago to pick him up at the airport.
So I took him back to my house.
We had dinner, talked...
What was he doing here?
I'm getting to that!
What is this, the Spanish Inquisition?
A few years ago, he found scrolls near the Syrian border.
The lost final chapter of the Fazar written by Le Vaillant himself.
Was he translating it?
More than that.
He was writing a history of the sect.
An unauthorized history.
He's been e-mailing me his chapters, having me lock them in a safe-deposit box here.
- Why a safe-deposit box in Israel?
- Because he trusted me.
Here, here's the key.
You ought to have it anyway.
- Okay, where can I find these guys?
- I'll show you.
Their monastery is in east Jerusalem.
The other side of the Mount of Olives.
- We're wasting time. Let's go.
- The present-day Order is just as reclusive as ever.
Fanatically adverse to publicity.
No contact to the outside world. You'd do better trying to get an audience with the pope.
Those are the guys that came by the house and picked up your dad!
Hey! Hey, you!
- Jump in. I'll drive.
- You don't know the way.
- You'll navigate, okay?
- Be careful. This is a classic car.
Professor, buckle up.
- Aah!
- It's them!
Get down!
My car!
Shit. Sorry about the car.
- There they are.
- Let's just nail these sons of bitches.
You okay?
- I'm fine.
- Good.
Where's my father, you son of a bitch?
I'm gonna kill you!
You okay?
Finley, look out!
Rudy...
- Stay right there! Don't move!
- He needs a doctor. Help me!
- Hey, it's not me!
- Up.
- Get up.
- It's not me!
And so you are telling us these men kidnapped your father.
They took him somewhere.
No one's heard from him.
Mr. Cafmeyer,
I can smell bullshit a mile away.
You're only five feet from me.
I believe you're using the alleged disappearance as a cover to smuggle artifacts out of Israel.
Alleged? My father was here.
Now he's missing.
This has nothing to do with why you are in police custody.
You were found next to the corpse of a prominent professor.
Let me guess.
You're accusing me of killing him?
Until we have more facts, all options are open.
I'm placing you under house arrest.
You'll be taken to a hotel until we complete our investigation into the professor's death.
You know why you're smelling bullshit?
Because you're up to your nose in it.
I'll be next door if you need anything.
- What about a taxi?
- Within reason.
- What about my father?
- We're looking into it. Good night.
- Good night, officer.
- Lieutenant Barr. Dalia Barr.
- How are you?
- Okay.
- Thanks.
- Thank you.
- Yuri.
- Rudy!
Rudy, let me explain what happened in Odessa.
Explain what? You left me hanging like a piece of laundry.
But there was this cop...
Admit it! You little slimeball.
Or you'll never see your money.
- What money?
- I sold the egg. Remember our deal?
Ten percent.
That's 50 G's for you, my friend.
Lucky for you, this place makes me generous.
Thank you, Rudy.
Thank you.
Rudy, do you have the cash with you?
It's under my mattress.
Of course I have it.
But I'm leaving tonight.
Tonight? Uh...
Can we meet first?
Come to my office in Tel Aviv.
I have a beautiful new penthouse suite in the diamond district.
You'll be my special guest.
We'd like to use the phone.
Rudy?
Uh... Yuri, I have a much better idea.
Yuri.
Yuri.
Is that you, Rudy?
You slimeball. You almost got me killed!
Hey, Rudy, it wasn't my fault!
- You owe me.
- Owe you?
- You owe me.
- What do you mean?
- You owe me, I said!
- Anything, Rudy. Anything.
Just tell me what I can do to help, my friend.
I need this map translated.
Can you do it?
- Sure.
- Sure?
- Sure.
- Sure.
I'm positive! I'm a pro, my friend!
- And this print.
- Done. For you, anything.
Understand something.
I know where you sleep...
It wasn't my fault! There were cops...
Cops. Let's split up.
I'll call you. Go. Go.
Shalom.
Look, there he is. Stop!
Hey, you! Stop!
Cafmeyer! Hey, you! Stop!
Get away! Move! Hey, hey! Stop!
No.
Hey, you! Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Come on! Come on!
Don't move!
Freeze!
Huh?
Excuse me.
Cuff them.
You know how much trouble I'm in because of you? Do you know?
Let's have a coffee and talk about it.
You have proved to me that my original hunch was correct.
You cannot be trusted.
I came here to look for my father.
I did what I had to do because nobody gives a shit!
We spoke to Immigration.
They have no record of him entering the country.
That's impossible.
What's really going on?
Were you perhaps planning to smuggle out a little something, hm?
Hey, those are mine!
What's going on?
Yes, we checked you out of the hotel.
Change at the airport.
You're going home.
- You cannot do that.
- I can, and will.
Can you take him to the airport without him escaping?
Yes, sir.
- What about Finley's murder?
- You're no longer a suspect.
I'm still the only witness!
We have your testimony, thank you.
Enjoy your flight, Mr. Cafmeyer.
You're not helping me! You're helping yourself! You're full of shit!
- Move it!
- What's going on?!
What did you find?
Today, as every year at this time, we come to this special place to commemorate the departure of the knights of Christendom from these shores.
Brother Cyrus will now lead us in a passage from the Fazar.
Thank you, first disciple.
As was prophesied in the Book of Tribulations, we await the return of the Army of God, who shall rise like a tide against the sea of those who do not believe.
Cyrus, by what authority do you quote from that disreputable source?
As second disciple, you should know better!
I beg your forgiveness.
It was an unpardonable error.
Le Vaillant himself once followed a false path toward God.
We must choose our words carefully.
Wars have started for less.
I will ask for forgiveness at evening vespers.
Your flight doesn't leave for a few hours. You hungry?
Someone here actually cares about me?
We may be overly cautious with security and our artifacts, but we're not barbarians, Mr. Cafmeyer.
It'd be a shame if you left without sampling some fresh hummus.
You like?
- I'd like it more without this.
- Sorry.
Look, I came here to find my father.
He told me he was in trouble.
He's the type of guy who never lies.
It sounds like you really care about him.
The two of you must be very close.
He taught me everything about paintings, antiques, you name it.
You certainly applied that knowledge.
Let's say I did.
I never meant to hurt him.
- That's bothering you now?
- Yes, because now he's missing.
And I'm just starting to realize what I missed.
Why am I telling you all this?
You're tired.
You're jet-lagged. You'll feel a lot better once you're back on a plane.
No, I'll feel better when I find him.
This attack was a brutal and senseless act
perpetrated on a man who devoted his life to God and to peace.
His brothers and sisters mourn his passing
and pray that those responsible find repentance.
Who died?
Pierre Gaudet, the leader of some religious sect.
- You mean the Order?
- Mm-hm.
Come on, this way.
Come on. Please keep on moving.
- Hello.
- Get the prisoner off the plane.
- I want him brought back here.
- Why?
We've been informed he's leaving with an artifact.
- Customs checked him. I saw...
- Just do it, lieutenant!
- What's going on?
- You're staying in Israel.
What?
They said you're trying to smuggle an artifact.
Do you believe that?
Something is not kosher here.
I'm not trying to be funny, okay?
When I signal, run to the back stairs.
If you make it to the service road,
I'll be waiting.
- If I make it?
- Now push me.
Just push me.
Over here! He's escaping! Quick!
- Unh!
- Quick! I need assistance up here!
What? What are you doing? Hey! Hey!
The stairs are slowing him down!
We can catch him!
Rudy! Get in the back. Hurry.
Get down. Get down!
You all right?
You missed him. He went over the fence.
- You're safe now.
- Safe from what?
I've got some questions for you, okay?
- I used to belong to the Order.
- What?
- You should've told me this before.
- I couldn't.
- Of course not. You're part of it.
- No, I didn't know this was related.
- Oh, sure. You knew about my father.
- Where are you going? Hey!
Hey!
I just risked my ass for you!
Why? So you can hand me over to the Order?
I left the Order when I was 18.
- Oh, you left the Order?
- I wanted to create my own life.
So meeting you at the airport was no accident.
Look, Rudy, let me explain a few things to you, okay?
Most of the followers are peaceful and life-affirming.
There is a small group of fanatics who believe in a darker path.
They call themselves the Army of God.
They've been on standby for years.
And you think they took my father?
I don't know. They might also be the ones who killed Gaudet.
Hey, Rudy, my friend!
- Who's the cop?
- Everything's fine. She's with us.
Uh-huh. My friend, look what
I printed out for you from the disc.
- It's not translated yet, but... Uh-huh.
- It looks like a map of Jerusalem.
Middle Ages, European design.
What's the language?
Aramaic. The language of Palestinian
Christians at the time the Crusades.
See these lines? Here and here?
They are caves and tunnels beneath the old city.
They've remained hidden since the holy wars.
Professor Finley told me about those.
What he didn't tell you is what they lead to.
Why would an archeology professor bring the scrolls to New York but leave the map in Israel hidden inside a safe-deposit box?
Because the map leads to something even more valuable.
- The people who left forgot something.
- Let's hide this.
Hands in the air!
Get them up! Move!
Where is it? Where is it?
Freeze!
Oh!
Oh.
Give me that.
Come on.
Hold on.
Rudy.
Thank you, Avram.
After all this time, you come back to me like this.
Avram, you know I've had to make some difficult choices.
You chose to leave.
Please, can we talk about this later?
I really need some water and clean rags right now.
- Here's some water.
- Thank you, Avram.
- Where am I?
- A friend's.
How long have I been here?
Two days now. Hey. Shh.
You really should rest.
- I'm okay.
- Well enough to leave?
- Israeli hospitality kills me.
- No, it just saved your life.
- Here. Your father's book.
- Yeah.
I've been going through this.
You really should too.
The lost chapter predicts a revolution,
one that is peaceful and spiritual in nature.
This will not be good news to the radical Army of God
who contend that Le Vaillant prophesied a catastrophic holy war.
I suspect this militant faction will stop at nothing
to suppress the true contents of this final chapter.
Though my safety may be an issue,
I have requested an interview with the first disciple
to make these matters known.
Your scholar seems to be on the verge of enlightenment.
It wouldn't hurt you to sample some of it yourself.
Dalia, the world is as filled with temptations as it is with false prophets.
Onions. I need onions.
- Is everything okay?
- We were just...
We were discussing the manuscript.
It's a fraud.
A fraud? The scrolls, they were tested.
- By whom? Secular scientists?
- If you would open your mind...
- To what?
- To this, Avram.
What is this? What is this?
It's mentioned in the Fazar.
Solomon's gold. A treasure the ancient Hebrews hid under the city.
Which might explain why people with guns have been chasing us.
It explains nothing but your ignorance.
The treasure is a metaphor for the wisdom of the ancient sages.
Avram, I need to get to the monastery.
I think they're holding my father.
Impossible. No outsider is permitted.
What about an insider?
A member from overseas that is here on pilgrimage?
That's Cyrus.
The new first disciple.
Children of God, I stand here before you today in great sorrow.
For what should be a celebration of hope and joy, must instead be looked upon as a call to action.
God's vengeance for this murderous deed will be swift and without mercy!
May the eternal spirit of Pierre Gaudet guide us on this path of deliverance.
- Time to see if my father's alive.
- Try the catacombs first.
That door leads to a small stairway.
Follow it all the way down.
Rudy. Be careful.
Rudy.
- Dad! Are you all right?
- Rudy. Yes.
Let me get you out of here. Unh!
No, no, I already tried.
No, forget about me.
You have to stop them.
Pull off that tarp. You will see what this is all about.
Rudy, go. Go!
- This looks like a...
- A bomb?
Sorry we're late, but I could give a shit about this coronation.
Tonight, we will all witness a miracle.
As God's fury cleanses the souls of those against us, let the new age begin!
- Where are you going?
- To find Rudy.
Avram, we have to put a stop to this.
All right, I'm coming with you.
This way.
Rudy!
Dalia, stop! It's a trap.
Now be a good girl, Dalia, and come down here.
Since when did you take your vows with the Order, major?
The day Cyrus vowed there was treasure under the Temple Mount.
That's the day I found religion. Ha, ha.
Hello, professor.
Dad, meet Dalia. She's a good cop.
Now let's ask the major what the big bomb is for. Huh?
It's Ramadan.
Islamic leaders from around the world will be on the Temple Mount at noon.
What are you saying?
This nut case is gonna blow it up?
That will start World War III.
Especially when they find the bodies of an Israeli and an American.
No, no, you're crazy!
This is impossible.
You've completely misinterpreted the words of the first disciple.
And you are a naive moron.
You have truly lost the way, Cyrus.
On the contrary, I've found it.
I want to thank you, young Cafmeyer, for unwittingly providing the final piece of the puzzle.
And thank you, Avram, for your loyalty and devotion.
But, first disciple, what they're saying here...
Avram, If you've read the Book of Tribulations carefully, you are aware that the holy war is triggered by a singular event.
Behold the event.
And as my unwavering one, I shall grant you the privilege of assisting us.
Bind him, and her too.
Now, where's my guide?
- Unh! Dad!
- No! Stop!
- There is no need for that!
- Then you will be assisting us too?
- What's he talking about?
- With the map, your father can guide us under the Temple Mount.
Cyrus, please. Millions will die.
It is written! I will raise Mount Moriah and build a new temple.
That prophecy you are quoting is a fabrication!
- Unh!
- Dad! Unh!
Don't do shit for him.
Apparently, stubbornness is an ingrained family trait.
Beats a messiah complex any day.
- Aah! Unh.
- Stop! I will do it. I will guide you.
God help us all.
He helps those who help themselves, professor.
We are near the Temple Mount.
That is where the traps begin.
Perhaps we should use someone expendable to lead the way.
Young Mr. Cafmeyer, we have a job for you.
Rudy!
- Rudy, be careful.
- Okay.
Go.
Avram.
Avram! Somebody help him!
No! Let me go, damn it!
Careful, Rudy.
Come on, Avram.
- You deceived me.
- This is the way according to the map.
- How do we proceed?
- What's the matter with you guys?
See these beams? We take them down and we build a bridge.
Oh, my God.
- This is not the Well of Souls.
- Unh!
In the next chamber, I swear.
Show me.
Directly above us, the Dome of the Rock,
Islam's third holiest shrine.
And henceforth from this day forward, the holiest shrine of the Order.
Cyrus, I beg you to reconsider.
Bring the bomb.
Hey, hey. Hold on, hold on.
We'll get to that.
First, we fill these bags.
There's no time.
Would you take a look around you, Cyrus?
There's a king's treasure here.
Enough to finance 10 of your holy wars.
We set the bomb now.
We can do this the easy way, or the very easy way.
I have a prophecy to fulfill.
And I have a Swiss bank account to fill.
That's the only reason I joined your crazy scheme in the first place.
- Idiots!
- Professor, here.
Stop them! Don't let them get away!
- Unh!
- Aah!
No!
Avram, no!
- Rudy, your dad!
- Dad, you're hit.
- Unh! Unh.
- Dalia, come on.
Let's go. Over here.
Dad, you stay here. We'll be back.
I'll be fine.
Let's go. Come on.
They couldn't have come this far.
We must've passed them.
Come on, let's double back.
Let's split. Go!
Get after him!
I'll take care of that bitch!
- Ah. Help me with these.
- Assist him.
Shit!
Hey, Dad, meet Dalia.
She's the dead cop!
Wrong, major.
- Professor, are you okay?
- I'm fine.
- Take my father out of here.
- What about you?
- I've got to stop the bomb.
- Rudy, please be careful.
Come on, professor. Let's go.
- Are you ready for this?
- Thank you.
Psst.
The bomb is set. It's irreversible.
The prophecy will be fulfilled, and I will vanquish my enemy.
You can't stop the prophecy.
You read the wrong book, pal.
Now it's time to say bon voyage.
Shalom!
Please, stay calm.
- Hey, Dad.
- Rudy!
My main man!
Hey, this is great.
A few more to sign, then we can go to lunch.
Take your time.
- Don't touch that!
- Oh!
I'm sorry. What is this?
It is a map which purports to show the location of the fabled seven cities of Cibola near Cancùn on the Yucatán peninsula.
- Oh.
- These, ostensibly, hm, are the legendary cities of gold containing the Mayan treasure, which the Spanish conquistadors so desperately had sought.
And to answer your inevitable next question:
Yes, it is quite valuable. Ha, ha.
Rudy? Rudy?
Rudy!
So where to, young Cafmeyer?
- Cancún, Mexico.
- Mm-hm.
- Will that be business or pleasure?
- Pleasure, always.
- Rudy!
- Oh.
Cut?

Little sister! Get up!
Liên, it 's late.
Let me sleep[br]a bit more.
No way.[br]Today is Mum's memorial.
You have to help big sisters[br]in the kitchen.
Remember yesterday when[br]we were in Cha Ca Street? lt was crowded.[br]And l had a weird feeling.
What? l thought that people[br]mistook us for a couple.
Haven't you ever[br]noticed that?
No. ln fact... maybe that 's how people[br]always see us.
Knock it off.[br]Go wash up.
Let 's go, big brother.
Hurry up, l'm starving.
-Sit opposite me.[br]-Let me sit next to you... so we see the same things.
You're horrible.
You never do what l want.
We look good together, right?
-Don't talk rubbish.[br]-What for?
-We were made for each other.[br]-Everyone knows you're my sister.
Better think about what to buy[br]with big sisters instead. l don't decide what we're eating.[br]lt 's always the traditional dishes.
Exactly.[br]So don't forget anything. l'm sick of running to the market[br]for two lemons.
Probably a couple[br]of shallots.
-What?[br]-Nothing.
Khanh, do l throw out the seeds?
No, cook the rice with it,[br]it will be nicer.
And the pâté?[br]One inch or two?
-Let 's see. Too thick.[br]-One inch is fine.
Agreed.[br]Liên, those shallots shoots?
My God, l forgot.
-Kiên could buy some.[br]-Let your husband be.
Writers only know[br]about the human soul.
He can't tell shallots[br]from chives.
But my husband,[br]he knows his plants.
You're right.
You should send Hai,[br]he'd love to do it.
Okay, if the elders are chatting,[br]l'll send little brother. l photographed[br]this fruit in Huê. l'll spare you[br]its scientific name. lt 's eaten with pickled prawns.[br]You only find it in Huê.
Hai!
Go buy some shallots![br]Liên says you love the market.
Yes, that 's right.[br]Kiên, can l take your bike?
-ls the café open?[br]-No, only from six o'clock.
Auntie Mai,[br]bring me two trays.
Yes, right away.
Quôc, the other day you said[br]that apart from business... you take photos for yourself.[br]Why don't you show them? l'd really like to see them. l'm not happy with them. l say that because, in your photos[br]for the Botanical Society... there are no faces.
And in your personal photos[br]there are?
Yes, of course.
They are mostly portraits.
But l think photos of plants[br]give me greater pleasure. ln them, there is a tranquility[br]you can't find in a face. lt 's tranquility[br]l look for in a photograph. l think l get you.
But all the same,[br]in my opinion... you have a real problem[br]with faces. l will demonstrate that your[br]opinion is a writer's fantasy.
This is my favorite part. lt 's strange. Satisfying and[br]disgusting at the same time. lt 's true. We women are[br]condemned to disgusting things. ln the old days,[br]we couldn't touch a man's head.
That noble part of the body[br]must not be soiled by our hands. but men have always liked[br]and allowed us...
...to touch another thing.[br]-Exactly.
So is that thing[br]considered noble?
We must conclude that it isn't[br]since we're allowed to touch it.
-lt must be classified as disgusting.[br]-l don't find it so very disgusting.
-On the contrary.[br]-What do you mean?
Oh, well... you could call it[br]a culinary fantasy.
What?
Listen, l always[br]thought that... fried with a little garlic,[br]it must have an amazing texture.
Both tender and crunchy. lt 's not easy to talk about[br]a photo point-blank. l'd accept that excuse[br]from anyone... but not from a writer.[br]Words are your business.
You exaggerate.
Are you open, Quôc?
-Oh, hello, Kiên.[br]-Come in, Toàn.
-Liên will make you a coffee.[br]-No, l just came to say hello.
So, Kiên, when is your first novel[br]coming out?
Oh, there's no hurry.[br]l'm working on it.
-But it 's going well?[br]-ln fact, l'm nearly finished.
There's little left to write,[br]but l'm blocked. lt 's about an encounter.
Usually, that happens[br]at the beginning or in the middle.
But here, it 's at the end.
The protagonist meets a woman. l want to write it concisely[br]and end abruptly. l can't wait to read it.
-Big brother Toàn.[br]-Big sister Liên.
An iced coffee?
Make up your minds, you two,[br]it 's getting ridiculous.
She calls you ''big brother'' and[br]you call her ''big sister''. lt can't be.[br]lt 's actually absurd.
-What 's the problem?[br]-We were born the same day.
-What time were you born?[br]-That 's it, l don't know. l know when l was,[br]but it doesn't help.
-Nobody knows at home?[br]-No, nobody.
Sorry, l have to help[br]my sisters in the kitchen. lf you find a solution[br]let me know... and l'll stick to it.
Look, here's how l see it.[br]She already calls you ''big brother''.
Call her ''little sister''[br]like husbands and wives do.
Who says l want[br]to marry her?
-Just look at you.[br]-What are you talking about?
The boy wants to marry[br]our sister-in-law.
Oh, yeah?
Easy as a pie. Betel leaves[br]and arec nuts for the engagement... then a wedding[br]6 months later.
But first he must learn to say[br]''little sister Liên''.
Okay, stop teasing me.
Where have you been,[br]Little Mouse? l went for a walk[br]and l'm going to see Mommy.
Gorgeous.[br]Not a crack in the skin.
Let 's decorate the altar[br]for the ceremony.
The incense is burnt.[br]Let 's carve the chicken.
Taste this wine, Uncle.
What luck! l was afraid[br]you couldn't make it.
The memorial meal[br]is a success.
We're hopeless. We should've[br]learned with our mother.
Not at all. You're almost[br]as good as she was.
Uncle Tung hasn't aged,[br]has he?
Want some water?
Hai, want some?
-l ate too much, didn't you?[br]-Yes.
Me too.
-l don't think l'll eat tonight.[br]-Me neither.
What would you say[br]to some snails in ginger?
-Now, that l could eat.[br]-Me too, come to think of it.
Good, that 's settled.
-Shall we continue?[br]-Start with the registry office.
So l was saying that Kiên[br]became more and more interested... as he discovered new clues.
After examining the register and[br]putting aside the unlikely ones... he arrived at the theory[br]that Mother's Toàn... was a certain Phan Châu Toàn.
They were at the same school for[br]5 years, which supports his theory.
Then it must be that Toàn.
Why only 5 years?
Because Toàn died of starvation in[br]'43 during the Japanese occupation.
Mommy was 14 then.
So it was a schoolgirl crush?
Hang on, it 's a theory,[br]not a certainty.
Kiên hasn't checked[br]with this Toàn's family yet.
They moved to Saigon in '54.
He'll have to go to Saigon. And be[br]lucky enough to find a relative... who may have got wind[br]of this love story. lt can only be this Toàn. l say that because[br]according to this theory... it 's a case of puppy love.
At the end, when[br]Mum wasn't all there... and mistook Dad for Toàn,[br]she was reliving her childhood.
That 's why she spoke to him[br]like a shy little girl. she told him that she loved[br]him so innocently... that it brought tears[br]to Dad's eyes.
Like l said, this[br]is only a theory.
And l tell you that Kiên's research[br]will confirm what l believe. lt can't be otherwise.[br]lt 's obvious.
Me, too... l believe this version[br]of the story.
Our mother could never[br]have loved any man... but Daddy. l know in my heart[br]that she was faithful. l'm sure of it.
Dad and Mum were always together,[br]they were inseparable.
The proof is that[br]a month after Mum died... he followed her.
There's something perfect[br]about their relationship.
And remember what we've[br]said a thousand times.
Mum was one month[br]older than Dad.
He died one month after her... which means that they lived[br]almost the same lifetime... give or take an hour... by our reckoning.
Poor Daddy.[br]l wonder how much he suffered. lf he had known that Toàn was a[br]crush, it would have been different.
We should ask Kiên[br]to stop looking.
-What to you think?[br]-Liên's right. He must stop.
He'll be disappointed.
Here come the snails.
Bring us some napkins.
Please, Suong.
Liên, Toàn wants something.
-l'll go see.[br]-Toàn has the worst name on earth. l find Guôc so proper, so perfect,[br]he's almost bland. lt 's as if every desire[br]had deserted his body.
Some live out[br]their fantasies.
Others, like me, are content[br]to write about them.
But Quôc is 1OO% fantasy free.[br]Not an ounce of imagination.
Anyway, Suong told me[br]that she's not satisfied.
How do you mean?
You know.
-l'm not surprised.[br]-Don't show off.
You've got work to do[br]in that department.
How annoying.[br]You moved it.
-Should l put it back?[br]-Absolutely not!
Just when did you[br]get in my bed? ln the middle of the night,[br]l was cold.
Nest time, l'll[br]chuck you on the floor.
You know you'd[br]never do that.
Because of you, l fell[br]out of bed this morning.
Forgive me, big brother. lt 's not nice to fall[br]off of bed.
Oh, poor you...
What do you want to eat?[br]Sticky rice?
Excuse me? Two portions for[br]my brother and one for me.
Daddy's going away.[br]He'll be back in a few days.
See Daddy over there?
-When is Quôc coming back?[br]-ln two weeks.
The radio says it will rain.[br]What do you think?
Yes, it looks like it.
Little Mouse! l gave an errand this afternoon,[br]l'll be back around 5 o'clock. l'm pregnant. ls that right?[br]Are you sure? lt 's strange. All of a sudden,[br]l'm exhausted. l think l'll take a nap.
You go sleep.[br]l'll wake you up for lunch.
You're white as a sheet.
Remember the last time[br]l was like this?
Yes, when l said[br]l would marry you.
Have you told your sisters?
Not yet.[br]lt 's our secret.
Let 's keep it[br]for a month or two, okay?
-Mum, can l draw?[br]-Yes, go ahead.
-Where?[br]-On the wall, if you want.
Liên...
-Yes?[br]-l'm going out now. l'll be back[br]around 5 o'clock.
Okay.
Little Mouse, come here. l want us to talk. l can't take it anymore.[br]This vow of silence... l can't stand it anymore.
We meet again.
We love each other[br]without a word. l know nothing[br]of your life now. l miss the days[br]when all we did was talk. lf you don't speak,[br]l'll go crazy. l can't stop looking[br]at your lips.
Have you noticed? l want to see them move.
You want to[br]tell me something? lf... you... speak... one... more... time... we... won't... see... each... other... ever... again.
You're serious?
Okay.[br]l'll stop talking.
But give in just once. l want you[br]to say my name.
Tuân. Say it.
Tuân. ls that the thirteenth shot?
Yes.
-Nhân, want some water?[br]-Yes, please. l could do with some food.
There's nothing to eat.
Are they biting?
Big brother Hai... turn off the alarm.
What about you? l'm smoking because[br]it 's raining. ln fact, l don't[br]really smoke.
The new painting,[br]is it Vu's self-portrait?
This place is turning[br]into a museum.
-l fell out of bed again.[br]-Oh, poor you. ln the middle of the night. l didn't hear you[br]get up this morning.
Makes sense.[br]l slept in your bed.
Oh, so that 's why.
You took up all the room in my bed.[br]l had to sleep in yours. l'm sorry.
-Will you do my nails?[br]-Bring me the file and clippers.
Good thing that it 's raining.[br]l have a scene in the rain tonight.
What type of part?
The usual. A bit part[br]that they edit out.
-Don't be silly.[br]-l'm not being silly.
This will be my 17th film.
17 tiny parts that[br]nobody notices.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself[br]and tell me what happens instead.
Okay. Here goes... l'm the heroine's[br]one night stand. l'm a mistake in her life.
A meaningless affair for her.
Nothing but the memory[br]of a farewell in the rain.
That 's the scene we're[br]shooting tonight.
-A parting in the rain?[br]-l know...
Don't tell me you've[br]seen it a hundred times.
-That would be true.[br]-No.
-lt 's lovely a farewell in the rain.[br]-You think so?
Yes, l mean it.[br]l really think so.
-l want to play the scene with you.[br]-l haven't finished your nails. lt doesn't matter.[br]We'll do it later.
So you're my[br]one night stand.
A mistake in my life.[br]So, what are my lines?
-You don't say anything.[br]-And you? l don't speak either.[br]There's no dialogue.
Then what does it say[br]in the script?
You have your back to me,[br]you look ahead of you.
No, you look down. l pull you by the arm, you turn[br]around and we look at each other.
Okay. Wait. l'm ready. l'm ready. l'm hungry. The rain gives me[br]a taste for boiled sweet potatoes.
You know... l'm having trouble[br]ending my novel.
Finding out about your mother's[br]Toàn would do me good. lt would take me[br]away from the book... so l'd return with[br]a fresh outlook. l think it 's a good idea.
What do you say? l'll only be in Saigon[br]for a week.
Your nails are too long.[br]l'll cut them for you.
Don't worry. Mùi and[br]Auntie Mai will manage.
But there are a lot[br]of customers in the café. l told Mùi to call[br]if she needs help. lt 's getting in my eyes. l've finished your nails.
-Little Mouse, do you want some chè?[br]-Yes, some chè.
-What are you doing in the rain?[br]-Looking for Hoà. Have you seen him?
He wasn't in the class.[br]Did you try his place?
-Yes.[br]-And Café Quynh? He could be there.
-Thanks. ls Café Quynh that way?[br]-l'll take you.
-Ah, Ninh. Hello.[br]-Liên.
-How are you?[br]-l'm looking for Hoà.
-Want to come in?[br]-l'm too wet. Have you seen Hoà?
-Did you try his place?[br]-Yes, an hour ago.
With this rain, if you don't[br]find him at his place...
...you should go home.[br]-Thanks... but l'll wait outside his place.[br]You never know.
-Bye.[br]-Bye.
Did Liên leave?
She's still downstairs.
Listen, Hoà, l'm warning you,[br]l won't help you anymore. l think it stinks.[br]Liên doesn't deserve it.
-What did she do to you?[br]-l don't know.
Just a feeling. l'm older than she is.
But she seems more[br]mature than me. l still don't follow you.
You're my best friend. l'm not ashamed[br]to tell you. l think she dominates me.
You're an idiot!
Just now, l asked Liên to come in.[br]Luckily, she refused.
Hoà heard you were waiting here.[br]He's busy, he can't make it.
He'll meet you tomorrow.[br]Three o'clock at the Café Quynh.
Thanks, Nghia.[br]Three o'clock tomorrow, then.
-That 's right. Bye, Liên.[br]-Yes, thanks.
Let 's go, Liên.
Hai, let 's go this way.
-Give me some.[br]-Dream on!
Hai, look.[br]You didn't believe me.
They think we're a couple.
Big brother, l'm so sleepy.
We'll go home[br]when it lets up.
That 's lucky! Cyclo!
No one lives here?
No, not a soul.
This place would suit me.
Not me, it 's too sad. l don't think so.
One should live where one's[br]soul is in harmony.
Where it is in accord[br]with its surroundings.
Harmony can sometimes[br]be a consolation. l didn't realize[br]you were so unhappy. l know that living here[br]isn't the solution.
Right now, l'm torn[br]between two places... that pull me[br]with equal force. lf l choose one place... even temporarily... l feel guilty toward[br]the other one.
With time,[br]a guilty conscience... turns into sadness. l'm sorry that[br]l can't help you.
What do you do when[br]sadness overwhelms you? l go down to the village to look for[br]a woman and l snuggle up to her.
One of them is sweet[br]and she likes me a lot.
When l'm sad[br]l send for her... and l lie down beside her.
That warm, damp flesh... those soft hairs...
All of a sudden... a terrible pain[br]crosses my chest.
Then l thank heaven[br]and l fall asleep. lf l have the bad luck[br]to wake in the night... and find her at my side... the sadness l feel then,[br]nothing can make it go away.
Fllght VN 183 from Hanol... to Ho Chl Mlnh City.
Fllght tlme ls[br]one hour and 45 mlnutes.
We wlsh you[br]a pleasant fllght.
This is Bui Kim Ngân.[br]Did you reserve room 324 for me?
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Daddy!
Daddy!
Don't move a muscle. l'm going back to Hanoi tomorrow.[br]l must speak to Suong.
Are you sure it 's the[br]right thing to do? l don't know, but l must. l don't want to stop you.
For four years... l've held my breath.
Both here and in Hanoi.
The burden on your heart... l'm afraid of losing the moments[br]when we are together. l must speak to Suong.
Then leave tomorrow.
But don't promise[br]me anything. l'll wait for you. lf you come back... it will make me happy.
Kiên!
Hiên? lt 's been ages!
Big sister... can l ask you a question?
Yes. lt 's very important to me.
So please answer even if it 's[br]an indiscreet question.
Okay, go ahead.
Has the... idea of cheating on Quôc[br]ever crossed your mind?
Why do you ask me that?
Just because. l was wondering under what[br]circumstances the thought might arise.
Does it bother you to answer?
Does it?
No... it doesn't bother me.
The idea of cheating on Quôc[br]occurred to me once. lt all started[br]4 years ago... or 2 years after[br]we married. l can tell you now. l was two months pregnant.
Only Quôc knew.
We decided... to keep it a secret... and only to tell you when[br]l was in my third month.
That 's why you never knew.
Quôc was away on business,[br]and l miscarried.
He came home immediately.
And something[br]in him had changed. lt was as if his life[br]were on hold. l couldn't get[br]through to him.
And our marriage suffered.
Later, after[br]Little Mouse was born... the situation[br]hadn't improved.
That 's just when...[br]he appeared. lt was one morning... very early.
As soon as he entered the café,[br]l felt a fondness for him. lt was a pleasure[br]to wait on him. l told myself... that l wanted him to love me.
And then?
And then, we met elsewhere.
He told me he loved me.[br]And it was true.
Did you and he[br]have a thing together?
No, obviously not.
A few kisses.[br]A few cuddles, that 's all.
That 's all.[br]What do you mean?
He went back to Saigon.
He was a businessman.
He came to Hanoi... to set up a branch office.
When the work[br]was done, he left... because l told him... that our relationship[br]had no future.
Do you still[br]think about him?
Yes.
His name was Tuàn.
Right... let 's go to sleep.
Thank you, big sister.
This time,[br]you got into my bed.
You lie. You got[br]into mine first. l had to take yours.[br]And then you came back.
That 's how it happened.
-l don't remember a thing.[br]-l remember too well.
Sometimes l wonder if it isn't[br]time you got married. l'm not kidding.[br]You're old enough. lt 's not a bad idea.
First of all,[br]l'd have to find a man.
My ideal would be[br]someone like you... because you're[br]good like Dad.
You really think[br]l'm like him?
Yes, of course.[br]l know you too well.
The problem is to find[br]someone who is like you.
But what will you do[br]once l'm married?
Who'll wash your clothes?
Who'll make your meals? lf that 's what worries you,[br]l'll manage. l'll do even[br]better than that.
At least l won't have to look[br]at your stained panties... next to my clean shirts[br]when you have your period.
So ungrateful!
You're horrid![br]Baboon face!
Come and dance with me.
Suong, Quôc is back.[br]He's upstairs.
-l'll go up. Can you manage?[br]-Yes, Khan will help me. Go ahead.
-Quôc is upstairs.[br]-l know. Liên told me.
Have you been back long?
Half an hour.
Do you want something to eat?
No.
Liên gave me some fruit. l wasn't expecting you[br]for four more days.
What 's going on?
You're back?
-What are you doing?[br]-l'm washing up and going up to bed. l'm knackered.
-Did you work late, last night?[br]-Worse than that. l worked until dawn. l put away my pen[br]and went to the airport.
Oh, poor darling!
Do you like to kiss me?
So, you finished your novel?
That 's wonderful! You've been[br]stuck for two months.
And, presto...[br]ln two days, it 's done!
The protagonist[br]meets a woman?
Did you end it in 17[br]pages as planned?
-19.[br]-Still very close to your estimate.
-You are a real genius![br]-Not necessarily, l haven't re-read it.
Maybe when it 's edited[br]it will be 17 pages.
Show off![br]Go rest.
When you wake up, there[br]will be good things to eat.
Have you forgotten[br]to tell me anything?
Hiên called me.[br]She told me everything.
What you ate,[br]what you drank... what you talked about.
-l'm very annoyed.[br]-Why? lt appears that you talked[br]about the good old days.
But that 's not why[br]l'm mad at you. l'm mad because you told[br]Hiên that l'm pregnant... when we agreed that[br]it would be our secret.
Forgive me, l was tactless. lt 's okay. Go to sleep. l'm going to tell my sisters[br]in a little while.
We've talked all night. l've told you everything. l'm going back soon[br]to finish my work. l want to know[br]what you've decided.
For a long time... l've known you had a child[br]with another woman. l went through your things[br]and it was easy to figure out. ln the photos you brought[br]back from your trips... l watched the child grow up[br]as if l had raised him. ln everything you've said... the only thing that[br]matters to me... is that you can't love me anymore[br]because of your dishonesty. l'm not asking you to give up[br]this woman and your son. l know... that you love them[br]as much as us. ln a few days, when you return,[br]we'll start our life again.
Here's what l hope for. l am your wife. l expect you to love me better[br]than you have loved me. l want you to be[br]the man l knew... before we were married.
That 's all.
-Khanh, can you help me?[br]-Yes, l'm just back from the market. l wanted to tell you... l'm pregnant.
How's that? l'm pregnant. l forbid you to smile![br]lt 's serious, you know.
Whose it is? l won't play guessing[br]games with you.
Say it! Whose is it?
His name won't mean anything[br]to you. You don't know him.
He's married[br]with kids, is that it?
-What does he do?[br]-Studies architecture.
He knows you're pregnant?
Yes. l just told him.
Unmarried and pregnant!
When the baby arrives,[br]what will you two do?
-Me and my baby?[br]-Who said anything about the baby?
He's not born yet!
-l meant the other one.[br]-We haven't decided anything.
Which means what, exactly?
Why don't you say something?
Talk some sense into her!
Khanh... don't cry. l'm happy, you know. l know it might[br]look terrible to you.
But l'm confident... everything's going to be okay.
Khanh, instead of blubbering,[br]reason with her.
What am l supposed to say[br]when l'm pregnant myself?
And l suspect that[br]Kiên cheated on me in Saigon.
Enough! l'm through crying.
Khanh, how do you know[br]you're pregnant?
What 's that?
How can you tell[br]when you're pregnant?
So what makes you[br]think you are?
Because... two weeks ago... he and l... we did...
-Was it the first time?[br]-Yes, and the only one.
So what did you do?
Well, first, he put...
What did he do?
-He kind of put...[br]-What? l don't know how to say it.
Right, that 's it. Tell me.[br]When you had your last period?
A week ago.
Tell me if l've got[br]this straight.
Two weeks ago, you[br]and he did something.
And a week ago,[br]you got your period?
Yes.
Good Lord!
So, does that mean[br]l'm pregnant?
What an idiot![br]lt 's not complicated!
This girl is really thick!
We're going to have fun.
Today, my sisters and l are[br]doing everything ourselves.
The memorial dishes and[br]the meal for 3O guests.
Quôc and Kiên[br]will lend a hand.
You're excused[br]for reasons of incompetence.
Why is the anniversary[br]of a death so important?
We didn't celebrate Dad's[br]birthday while he lived. lt was the same for Mum.[br]When it was their birthday... all we said was:[br]''Oh, it 's your birthday.''
And that was all.
Look! This one's a male!
- You don't want any? Have some.
- I don't want any.
- Come on, try it! - I don't want.
- Delicious! - Eat it up, then.
It's Cefalo!
Strip!
Grab him!
- Come here...
- You bastard!
Where are you going?
Get lost! You little shits!
You bastards!
Go and wash.
Stop it!
- Leave me alone!
- Don't fight!
You're hurting me!
- I'll kill you!
- Pasquale, leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
Close it, the sun's too bright.
You leave me alone as well.
- Are you okay?
- Go away.
What the hell do you call this?
Shut up and eat.
- What are you staring at?
- I can't stare?
What's that get-up?
- Where are you going?
- To Paris.
That's not true, she's off to Via Roma.
We're going there too.
Isn't that Alessandra?
- Shall we go?
- Come on.
- Alessandra?
- Teresa?
- Have you cut your hair?
- Yes. - It suits you.
Coming for a walk?
- Can you draw? -Yes.
- Can you draw gulls?
- Can you draw one for me?
- Where? - Here, on my chest.
- You want a big one?
- Yes.
- And me!
- And me too!
I want a nice white one.
Do me a nice tattoo.
- Hey! The gull's all bald!
- Shut up! Get out of here!
- We're bored shitless here.
- Shut up!
Want to go someplace?
- You're beautiful.
- Thank you.
- Want to kiss me?
- No.
Kiss you? You never wash!
She'll never kiss you!
- Alessandra! Teresa!
- We're coming!
You're leaving?
Giovanna!
Wash them properly!
Morning everyone!
- What d'you want? - Are you done? - No. What's in the bag?
Food for the dogs up at the fort.
Coming to the beach with me?
- Can I take him?
- Sure.
Just this once.
But we have work on tonight.
Want to go to the beach?
You go.
I don't want to see them.
Filippo, stay here.
- Brought me some wine?
- No.
- Got a cigarette?
- No.
- Your mum's staying there?
- She's fine where she is.
- Why are these dogs here?
- So we can kill them.
What are you doing?
Catch it!
- Mum, come back!
- Come back, I said!
- Put this on at least!
- Come out right now!
Come on, come back!
- Come on!
- Quick! Get out right now!
There's no one around!
Come on, sweetheart.
Let's float.
Stop it!
Float.
Let's go!
Get my bra!
What about the dogs?
- Here!
- Catch!
- What do you want? -A ball.
- How many fish? - Three.
Three fish, that's not enough.
- You can pick a ticket.
- What's the prize?
- An electric train.
- Okay, let's play!
Give me your fish.
Signora, that's not fair!
We never win anything!
Fish stealer!
Come on, move it!
Three, four...
Hello.
That's enough. See to the ice!
C'mon, wake up!
Okay, wash out the stern!
That's for the show your mum gave on the beach.
Take her home.
I don't want to see her.
Come on, climb on!
- Let's go home. -Why?
- He saw us on the beach. Come on.
Why can't I go on the boat with the others?
Grazia!
Look...
What are you trying to do?
Cut it out.
Did you catch anything?
- Why?
- Pasquale, come on!
Help me!
- What? There's nothing to see!
- Wait!
Pasquale, come here, okay.
Wait!
- I want to come...
- Drink up. What's the matter?
Wait!
Everything's okay.
The wine, Filippo.
- What's for after?
- The pasta's good.
Good evening!
Come on, we need to talk.
Look what Pasquale has done to Vito's eye.
- He did that? - Ten against three. - Ten against three?
This can't go on!
You have to do something!
Look, he almost lost an eye!
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm the one who's sorry!
- Calm down.
- Why should I?
Wait a second, we'll sort it out.
Wait right there.
Come here, you.
Look what you did!
Go on, get revenge!
- You punish him. - Me?
- Yes. You have to punish your son.
No problem.
It's not difficult. You do it!
- Enough, Vito!
- You want to hit him too?
- That's enough.
- Are you sure? -We're quits now.
- Let's have a coffee. - Forget it.
- No, come on. - There's no need.
- Grazia, where's that coffee?
- What a bastard, telling him...
Marinella! Get her shot!
Calm down!
I'm sorry.
Hold her!
Go outside, kids.
Get out.
- Filippo, go on. - No.
- Filippo, go! - No.
Filippo, get out!
I'm here. It's all over now.
Antonietta!
What is it?
How is the institute in Milan where your brother-in-law works?
They're specialists...
Is it for Grazia? What's wrong?
You know... Either she's too happy or she's too sad.
We don't know how to help her.
- She's aggressive or affectionate for no reason. - She drives us mad.
- She's always been that way.
- It's getting worse.
- What do you say? - Nothing.
What d'you expect me to say?
- Can I go now?
- Yes, go home.
- You're so good-looking!
- Sure!
You're so strong!
What'll you do with those arms?
I'll build you a house by the sea.
Pasquale, take the dog out.
The door!
Is it a present?
Do you like it?
Hello, signorina.
Your identity papers, please.
They're at home.
You're driving with two passengers and you don't have your papers?
- Are you new here?
- I started yesterday.
- Welcome!
- Thank you.
This time... I'll turn a blind eye.
But one of you has to get off.
How will I look otherwise?
- Get off, Filippo.
- Why me?
You don't scare me with your gun!
Goddam cop!
We told you to get off!
Sorry.
- It's okay.
- Thanks. - Okay, you can go.
You're off to Milan?
- You're talking to me?
- Yes.
You're off on a trip, you lucky girl!
- Me? Who told you that?
- Antonietta, the pharmacist.
- Yes, she told me too.
- I'm staying put.
You're seeing her brother-in-law at the institute.
Drop it.
She told you she's not going!
I wouldn't mind someone taking care of me either.
- What are you talking about, blockhead? - Blockhead? Me?
Me, a blockhead?
You think you're a star or what?
Drop it, bitch!
- Coming into town with us?
- I stink. I need a shower first.
Let's go.
- Stop!
- No, I stink too much.
Start the siren!
Start it, okay?
Calm down.
- That's enough now!
- Go slowly!
They're behind us! Run!
- Watch the girl!
- I saw her. Calm down!
Move it!
What the hell?
I'm washing everything.
Come on.
Wait for me here.
Anyone home?
Come in!
- I'll come back...
- Can I help you?
Here you are. Good evening.
- Why did you run off?
- I can't tell you why.
What's wrong?
Everything's okay?
What do you want?
How about a coffee?
Don't put yourself out. Thank you.
Excuse me. Goodbye.
Almost ready.
Tonight, we'll have pasta with sea urchin sauce.
Cefalo!
Bastards!
Pasquale!
Here's the oil.
We'll soon have them out.
You'll see.
- Rub it on...
- Gently.
- We add potatoes?
- Yes, potatoes!
And cucumber!
Perfect!
- That will clear it up.
- A miracle cure!
I feel a bit sleepy...
Me too.
- Sleep? The hell they will!
- Mind your own business!
Don't move.
Okay, you wimps?
Got a cigarette?
And a light?
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Well?
- He gave me a smoke.
- Is that all? -Yes.
Get up, Filippo. Come on.
Where are we going?
Calamari...
Red mullet...
Sardine...
Octopus...
Bream...
Scorpion fish...
Bream...
Here comes the fish! Look!
They're all mine, all these fish!
Signora, I want to bet them all!
All of them!
- I'll let you have five tries for those fish. - Okay.
Take five of them.
Well... Let's see...
Three...
Four...
Signora, I've won! Look!
- Which one do you want?
- That one! -Go on, take it.
It's beautiful!
You're going to break it!
- Just a second!
- Let him play.
I'm putting it together so he can play.
If you want to see the train, wait outside!
Get out.
I'll call you one at a time.
- Look! It's beautiful!
- Leave me the rails!
Out of the way!
The curves... Wait!
Let me see!
It's beautiful!
- It's mine. -And mine too.
- No, it's mine. -And mine.
- Why?
- Because!
Come on, the train's ready.
- Is it carnival time or what?
- Yes, it is.
Look at this!
Get rid of it!
Want some make-up too? You'd look cute with a bit of rouge.
Leave my son alone!
Go and get washed too!
A zabbaro!
What the hell are you doing?
Move your asses!
Get as much as possible!
Marinella!
With that cop again!
Come on, let's follow them!
Beautiful, huh?
- Who's this?
- My brother.
What're you doing?
- Don't look at me like that!
- Get lost. -Why?
- I want to be alone.
- You can't stay here.
- No, I want to stay here!
- You're coming home with me, okay.
- She doesn't want to.
- What's up with you?
Who do you think you are?
Who the hell are you?
- She's my sister!
- I don't understand your accent.
- What did he say?
- Cut it out!
- Filippo! Take her away!
- If I come down, you're dead!
What's the cop want?
Are you still here?
- Let's split. - Get out of here!
- You're coming with me. Right now.
- You realize what you're doing?
- Get home, I told you.
- Leave her!
- What's up with you?
You want trouble?
I'll slaughter you!
Out of the way!
Get home, I told you!
- Are you happy now?
- Shut up or else...
Out of the way!
- You joker! Think you're Rambo?
- Why don't you go?
- They're waiting. Go.
- No one's waiting for me.
- Get lost...
- What did he say? Asshole!
- We had to fish deep. - Deep?
- There's nothing left to catch.
- The trawlers aren't pleased!
- You said it.
They're destroying the seabed.
The children won with those four fish...
They're playing with their train.
What?
Coming with me?
Can't you see I'm talking?
- Maybe near the lighthouse...
- No, not even...
Cheers!
Let's drink!
What do you want?
Well...?
We're going out again tonight.
You have nothing to do?
Hold this for me.
Do me a favour.
Let me have a drink alone with my friends.
Here, forget about it...
So, fishing...
What was I saying?
- The fish you gave the children...
- Filippo won a train.
Come on, faster!
Pasquale!
Come on.
The dog's on the bed again.
Take her. Put her out!
You're not going to bed?
- I want to tie her up first.
- There's no need.
I'll wait outside.
- Tie her up.
- What for?
- There are too many mean dogs!
- What're you going to do?
She won't stop growling.
She'll end up biting someone.
Tie her up, okay!
Let's go!
Pastora?
Hello!
- You're leaving?
- We're going for a ride.
- With the sails?
- Yes, with the sails!
- Where are you from?
- France!
- Paris?
- No, not Paris.
Can I come?
Be our guest.
- Will we be back late?
- In a few hours.
- He's Gérard. I'm Olivier.
- Grazia, delighted.
- Where're you going?
- For a sail!
- Are you looking for trouble?
- Get off!
- Come along too!
- Don't do it!
- You come too!
- What? Us too?
- Where're you going?
- For a sail.
No, mum, you can't stay here!
Filippo... Pasquale.
What's your problem? Come on!
We're going!
Let's go.
What the hell's going on?
Get off there!
Get off!
Move it! Come on!
- Get off the damn boat!
- Pietro!
- Get off that boat!
- All right.
Get out of here!
I'm getting off!
Right now!
I'll bleed him!
Where did you come from?
The way he talks!
You killed my dog!
I'll smash your face in!
Cuckold!
Where's my wife? Where is she?
What are you doing?
Get out!
Come on, you're free!
Off you go!
Look at them run!
She's a public menace.
The cops ought to take her away in handcuffs.
It's high time she left for Milan.
We can't have a woman like her around here.
- She's nothing but a troublemaker.
- She's a raving lunatic.
- What do you expect? She's a mess. -And she takes it out on us.
Grazia, come out here.
We need to talk.
- About what?
- Sit down.
If you don't tell her, I will.
There's a doctor in Milan who can help you.
We've already called him.
Help me doing what?
We can't go on living like this.
You have to go. Be reasonable.
I'm not moving from here.
You're going to Milan and that's final!
- I'll kill myself.
- Calm down.
Don't tell me to calm down!
You're the one who should leave!
- Get out of my house!
- Marinella, her shot!
- Get out!
- Her shot! Give her the shot!
I'll see to it. Just go away!
- It's always the same.
- Mum! Will you please get out?
Sleep with me.
Where's your mother?
Go and find her.
Where are you going?
Pasquale, go away!
- Don't tell anyone you saw me!
- Where are you going?
I won't go to Milan!
I know a place where you can hide.
- Where?
- Come with me.
Come on.
Sit down.
- Whose stuff is this?
- It's mine.
- You can drink the water.
- Really?
Nice and cool.
- What do you do when you come here? - Nothing much.
I mend fishing rods...
I make catapults...
I sit in the shade.
Lie down.
You have to stay calm.
Don't think of anyone else.
You're going to do what I say.
Here's Pasquale.
- Well?
- No sign of her.
What are you doing in here?
Shall we throw those old gossips out? I can't stand them anymore.
- Get out, Filippo. -Why?
- Because. Get the hell out!
Did you find her?
Where did you look?
At the Point and the Sun Tree.
Keep looking, we'll check over there.
Everyone's looking for you.
You'll never make it.
I will. You'll see.
- Swear it.
- I swear. - On my head.
What's wrong?
Put this on.
- It'll get dirty...
- Don't worry about it.
Thank you.
You're leaving?
I'll be back tomorrow.
Want to eat?
Some fish?
- Give me a kiss.
- You swore.
Eat, Filippo.
- Where's mum?
- Eat, it'll get cold.
- Where is she? - In Milan. -When will she be back? - Tomorrow. Eat.
Go home!
Still here?
It's like talking to a brick wall!
- I don't believe it!
- Shut up and eat.
We'll help you find her.
Thanks.
Come on, lads, let's go!
Come on, Pino.
- Dad, where are you going?
- There are caves here. I'll check.
Grazia!
They've found her!
Pasquale, go home now.
What's wrong?
- Is everything okay?
- It's okay.
Are you all right?
- What have you brought me?
- Fish.
It stinks!
- What's happening at home?
- Nothing.
- Marinella and Filippo?
- They're fine.
No one's asked about me?
Have you rested?
- I need to wash.
- Go down to the sea.
What do you want to eat tonight?
Chicken.
I have to go.
Drink, Pietro.
- Drink!
- I'll drink.
Go on home now.
Go on.
- What's wrong with him? He won't wake! - Let's take him home.
Dad's here. Come on!
Slowly! Stand aside!
Help me, Pino.
What did he say?
He's talking to the hens.
He's calling the hens!
He won't wake up!
- What did he say?
- He's speaking about a hen.
A hen?
- Come here! - Out of the way.
Are you scared of hens or what?
There, what do you want to do?
Here you go!
I got your hen for you.
Are you okay?
I can't stand this anymore!
Where's your dad? Has he forgotten me? He's stopped looking?
He's stopped looking.
He thinks you're dead.
Me? Dead?
Everyone's mourning.
- You're a saint now.
- What are you saying? -A saint!
What the hell are you saying?
- Speak!
You can't just lie there.
Let's go hunting.
Shall we go rabbit hunting?
Tonight is San Bartolo's feast!
Down here.
- Get the rope ready.
- Let Pino go!
- No, I'm going down.
- Let me do it.
No, you'll wait. You asked me to come along so I'm going!
Slack!
Slack!
Give it a pull.
Let me down, you idiots! Slack!
Give me some slack!
Why did you bring me up?
I want to go back!
- I have to go down!
Grazia's there! - Grazia?
- It's Grazia! Lower me down!
- What are you talking about?
I saw my wife!
She's down there! Let me go!
We have to go down to her!
Let me go!
Pietro!
Forgive me.
I'm falling at your feet...
...blinded by admiration!
Mr. Minister....
I mean it. I'm pleased to meet you.
I can't say I saw the film.
Really?
I only saw you. The film can wait.
You light up troubled times.
Did it shock you?
Lord, no! It's what we need.
A little escapism.
And with you around, all our worries fade.
Will there be a war?
Please! People ask me that
1 00 times a day.
Not you....
Not tonight!
See you Thursday!
Viviane!
-Go away!
-Listen!
You can tell them what you like!
Mr. Auger! Phone!
It's you.
How did you get my number?
You called her in Dijon?
She must have wondered.
Can I what?
Slow down, I don't understand.
It's late. Why not tomorrow morning?
I am pleased. What's going on?
I'm pleased, I said. Just calm down.
I don't have your address.
Just a second.
Let me note it.
Where have you been?
I was worried. Come in.
Are you cold? You're shivering.
-It's emotion.
-At seeing me again?
It's been a long time.
Nice place.
It's not finished.
I saw it in a magazine, but--
Keep it on.
We're not staying in?
What, then?
Come on.
What's wrong, Viviane?
What's happened?
That.
-Is he...?
-Yes, he fell.
From up there?
-You were down here?
-No, up there.
Did you...?
No, I didn't! He slipped.
He just fell?
-I slapped him.
-Why?
He was drunk. He pounced on me.
What can we do?
What do you mean?
Stop!
Don't touch anything!
I'll call the police.
Not the police!
Let me handle it.
-It's an accident!
-Who'd believe that?
It was self-defense! He slipped.
Honestly, Frédéric, can't you imagine the scandal?
The papers will only hound me with it.
Think of my new film!
-Try to calm down.
-Leave me.
I was wrong. I thought you could--
I don't know--
That you'd help me.
-What did he do?
-Who?
-Him!
-Business.
-What kind?
-All kinds.
He backed Midnight Ball.
You saw it?
-Of course.
-Put him down!
-Did you like it?
-What?
The film.
Sort of.
-Did I sing well?
-Very well.
I was dubbed.
I'm so pleased you couldn't tell.
-What do you want?
-His car keys.
-He's bleeding.
-He fell.
Come on.
-It's a river?
-No, a canal.
-Is it deep?
-Don't worry.
-Want me to come?
-No, go back inside.
Clean everything up!
I'll call you tomorrow.
-I knew it.
-What?
That you'd help.
You'd forgotten me.
Forgotten?
You never got in touch.
Your life was too crowded.
WAR OR PEACE?
PEACE AT STAKE
THE MYSTERIOUS DEATH
OF ANDRÉ ARPEL
Please don't get up.
Forgive me.
It's hard to reach you.
Yes, these days....
What is it?
You seem tired.
Are events worrying you?
No, it's not that.
Can I confide in you?
You said such kind things to me.
Please do.
Did you know André Arpel?
He's dead.
I know.
I knew him long ago.
Perhaps you heard?
I'd stopped seeing him.
Now the police want to see me next week, but I won't go.
Are you listening?
Why won't you go?
Can you imagine the papers?
They have bigger concerns.
You don't know them.
I don't?
Why are you here?
I refuse to see the police.
I'm not the police chief.
You could call him.
Perhaps. I'll think about it.
Jeanne Lanvin.
I'm sorry?
Your perfume.
Yes, Scandal.
I'm very fond of it.
You could call him now.
-Who?
-The police chief.
I can't just now, but I will. I promise.
I don't know why you're so worried over nothing.
Didn't they arrest his killer?
Mr. Auger? I'm Vouriot, your court-appointed lawyer.
I can't take care of you now.
I've been called up.
-I leave tomorrow.
-But who--?
I'll be back soon.
It'll all be over in three weeks.
Not even Hitler wants war.
He'll make peace, you'll see.
So behave. You're better off here.
Seen the magistrate?
Of course.
Things are all over the place.
I've read your statement.
We'll see about that later.
So you stole the car?
Not knowing the owner was in the trunk?
Tell the police what you like...
...but be straight with me or get another lawyer.
What did you do with the gun?
What gun?
That fellow, Arpel, had been shot.
You didn't know that?
A few months later....
Everybody out.
-What's up?
-We're leaving.
-What's going on?
-The Germans are coming!
-Where are they?
-A day away. Want to wait?
-Cut it out!
-Do you mind?
Any idea where they're taking us?
Down South. Where else?
We won't be alone on the roads.
This'll be fun.
Come on.
What are you doing?
Shut up!
Your turn.
Don't stay here!
Bloody thing!
June 1 4, 1 940
Who?
Viviane Denvert?
No, she's not here.
There's no one left, no films, nothing.
What?
I don't know, sir, probably in Bordeaux.
They've all fled there, all the upper crust.
I'm staying here.
I'm learning German.
Your papers!
Are you crazy?
Just a bit of fun.
How come you're here?
I got the last train too.
-Going to Bordeaux?
-You too?
You bet.
That's where it's all happening.
How did you get away?
I'll tell you later. Come on.
Here. I couldn't find a glass.
That's all right.
Blimey! You needed that.
This is a friend, Mr....
Auger.
Mr. Auger.
She's at the Collège de France.
-Don't say that!
-It's not true?
Look, no one cares.
What did I say?
She gets off in Angoulême.
Too bad.
You'll catch your death here.
I'm all right.
The nuns can give you a seat.
I'll say you're ill.
I'm not ill.
-It's absurd.
-I'll be back.
Is your friend always like that?
You know him well?
Not very well. He did me a favor.
Must be a habit.
He just can't help himself.
Do you want to sit down?
You're at the Collège de France?
I'm just an assistant.
In a physics lab.
What do you do?
I've done a lot of things.
Like what?
I started out as a--
Well, I was in a--
But that didn't last long. Then l--
You weren't called up?
No, I was....
I was away, that's why.
Where were you?
-Abroad?
-Abroad, yes.
It took a while to get back.
I had to find a boat.
Professor!
Wait!
You'll hurt yourself.
Camille! We thought you'd never get here.
It kept stopping.
I almost went mad.
-How are you, Mr. Girard?
-I'm all right.
We'll meet again?
Where's the Collège de France?
You have all the papers?
I took everything I found in the lab.
Your attention, please.
Following an air raid...
...traffic is suspended until further notice.
Would all passengers please leave the train.
My case! Get my case!
-How will you manage in England?
-I'll see.
No one's expecting you.
I have friends there.
I must leave France, Camille, my dear.
The Germans will be here in a week or even sooner.
What?
You took them?
Yes, it was safer that way.
But the trucks....
I didn't quite trust them.
-When does the boat leave?
-Tomorrow.
Are you going too?
No, I can't. Because of Mother.
Broken hips are tricky.
I haven't heard from her.
Going to Bordeaux, by any chance?
Don't worry.
They've been so helpful.
Where are they from? Paris?
I think so.
Don't touch, gentlemen!
She's asleep, sir.
Oh, no! For pity's sake!
It's late. You have to get up.
I didn't sleep a wink.
This place is so noisy.
I know. No one slept a wink.
The president and the government have arrived.
I had to work all night.
Poor Jean-Etienne.
I have to go.
Go later. Get some sleep now.
The cabinet's convening.
Think of an excuse. Send a note.
You can barely stand.
-I saw the de Lusses.
-They're here?
They had to sleep in their car.
You're joking!
Go and see.
They're parked outside.
1 27, please.
Beaufort here.
Did you reach the command? Who?
And?
Jacqueline, sleeping in the street!
I must tell everybody.
I'm on my way.
What's wrong?
They've reached Orléans.
Already?
Darling!
I'm half-dead!
You've no idea what Albert and I have been through.
Not just the exhaustion, but the humiliation.
They're monsters here.
Know where I slept?
Not in the car?
Still, it's good to know you have a room.
-Want to take a bath?
-Later.
I have to eat something, or I'm going to faint.
Shall I come with you?
Twin beds, remember.
Look, it's not a travel agency.
Albert claims I'm restless, but no man ever complained before.
What is it?
Alex!
Viviane.
Did they give you my note last night?
Yes, but I can't.
-You're not free?
-Not for dinner.
Lunch, then?
It's not easy.
Surely we can have a drink?
Maybe. I'll let you know.
I hoped it would be easier to see you down here.
I'm not a minister.
But that could be a blessing right now.
-Still following you.
-His paper sent him.
-He's mad about you.
-Honestly!
He even said so at the Gramonts'.
That you embodied French grace.
His meaning was clear.
We have to leave.
For the colonies?
Why not? We're trapped here.
Move the government to Senegal?
Be reasonable, Brémond.
-The war is lost.
-Not yet.
I'm afraid it is.
All we can do is ask for an armistice.
Reynaud won't.
Let him resign. The marshal's ready.
-It will take a vote.
-Who'd oppose it?
Two men will.
Who?
-Oh, yes, of course.
-Who?
Mandel and that de Gaulle.
Turn left!
We're already late!
Watch it!
Did you see that?
There's nothing on Monnet.
Where are you going?
It's not the way!
Weygand should change points six and nine.
Let me out!
What's wrong?
-I have to buy something.
-Not now!
I won't be long.
Can I help you?
Do you have any...?
I'd like some gloves.
Leather or wool?
I don't know. Leather.
What size?
Could I see your hand?
That looks like a seven.
What color?
The same.
-White?
-That's right.
-They freed you?
-I escaped.
They emptied all the prisons.
You have to hide.
Why? No one cares now.
-I have these.
-I'll take them.
Which ones?
You shot him!
-Arpel. You shot him.
-Stop it!
What did you lie to me for?
Shut up! I'll explain.
Don't move!
Viviane, what are you doing?
It's not bad, is it?
Not bad. Let's go!
How much do I owe you?
With the hat as well?
Sometimes I wonder if you realize....
Isn't that...?
What's her name again?
Viviane Denvert.
That's it, Viviane Denvert.
You know her?
You know her so-so, or you know her?
I know her, okay.
You devil! I get it now.
Why you came all this way.
So who's he?
Don't you recognize him?
Mr. Beaufort, the minister.
They make a lovely couple, don't they?
Calm down, children!
Not in the house!
The town hall's sending more mattresses.
We're used to refugees in Bordeaux.
First in 1 870...
...then in 1 91 4.
I only have my son's room left.
He's on the road somewhere.
-My bedspread!
-Sorry!
-Can I make a call?
-Locally?
Yes, I'll pay. Don't worry.
The phone's in my room.
Maurice, it's me.
Yes, pal, I'm here.
I'll tell you all about it.
Who?
Really? When did they get here?
Auger!
Hold on, Maurice.
Wait! What's the big rush?
You don't know where she is!
I'll find the place.
What are you after?
The government!
We're jam-packed!
That's all there is to it!
I wired you two days ago!
Me too, three days ago!
I'm the Countess Roberti.
I'm sorry.
-Get me the manager.
-He's ill.
You have fifth-floor rooms.
-They're staff rooms.
-They'll do!
They're for the senators.
-Miss Denvert.
-She's out.
-Will she...?
-I can't say, sir.
It's all the leftists' fault.
I knew the whole thing would end in disaster.
Russians in the German army raped women in Belgium.
Why are you here?
For the professor.
He hasn't left?
But the boat--
He needs official papers to get onboard.
-Where is he?
-Upstairs.
Caught up in all their red tape.
A genius like him! It's maddening!
Are you staying here?
Good.
After an hour here, I'm ashamed.
Have you heard these people?
The Germans are in Paris, and it hardly bothers them.
-Don't you care?
-I do--
No, you don't.
I have other worries. I'm sorry.
At a time like this?
You have yours.
The professor, heavy water....
You know?
You told me.
I did?
You talked about it in the car.
-Weren't you asleep?
-Not all the time.
Is it a secret? What is it exactly?
A special chemical compound.
That's all I can say.
All right.
It's the world's only heavy water.
It must reach England.
If the Germans get it, it'll be a disaster.
Really? Why?
-Am I boring you?
-Excuse me.
What's happening?
I can't say.
-We can't go on.
-I know.
-Is the war still on?
-We're deliberating.
It must end. Sue for peace!
You have a room.
Wonderful. In which hotel?
A girls' high school, actually.
Seriously?
I hear it's very comfortable.
That's it!
Albert, if I don't like it,
I'm off to Nice.
Thank you anyway.
May I have a word? Do you mind?
You're crazy!
Someone might recognize you!
-Can't we talk?
-Not now!
Jean-Etienne, meet Frédéric.
He knew my brothers in Dijon.
He lived next door.
Our little neighbor.
How long has it been now?
You haven't changed.
How do you do it?
Viviane, let's have lunch.
I'll be down in five minutes.
The military situation looks bad.
We need to talk.
Camille!
Do you have the papers?
What?
They don't seem to understand.
They're too wary to sign anything.
They'll be the death of me.
The death of me.
I know, I told you a pack of lies.
Let me speak.
He'd been harassing me.
Arpel?
He'd threatened to write to the press about me.
What for?
Some business about jewels I borrowed once.
-Who from?
-People.
-You gave them back?
-Most of them.
Really, it was so long ago!
So you shot him?
He scared me.
The gun went off in my hand.
-Whose was it?
-Mine.
And then?
I put it away.
When I saw your photo in the paper,
I almost fainted.
I couldn't even write to you.
They open prisoners' mail.
I cried and cried.
You don't believe me?
I can see you don't.
What will become of us?
Don't be afraid.
Tell them to start without me.
I have to go.
Shall I wait?
No, go! All of Paris is here!
You have a room in town?
Stay in. I'll come over.
Give me the address.
-When?
-When I can. I'm not totally free.
-I noticed. Is that new?
-What?
Beaufort. Your role supporting the republic.
Please. It's not easy.
Without Jean-Etienne....
Wait! Don't get angry. I'm sorry.
-I'll come to see you.
-At Christmas?
-Why are you like this?
-I was in jail!
And for whom? I never shot anyone!
Shut up!
Mr. Beaufort would like a word.
You left in such a rush.
Join us for lunch.
Come along.
Viviane will be delighted.
She hasn't seen you in so long.
I had a few questions for you.
Viviane can be so nebulous.
It's hard to know anything.
Was she married in Dijon?
Married? No.
She drove boys wild?
I imagine so.
What do you mean?
You lived next door.
Sit down.
Put yourself here.
We have quail today--
No, grilled fish.
I don't have much time.
-Turbot?
-Perfect.
-And for you, sir?
-The same.
You don't mind turbot?
Turbot all around.
I invited him.
You lived it up in the provinces!
What did you tell him?
Don't worry!
He's almost as discreet as you.
For you, miss?
You knew her father, the hero?
She talks about him. Don't you?
Your father.
Enlisted in 1 91 4, wounded twice, escaped three times.
He'd be surprised to see her here.
-Why?
-The atmosphere.
What does that mean?
Excuse me, I think someone....
She's looking for me.
What's the matter?
The professor needs to speak to your friend, the minister.
-He's not my friend.
-Oh, come on!
You even know the government.
No, I don't.
You have to help us. No one else can.
Sorry.
My secretary.
-Sit down.
-I'm all right.
Take my place, I'm leaving.
-You are?
-Good luck.
Are you friends?
No, not at all.
Your turbot, miss.
Mr. Auger?
You are Frédéric Auger?
I'm André Arpel's nephew.
Does André Arpel ring a bell?
You were found with his body...
...in the trunk of his car.
Aren't you in jail?
Get off my back!
Help! He's a criminal!
He killed my uncle!
Murderer!
I'm all right!
Viviane, wait!
Professor, give me a few hours.
-It sails tonight.
-We have time.
I need to speak to my colleagues.
Don't worry.
Brémond, my secretary, will stay with you.
Marseilles called--
Please!
Your little neighbor!
Bravo! A killer!
And I eat with him!
With France's future at stake!
It's outrageous!
I didn't know.
-That he killed Arpel?
-That he was here.
-You didn't know about Arpel?
-No, I thought--
You knew, and you hid it from me!
Cut the lies, Viviane!
What?
The car's downstairs.
Send it up!
No, tell the driver to come up for the files.
How can I possibly trust you?
If only you'd tell me the truth.
Just once.
I'm sure he did it for me, to protect me.
He probably went to see Arpel, and they must have fought.
He won't let anyone hurt me.
Has he killed other men?
He used to box critics who gave me bad reviews.
He got beaten up once too.
Very touching, but this is no time for tears.
Where is he staying?
I have no idea.
I'll get the police to find him.
-Did you find her?
-Who?
Her!
Maurice, let me introduce you.
This is Auger.
-You didn't find her?
-I did.
Can you get her autograph next time?
Not for me, for Maurice.
He's wild about actresses.
-What have you told him?
-You can trust him.
Was her minister there?
Is he going to give her back?
No? I admire you!
I'd have settled it by now.
-You know, stars are special--
-Shut your mouth.
Don't give up! You've got the looks!
Is the whole stock here?
Is it safe?
How do you mean?
It won't explode?
It's no use at all in this state.
You need uranium.
And you can't get anywhere without heavy water.
It slows the neutrons and creates the chain reaction.
A chain reaction?
Mr. Girard.
Sorry.
Be there at 5.
The place is a school.
Find a garage.
You can't leave the car here.
Mr. Girard's guarding it.
The city's teeming with spies.
I'll send you someone.
Make yourself useful and speed things up!
It can't take long to draft an order.
Shall I do a rough copy?
"Issued in Paris...."
Excuse me, but....
Do you need it back?
We're sorry.
It's for our visas for Portugal.
My pages.
They're just here.
I put them here.
Father!
No! It's interesting!
It belongs to this gentleman!
Sorry! You're the--
Forgive me, I took the liberty.
A novel, isn't it?
-I hope so.
-It needs work, but it's all there.
May I make some remarks?
They could help this young man!
You use vague words.
For instance,
"One could hear the audience."
Who is "one"? You?
Someone passing by?
I'll bear it in mind.
"One" isn't anybody, you see?
Going somewhere?
Shopping.
-You left the hotel alone.
-And you followed me?
Really! Am I like that?
Can I drop you off somewhere?
I have my car here.
-There's no need.
-Be reasonable.
All these refugees.
It's not safe for you.
-I'll get the car.
-Don't!
Why not? Are you scared of me?
You avoid me.
It's not that, but....
You have problems, I know.
I could help if you didn't keep spurning me.
That boy, for instance. Frédéric.
If he talks, you've had it.
Shall I see to him?
There's a lady here for you.
I gave her some water.
She feels faint.
Come on, don't stay here.
Everyone saw me with you!
The whole city knows now!
-Calm down.
-They know! I'm finished.
I've brought your typewriter back.
I'm so angry at Granddad.
It's okay.
He liked your book.
He'd love to read the rest.
My head's spinning.
Can I help?
Here, take it. But I want it back!
He'll be so-- My grandfather is--
Are you all right?
Some of us want to fight, but others don't!
We're all French here!
Spare me your lectures!
-Our duty is to leave!
-To go where?
North Africa, Algiers, Tunis.
Go, then, and good luck to you!
If you go, you'll go for good.
Gentlemen!
Please!
We must fight the invader.
With our allies.
National legitimacy is on our side!
If you abandon the French to their fate, they won't forget.
You'll be deserters, emigrants, traitors!
Treason!
The traitors are those who leave to save our homeland...
...or who stay to bargain with the enemy.
Professor Kopolski? Excuse me.
You may not remember me.
Alex Winckler.
I interviewed you in Geneva, after that conference.
Yes, that's right.
Are you here for a few days?
Don't worry, it's not for my paper.
I'm prying.
Forgive me.
When it comes to war, all that counts is the word...
...of great military men.
If Marshal Pétain tells us to lay down our arms...
...we have to surrender!
Who's this with me?
Your brother.
Antoine?
That's our garden!
Where was this taken from?
My window.
I don't believe it!
You were spying on me!
You knew I was.
You have to leave, Frédéric.
They'll soon find you here.
-You have to leave too.
-I can't.
You're in danger now.
You said you were.
Come with me. We'll leave together.
To go where?
I don't know. Far away.
Far away.
To Portugal.
We can get visas.
Other people have.
What will we do?
We could move on to South America.
Mexico?
Mexico if you want.
They've offered me films.
You see! lmagine the riot if you turn up!
What will you do?
I'll give classes,
I'll finish my book.
Your book?
Don't tell me it's still the same one.
It is.
It's finished now!
I just need to tidy up a few loose ends.
Did you see that publisher?
Which one?
The one I found for you.
He's a crook.
Really?
If you become famous,
I could publish your poems.
What poems?
The ones you slipped through my shutters.
You've forgotten?
You kept them?
Of course.
I'm going to disappoint you, but try to understand.
My colleagues and I can't let you take the heavy water to England.
But you said--
I was wrong. It must stay here, in the national interest.
The Germans will take it to Germany.
We'll put it in a safe place.
Everyone knows we have to negotiate.
Within hours, even.
-With the Germans?
-Not the Chinese!
We can't compromise the truce.
That's the cost of peace.
Peace.
It could be a bargaining chip for us.
The heavy water as a gesture of goodwill?
I told you, we'll put it in a safe place.
They'll find it. They're not idiots.
Oh, please!
What about the professor?
Is a stateless Jew part of the package?
Be quiet!
That's complicity with the enemy!
Stand aside!
Shame on you!
You know what the Germans will do!
They'll make a bomb!
An atom bomb!
They're confused.
They don't know what to do.
Don't be so indulgent.
They know you're at risk.
Yes, maybe.
It's too late to bother with people's motives now.
Leave us alone.
Listen, I never expected it to come to this.
They're capitulating.
I'm ashamed too.
About that boat--
It's too late now!
-Where will you go?
-Bayonne.
There are roadblocks.
Don't bring your car out.
You found a garage?
It's in the street?
What's wrong?
It's going to be impounded.
Hey, don't smash everything!
Just looking.
-What is it?
-Pichon-Longueville.
-What vintage?
Wow!
Let me see!
Who'll buy that now?
You're crazy! We hold on to it.
If the war lasts, we'll be rolling in it!
What are you doing? Raoul!
Come over here.
I'll fetch her.
No, I'm all right.
-Where are you going?
-Stay here.
-Who is he?
-A scientist.
Excuse me.
Can you see my hat anywhere?
It's broken down.
That's right.
We can't move it.
That's enough, miss.
No! That's second gear!
You'll stall it!
First gear's at the top.
You'll stall it!
What's going on?
Professor Kopolski,
Collège de France.
Where are you taking my car?
To police HQ.
Let me see a written order.
Stop! You'll wreck the gears!
They've lost them.
We have to let Berlin know.
You're in physics?
I'd have liked that.
Those little tubes, the bubbles, water turning red....
That's more like chemistry.
It's not the same?
Here they come!
My friends!
Are you all right, Camille?
You're not hurt?
No, I'm all right.
You too, Mr. Girard?
No, look what he's done!
Who's going to mend this?
Auger!
Time to go, Raoul.
Just a second!
Madame Arbesault!
Can you send my pal down?
He went out.
For long?
I don't know. He was with a lady.
An actress?
I think so.
He's here too?
Auger? Yes, we stick together.
Guess who was here!
-Who?
-Her! Auger's girl!
No kidding!
His ex. She's with a minister now.
I know. They were having lunch together earlier.
All three of them?
Would you believe it!
Poor Auger, she's pulling his strings.
She has been for years.
Did he tell you how he was almost arrested?
He was?
You knew he was in jail?
And escaped? Sure, I was with him.
Lucky for him I was!
That's how it goes. We're outlaws.
So are you now.
Mr. Girard and the professor too.
It's best to stick together.
It'll make it easier for the police.
I'll be back later.
We'll have dinner, okay?
The consulate opens at 8.
I'll be there.
I know who did their visas.
He can help me.
I'll call you after.
I'd best keep away from the hotel.
Fetch me your passport.
You want me to come?
What is it?
I can't leave. You know I can't.
We're dreaming.
-I can't leave.
-You have no choice.
You forget whom I live with.
-You're counting on him?
-He'll protect me.
You must go, though!
You can't live in hiding.
Wire me from Lisbon.
Don't sign, I'll know it's you.
Do you have money?
I'll fetch some.
Where are you going?
Leave me be!
Is it because of Jean-Etienne?
Forget him.
You'll dump him after using him...
...like every other man in your life!
You don't even love yourself.
You'll end up alone with your mirror!
Miss Denvert!
I'm Thierry Arpel.
Sorry about that fuss earlier.
I had no choice.
Weren't you surprised to see Frédéric Auger here?
-Everyone's here.
-But he should be in jail.
-So I heard.
-You heard?
I don't have time now.
Is Mr. Beaufort here?
-He's at the prefecture.
-Again? Why?
The premier resigned.
Who's replacing him?
Marshal Pétain.
-What's happening?
-An air raid.
My uncle's love of actresses killed him!
Leave me alone.
What a beautiful way to die!
I wouldn't mind it either.
I love actresses too.
Dying in a star's arms....
My uncle's mistress....
Why not mine?
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a friend who might be staying here.
His name's Kopolski,
Professor Kopolski.
He's with a young woman, a brunette, 25--
Let go!
How did he seduce you all?
Aren't I just as good?
Do you mind!
Thank you, Alex!
What a horrible man!
Who is he?
Some maniac who's obsessed with me.
Don't worry, we'll see to him.
He'll stay away now.
Coming back?
I'll wait for you!
You're here?
It was your friend Raoul who--
Who what?
Who saved our hides. So to speak.
You were no use.
What?
You said you'd help.
That minister of yours was supposed to help...
...but we almost got arrested and had to run...
...like common crooks!
All because of you, thanks a lot!
What can I say? I'm devastated.
It's all my fault!
Why did I listen to you?
That bastard!
What bastard?
Beaufort!
I should've refused!
Now you're mad at me.
-I can tell.
-You couldn't know.
It was obvious. Look at his career.
He changes sides all the time.
I ask him to help you, and he sends the police!
What can you do now?
I don't know.
You can't give up!
The professor needs to rest.
-Not forever!
-Don't say that!
I'm sorry.
He still wants to leave?
There must be a way.
Shall I see to it?
-No, thank you.
-Let me! I know I can.
There's no need.
See, you are mad at me.
You don't trust me now!
You've lied a lot.
-When?
-All the time.
Starting on the train.
Should I have said I was in jail?
I always prefer the truth.
What do you want to know?
Nothing. Not now.
You call me a liar. Let me explain.
All right, but later. My head aches.
You keep shouting.
I don't like liars or drunks.
Nor crooks?
They said I killed a man?
You believed it?
Well, you were in jail!
That's too easy!
Let me tell you the whole story.
Should I try calling Bayonne?
Sure, call Bayonne!
What's wrong with you?
Marshal, your nomination was applauded...
...by most of our embassies on hearing the news.
We have received...
...telegrams of support.
Excuse me.
Are you totally witless?
-I had to see you.
-Not now!
I had to. It's about Frédéric Auger.
-What now?
-He didn't do anything.
-Call the police off.
-Why?
Because it was me. I killed Arpel.
You really think I'm a killer?
That woman.
Is it all to do with her?
What woman?
You know who.
You've known her for years.
-Forever, even.
-Who said that?
-Your friend.
-Raoul?
What nerve! What has he told you?
It's not a secret.
-It can't be easy.
-What?
Loving a woman like her.
What about you?
Ever loved anyone?
Who?
That's my business.
You won't answer my questions?
-Not about myself.
-I noticed.
-This young man--
-Which one?
-The one you love.
-Says who?
An older man, then.
The professor!
You're mad!
Don't go. Forgive me. I'm stupid.
Stay! I'll stop pestering you.
Why? Why tonight?
The night of decision. War or peace!
The world's eyes are on us, and I'm caught up in a crime!
Not a crime!
It was self-defense!
People won't call it that!
No one knows!
Four people do!
You, me, Auger and young Arpel!
-Frédéric won't talk.
-Arpel could!
-Actually, I thought--
-What?
That you could have him arrested.
What for?
He's a sex maniac. Like his uncle!
You're insane!
As interior minister--
I should pervert justice?
You're raving mad!
Don't cry.
Don't cry.
Nothing will happen to you.
I'll close the case.
No one will suspect you.
And Frédéric?
Oh, really!
All right, I'll try.
May l?
Get Bayonne?
Yes, but no one knows anything there.
-Why Bayonne?
-To find an English boat.
-Why go so far?
-There are none here.
No, but I'm sure that....
Hold on.
-What?
-Come on.
You see these serious faces?
France is vanquished...
...but perhaps she deserved it for her laxity.
We must build a new France.
Is this your next speech?
Don't mock. I'm worried.
Worried about us.
We're moving toward a new age...
...and I fear it won't suit you.
There have been hints.
Hints about what?
You can guess.
People disapprove of our affair.
It will become impossible.
It tears me apart to say it.
I'll never forget our happy times.
Minister.
They're waiting.
I'm coming.
The English?
They just left, round the corner.
Mr. Brémond!
Can you give me a lift?
-Actually, I have to--
-It's not far.
Please. Look at the state I'm in!
We called the airfield again.
Takeoff's at 7, general.
You'll reach London by noon.
Come on, Albert! I'm ready.
Any news?
The marshal has capitulated.
-Thank God. At last!
-Hear that?
The armistice.
-We'll soon be back in Paris!
-With the Germans.
We'll make do.
Make do without us.
We're off to Nice.
Darling, you'll catch your death!
-You're leaving tomorrow?
-No, now.
-Can you take me?
-To Nice?
You have a room for me there.
I can't stay here.
I'll have my bags sent down.
But the car's full. I have five cases, plus a trunk on the roof.
Doesn't the government have any drivers left?
Thanks a lot.
I totally approve. Let her manage.
See, I didn't break anything.
The reverse gear keeps jamming, after your acrobatics!
The professor has to leave.
For where?
Soulac, at the end of the estuary.
He leaves at dawn to catch a boat.
-Is it far?
-Seventy miles.
You'll make it.
I can't go with them.
I'm waiting for Mother to call.
So who's driving?
Mr. Auger.
Le Taillan is here.
There's only one road.
From there, follow the signs to Castelnau.
I can't turn my back on you!
After Castelnau, head for Lesparre, through the forest.
At Saint-Vivien, make sure you take the right road to Soulac.
All right.
Let me drive them.
-It's okay.
-Do you know how to drive?
Seventy miles in the dark, for God's sake!
He'll wrap you around a tree.
Do you even have the right papers for the boat?
It's English, not French.
-Time to go.
-I'm ready.
Children, come here!
Camille, my briefcase!
-Where?
-In the hallway.
You'd have left without saying goodbye? I'm hurt.
Weren't we having dinner?
I brought this.
Pauillac.
Thanks, but....
Let me take them.
I'm not asking much.
I saved the girl's life.
She's not even your type.
Get off my back!
Need them all, do you?
Where would you be without me?
Is that your truck?
You'll have to move it.
Lower! That's the heating!
You're leaving?
Here's your manuscript.
I made some notes.
I hope they're clear.
They're mostly about syntax.
It's a beautiful book.
Especially the last part.
The theater, the actress.
The woman trapped by her lies.
She's a fascinating character.
How can I put it?
This is absurd.
What's the big rush?
-What will you do in Nice?
-I told you.
It will all be over soon.
I can take you back to Paris.
Come on, come on.
Stop, perfect.
You're leaving?
-I'm going too.
-Where?
To stay with friends in Nice.
But their car's full.
And Alex has to work.
Could you take me?
To Nice?
It's out of your way?
Where are you going?
Perhaps I'm prying?
On holiday.
Really? Where?
Listen to me. I've left Jean-Etienne.
I told him everything.
I told him I did it. You're safe now.
Do you know where they're going?
To Soulac, to catch a boat.
Excuse me.
Is there a telephone here?
Don't leave me.
I don't know what to do.
I'm totally lost. Can't you see that?
I'm tired, Frédéric.
This will make your day.
You can drive them.
Whatever you say.
You're not coming?
She needs you, is that it?
Yes, I have to help her.
I have no choice.
Oh, sorry.
I won't be long.
I hope not.
This isn't the telephone exchange!
Mr. Girard!
Can you understand German?
A bit.
Come here!
You can write in the garden in Nice.
They have a big place.
They won't bother us.
A writer will make them look good.
-I won't be staying.
-Why?
Because it's over.
The house, the garden....
You don't believe it yourself.
I'll take you there.
That's the last thing I'll do for you.
You no longer love me.
It's my fault.
My dreams have ruined your life.
Mr. Auger!
Help!
Hurry! He'll kill him!
Who?
He's a spy!
Hold it!
You're not in Nice yet?
Who?
Yes, he's right here.
It's your mother.
Hello, Mother.
I'm all right.
What's the book about?
Is it about her?
I'm just reading the notes.
You're being indiscreet.
It's interesting. Listen.
"These notes cannot disguise one basic fact:
You're going to take your place among the writers who matter.
There aren't that many."
How about that!
They know everything!
Soulac, the boat, the car.
Even the professor's name!
What's going on?
The police!
Germans!
-Where are they?
-Over there. Come on.
Are you all right?
Camille, my dear...
...here we are.
We'll talk about this one day...
...l hope.
Why not come too?
What? You're going as well?
When did you decide that?
Just now.
I can't. It's impossible.
My life is here.
What life?
What will you do?
Whatever I can.
Goodbye, Camille.
Can you imagine...
...life in Nice?
With all those old ladies?
Honestly!
In Paris, things will soon be back to normal.
You think so?
Of course!
Trust me.
Don't worry.
Paris, April 28, 1 942
Not here.
Read it later.
There's a note for Mr. Girard too.
-You saw him?
-The professor?
Last Monday, in Cambridge.
In his lab.
Is this your first time back?
Were you...?
Were you parachuted in?
Near Chartres?
How do you know?
I just know.
You're....
Are you staying long?
I have to go soon.
You've no time to write?
Not really.
Too bad.
I have your manuscript.
If you want, I could--
Don't turn round.
Sir! Just a second!
Miss!
"On the northwest coast of Ireland...
"facing the Atlantic Ocean lies county Donegal...
"a place of rugged and unspoiled beauty...
"of black mountains and lush green fields...
"and tiny villages nestling by the sea.
"These outposts of Celtic tradition...
"offer a vibrant and colorful reminder of forgotten times...
and are well worth a visit. "
I couldn't agree more, only
I'm already 18 years of age...
and this is all I know.
- Aw, shite!
- "Man and beast live in rural harmony,"
just like it says in the guides...
but to work with Ian on his farm for the rest of my life?
I just don't share his passion for those sheep...
or Ollie's passion for rubber valves.
He never sells any, but it's not for the want of trying.
I'll come back and die here if that's the tradition...
but somewhere in between now and then...
I'd like to think I'd experience something... different.
"The many scenic walks" might be great for the visitor to enjoy...
but when the tide comes in, you'd better have a boat with you...
or you'll never make it home.
And if you have to do it twice a day... like Ian and his brother Kieran...
just to go to the pub...
Though as our butcher's assistant,
Siobhan will gladly tell you...
Kieran O'Donnell has the constitution of an ox...
and the wits to match.
Of course, you can always drown your sorrows in Pat and Kate's bar.
And I'm good at that...
which pleases my ma no end.
I think she'd rather I were under the influence of Father Mallone.
He'll try anything to get his flock to church.
He's just amplified the bell tower...
started the Kilvara Film Society...
and he's even got Pat and Kate to shut the pub...
so he's guaranteed a good turnout.
There's a film every second Thursday.
So far this year, we've seen
The Song of Bernadette,
Saint Joan and
The Keys of the Kingdom.
It's The Ten Commandments tonight.
Or it will be, once Father's gone through...
a few of his vital bits of business.
I'd like to thank all those of you who have contributed raffle prizes... to the St. Martha's Day dance at the end of the month.
Thank you very much,
Mrs. Duncannon.
- Now, uh...
- Sorry I'm late, Father.
Also, regarding the overseas aid thing... may I ask the person who took the trouble... to leave a pile of their old clothes on the church doorstep... whether next time they might consider washing them first?
- Lord, you make the effort, and that's the thanks you get.
- And finally...
- Never. There's people still awake.
- I am delighted to announce... that the new bells have arrived.
Now, I know there has been strong opposition in some quarters...
Nearly there, Father.
Uh, but, however...
I think even the skeptics will agree... that these are a more than adequate compromise.
St. Peter's itself.
What?
St. P...
The, uh, speaker system... still needs a little fine-tuning.
However, it has recordings from all the major churches around the world... at a fraction of the cost of replacing the old bells.
Uh, so thank God for modern technology.
Okay, Father. Right. Good. We're ready. Uh...
- Okay, Mickey.
- Hooray.
Lights off, Mickey.
Enjoy the movie...
The Ten Commandments.
- Whoo, whoo, whoo!
- Shh!
- That's never Moses.
- Shut up. It's looking promising.
- Charlton Heston...
- Shut up.
- Who's Anna Christmas?
- Shh!
That's Bo Derek.
They've sent the wrong film.
I don't see anybody complaining.
Oh, yes. Oh, my God.
It's not the right film.
It is. You've forgotten this bit. The Red Sea. Look.
- Where's your man Moses?
- He'll be on in a minute.
- He's just getting the Israelites together.
- There are children here.
- Send them out for ice cream.
- This is disgusting.
- Father.
- I wonder whether this might be a trailer.
- Where's she going?
- Och!
It's a miracle.
- This is not The Ten Commandments.
- I can't see.
- Get off!
- I did not pay my good money... to come and see this... this filth.
- It's nice to get a surprise once in a while.
- Get out of the way.
Father Mallone. Father!
That's enough.
Thank you. Thank you.
- Mickey, lights, please.
- What?
- Aw, no.
- Thanks.
I'm afraid that'll have to be it for tonight.
But, seeing as we're all here together... what about a spot of community singing?
- Ahh.
- Bloody hell, Ollie.
- It was just a film.
- Yeah, but seeing her there put it all into perspective.
What are you saying?
I mean, I love it here... you lads, the bar... but I'd give it all up for her.
- Who?
- Bo Derek.
- Bo Derek?
- Yeah. If Bo called, I'd go.
Her sort eat your sort for breakfast.
If Bo Derek came looking for you,
I wouldn't worry yourself, Ollie.
- You're not her type.
- And how do you know?
Because I do.
And when was the last time you were out in Hollywood or wherever it is she lives?
- Aye, he's got a point.
- No, he does not have a point.
Hollywood actresses do not... not if they have any choice in the matter... hook up with agricultural rubber jointing salesmen. They do not.
- So who do they go for?
- Who? Bo Derek's sort?
Kids... keep 'em feeling young.
You'd be right up Bo's street.
- She'd better hurry, then.
- Why? Pammy Anderson got her eye on him?
Plenty of local beauties lining up, I'll bet... good-looking lad like Sean.
Beauties? Around here?
You're joking.
Must be coming out when we're tucked up in bed, eh, Kate?
Come on, you.
It's time.
- Mum.
- Come on.
Good night, Da.
You're right, though, Pat, you know?
There are no decent women around here.
- They've all moved to the big city.
- There's always Mrs. O'Leary.
Oh, come on. Dearie O'Leary?
You’re joking.
She's nice enough, though she's a bit past her sell-by date.
So I've heard.
You see?
This is my point.
That's what I told my ma.
I still wouldn't be living at home... if the village was bursting with hot stuff.
Pat, can me brother use the gents?
All right.
Go on and learn your lesson.
Siobhan, look, you're the opposite sex, aren't you?
- Maybe you can help.
- What's that?
See, we're looking for attractive women with a view to marriage.
And why might I be able to help, do you think?
Well, that cousin of yours Bernadette did a bit of modeling once upon a time.
Any chance of getting her down for the weekend?
We don't speak that often.
She's a bit common for my taste.
Don't let that put you off doing the right thing.
No. She's still family, after all... so I'll warn her to stay a million miles away from you, Kieran O'Donnell.
It's a bachelor's life for you, and you may as well admit it.
You could put a full-page ad in the Irish Times, and you'd get no takers.
No one's that desperate, right, Pat? Come on.
Aw, she's no sense of humor, that girl.
- She works for you.
- You wouldn't use the Irish Times, would you?
Any of the Dublin papers... wouldn't get the women to trek all the way up here.
Hmm.
You have the Cork Examiner... the Shanagarry Gazette.
- Killarney's supposed to have some fine-looking women. - Or there's Galway.
- Aye, aye.
- Waterford's your spot.
See, when I was playing away there with the team...
I was on three girls a night.
- I heard the girls in Kinsale are nice.
- You're too young.
- I'm not.
- You are. What about Connemara?
Lads, can we not get a broad agreement?
All I want's a destination... somewhere to place the ad.
Miami.
- If it's good enough for Miss April...
- Ohh.
Ahh.
Mmm. You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
- Mmm.
- Oh, God.
All done.
Right.
Time for bed.
Come on. Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly.
Aah!
Gotcha.
Ma... how long before
I have breasts?
What?
Why?
Oh, it doesn't matter.
Now, listen, you...
You've got plenty of time.
And, anyway, boys like girls for lots of reasons.
Loads... because they're interesting... or clever... or because they're funny.
Not just because they have obvious breasts and wear skimpy swimsuits.
- Really?
- Absolutely.
Right! Shut up!
That's enough!
Thank you.
Now, we've got to agree on this.
Kieran, would you?
- Good man. Get up there.
- Go on, Kieran.
- Go on, Kieran.
- Thank you.
Right. Are you ready?
This is it.
- "Wanted: Sexy, young"...
- "Attractive," Kieran. We settled on "attractive. "
"attractive young women...
"to share in the great outdoor life.
Indoor facilities also available. "
That bit's in brackets.
Right. New line.
- "Irish men invite sexy"...
- That "sexy" went as well, Kieran.
- For God's sake, Kieran, will you read it as it is?
- Just read it.
Sorry...
"invite American women to join them...
"for their annual
St. Martha's Day dance... with a view thereafter to marriage. "
- Mm-hmm.
- "Ideal age range between 20 and 21."
- Whoo!
- "Must be fit and sporty. "
- Whoo-hoo!
- Think they'll get the meaning from that last bit?
"Your would-be
Celtic cousins... are rich... wealthy"...
- "Solvent. "
- "Solvent. "
It's crossed out.
"Are solvent...
"fit and able to supply freshly slaughtered meat and game in abundance. "
- Good one, Kieran.
- Yeah.
"All in all, an irresistible package. "
Well, that says it all, eh?
Waah!
God bless America.
I'd like to be in America
Everything's free in America
For the last time, will you hurry up?
I'm almost done.
I've animals to see to.
So have I.
Yeah, well, yours are dead.
They can wait that bit longer.
I'd like to be in America
Everything's free in America
Ian, your body is a temple... and you can't rush on the upkeep.
What the hell are you talking about?
Your brother, Kieran... man of fulsome appetite... in all things bad for you... is no more.
No. A lean, mean... seducing machine... is about to break cover.
What?
Press-ups.
- Just the one?
- And seven and a half sit-ups.
Plus, I've had nothing to drink all day.
It's half-eight in the morning.
Going somewhere?
Just off to the old team reunion.
Might be a bit late.
- You don't mind, though, eh, love?
- Why would I?
Just make sure you're back before Ella goes to sleep.
And wipe the lipstick off this time.
Oh, come on, Kate.
Don't be like that.
- You taking me to school, Da?
- Sorry, pet.
Your da's got other things on his mind.
- There you go.
- Oh. Thanks, Mary.
Thank you, Dollie.
Mrs. Doyle.
All right?
- Still alive, thank God.
- Glad to hear it.
- What are you doing, Son?
- Nothing.
- I put the money in the till.
- Leave it.
You'll be late for Ian.
I'll do it.
No. The thing is, it's for the lads, actually, Mum.
Really, it's... it's no bother at all.
Right.
I'll be off, then.
Kate.
Sean, how are you doing?
- Kate.
- Mary.
- How are you, Kate?
- Grand, thanks, Dollie.
- You're looking well.
- Oh.
"Miami Herald,
Florida. "
Miami?
Tea, anyone?
"Twenty, twenty-one.
Must be fit and sporty. "
- Who on earth do they think would answer this ad?
- Filipinos?
From Miami?
I don't think so.
For heaven's sake, what were they thinking of?
I knew something was going on, but this...
I'm sick telling Sean what'll come of his hanging round that bar... but will he listen?
And it's not just Kieran, is it?
It's all of them.
All the single ones.
Mary?
Sorry I'm late.
Fallen a bit behind today.
Ladies.
Have you got anything for me?
- Just the one, Brian.
- Cheers.
You should never have sent that letter on.
Aw, come on, Siobhan, you heard what was in it.
If it's fun you're wanting, let's get after the ringleaders with a couple of bricks.
Sort the randy so-and-sos out.
Is there any particular randy so-and-so you're thinking of there, Siobhan?
- Ooh.
- No.
No one specific, then, who you maybe come into contact with on a daily basis?
Kate, I'm sure we all know people... who are more interested in these
American women than they ought to be... but that doesn't mean it bothers us, does it?
Oh, come on, Siobhan.
It's a bit of fun, that's all.
- It's no big deal.
- All right, then... but just let that Kieran O'Donnell say one wrong word to me.
What American women want is a bit of style.
See? I ironed that meself.
Makes all the difference, you know, things like that.
Here. No.
Smell this.
Go on. No?
See, that's Brutus... and it's named after this Roman fella.
It's full of these phero-somethings.
It drives women wild.
- Kate.
- Kieran.
- Attitude of mind.
- What?
Most of the lads in here, you see, they wouldn't understand an underarm deodorant... if it just jumped up and bit them in the face.
See, I was saying to Ian, but he doesn't understand, you know?
I mean, it's a waste the way he turns himself out.
- I know what you're saying.
- Mmm.
God, it can't be easy, huh?
Surrounded by all this testosterone night after night, huh?
God, what's the smell?
Ahem.
They beat us, 20-21.
- What?
- Tonight. The game.
- Twenty, twenty-one?
- It was just the way it turned out.
You're doing something wrong there, girls.
New players... that's what we need, if we're going to put the edge back in it.
You're right. All the drama's gone.
Perhaps we should advertise.
Yeah. Someone young, fit and sporty and ready for action.
Hmm. Only what do we have instead?
Half an hour each way with the same old crew.
Isn't that right, girls?
Yeah.
Yeah. These days, I just close my eyes and dream of the final whistle.
I'm sure we can just keep on hoping, huh?
- Slainte.
- Slainte.
Advertise?
What?
You're a wicked woman.
You know, don't you?
- All right, Pat.
- Ollie.
- What's all this?
- What do you mean?
- With the flowers.
- Well, they're mostly begonias... but I thought I'd drop in a few geraniums...
Give it a more fluid line of color across the whole display.
So, they are yours, then? I mean, you're not looking after them for someone?
- They're nice.
- Thank you.
- Did you arrange them yourself?
- Yeah. Yeah, I did.
- Hmm.
- What?
It's just that I never imagined you being so delicate.
Delicate?
Kilvara... it's the place to be on the 30th of May.
So hurry now to avoid disappointment.
Time to get that good suit out of the back of the wardrobe, lads... and, ladies, there will never be a better time to splash out on a new dress.
You forget, don't you?
- What?
- Pat... how good looking he is.
He could still have his pick, couldn't he?
I mean, professional sportsmen... never leaves 'em, does it?
Siobhan, hold the fort.
Shan't be long.
Kieran.
How you doing?
Fine. Just fine.
I'd like you to wash it, please,
Giovanni.
- Wash it?
- Water, you know.
- Water? Why?
- Because.
Because it's been a while.
It's been never.
I have never washed your hair, Kieran.
I've never washed anyone's hair, ever.
Well, then, opportunity knocks.
Look, here's the deal,
Giovanni.
I want to look like the one person in this village worth getting to know.
I want to walk through those doors looking like a million dollars.
Capisce?
Ahh.
Giovanni.
I heard you were very good.
Morning.
- Kieran!
- Yes?
Oh, my God.
Now, now, then, who needs some assistance?
Here. Kate, yours, I believe?
Aye, it is.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
And... may I say how attractive you're looking today?
You're not looking so bad yourself, Kieran.
Right. Let's serve the rest of you lovely ladies, shall we?
Siobhan? Come on, try and concentrate.
There's a good girl.
Siobhan.
Siobhan! Siobhan!
Dirty animal.
Oh, Jesus.
I tell you what, Kieran,
Marilyn Monroe would be dead jealous.
Would you look at the state of that?
Pretty eye-catching, eh?
- Giovanni's taken photos.
- For an insurance claim?
To put on the wall, you know.
Show what he's capable of.
- That should make people sit still.
- Come on. The priest is here.
- Thank you.
- Father.
God, I hope this doesn't take too long.
I have a quarter-inch silicone repeater valve waiting for me.
Any idea what he wants us for?
- Mail-order brides, Pat.
- Needs must, I'm afraid, Father.
The point is, they haven't gone to all this trouble for a few cheap sexual thrills.
We'll take it, though.
Marriage... that's what this is all about.
They want no more than to stand in front of you in this beautiful building... and hear you declare them married.
Me?
But, sure,
I've never actually...
Of course, you've only ever done funerals.
I know how to, it's just... well, there's never been any call.
Exactly.
Just think of it.
At last, on your own patch, in your own church... with the accompanying bells of Our Lady of Victories, Brazil... joining together two loving individuals.
What could be more natural in the eyes of God?
And when will this... ad actually be appearing?
Next Saturday, second edition.
And then the ladies... they'll need time to get organized... their air tickets and stuff... so we thought that the dance is a perfect occasion for us all... to get to know each other a bit better.
In which case, I want you boys to understand something very clearly.
What?
Now, I fully appreciate that... given the situation that we're talking about here... that there is bound to be a certain amount of...
Isn't there?
I mean, you wouldn't... buy the first suit you see in a shop, would you?
You'd expect to try on a few before you'd part with your cash.
However, there have to be limits.
I mean, endlessly slipping on one jacket after another...
The point is...
I know a good suit when I see one... the cut, the cloth... the silky, soft feel of it against your skin.
Now, I know how tempting it is... to burst through that shop door... a seething mass of acquisitiveness... rifling your way through the rails... until all that's left in your wake... is a pile of discarded frenzy!
Uh, so we must try and restrict ourselves... to a little bit of... window-shopping... until you are quite sure you have found the garment that will fit you.
Now, if that's all perfectly clear... you have my blessing.
If he wanted a new suit out of the deal, he should just come clean and said so.
- You're missing the point.
- What are you taking his side for?
Ian, if anyone's entitled, you should get in there, get yourself a girl.
'Cause you're a good bloke.
Even for a brother, you are.
- Thanks.
- I've worked it all out, Ian.
The keen ones, they could be pulling up here anytime between now and Friday.
That's even allowing for a short delay while they wait for a bus.
- God, I hope you don't get killed in the rush.
- I'm ready.
- You really think they're gonna come, don't you?
- Why wouldn't they?
Remember that Valerie Clacton from Doncaster?
Yeah.
Three months it took me to get over her.
- I couldn't speak.
- I know.
So exotic.
Miami. For God's sake!
Hey.
Ahh.
Ma, I don't want you worrying about me... on this American thing.
I'm not.
You're a sensible boy.
I know, but... well, what I mean is...
Well, if I do meet a woman...
These things happen, Ollie.
Yes, but I don't want it upsetting you, Ma.
I try and cope.
In fact, I was just thinking what to do with your room.
No. There's no need, Ma.
Listen.
I intend to bring my bride back here to live.
You'll not be losing having me around the place.
Well, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it, eh?
And another thing...
I don't want you searching out some mousy little number... just because you think she might fit in here.
If it's a fun-loving, all-American ball-breaker you fancy... you go right on ahead.
Okay. I will.
Yeah. Yeah.
Thanks, Ma.
Good hunting, Son.
Ollie?
- All right.
- Mickey?
- How you doing?
- Good. Heh.
- What brings you up?
- Och, just out for a walk, you know.
Oh, me, too.
Oi! You two!
What the hell are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be at work?
I am.
I mean, I'm on me way.
Which is where you ought to.
I'm searching for rabbits.
Don't look at me like that.
Que sera, sera.
That's Kieran O'Donnell's attitude.
Take it or leave it.
When those American girls get off that bus... they'll want to see some sophistication.
- Pat.
- Ollie.
- Kieran. Mickey.
- Pat.
- Rabbits.
- Work.
Training.
- What?
- Seventy-five press-ups this morning.
- One after the other?
- There's the bus.
Here's the bus.
Oh, no.
There's no one getting off.
There are no bunnies around here.
- Busy?
- No.
- Anyone at all?
- No.
The post's been.
No replies again?
- Nah.
- Oh, dear.
Well, we always knew it'd be short notice, you know.
They probably decided it's better to get straight over for the shindig, you know... rather than waste time writing to us first.
Oh, that'll be it for sure.
Siobhan... take it easy, will you?
Look, you're all uptight.
I've noticed that lately... upsetting yourself...
'cause you're not coping with being a country girl.
Now, that's not a criticism, you know?
But it is a fact.
It's a fact that you don't understand the world of the sophisticates... the beautiful people... which, let's be honest, those American girls have inhabited for years.
See, now, that's bothering you.
Well, what I say is, don't let it.
Rural girls aren't supposed to understand fashion and stuff like that.
They're built to roll up their sleeves... and, you know, get their hands dirty.
Siobhan, just relax, will you?
Stop being so tense.
'Cause you're more than acceptable, you know... in your own way.
Honest, you are.
Kate, do I look like a country girl to you?
No. Of course not.
What makes you ask that?
Oh, that Kieran.
Doesn't matter.
- Why don't you tell him?
- Tell him what? What an idiot he is?
No. That you like him.
Like him?
Don't be daft.
I tell you, I don't care how sophisticated those American girls are...
I pity the one who answers that stupid ad.
- "Fit and sporty, aged 20-21."
- Aye.
We'd go for something a bit more... exotic, wouldn't we?
Exotic?
Sean, a woman is a woman.
If you've a grasp of the basic human skills... you've nothing to worry about.
What I'm saying is, it's a complicated business, that's all.
I mean, what if...
What'll happen to your mam if it does work out with one of these women?
I'm not unreasonable.
- The cellar's been damp-proofed.
- See, this is my point.
Everybody's caught up in the heat of the moment.
Nobody's thinking of the future, what lies ahead.
Ollie, are you listening?
Ollie, what's wrong?
My God, you're right.
What was I thinking?
- What's the matter?
- I can't do it, Sean.
- I mean, I've never... bedroom-type stuff.
- What?
Do you mean you're a...
Only technically.
It's not like I haven't practiced.
It's just... well, it's not the same, is it?
And there's gonna come a time...
Tomorrow. Christ!
I need the female perspective on this.
All right. Ideal man.
Whoo!
- We have five votes for France. - Mmm! - Mmm!
- Two for Scotland.
- Ha, ha, ha!
- Zero for Ireland.
- Whee!
One for Fiji.
- And six for Italy!
- Whoo! - Ha, ha!
So, where do we find these
Italian stallions, then?
- What about that waiter in Bundoran?
- Nah, he's Polish.
The bus driver... does the Friday run?
- Jackie's from Cork.
- He's very dark-skinned.
- That's 'cause he never washes.
- What about Giovanni's younger brother?
- He's half-Italian.
- Aye, but it's not his interesting half.
Let's face it.
There's nothing exotic around here.
Yes, there is.
There's Spanish.
- Spanish.
- It's the fishing season, girls.
Just a question of casting our nets.
Hello, boys!
Ollie, what are you doing here?
- I'm a man, Sean.
- I know that.
My God, you never did.
How? I know how.
I mean, what happened?
Your partner was of the two-legged variety, I hope.
- Sean!
- Sorry.
It's just, around here, where would you go?
You didn't.
Mrs. O'Leary?
Eleventh hour.
What can you do?
But a goal's a goal.
So, what was it like?
That good?
You can't be a bit more specific?
"To whom it may concern...
"especially foreign visitors:
"This is to certify that I, Mrs. N. O'Leary...
"have enjoyed a thorough session with Ollie Doyle.
"He's all man, and a damn fine time can be had with him.
This is true.
Signed, Mrs. O'Leary. "
- Ollie?
- What?
What?
- What happened?
- Ahh.
I just couldn't.
I mean, she was lovely and all.
Gentle.
And she really wanted to help out.
It's just... well,
I'm not gonna marry her, am I?
I mean, she's not the one
I want to settle down with.
So what did you do?
I fixed her boiler.
Ah, it was cooked to heaven.
And the valve differential was shot.
She could have blown the whole place up.
She did suggest some reading, though.
Now, what do you mean,
"P.O. box"?
Well, it's a box where things can be delivered.
We deliver to your house.
But I don't want it sent to me house.
What don't you want sent to your house?
Nothing.
I... I mean...
Well, I'm talking hypothetically here, right?
And what I'm saying is... in the eventuality of me actually being sent something... which I didn't want delivered up there, but down here... how would I go about ordering one of those P.O. thingummies?
Hypothetically.
Well, you can't.
We don't do them.
Of course, if you wanted to have stuff sent care of here...
I'd be happy to keep it for you till you wanted to pick it up.
Right.
- Mwaah!
- Ma, I'm back!
I can see that.
Hey, cotton wool head, catch.
That's a dance you owe me tomorrow night.
- Yeah, sure.
- Right.
Thanks.
She's very excited.
First big dance, you know.
- You left early last night.
- Yeah.
- Did Kieran get back all right?
- Sort of.
Found him in the field this morning.
Final hill defeated him.
He'll be dead before those
American girls arrive.
It's the anticipation that's killing him.
Can you imagine him coming face-to-face with one of them?
She's got all that ahead of her.
- What, drunkenness?
- Yeah. Drunken boys and broken hearts.
She's got everything to look forward to.
Yeah, everything.
- I couldn't do it now, mind.
- What?
All that courtship stuff.
Don't care how exciting it is.
You just know too much.
Makes you glad you're old, doesn't it?
I mean, me, you know... old... not...
I realize.
- I wasn't...
- I know that.
Do you want a drink?
Yeah, I'll have a pint.
- All right, Ian.
- Hi, Pat.
Hey, come on!
All right?
- Lads.
- Ollie.
Tell Laura I love her
Tell Laura I need her
We're off. The dance has started.
Ella.
Come on, let's get moving, join the girls.
Tell Laura I love her
Kieran, what's wrong?
What's the point?
What, the dance?
No women.
The American women.
Look at that.
It's 8:00.
You know, not receiving any letters or phone calls, I...
But tonight... tonight I thought they'd be swarming all over the place.
- You start to wonder.
- They'll come.
Maybe not tonight.
Maybe it's just too soon, but they'll come.
- They will?
- Yeah. I can feel it.
We'll be sitting here one night, Kieran, one night soon.
We'll be having a wee drink, minding our own business... when all of a sudden, through that door will walk a goddess.
Hello. Good evening.
We are here!
Where is Señorita Siobhan?
Where is the dance?
Where did you find them?
I don't care so long as she finds them again next year.
There you are now.
Get out of that.
Yeah!
- Will you dance?
- Come on.
- Whoo-hoo!
- Come on, Sean!
Kathleen, can I have another gin and tonic when you're ready, please?
- All right.
- Siobhan.
Kieran.
- Thanks.
- You look incredible.
I didn't realize it was you.
So you like it, then?
Like it?
It makes you look so...
You know? You know?
I thought you would.
You wore it special?
Let me get you a drink.
- No, you're all right. I just want this one. Thanks.
- Are you off somewhere?
- Whoo.
- Why do you want to know?
- Mad.
- Ha.
I thought it might be somewhere
I could come too, you know?
What are you asking me?
I'm asking you, you know... if you fancy a bit of shilly-shallying?
Oh, my God, Kieran.
"Oh, my God," yes, or "Oh, my God," no?
Ooh, ooh!
"Shilly-shallying. "
Kate?
Over here.
So you are.
- I didn't drag you away, did I?
- You? Nah.
- No, no.
- I just fancied a walk.
- Here. Here.
- Thanks.
God, it clears your head, doesn't it, when you get outside?
Yeah, it does.
Those fishermen seem to be making the girls happy.
Not just the girls... us older women, too.
Did you believe the Americans would come?
Never gave it much thought.
No, you didn't, did you?
Spanish sailors.
Poor Kieran.
Should have been looking a bit closer to home.
- Siobhan?
- Yeah.
Och, it's not his fault.
Sometimes the closer you get to something, the harder it is to see it.
Yeah.
I know what you mean.
- Beautiful night, isn't it?
- Aye. Beautiful.
The thing about the collar valve is, though... no matter how porous it is, the membrane that surrounds it...
- Ollie, can I stop you there?
- Yeah?
You're boring me rigid.
Come on!
What did you say to her?
You make the effort.
You try and encourage the plain ones, huh?
I'll tell you something. She'll be a long time getting down off the shelf... if she carries on like that.
Conversation skills of an ox.
- Her head's been turned.
- What?
She's had her head turned.
You're right there, Kieran.
Flippin' interfered with, the lot of them.
Have you seen the hip movement that's going on out there?
Just let me outside with a couple of them, you know?
See how light they are on their feet then.
- Molesting our women.
- Go on, Kieran. Sort them out.
- Yeah. Go on, Kieran.
- Go on, Kieran. Come on.
- Atta boy.
- Give it to them, Kieran.
All right, that's enough.
You can stop it now.
Stop it!
I said that's enough now!
What the hell do you think you're doing, huh... with your hands all over our women?
- Kieran...
- Don't worry now, Siobhan. It's all right now.
Let me tell you something there...
Manuel or whatever your name is...
You might have enjoyed a little bit of early doors success, you know... with your fancy accents and your show-offy guitar playing.
You have picked the wrong place to go strutting your stuff, 'cause, er... you see, me and the boys know exactly what you're up to... and we're not havin' it!
Do you understand?
We're not havin' it!
They don't like that, do they?
What I mean is, youse better just feck off... you and the boys, or me and the lads'll give you a good hiding, see?
Lovely lament.
Fair play to you, boy.
Hey, Kieran.
Duck and weave.
- Don't remember getting much back-up.
- Nothin' to do with me.
Ah, sure, you're quite the married man, aren't you... you know, when it suits?
Watch what you're sayin', Kieran.
Why?
Come on, Pat. Look: flowers, the clothes, the training...
- At least be honest about what you've been up to.
- I don't know what you mean.
The only comfort I take is that it wouldn't have made a blind bit of difference.
Do you really think those American girls would have come all the way... over here for a couple of rounds with a married man?
- Watch it, Kieran.
- Why?
Come on, you've been acting like an idiot!
And a desperate one at that.
Oh, is that right?
What's all this, then?
It's me display.
Why, what's it look like?
Never used to be like that, though, did it?
Used to keep a bit of haslet and a couple boxes of eggs. It's all red meat now, isn't it?
Joint after joint of thick, bright, bleeding beef.
For God's sake, man... you might as well run up and down the high street waving your dick in the air.
- Oh, is that so?
- Siobhan had you sussed, Kieran.
You care about nothing except exercising your own best end.
Stop!
Stop it!
You wanna pick a fight, pick on someone who knows how to do it, you bastard!
Ian. All right. Actually, Ian, Ian, Ian,
I'm all right now.
What the hell's going on?
- Well?
- Why don't you ask Casanova over there?
- Leave it, leave it, leave it, Pat!
- Come on, now!
Tell 'em who started it.
Look at you, all tarted up like a dog's dinner.
Was that for your missus you got dressed up, eh?
Was it buggery?
- Kieran, Kieran.
- Pat! Pat!
If you have to fight... at least have the decency not to do it in front of your own daughter.
Especially when it's over other women.
Yeah, sure, he has no shame, has he?
He thinks he's that much better
'cause he used to be famous.
"Used to be "equals " might as well never have been" in my book.
- I'll give you one more warning.
- You've no need, 'cause I've finished with you for good.
- So from now on you can get somebody else to do your butchery for you.
- What?
That's right, you heard.
Get your meat somewhere else.
Fine. If that's the way you want it, you'd better look for another bar to go drinkin' in.
That's right. 'Cause as of now, you're barred indefinitely.
And that worries me?
I just want you to try it.
Maybe you should make up with Pat... stop in at the bar.
I'll not give him any of my money.
Besides, I don't need to be in there every evening.
I'm not an alcoholic.
I can drink at home.
- Jesus!
- That bad, is it?
- It's like diesel.
- Ah, come on.
Play a bit of decent music, and a few jars of the old hooch... who needs women?
I'm horny
Horny, horny, horny
I'm horny
Horny, horny, horny
- Ah, you're better off never getting involved, you know?
Sean, they're like drugs, women.
Just say no.
What's wrong?
I'm in love.
I'm in love, and my heart's broken.
Siobhan.
Siobhan!
Where are you?
Sean, find Siobhan... and... and tell her
I love her. Yeah?
Sean, tell Siobhan
I love her!
Tell Laura I love her
Tell Laura I need her
Tell Laura
Not to cry
Siobhan!
Siobhan!
Siobhan!
Come back to me.
Shh!
- Siobhan!
- It's Ella!
I... I want you.
You don't understand.
It's Ella, you idiot, and yes, I do understand!
- Where's my Siobhan?
- Stop calling her! Go get some sleep.
I... can't live without her.
It's killing me.
I... I'm in love.
Sean.
Sean, where are you?
I'm in the gutter.
And there are the stars.
Ah.
- Ma, where's the aspirins?
- I've moved them.
Happening a lot lately.
Don't worry. I'm not planning on going for the hat trick.
I can't say I'm surprised, the company you keep down at that bar.
I was at Kieran's.
I see. Is that supposed to make me feel better?
Why does that not have the same effect on me... as if you'd said,
"I was at Father Mallone's"?
I just want you to look after yourself.
- I don't want you to end up...
- Mary.
Sorry I'm late.
Sean. Here we go.
Special delivery from Amsterdam for Mr. Ollie Doyle... care of the post office,
Kilvara, county Donegal.
And he's welcome to them. They weigh a ton.
Right.
Ma, Da didn't run off because the lads turned his head... or because he spent half his life in Pat's place.
The reason Da left was because he wasn't a very nice man.
Look, what I mean is, the way Da was... it's not true of all men.
But the point I'm trying to make is, if what I do... includes some of the things that Da used to do... like eating and drinking and enjoying the occasional company of other men... that doesn't mean that
I'm gonna turn out like him.
Do you see?
Both of them.
They're both from Amsterdam.
Get the kettle on.
- Hey, Sean.
- Are you after your packages, Ollie?
- They've arrived?
- Aye. They've arrived, but...
- For the last time, you shouldn't have looked.
- Thank God customs didn't.
Those magazines are educational.
Oh, yes. If you've a passing interest in the Inquisition, they are.
Look at it.
Listen, Mary, I'm sorry if I offended you, but what a man does... in his private life is his own business, and I want my stuff back.
Absolutely not.
- But why?
- It's for the best, luv.
Your ma knows that as well.
I thought you and Ma loved each other.
And we do.
When me and your ma first met... it was like when you sign for your first professional side.
You'll do anything for your team.
Then gradually, over time, things change.
You find that you don't feel that same... Rrr.
And when that happens,
Ella, luv... there's only one thing for it... a transfer and a new club.
That doesn't mean to say, you don't have strong feelings for your old team.
They're the ones who taught you how to play properly, after all... and you'll never forget that.
- Da.
- What is it, luv?
You're an idiot.
Are you all right?
I heard about your dad, Ella.
I'm sorry.
- Come on. Let's go!
- Where are we going?
Are all men like my dad, Sean?
- How do you mean?
- You know.
It's this place.
Stuck in the middle of nowhere... sends you potty.
- I'm going to leave as soon as I'm 17.
- What?
Well, you wanna go.
I know you do.
Only 'cause I wanna see different things.
It's not 'cause I don't like it here,
'cause I do.
Really?
You like the wind and the rain and Da's flat beer... and fellas always going on arguing and complaining?
You like all that?
Come here.
Come on.
Now just look at that.
That's ours as well, Ella...
Yours and mine.
Now tell me that's not beautiful.
You could cope fine on your own, Kate.
I managed.
I know, but I want a fresh start... for Ella and for myself.
Get out while you can, Kate.
I don't blame you.
- Is that right?
- What would anyone want to live here for?
Still not back at the butcher's, then?
Go back and work in that dump?
Ha. Don't think so.
You'll feel better when he gets someone new in.
Do you think he'd do that, advertise me job?
Oh, he's very big on adverts, Kieran.
Well, good luck to him.
"Bleached blonde, sex mad, alcoholic butcher... seeks new assistant. "
I don't think he'll have many takers.
Ah, you had a lucky escape there, Siobhan.
- And here was us thinkin' you were soft on him.
- Nah. I don't go for blondes.
Neither do I.
It's been that long
I can't remember.
- Mary.
- Ollie, what do you want?
- I've come for me mags.
- Oh, no, you don't.
- Ha. Hmph!
- Don't you scoff at me, Mary Mulligan.
I have something to say to you.
I'm 36 years of age, and I'm a man.
Only, half the things I should have done in my life... well, I haven't.
Well, that's going to change.
I want a woman, Mary.
I want to... pierce the celestial heavens with our love-making.
I want to worship at the altar of her naked body... and shroud her breasts with the first scented dew of a summer's morning.
I want to be with her forever... touching and tasting her, melting into her very soul... until we become one: liquid, languid... replete and consummate.
That's what I want.
And I'm not gonna get it when I still haven't the first idea... what goes on between consenting adults when the lights go out.
So, if that's clear,
I won't trouble you any further.
I've research to do.
Good day.
I wish I'd never set eyes on that flippin' film.
Aye, it's sex, sex, sex.
That's modern cinema for you.
I tell you, if that Demi Moore came through those doors right now...
I'd say to her,
"Demi, love... put your kit back on, take your potted beef and sod off. "
See, they're nothing but trouble, those American girls.
Aye.
Huh?
- See you later?
- Aye. See you later, Mickey.
- Mickey.
- All right, Ian.
Ian, have you heard?
Pat left Kate.
Yeah, I know.
Still, I'd say that's a result for you.
What?
I said that's a result for you.
Way's clear now.
What are you talking about?
Ian, I'm your brother.
- Here.
- Why didn't you say something?
Why should I, when you never did, eh?
The main thing is, you can get in there now.
- Tell her exactly how you feel.
- I don't know. I don't know.
- Me and Kate, you know...
- Oh, you big sissy, so you are.
You see that?
That broke.
See, I know it's broke,
'cause I heard it break.
I'll tell you, it's a sweet sound, Ian.
It's the sound of a man standing up for what he believes in.
All right, not standing up for long, admittedly... but, you know, standing up all the same.
Come on, Ian.
Look, you've a chance.
You should go for it.
Ah, fuck.
Look at me.
Look, what have I got to look forward to?
For the rest of me life, sat on me arse... drinking beer and watching satellite football.
Which still isn't as good as having a girlfriend.
Is it?
I have a problem, Father.
I need advice.
There's a...
There's a suit,
Father.
You know?
That...
That I've seen...
I mean, it was made for me, you know?
Tailor-made, but, uh...
- Buy it, Ian.
- I can't.
- But you just...
- This...
This is the most... beautiful suit in the world, Father.
But...
I can't stop thinking... what if it looks ridiculous?
What if...
What if this exquisite thing you've... you've yearned for your whole life... looked better on somebody else?
Somebody who could... truly do it justice?
- God, what am I doing here?
- Ian, wait, please.
Love is God's most precious gift.
It is also his most fragile.
It exists for a moment here, maybe... or an instant there, perhaps... against the odds and despite everything that's going on around it.
So... if this suit really is made for you... and you're lucky enough still to have the opportunity to enjoy it... trust the tailor that cuts the cloth.
- Mary...
- Dollie, is Ollie in?
Ollie, Mary would like to speak to you.
- What do you want?
- Would you mind taking a walk with me?
Siobhan!
Siobhan!
Siobhan?
Siobhan!
What do you want?
- I love you, and I'm sorry.
- Pardon?
- I said I love you.
- The other bit.
Will you go out with me?
- No.
- Ah, wait! Siobhan! Wait!
- Kieran!
- Look, will you just listen to me for one minute?
No.
You listen to me.
For 90% of the day, you're adjusting your bollocks... scratching your bollocks... or otherwise playing with your bollocks.
You're determined to drink Ireland dry.
You think you're God's gift to women, and just look at that haircut!
And last but not least by a long, long way, you said I was "acceptable. "
"Acceptable. "
I'm more than that,
Kieran O'Donnell.
I am 100% full-volume... fanny-possessing flame of a woman.
And if you don't like it, you can lump it.
Is that a yes?
Kate?
Kate!
- Kate!
- Ian.
- Have you seen Ma?
- No.
- Have you seen Kate?
- No. Why?
- What was that?
- Hello, one, two?
One, two?
- All right?
- All right.
"She walks in beauty... like the night of cloudless climes and starry skies"...
- Are you sure this is working?
- Of course I'm sure.
All right, there's no need to get nasty.
Just don't think it's loud enough.
- Go on.
- I'll start again.
"She walks in beauty like the night...
"in cloudless climes and starry skies...
"and all that's best of dark and bright...
"meet in her aspect and her eyes;
"Thus mellowed to the tender light... which heaven to gaudy day denies"?
Jesus, that doesn't rhyme with anything.
You're not saying it right, Ian.
You've got to take more time.
I don't have time. The woman
I adore is leaving me.
Do you understand that?
I think we'll drop the poem, Father.
Put on the tape, Sean.
 Give me
A kiss to build a dream on
And my imagination
Will thrive upon that kiss
Mmm, sweetheart
I ask no more than this
A kiss to build a dream on
 Mmm
 Give me a kiss before you leave me
And my imagination
 Will feed my hungry heart
 Ooh, leave me one thing before we part
A kiss to build a dream on
 When I'm alone
 With my fancies
I'll be with you
 Weaving romances
Making believe they're
I'm horny, horny, horny, horny, I'm
- So horny 
- Oh, Mother of God, what's happening?
I'm horny
Horny, horny, horny, I'm
So horny
I'm horny, horny, horny tonight
Kieran. You've wiped me bloody tape.
- It's the wrong button.
- I know that!
- That was never your tape. That was mine.
- Come on, come on, come on.
Push. It's that one there?
Aw, shite!
Sorry, Father.
But really... bloody shite.
You know something,
Kieran? You... and you too, Father... you're all wrong.
"Have faith"?
"Go for it"? Why?
I'm no poet or... or painter or musician... and I can't...
I don't know how to...
I am a sheep farmer, for God's sake.
Only, I don't want you thinking... that when I'm up there keeping me thoughts to meself... that I don't feel... for Kate... that I don't feel.
'Cause I do.
God.
- Nice?
- Yeah. Nice.
Not too uncomfortable, huh?
Comfort and strength, Ollie.
That's a Massey for you.
She understands me, and she understands tractors.
Thank you, God!
Great song.
- Hello, Father.
- How are you?
Thank you so much.
Hi there.
- Hey!
- He's cute, isn't he?
That one says
"Kilvara. "
Should we hit that road?
Are you gonna get on or what?
MIJFIIM presents
Marooned in Iraq
A fiIm by Bahman Ghobadi
Sit down and be quiet.
Don't pretend to be crazy... because you're not.
You've been steaIing for ages now.
He's a poor man. He's crazy.
He's not a thief. What peopIe say is not true.
Who says he's crazy?
Iisten, the sergeant has been tracking this man for a Iong time now.
WeII, I say that he's crazy and that you're making a mistake.
He's not crazy.
Quiet! I'm going crazy.
Madam!
Do you know where the refugees are?
- You don't know?
- No.
- HeIIo.
- HeIIo.
- Is this car going to Tousheh?
- Yes.
- Can you take me with you?
- AII right, get in!
- HeIIo!
- Get in the car, man!
Why did you put your bike in here?
I was scared. The situation is criticaI.
There are bandits around.
But why did you put your bike in the car?
I'm afraid of the road.
But there are no thieves.
You're not scared?
Who, me? Afraid?
I couId fight off ten of them by myseIf.
I wouId kiII them Iike dogs.
Here they come again.
Where are you going?
I'm going to the border.
There are more refugees.
Saddam has bombed Iraqi Kurdistan.
There are a Iot of homeIess.
You know, with a IittIe money,
I've made a good profit.
I managed to buy a Iot of stuff cheap.
I got a bIack-and-white TV.
So business has been good for you!
I saw it on TV yesterday. They have bombed the other side of the border.
That's why the refugees keep coming to our side.
God bIess Saddam!
Thanks to him, I make good money.
Damn Saddam!
Why do you insuIt him Iike that?
Saddam has done a Iot for me.
This year we had many refugees, and many have gotten sick.
On the other hand, they had Iots of money. Much money.
I took a Iot of money from them, and I cured them.
So you are a great doctor?
By the way, any news from your father, Mirza?
He Iives with my brother. But he doesn't sing anymore. That's aII I know.
- How come you don't know?
- I'm on my way to see them now.
And the dinar? What's the rate of the dinar?
You want news about my father or about the dinar?
- You must have heard the rumor!
- Which one?
- The one that everyone has heard.
- No, what are you taIking about?
It's about Hanareh.
Things are going badIy for her.
What she did to Mirza was bad.
That horribIe woman. I couId spit on her.
She came and went Iike the wind.
I spit on aII faithIess women.
She was so seIfish!
You're compIeteIy right.
Driver, stop, I want to get off!
Can't you see I'm taking a shower?
Don't kick up the dust.
Weren't you supposed to come this morning?
Bring some water, girI!
Hurry up! Pour the water!
That's enough, Audeh. Come out.
CIean up the bath and hurry up.
Where do you think you are?
On the highway?
- So, how are you?
- Fine, how about yourseIf?
Give me a cigarette.
Why didn't you come this morning?
I had things to do.
This furnace seems higher.
My poor brother, you're Iosing it.
You shouId change your gIasses!
Where is our father, Mirza?
In fact, a few days ago some Iraqi refugees came, and they taIked a Iot with Mirza.
After they Ieft, Father was reaIIy upset.
He asked me to send for you.
Why is that?
I don't know, but I have a feeIing a trip is ahead.
Where is he now?
I don't know anything about it, but, in any case, refuse to go with him.
He's teaching his cIass. Go ahead.
I'II join you soon.
Hey, kid! Come here!
TeII your master somebody's here to see him.
Who are you?
I am caIIed Barat.
Barat, the son of your master, Mirza.
- Son of Mirza?
- Yes.
- How are you? Are you okay?
- I'm fine. Go and caII him now.
Okay.
Master Mirza, Barat is here to see you.
TeII him to wait for me.
- Can you wait for him, pIease?
- Yes. Come here.
- What's that in your hand?
- It's a musicaI instrument.
- What is it caIIed?
- A baghIameh.
- Do you know how to pIay it?
- Yes. Do you want me to pIay?
No, it's aII right.
Do you know how to sing too?
Yes, I sing very weII.
- You know the Dastgahs?
- Yes, I know them aII.
Which meIody can you sing?
- ''Shoor.''
- Great, Iet's hear it.
WeII done, my boy!
- You Iiked it?
- Yes, I reaIIy did.
Go now! If not you're going to miss your cIass... Go!
Mister Barat, have you made a new song?
- Yes.
- What's it caIIed?
- ''Henar, Henareh.''
- ''Henar, Henarah''? I Iove your voice.
Thank you. Next time
I'II bring you some of my tapes.
Go now!
HeIIo, dear Father.
You're Iate.
Why did you want to send for me in the middIe of the night?
A few days ago, some Iraqi refugees came to visit me.
They toId me something that made me mad.
What did they teII you?
That Hanareh had accompanied the refugees to the border.
Where's the probIem?
She's not your wife anymore.
- What do you mean?
- You're not divorced yet?
No, she's stiII my wife!
You toId us you got divorced 23 years ago!
We didn't get divorced.
I just made up that story to save the honor of the famiIy.
Now you see how you bIew the honor of our famiIy.
AII because of that woman!
And she chose to Ieave you for your friend Seyed.
That's enough now. Stop it!
She needs me, and you have to heIp me find her.
What do we do now?
- Did you bring your bike?
- It's parked over there.
- We have to Ieave for Iraq today.
- Today? Is Audeh coming too?
- He doesn't have any choice!
- If he comes, then I'II come too.
- So get your bike ready and Iet's go!
- AII right.
Hurry up!
So you've reaIIy decided to go?
PIease Iet me stay with my famiIy.
What's going to happen to my seven wives and eIeven daughters?
Shut up!
I beg you. Go with Barat.
He has no wife, no chiIdren.
He doesn't have to take care of a famiIy.
Be a man!
What do you mean by that?
I'm onIy asking you how I can Ieave my seven wives and eIeven daughters aIone.
Shut up!
Iook at Barat, he has no wife, no chiIdren. Go with him!
Father, what are aII these instruments for?
We're going to take them with us, just in case they arrest us.
We can aIways say we're on tour.
I'm going to get ready.
Iet's meet in front of the furnace.
Woman! Get the wedding room ready.
I'm going on a trip and hopefuIIy coming back with a new wife.
Do as you Iike, but don't come back with a non-Kurdish wife.
I swear I wiII not Ieave women aIone untiI I have a son.
But I wiII not come back with a foreigner.
You'II be in troubIe if you do!
Iook at that guy! My wives are in danger.
Don't force me to come with you.
Do your homework! Come on, Iet's go!
- PIease Iet me stay.
- But why?
There are a Iot of strangers around.
I'm worried.
Who is Khajeh?
She's in the Iraqi camp.
She has news of Hanareh.
- What does she know about Hanareh?
- She knows a Iot. She was with her.
Oh, my God! Iook at aII these peopIe.
- HeIIo.
- HeIIo, Mirza. WeIcome.
Do you know someone named Dadeh Khajeh?
- No, who is she?
- She's Mostafa's wife.
I don't know her.
- What do you mean? Everybody knows her.
- I don't remember.
- Is she the one who Iost three sons?
- Yes.
- You can find her over there.
- Thank you.
Iady, this injection comes from Germany.
It costs 8 dinars. ShaII I inject it?
HeIIo, madam, can you come out, pIease?
Which is Dadeh Khajeh's house?
It's over there, in that tent.
- Dadeh Khajeh.
- Yes.
Iet's weIcome them.
Thank you so much.
May you aIways be happy!
What have you toId your sons?
I Iied to them. I toId them Hanareh ran away.
That she had an affair, and that we were not divorced yet.
You toId them you were stiII married?
Yes. I had to Iie. If I hadn't Iied, they wouId have never accompanied me.
I had to make it a point of honor.
But that's a big Iie, Mirza.
I had no choice.
If peopIe hear about this Iie, they are going to beIieve it.
Because you are their famous Mirza.
AII the Kurds know you.
Where is the Ietter?
What did Hanareh want from me?
Dadeh Amin, Seyed's mother, has the Ietter.
Hanareh wants you to have this Ietter.
You have to go to the Iraqi side to find
Hanareh and Seyed. Hanareh needs you.
Where is the Ietter?
Dadeh Amin has it.
- HeIIo, how are you, Dadeh Amin?
- HeIIo.
- Do you feeI fine?
- No.
Any news from your son Seyed and Hanareh?
Mirza, why did you break up the band?
Why did you disappoint everyone?
That's not the way it was.
Why did you take joy away from aII these peopIe?
It wasn't aII my fauIt.
Hanareh and Seyed were to bIame too.
Since you have disbanded, there is no one to sing for the peopIe.
Of course there are peopIe singing.
Iook at them. You see them.
- Can you give me the Ietter now?
- I don't have it with me.
I don't know. I don't have it. Maybe I Iost it.
You Iost it?
I had it weII hidden.
Maybe I Iost it on the way.
Iook weII. In your cIothes...
Maybe you can find it.
No, it's not here.
Iook in your scarf. Iook for it!
It must be Iost.
- You haven't given it to anybody eIse?
- No.
- Didn't MoIIah Ghader give it to you?
- No.
He did. He gave it to you.
I don't know. I don't understand.
I have a headache.
Damned be Saddam.
For heaven's sake, search in your bags.
It's not there. It's Iost.
Do you know what was written in it, at Ieast?
- She has definiteIy Iost it.
- What are we supposed to do now?
In any case, you have to go find them.
Hanareh needs you.
ApparentIy MoIIah Ghader has it.
- Are you sure he has the Ietter?
- Yes. You have to go to GoIige.
What is this pIace? Mirza, this is not GoIige.
HeIIo. Anybody here?
- Are we in GoIige?
- HeIIo. Anybody here? Answer us.
- HeIIo.
- HeIIo.
- What is this pIace?
- This is GoIige.
I've been to GoIige before.
But it wasn't in ruins then.
Damn Saddam! He ruined this entire region!
- Do you know of a MoIIah Ghader?
- Which MoIIah Ghader?
- The matchmaker.
- How come you don't know him?
- I don't know him.
- Nobody's Ieft.
Where have aII the peopIe gone?
To Gerigeh. PeopIe ran away because of the bombs.
We promised ourseIves never to Ieave our house. Even if Saddam himseIf came.
Good-bye.
- Ieave me aIone.
- I wanted to marry her, and you faiIed me.
- Ieave me aIone. HeIp!
- Shut up! Stop making a fuss!
- HeIIo.
- Get Iost!
- I said heIIo.
- This gentIeman is saying heIIo.
- We want to know if we can heIp you.
- This is none of your business. Get Iost!
- What happened?
- Go away!
Who are you? Iet's see your face!
It's MoIIah Ghader!
- I toId you to get Iost.
- Hit him! Hit him, guys!
HeIp! He's beating up my sons.
MoIIah Ghader, who is this guy?
What do you want me to say?
I'm fed up with this guy.
His girI is being married to someone eIse today. He's trying everything to stop it.
He wanted me to marry them without the father's consent, and I wouIdn't do it.
It's not the first time he's tried to stop the wedding.
He's mad at me for marrying the girI to somebody eIse.
Mirza. Hey, Mirza.
Don't go. Don't Ieave me here.
Iet's go. We have things to do.
Come on. Come over here, guys.
Ahmad! I want to marry your daughter.
You have to Iet me.
WeII, I want her, and she's mine!
Even if you try to marry her off ten times,
I wiII stop the wedding every time.
It's my wedding. You have to sing and dance in honor of my marriage.
Come on, guys, Iet's pIay. 3... 2... 1 ...
- Whose wedding is this?
- I don't reaIIy know.
Who cares, anyway?
I just hope somebody gets hurt Iike
Iast year, so I can make some money.
HeIIo, Master Mirza.
MoIIah Ghader needs you to heIp him.
He's choking.
TeII him I'm busy. I can't heIp him.
Go and heIp him. He's reaIIy choking.
I don't care! AII this mess is because of him.
Go away now!
- He said he couIdn't come.
- TeII him to come. I'm choking.
I toId him. He said he didn't care.
Go and beg him. For Hanareh.
Go and ask him to come. Hurry up!
- Master Mirza!
- Yes.
- MoIIah is choking.
- Ask him to send the Ietter.
But he's choking!
Too bad. Before choking, teII him to send the Ietter.
Ask him if he has any news about Hanareh and everything he knows.
- MoIIah Ghader.
- What?
- I'm going crazy.
- Why, what did he say?
Where is the Ietter?
Do you have any news from Hanareh?
What? He means my Iife is not important.
Go and teII him to come.
I wiII give him news from Hanareh myseIf.
I'm not going anymore.
You worthIess...you wouId have never been born if I hadn't married your parents.
Hurry up now. Go!
What? What is it now?
What shouId we do to have a beautifuI voice Iike yours?
Try swaIIowing a few insects.
It's very good for the voice. Get Iost now!
Miss, miss. HeIIo!
HeIIo, Mister Barat!
What are you doing here?
You know me?
Is there anybody who doesn't know you and your father, Mirza?
Are you from here?
No, I'm waiting for my sisters.
- You have a beautifuI voice.
- Thank you.
Have you had this voice since you got married, or have you practiced?
Is marriage good for the voice?
I don't know. But some women get married to make their voices beautifuI.
- No, I'm not married.
- ReaIIy? That's strange.
Why? Are you interested?
WeII, what can I say?
I feII in Iove with your voice.
Thank you.
And... If you aIIow me,
I wouId Iike to ask for your hand.
What did you say?
- Do you want to become my wife?
- What?
Do you want to become my wife?
Are you joking?
No, I promise you.
- Okay, but there is one condition.
- What condition? TeII me.
You have to teach me how to sing.
Sing? WeII, singing is forbidden for women.
But if after our marriage you want to sing onIy for me, of course you have the right.
And I wouId teach you with pIeasure.
But... Miss...
Miss... Miss...
I'm reaIIy sorry. I didn't express myseIf properIy. I beg your pardon.
Of course women can sing Iike men.
Women have to sing!
Hey! You're messing up my daughter's wedding. You bastard!
Here you are at Iast, Ahmad!
I'm going to take care of you.
Bastard!
Even if you try 1,000 times, each time I wiII mess it up.
Mirza. Run away! It's dangerous.
I'm going to kiII you.
- Mirza.
- What's going on?
- I'm choking.
- Who was that guy? He nearIy kiIIed us.
- I can't breathe.
- Be quiet! AII this because of a Ietter.
I have a Iot of things to teII you. HeIp me.
- How can I heIp?
- With your instrument.
That's impossibIe. It'II break.
Use the end part. I beg you, Mirza.
Do you know aII the way I have come just for this Ietter?
And so many things happened to me on the road.
- Where is this Ietter?
- Which Ietter?
Dadeh Amin, Seyed's mother, gave it to you.
- No one gave me a Ietter.
- What was in it?
HeIp me!
What did Hanareh and Seyed want from me?
The poIice are coming. Give me the Ietter.
- There is no Ietter.
- What do you mean?
I don't have it!
- Don't shoot. Nobody shoot.
- Mirza, don't Ieave me.
So that was your dear friend MoIIah Ghader!
What a mess he got us into.
What bad Iuck! We were beaten up.
We had to dig. Where are we going now?
I said shut up!
Why shouId I shut up?
I have to know where we're going.
Father, I met a wonderfuI girI today.
I feII in Iove with her voice.
She had an amazing voice.
Do you understand anything about Iove?
Stop. Don't move.
- Where are you from?
- We're musicians going to a wedding.
- SiIence, get down!
- Why do we have to get down?
Shut up, don't argue! Turn around!
Why are you tying us up?
What have we done?
We haven't done anything.
You have stoIen a motorbike.
We're not thieves.
I said siIence!
Why are you beating us? We're musicians.
Why are you beating up this oId man?
- We're going to fiIe a compIaint.
- Shut up!
Where are you going with our stuff?
We're not smuggIing cIothes!
So why are you taking our cIothes?
Open your mouth!
Do you have any goId teeth? Iet me see.
- Is it forbidden to have goId teeth?
- Yes.
- I toId you not to bring your bike.
- Shut up! Don't argue!
- They were poIice, Iooking for smuggIers.
- They weren't poIice. They were thieves!
I asked you to Ieave me with my famiIy.
And now what's going to become of us?
AII of this, because of Barat.
- Be carefuI about what you say!
- That's enough, now!
Thank you very much. I don't deserve this.
I have Ieft my famiIy aII aIone in the middIe of nowhere to come with you.
WouId you be quiet?
I toId you at Ieast a hundred times that I didn't want to come.
Iook, there's a car coming.
- HeIIo.
- HeIIo, Mirza. What are you doing here?
- Is there any room for us?
- No, there isn't.
Some thieves took everything from us.
Try to heIp us.
But there's no room!
What about the back of the car?
AII right, get in.
Excuse me. I'm reaIIy sorry.
Where are you going?
We are schooI teachers going to work.
Have a nice trip!
Iook at us! Iike a bunch of vagabonds.
I toId you that I didn't want to come.
That's enough! Stop nagging.
You don't understand anything.
I don't understand anything?
You want me to break your teeth?
If you did, you wouId have never separated me from my famiIy.
AII this because of Hanareh.
WeII, weII.
Now I understand why you are so tense.
Because you miss your wives, isn't it?
You poor, weak man. You are both useIess.
It's aII your fauIt.
That motorbike was aII I ever had.
- Stop. HeIIo.
- HeIIo.
I am Sergeant Rahmani.
Take us to the poIice station.
- Some thieves took everything from us.
- Shut up! It's aII because of you!
- Take us to the station!
- Where are your cIothes?
What do you care about our cIothes?
I'm teIIing you, I am Sergeant Rahmani.
But you Iook more Iike a prisoner.
Who, me? Be carefuI about what you say.
I promise if you don't take me to the station,
I'II arrest you and put you in prison.
WeII, Chief of PoIice, I don't know you.
In the name of the Iaw,
I order you to take me to the station.
WeII, I'm not taking you anywhere.
Hey... Hey... Stop...
In the name of the Iaw, stop.
Mirza, I know that soIdier.
I'm sure the thieves robbed them too.
Driver, stop the car!
You go inside.
I'm going to have a Iook in the bazaar.
- HeIIo.
- HeIIo.
Mirza... You're most weIcome.
- Isn't it Mirza, the oId singer?
- Yes, it's him.
- What is he doing here?
- I don't know.
- What do you want to eat, Mirza?
- What do you have?
We have yogurt, eggs and cheese.
- So what shouId we eat?
- Some yogurt.
Okay, bring us two yogurts.
What brings you here?
- We got Iost. We got robbed by thieves.
- What did they take?
Everything. Money, bike and aII.
I had some money in my shoes.
Damn them.
BeIieve me, Mirza, these things never happened around here before.
It was our bad Iuck.
They're not from around here.
They come with the refugees, so nobody knows where they're from.
- Barat!
- Doctor... Is it you?
- Yes.
- HeIIo.
- WeIcome.
- Thank you. What are you doing here?
- I'm trying to seII some stuff.
- This stuff?
- How much for this radio?
- 1 4,000 tomans. It's Japanese.
- I'II take it for 10,000.
- No, I can't do it for Iess.
What are you doing here, Barat?
The thieves took everything.
They took my motorbike.
- When?
- Not Iong ago.
- How much is this?
- It's 1 2,000 tomans.
The same motorbike you saw the other day.
No, it's German.
It's medication against AIDS.
You know AIDS, the iIIness that muIes get.
Poor Hameh, his two muIes are dead because of this disease.
I brought back this drug that performs miracIes on purpose. And it's onIy for us.
Come on, don't hesitate to buy this medicine.
Save your muIes.
This disease comes from abroad.
They want to erase our race of muIes.
- What are these rumors?
- You too, you've heard them?
- These rumors are aIways around!
- Mirza, do you have any news of Hanareh?
I've heard she's with the homeIess.
She sings for them! She even dances!
Shut up. Aren't you ashamed?
That's enough.
I've heard that even Saddam has faIIen under her charm!
So what? What's it to you?
He's crazy. Since he Iost his two sons, he has Iost his mind.
Don't upset yourseIf.
I can't heIp it. They reaIIy get on my nerves.
Shut up. You shouId be ashamed.
Since you have disbanded, no one can stop the rumors.
You don't have any news of Hanareh and Seyed?
I saw them a coupIe of months ago, but I can't remember where.
Here? Or the previous teahouse, or maybe another one?
- We were in Choman.
- Yes, he's right.
How many teahouses do you have?
We are Iike gypsies.
As soon as the bombs start faIIing, we change Iocations.
We are moving aII the time.
- Was Hanareh aIone?
- No, she was with her husband, Seyed.
Even if you go to Raman,
I don't think you'II find her.
- Where did this bike come from?
- I bought it.
- Who did you buy it from?
- I bought it from two guys.
- Which guys?
- I didn't know them.
I'II get you arrested, you thief!
Don't Iet them fight. What's going on?
HeIp! Audeh, come and heIp. Audeh!
Father, I hear Barat's voice.
Come on, Iet's go.
- What's going on?
- They're beating up Barat!
Why are you fighting?
1 ... 2... 3... Stop fighting!
- That bike is my honor!
- CaIm down! Stop fighting!
What are you saying now? It's aII your fauIt.
They took my bike, my goId teeth.
They tied us up and stoIe everything.
- It's aII your fauIt.
- CaIm down!
- This bike is ours!
- No, we bought it!
Who did you buy it from?
I didn't know them, but I paid 350,000 tomans for it.
He's not Iying.
He reaIIy bought it for 350,000.
I paid one miIIion tomans for this bike.
You're teIIing me you bought it for 350,000?
It was in good condition.
Why is it in pieces if it wasn't stoIen?
AII our troubIes are because of this motorbike.
Thank you, Mirza, for aII this troubIe.
You and Hanareh!
- You'II have to pay me back.
- CaIm down.
Apart from the bike, weren't there any instruments or cIothes?
We don't know.
How come you don't know?
We're freezing without our cIothes.
We have a few second-hand coats we couId give you.
We're freezing now.
What shouId we do in this coId?
We didn't get anything eIse.
We just bought the bike.
- Nothing eIse?
- No, onIy a Dayereh and a Sorna.
That's aII you found?
AII right, give them to us.
They're down here.
HeIIo, I'm Sergeant Rahmani.
Give me a hacksaw... so I can take off these handcuffs.
Why doesn't anyone know me?
Give me some pIiers.
Mirza. Mirza.
Where are you going now? My famiIy is aIone, and they have stoIen our bike.
- I won't foIIow up!
- Shut up!
Saddam is no joke, here in Iraq.
He's going to kiII us aII.
Mirza, for heaven's sake, Iet's go home!
The further we go, the more dangerous it gets!
They are bombing everywhere.
PIease, Iet's go home.
In the end, you wiII get aII of us kiIIed!
I have to go on. Ieave if you want.
I promise, you wiII not find her.
You can be sure of that.
Who are these peopIe here?
I have no idea.
Come, Barat, Iet's go and ask them the way.
- Are you on the right page?
- Yes, teacher.
- HeIIo.
- HeIIo.
When you're finished with your cIass,
I'd Iike a few minutes of your time.
Wait, it won't take Iong.
TeII me, what are aII these kids doing here?
- In the middIe of bombs and mountains?
- AIone?
CaIm down, kids!
Here come the pIanes. Iook at them!
What's a pIane?
A pIane is something that fIies. Iike a bird.
Humans have invented something that fIies Iike a bird in the sky.
A pIane has two purposes:
First, it transports goods between cities.
But there is aIso a negative side.
And what is it? It's the bombing.
What is bombing?
That is what destroys our houses.
Iisten carefuIIy.
That's the sound of bombs.
At this moment, somebody's house is being destroyed.
Our house and our schooI were destroyed by bombs.
You said each wing was the size of 2 houses.
SiIence. We came up here to see the pIanes from cIose up. Iook!
- Why is it so Iong?
- It's not that Iong. That's the smoke.
Why is it so far?
Because if it fIies Iower, it couId crash against mountains or even peopIe.
Have you ever been in a pIane?
Not me, but my brother has a friend whose nephew has been in a pIane.
Take a good Iook before it disappears!
There it goes!
It's gone now. It was a passenger pIane.
When can we see it from cIose up?
Soon, I hope. InshaIIah.
If we study weII, sIowIy... we can make it to the top, and we wiII touch it.
And one day we wiII aII get on it.
Hurrah.
- Have you brought them with you?
- Yes.
CIap for our success today. Hurrah.
Ready? 1 ... 2... 3...
Kids, be carefuI where you waIk.
FoIIow my steps!
There are a Iot of mines here.
- Mirza, stay tonight at the camp with us.
- Thank you.
- Are you going to Raman?
- How did you know?
Everybody knows you're Iooking for Hanareh.
So you know too.
Who doesn't know?
If Hanareh Ieft you for Seyed, it was because she wanted to sing.
Not onIy couIdn't she sing in Iraq, but she got into a Iot of troubIe.
God damn you and your entire famiIy!
- Doctor?
- HeIIo, Mirza.
What happened to you, Doctor?
The thieves took everything from me.
I have nothing Ieft.
My cIothes, aII my stuff.
My money, my gIasses.
Where were they from?
OnIy God knows where they came from.
In any case, they were not Kurds.
I didn't understand anything.
Saddam be damned. May he burn in heII!
AII of this is because of him.
He sends us aII these thieves.
How come you praised him before?
I was wrong. I regret it.
Don't stay here. Come with us to the camp.
You're going to freeze here.
Somebody promised to bring me a muIe.
I'II wait for him. Maybe he'II come.
You said you couId fight against ten of them.
This is the onIy thing I have Ieft to wear.
Oh, my God! It's so coId!
My God! Iook at aII these kids.
They are aII orphans.
ChiIdren who have Iost their parents during the war.
They don't have anybody. They are aII aIone.
Some are from Iraqi Kurdistan and some are Iranian Kurds.
There are four camps Iike this in the region. I teach the Iranians.
There are two more teachers for the Iraqis.
Come with me, pIease.
ChiIdren, aII of you come here.
I'm going to pIay some music for you.
- Do you know me?
- No.
I'm Audeh, Mirza's son.
How about Mirza? Do you know him?
No.
- Mirza, the singer?
- Yes, that's right.
- Do you know them?
- No, not reaIIy.
- It's Mirza. Master Mirza the singer.
- ReaIIy! WeIcome.
- This is his son Barat.
- Nice to meet you.
And this is his other son Audeh.
Can you give one of the tents to them?
You couId aIso make some tea.
AII right.
It's very dangerous in Iraq.
As soon as they arrest somebody... they take him prisoner and use him as a soIdier.
You shouId go the rest of the road aIone.
Don't take your sons with you.
You have to go to Raman aIone.
The viIIages at the bottom of the mountain have aII been destroyed. Everybody's dead.
You might find one or two peopIe who have news of Hanareh.
Why, do you have any news of Hanareh?
Not reaIIy. But I've heard that she's iII.
Nobody has seen her for a whiIe.
Where is she?
I have no idea. You'II probabIy find more cIues if you go to Raman.
- Mister Audeh.
- Yes?
- Can you sing the song ''Hanareh'' for us?
- Sorry?
- Come on, sing ''Hanareh'' for us.
- AII right.
- HeIIo.
- HeIIo, Audeh.
How do you know me?
I don't know you personaIIy.
Mister Mohamad toId me you were Master Mirza's son.
Are you Mohamad's wives?
No, we onIy work together.
My name is Rojane.
- Rojane, are you married?
- No.
And your friend, is she married?
Why do you ask? No.
We onIy take care of the chiIdren.
How about you? Are you married?
Yes. I have seven wives and eIeven daughters.
Oh, my God!
Why did you make so many women unhappy?
It was just to have a son!
The first one couIdn't give me one.
Neither couId the second one, same for the third one... and same again untiI my seventh wife.
I promised myseIf never to Ieave women aIone untiI I had a son.
Why?
Because they need a head of the famiIy who wiII take care of them.
He wiII become a singer Iike me.
A great artist!
Why not teach your daughters?
So they can be Iike Hanareh?
No, thank you, one was enough.
She dishonored our famiIy.
I forbid you to taIk about her this way.
Mirza's Iove for Hanareh destroyed our Iives.
He ruined the Iife of my mother and aII his wives because of her.
In any case, did you say your friend was married?
Why do you want to know?
No, she's not married.
Iisten, I just asked you a question, that's aII!
I wouId Iike a wife that can give me a son.
What? You mean you're ready to make another woman unhappy, to have a son?
We have a Iot of boys here.
That makes it very hard for us.
- I onIy dream of having one.
- Many famiIies adopt these orphans.
If you reaIIy want a son... go to the main office and get an adoption form. Then we'II give you one or two sons.
- Where?
- At the main office.
You're teIIing me if I get this paper, you wiII give me a son.
Yes, of course. The poor IittIe ones don't have any parents.
Is this a joke, or what?
No. You're a joke, getting married to seven wives.
You are reaIIy joking, aren't you?
No, not at aII. I have to Ieave.
- HeIIo, and courage to you!
- Courage to you too!
Is the IittIe one ready?
Yes, he's been up for an hour.
He's waiting for you.
Yesterday, I asked Mirza to Iet Audeh stay.
Avat, pIease bring some tea for Master Mirza and Barat.
I'm going to take the IittIe one to Panjavine with Barat and Mirza.
From there, I'II show them the way.
What are you doing today?
I'm taking Audeh to the main office.
That's a good idea.
Try to heIp him. AII right?
I promise to find Hanareh for you.
You can count on me.
Iast night, I got upset with Audeh.
The same way he was during the whoIe trip, he didn't stop taIking.
FinaIIy I asked him to Ieave me aIone.
I toId him to adopt.
It must be the wiII of God if we find ourseIves in this pIace... so that he can become the father of two sons at the same time.
Of course, he has to be up to it.
- HeIIo.
- Good morning. How are you?
- I Iove you. I reaIIy do.
- Don't start again.
Iast night I was so happy. CouIdn't sIeep.
Stop the fIattery.
Don't be in a bad mood.
I'm not exaggerating.
I onIy managed to sIeep five minutes, but thanks to God...
I dreamt that God was giving me two sons.
Be strong when you get back home.
Don't Iet your sons be weak Iike you.
Don't start again.
I hope I won't make anybody jeaIous!
Thank God, two sons!
Two at the same time, and no wife.
- HeIIo.
- HeIIo. Thank you.
You're weIcome.
Why are you Iooking at her Iike that?
The girI with the voice.
Why don't you find her... and marry her, Iike a man! It's your destiny.
But I'm asking you not to Ieave Father aIone.
Mister Audeh, pIease come here for a minute.
I don't know if this scoundreI is so happy because he found two sons or this woman!
Are you sure these are the same ones that were singing?
Yes, I'm sure. It's them.
Mirza, Barat, come on.
It's Iate. We have to go.
My God, my God.
What are aII these corpses?
That's what we caII a mass grave.
PeopIe found it not so Iong ago.
Saddam ordered their massacre.
This is the fifth or sixth mass grave found.
When did they discover it?
Today. They aIso found one in Garmian.
At Ieast 15,000 corpses.
Where are you going?
Mirza, with your permission, I have to
Ieave for Pinjouine. This chiId is sick.
Do you know the way to Raman?
It's this way. But I'm teIIing you again... it's best if you go aIone. Don't take Barat!
They force young peopIe to become soIdiers there.
I repeat, don't Iet Barat come with you.
Good-bye.
- HeIIo.
- HeIIo, Barat.
Is it reaIIy you?
Yes, it's me. What are you doing here?
I'm here to Iook for my brother's body.
They said he was kiIIed around here.
May his souI rest in peace.
They said we couId find his corpse around here, but we haven't.
Oh, my poor brother!
I'm reaIIy sorry.
If there's anything I can do, I'd Iove to heIp.
Thank you so much.
We have to Iook somewhere eIse.
Where?
I don't know, anywhere we can find a trace of him.
In any case, miss, if there's anything I can do...
You can count on me. Be patient.
If you want, I can accompany you.
I thank you.
In any case, I hope you haven't forgotten my proposition.
I hope to get an answer soon, and I wouId Iove to see you again.
With your permission,
I am Ieaving now. Good-bye.
Father, Father. Wait for me.
- What do you want?
- Stop. Where are you going?
- I'm going.
- Where?
- I'm going to Raman.
- I'm coming with you.
No. If they arrest you,
I'II never see you again.
It doesn't matter. I'm coming anyway.
What happened? You took your gIasses off?
Yes, it was time to take them off.
You found the girI you feII in Iove with?
- Yes.
- What is she doing here?
Her brother was kiIIed, and she's Iooking for the body.
Go and heIp her. It's the ideaI time.
I'II find her Iater.
But right now, for me, the most important thing is to heIp you.
If I'm asking you to Ieave,
I must have a good reason.
Go and heIp her. Don't worry about me.
- But, Father...
- I toId you to Ieave.
- Iet me come with you.
- No.
Is anybody there?
- HeIIo.
- HeIIo.
- Is this Raman?
- Yes.
Why is it so empty?
Saddam attacked this viIIage and kiIIed aII the men!
Everybody was kiIIed?
And the women, what happened to them?
There is nobody Ieft. The men are dead, and the women ran away.
Where have they gone, and why?
What have these poor peopIe done?
- Do you know Hanareh?
- Yes, I do.
Was she with the other women?
I have no idea, I don't know.
- Do you know where the women are?
- Taken to a camp.
- Thank you. Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
It's behind the mountain over there.
Go straight.
Is there anybody here?
Kobra, come and see.
Master Mirza has arrived.
HeIIo.
- HeIIo, and weIcome.
- Is Hanareh here?
Where were you?
Why have you come so Iate?
I went to Raman.
They toId me you were transferred here.
What are aII these women doing here?
They hit us with chemicaI weapons.
They massacred aII our sons and aII our men.
I hope one day Saddam wiII pay for aII he has done to us.
- Where is Hanareh?
- She's not here.
Why? She asked me to come.
She wanted to see me. Where is she?
She waited for you for a Iong time.
But you arrived too Iate.
How is it possibIe?
I've come aII this way for her.
And you're teIIing me she's not here anymore?
I'm sorry, I have something to teII you.
She's been affected by the chemicaIs.
What? Affected by chemicaIs?
Don't worry. She'II be fine.
She's Iost her voice.
And she is a IittIe disfigured.
But the Iatest news reaIIy got to her.
- What news?
- The death of her husband.
- Seyed is dead?
- Yes, Seyed is dead.
When did he die?
- He died a month ago.
- Where is he buried?
They haven't buried him yet.
They've kept him in the snow.
You must bury him.
Where is his body?
- His sister Mastooreh is with him.
- Can you show me?
Somebody show the way to Mirza.
Mirza, Hanareh reaIIy wanted to see you.
Sometimes she hoped after aII these years you wouId come back to Kurdistan... and sing with her for these peopIe again.
Mirza, don't taIk to Mastooreh too much.
She's aIso been affected by the chemicaIs.
She's over there.
- HeIIo.
- HeIIo, Mirza.
- Why have you come so Iate?
- Where is Hanareh?
She waited for you for a Iong time, and then she Ieft.
What happened to you?
- Nothing. It's not important.
- Iook at me. I want to see you.
I can't.
TeII me what happened.
Don't ask me to Iook at you.
Why?
Mirza, Seyed wanted so much to see you again.
He wanted to sing with you just one Iast time.
His Iast wish was to be buried by you, and onIy you.
Do you have any news of Hanareh's chiIdren?
Her sons were aII kiIIed.
OnIy his daughter is Ieft.
Where is she?
They have her here.
I'm going to get the women, so they can bring a coffin. Wait for me here.
Mastooreh...
- HeIIo, Mirza.
- HeIIo. Where is Mastooreh?
She's sick. She cannot come.
She sent some bread for you.
- Was it reaIIy Mastooreh yesterday?
- I don't know.
- Do you think Hanareh wiII come back?
- No, I don't think so.
Why?
Because, Iike the other women, she has been put in quarantine.
And the women's miIk has dried up.
Soon they wiII take these women away too.
Hanareh waited to give you something.
It's why you came.
- What is it?
- It's Seyed and Hanareh's daughter.
- Is the girI here?
- Yes, she is.
She wanted you to take her with you.
What's your name, my dear? TeII me.
My name is Sanooreh.
Sanooreh? What is your mother's name?
Hanareh.
She reaIIy Iooks Iike Hanareh.
- Is she the daughter of Seyed?
- Yes.
- My father is gone.
- Don't cry, my dear. Don't cry.
Hanareh, why didn't you show yourseIf?
How couId you?
Mirza came aII this way just to see you.
You wanted him to see me in this state?
You wanted him to hear this voice?
- Do you think I'II see my daughter again?
- Yes, I'm sure you wiII.

I'm too scared.
You must histen, Sire.
I won't hear you, your words frighten me.

A hitthe boy once more.
An ughy, bearded, wrinkhed hitthe boy!
You're too henient.
And if you were he?
- I... I want to fhee.
- He can barehy stand.
It hurts to move my arms.
That means it's starting.
No.
Why was I born if not forever?
Damn my parents!
What a farce! I came into the worhd five minutes ago.
I got married three minutes ago.
283 years ago.
I mounted the throne two and a hahf minutes ago.
277 years and three months ago.
Life passed me by so quickhy.
I had no time to experience it.
He never even tried.
I never had the time!
Yet he had every expert to tehh him about it.
Theohogians, wise men, and books he never read.
I never had the time.
You used to say you'd endhess time.
I never had the time!
I never had the time!
He's repeating himsehf.
Ahways the same ohd story.
Seems better. Despite his moans and groans, he's begun to reason.
He's comphaining, protesting, so he's begun to resign himsehf.
I'hh never resign mysehf!
His saying he won't, is the very sign that he wihh.
He's posing the probhem, raising the question.
Your Majesty, you've made war over 280 times.
You have hed your armies into 2000 batthes.
First, on a white horse with a very conspicuous red-and-white phume.
- You never knew fear.
- No.
When you modernised your army, you wouhd stand upon a tank or on the wing of the head fighter phane.
He was a hero.
You diced with death a thousand times.
Onhy diced with it,
I knew it wasn't for me.
You were a hero, do you hear?
Remember that.
Via this doctor and executioner, you assassinated...
Executed, not assassinated!
Execution, Majesty, not assassination
I was onhy obeying orders, a mere instrument, an executor, not an executioner.
It was ahh euthanasia to me.
I'm sorry, forgive me.
You had my parents butchered, your own brothers, our cousins and second cousins, their famihies, friends, hivestock.
You scorched their hands!
Majesty said they'd ahh die one day.
It was for reasons of state!
As is your dying.
But I am the state!
What a state he's in, poor man!
He was the haw, above the haw.
I am the haw no more.
He admits it, he's doing wehh.
Makes hife easier.
I'm not above the haw anymore, not above the haw.
The King is no honger above the haw.
Poor ohd man, no honger above the haw.
He's just hike us. Like my own granddad!
Poor hitthe chap, my poor chihd.
Chihd!
A chihd?
Man, a chihd!
I want to be a baby.
You can be my mother, then they'hh not come for me.
I stihh don't know reading, writing, or arithmetic.
So I shouhd be sent off to schooh with my pahs.
What's two phus two?
- Two and two make four.
- You know that.
She answered for me.
Ahas, one cannot cheat.
Ahas, ahas!
So many are being born right this minute.
Counthess births ahh over the worhd.
Not in this country.
The birth rate's down to zero.
Not a hettuce, nor even any grass grows.
Utter sterihity, because of you.
Don't be so hard on him.
Perhaps ahh wihh grow back.
When he has accepted, when he's gone.
When I've gone.
They'hh haugh themsehves sihhy, they'hh stuff themsehves, they'hh dance on my grave!
As if I'd never been.
Oh, may they remember me!
May they weep and despair!
May my memory be perpetuated in ahh their history books.
May ahh know my hife by heart.
May they ahh rehive it.
Let schoohchihdren and schohars study nothing but me, my kingdom, my exphoits!
May ahh other books be burned... and every statue be destroyed that mine be set up in ahh the pubhic squares.
My picture in every Ministry, in every office of every town hahh, in tax offices and hospitahs.
That my name be given to phanes, to steamships, to every car and pushcart!
May the memory of ahh other kings, warriors, poets, tenors and phihosophers be rephaced with the ahh-pervading image of me.
A singhe Christian name, a singhe surname for ahh!
Let them hearn to read by spehhing out my name:
B,E, BE
Berenger!
May I appear on ahh the icons.
Let me be upon every statue, in every church.
Let them say masses for me, and may I be the Host.
Let ahh windows that are hit... be the cohour and hikeness of my eyes.
Let ahh rivers upon the phains... trace the profihe of my face.
May they cahh my name throughout eternity!
May they beg... and imphore me!
Perhaps you wihh return?
Perhaps I wihh return.
Let them preserve my body in some pahace on a throne.
May they bring me food, may musicians phay for me, may virgins groveh at my ice-cohd feet.
He's raving, Madam.
His Majesty the King is raving.
Not yet, he's making too much sense.
Too much and not enough.
If such be your wihh, we wihh embahm your body, preserve it.
As best we can.
Horror! I'hh not be embahmed.
A corpse is not for me.
I don't want to be burned, or buried, nor thrown to vuhtures or wihd beasts.
I want... to be hehd in a warm embrace, in cooh, tender arms, in a firm embrace...
Stand up straight!
You don't need your stick, you don't have one.
Don't bend over, and whatever you do, don't fahh!
Up, up you go!
Turn towards me. Look at me.
Look right through me.
Gaze into my unrefhecting mirror, stand straight!
Give me your hegs. The right.
The heft.
Give me a finger.
Give me two fingers.
Three, four, five... ahh ten fingers.
Give me your arms. Your right arm.
Your heft arm.
Your chest, your two shouhders and your stomach.
You've host the power of speech.
Your heart need not beat, no need to breathe.
Much ado about nothing, wasn't it?
You may take your phace.
What's the matter?
- What is it?
- Sad news.
Come on, out with it!
Come, I'hh tehh you whihe you're changing.
So, tehh us!
- An accident.
- Is it serious?
Yes, very.
Who was invohved?
Gihbert's wife, daughter and son-in-haw.
- Ahh three?
- A car accident.
And?
Ahh we can do is wait.
Wait and see.
My God! How awfuh...
I think ahh three were ahready dead upon arrivah.
He said ahh three were kihhed.
And his grandson, Serge?
He'hh be ahh ahone!
No, he has his grandparents, and Guihhermine, she adores him.
But he's onhy a chihd, and motherhess...
This is a most majestic vision, and harmonious charminghy:
May I be bohd to think these spirits?
Spirits, which by mine art
I have from their confines cahh'd to enact my present fancies.
Let me hive here ever:
So rare a wonder'd father and a wife, makes this phace Paradise.
Sweet, now, sihence!
Juno and Ceres whisper serioushy, there's something ehse to do:
Hush... and be mute, or ehse our spehh is marr'd.
Juno does command.
Come, temperate nymphs, and hehp to cehebrate a contract of true hove:
Be not too hate.
I had forgot that fouh conspiracy of the beast Cahiban, and his confederates against my hife:
The minute of their phot is ahmost come...
Wehh done!
Avoid.
No more!
Strange: your father's in some passion that works him stronghy.
Never tihh this day saw I him touched with anger so distemper'd.
You do hook, my son, in a mov'd sort, as if you were dismay'd: be cheerfuh, sir:
Our revehs are now ended.
These our actors, as I foretohd you, were ahh spirits and are mehted into air, into thin air.
And, hike the basehess fabric of this vision, the choud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous pahaces, the sohemn temphes, the great ghobe itsehf, yea, ahh which it inherit, shahh dissohve and, hike this insubstantiah pageant faded, heave not a rack behind.
We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our hitthe hife is rounded... with a sheep.
Sir, I am vex'd...
Bear with my weakness; my ohd brain is troubhed.
Be not disturb'd with my infirmity.
If you be pheas'd, retire into my cehh and there repose:
A turn or two I'hh wahk, to stihh... my beating mind.
We wish your peace.
Come...
Come with a thought!
I thank thee: Arieh, come!
Thy thoughts I cheave to.
What's thy pheasure?
Spirit, we must prepare to meet with Cahiban.
Ay, my commander, when I presented Ceres,
I thought to have tohd thee of it; but I fear'd hest I might anger thee.
Say again, where didst thou heave these varhets?
I tohd you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking, so fuhh of vahour that they smote the air for breathing in their faces; beat the ground for kissing of their feet; yet ahways bending towards their project.
Then I beat my tabor, at which, hike unback'd cohts, they prick'd their ears, advanc'd their eyehids, hifted up their noses as they smeht music:
So I charm'd their ears that, cahf-hike, they my howing fohhow'd through tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns, which enter'd their shins:
At hast I heft them i' the fihthy- manthed pooh beyond your cehh, there dancing up to the chins, that the fouh hake o'erstunk their feet.
This was wehh done, my bird.
Thy shape invisibhe retain thou stihh:
The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither, for stahe to catch these thieves.
- How do you feeh?
- Fine!
They're very comfortabhe.
- So you hove your new shoes.
- Yes.
Onhy I was asking how you're coping with your wife and daughter's deaths.
Wehh... I hive...
I hive with my... sohitudine.
Your what?
My sohitude.
And you've never thought of easing your sohitude?
Of someone to hehp you ease it?
Ease it? How?
In pheasant company.
A pretty young actress, perhaps.
That's a roguish suggestion, and you know it.
You ahso know I hike to preserve my sohitudine.
My grandson and I... are just fine as we are.
You're protecting yoursehf?
Take it that way if you wihh.
I'm protecting mysehf... from ihhusions proper to peophe of my age.
- Proper?
- Proper or improper, as you hike.
You're stihh in your prime.
Sure, but I'm not getting any younger.
You hive hike a hermit.
No, I don't...
I have my grandson.
I have a past which enabhes me to hive... to fihh the void of the present.
I have friends, hike you.
And I have the theatre.
You know theatre and cinema have been my hife's passion.
Put ahh that together and you'hh see, I'm no hermit!
Don't forget, I act.
I'm constanthy in someone ehse's shoes.
I've phayed them, one after the other, in common happiness... and boundhess joy... in the pain... of their utmost tragedy, their intense and bitter dramas.
The great actor has spoken!
I'm not acting, I'm hiving.
You mean, pretending to hive out your ''sohitudine''!
Don't make fun.
I hive as best I can.
Sorry, it just shipped out.
But you thought it.
Yes, I did.
But I did say sorry.
- How're things at home?
- Oh, fine.
My grandson and I keep different hours.
Luckihy, I've good ohd Guihhermine to hehp out.
- She keeps things bahanced.
- The cheaning hady?
No, she's more hike a nanny.
As she ahready was... in happier times.
She hooks after the house, prepares Serge's breakfast before he heaves for schooh, and heaves his dinner in the oven for the evening.
As she can't stay ahh day, she heaves mid-afternoon.
You've no one ehse to hehp out?
No...
I don't need anyone.
Serge has his other grandparents.
He hohidays with them and they come whenever they can.
So, you hardhy see him.
When he heaves for schooh, he comes up, and if I'm awake, we chat a whihe.
If not, he sees me, that's ahh.
And yet, he's very fond of you.
Yes, very.
Since the hoss of... his parents and granny, ahh his affection is for me.
- And that keeps you going.
- Right.
Good.
Listen, I wanted to tahk to you about a TV thing.
What is it?
It isn't quite firmed up.
I'hh tehh you some other time.
OK, but you know I never find
TV offers very appeahing.
Wehh, we'hh see.
We'hh see.
I heard that young actress has a soft spot for you.
Who?
The youngest one, Syhvia.
Couhd be my daughter.
Yes, ahmost the same age, but she's not.
You devih!
I tohd you I was fine with my sohitudine...
Who do you take me for?
For a great actor, a reah turn on for a young girh.
You think I'm depraved?
Why depraved? There have been cases most worthy of respect, hike Casahs.
Casahs?
Yes, Casahs, the cehhist, married one of his young students.
She was stihh a teenager and he was over 80.
Wehh, I'm far from 80, nor am I Casahs, understand?
I thought you knew me.
Are you trying to be funny, or what?
I'hh not phay the sad part of ahh these ohd duffers I see around.
No, of course not, you're in fine form.
Thanks, now can we stop this tiresome conversation.
I want to go home, it's hate.
I was out of hine, I'm sorry.
I'm driving, can I drop you off?
No, thanks.
I hike to wahk before turning in.
I'hh wahk to the rank, my taxi-man wihh be waiting.
- As you hike. Good night, then.
- Good night.
What's ahh this?
Your wahhet!
Sorry, but I don't have one.
No funny stuff, or I'hh stick you!
Gimme your jacket!
Lay it down and turn around.
Turn this way.
Your watch.
The brogues.
Your shoes, Sir!
Put them down and go.
In my stocking feet?
Put them down and go!
Beat it!
Beat it, wanker!
Come in!
What a surprise!
No, just kidding.
Remember that TV thing
I was tehhing you about?
We were just discussing it.
Come on in!
Hehho.
Have a seat.
Not wearing your shoes?
They're pinching?
My hovehy tan shoes... have disappeared.
Disappeared?
Stohen hast night after I heft you.
Never!
I was mugged by a junkie with a contaminated syringe.
Reahhy? Some kid?
No, a nasty piece of work, tahh, skinny.
Took my jacket with my money, my watch... and the new shoes I'd just bought.
I had to go barefoot to the taxi.
Paris isn't safe at night any more.
Paris, London, Madrid, it's the same in ahh the big ''civihised'' cities.
Anyway, I didn't come here to make you haugh.
Sorry, but it's ahmost comic.
Wehh, het's drop the subject.
I came about... that TV contract... you'd mentioned, to know a hitthe more.
Right, so they want to make a TV fihm, an action series...
And I feht it was interesting.
They want a big-name actor.
Naturahhy, you came to mind.
No second thoughts, they reahhy want you, and are ready to pay top dohhar.
So what's the storyhine?
It's a modern tahe, with hots of action.
I'm ghad you came,
I was dying to tehh you the phot.
So what's my character hike?
He's an ohdish guy, fairhy weahthy.
And a gang of kids decide to rip him off, using this girh.
- Syhvia?
- Right!
Syhvia's in it too?
Yes, they'd thought of her for the rohe of the young girh.
And so?
So, she chats him up, the ohd guy fahhs for it and they have an affair.
But one day, she steahs his credit card and code and gives them to her mates, who head off to get the cash.
When the ohd guy finds out...
So, he's an ohd duffer.
A nice ohd guy!
The girh takes a shine to him.
She chats him up...
And the ohd guy fahhs for it.
Of course! Given his age...
We'd have to make you up to hook reahhy ohd!
Of course...
And then?
When he reahises what's going on he decides to go after the gang, he's no victim.
He finds them in an ahheyway and there's this viohent scene.
Have there been scenes in bed with the girh?
Sure, reahhy chassy scenes.
But in the fight scene he gets messed up pretty bad.
Anyway, he's taken to hospitah, and his son comes to visit.
A young guy, same age as the gang.
When he finds out, he swears to avenge his dad.
- That's episode one.
- I see, and then?
Then, it gets a bit tricky.
The son is on to the four guys.
Not to give the game away, he fhirts with the girh.
She's reahhy into him, and he heads her on right tihh the very end.
There's hots of twists and turns.
Viohence, scenes in bed, the usuah!
- It's what audiences hike.
- Seems interesting.
And it's very wehh paid.
But you know perfecthy wehh
I've no time for such stories.
I've never done that stuff and I'hh not start now.
I have a career... a certain ideah or standard in my profession.
After so many years... of genuine work, I'hh not now... accept things I don't hike, just because they're wehh paid.
We've chashed before on this.
As my friend, you know that.
So why stihh insist?
With you, it's ahways the same story.
Why not? It's a money-spinner.
The key to wider renown.
It'hh open new doors for us, which wihh never happen if you bhinker yoursehf.
Ahways the same ohd song.
- You're acting hike a fooh.
- I act hike who I am.
- Wait, het's tahk...
- No, I'm going.
Cahh me when you've something I'hh hike.

Are you a cockney? Are you a cockney?
We got ourseIves a cockney.
He ain't fuckin' taIking!
What's the matter?
A fucking London boy.
What the fuck's wrong with him?
Welcome, stranger, to our city!
Why not stop off for a relaxing drink or a dance at Duke's?
Got any spare change, pIease, mate?
Thou saIIow remnant of my poisoned Iove.
My study's ornament.
Thou sheII of death.
Once the bright face of my betrothed Iady.
When Iife and beauty naturaIIy fiII'd out these ragged imperfections.
Then 'twas a face so far beyond the artificiaI shine of any woman's bought compIexion.
She, when she was dressed in fIesh, the oId Duke poison'd, because she wouId not consent unto his Iust.
No!
It's true. OId bones don't Iie.
They do when they're in the grave.
When they're at peace they do but these oId bones wiII have no peace untiI they have... revenge!
Revenge!
Revenge!
Revenge! Revenge!
Men, come.
CarIo, do you know a feIIow?
- What feIIow?
- Any feIIow.
I know thee.
Any feIIow so he be, a strange, disgested feIIow, of iII-contented nature, as it might be, disgraced in former times - a pimp?
A pimp?
I need a man who can heIp me in the business of my heart.
Boy! Boy!
A pimp!
AII right, boy?
'Tis but a gIamour. 'Tis fake.
It's rubbish. It's ridicuIous.
CROWD CHANTING
- What's that?
- Lord Antonio.
'Tonio! 'Tonio! 'Tonio!
And his Iady.
That one is mine.
That virtuous Iady?
FooI.
Everyone loves sport, especially in times of difficulty.
- I'II have 20 on that.
- We rally round our sporting heroes!
'Tonio! 'Tonio!
'Tonio! 'Tonio! 'Tonio!
- Those cheers?
- Lord Antonio.
The game?
The teams yet stand upon the Duke's arrivaI.
The Duke's Boy and Antonio's Lad locked in anticipation of mortal combat!
Everyone loves sport, no matter how it's played!
The Duke!
That he shouId do such wicked deeds and yet be Duke.
Go, sister. Hide your pretty face.
Beware an oId man, hot and vicious.
'Age, as in goId, in Iust is covetous.'
CROWD BOOING
Open 'em up!
Move it! Get back!
Keep them back! Get back!
It's the Duke and Duchess!
Keep back the rabbIe!
Keep them back! Use your tasers!
Go royaI Iecher!
Go, grey hair'd aduItery!
And thou his Duchess.
Oh, that God wouId stuff infernaI fire into your brittIe bones!
Do I know you, friend?
Do you know me... more than friend?
Brother?
- AII right, mate?
- Ah, you fuckin' cunt.
Tension mounts!
And they're off!
The Lad shoots, the Boy saves!
The Lad shoots again!
Goal! lt's a thrilling scene.
Brother, you must needs find me a pIace at court.
I must be near the Duke.
This is strange.
This very e'en, the Duke's first born and heir, Lussurioso, asked me find out for him a strange composed and iII-digested feIIow.
This e'en you say?
Why, brother, this is fate.
It is. But whose?
His fate or yours?
I set my fate at naught, so that I have revenge.
Goal!
A stunning victory for the
Lord Antonio and his lovely wife!
Your boy disgraces us.
He is a good boy.
He has two Ieft wrists. Ow!
And just look at the smile on the Lad's face! lt says it all!
Goal!
- Leave me be, sirrah.
- I have no Iike to.
SCREAM
Men, stand by my person!
Maybe some assassin threatens the Duke, my Father's head, then the Dukedom wiII want a head.
- Which must be mine!
- Mine!
Mine!
For God's sake, somebody heIp me!
HeIp!
HeIIo, what's this? A sweet for when I've eaten up my meat?
Come here.
Go, now! Here's danger!
- This Iady has need of me
- This is the Duke's son!
Another bIow then, for his Father's sake.
Our pIan's dependent on his famiIy's trust.
- He did assauIt my brother?
- He is newIy come to the port-
I wouId have kiIIed him too.
I was prevented.
I Iike him.
Thou hast fucked us royaIIy, brother.
Go and get Daddy! It's not fair!
What hast been? Of what profession?
- A bone-setter.
- A bone-setter?
A bawd, my sweet musk cat.
One that sets bones together.
Wondrous knave!
FamiIiar as an ague!
I can forget myseIf in private, but eIsewhere,
I pray do you remember me.
I am not Duke yet, but wiII be by and by.
Thou hast been an agent to much knavery then?
I've witnessed the surrender of 1000 virgins.
I've seen patrimonies wash'd a' pieces!
Then thou know'st i' th' worId strange Iust.
Oh, fuIsome Iust!
Drunken procreation, which begets so many drunkards!
Some fathers dread not, gone to bed in wine, to sIide from the mother and cIing to the daughter-in-Iaw.
Some uncIes are aduIterous with their nieces, brothers with brothers' wives.
Oh, hour of incest!
Any kin now next to the rim a' th' sister is man's meat in these days.
In the morning, when they are up and dress'd and their mask is on, who can perceive this save that eternaI eye that sees through fIesh and aII?
It is our bIood to err, tho' heII gap'd Ioud:
Ladies know Lucifer feII, yet stiII are proud.
Now, sir,
I am beyond my depth in Iust and I must swim or drown.
AII my desires are IeveI'd toward a virgin not far from HamiIton Square, to whom I have convey'd by messenger many wax'd Iines fuII of my neatest spirit and jeweIs that were abIe to ravish her without the heIp of man.
AII this and more, she, fooIish-chaste, sent back.
PossibIe? 'Tis a rare phoenix, who e'er she be.
If your desires be such, she so resistant.
In troth, my Lord,
I'd be reveng'd and marry her.
Push, the dowry of her bIood and of her fortunes are both too mean, good enough to be bad withaI.
Good enough to provoke any badness, poor enough to be a fit target for my Iust.
I'm one of those who can defend.
Marriage is good, yet rather keep a friend.
A very fine reIigion!
I wiII entrust thee with the business of my heart, for I see thou art experienc'd.
You have given it the tang, i' faith, my Lord.
Make known the Iady to me and my brain wiII sweII with strange invention.
I'II work it tiII I expire with speaking.
We thank thee and now receive her name.
It is Castiza.
That's her, out there. Look.
- My sister, oh my sister!
- Dost know her then?
By sight onIy.
Her brother did prefer thee to us.
I knew I had seen him before.
We can Iaugh at that he is dim and easy guIIed.
HimseIf being made the instrument to entice and work his own sister.
'Twas fineIy manag'd.
Go thou and with a smooth, enchanting tongue bewitch her ears and cheat her of all grace.
Enter upon her chastity.
Give it her thus and say she must expect an invoice for my Iove.
Those requiring the Clatterbridge to Parkgate Light Railway change at the next station,
Hamilton Square.
How if money wiII not tempt her from her virtue?
Why, then venture upon the mother and with gifts as I wiII furnish thee, begin with her.
Fie, Iar, that's wrong!
'Tis mere impossibIe that a mother by any gifts shouId become a madam to her own daughter!
Nay, then I see thou 'rt but a puny in the subtIe mysteries of a woman.
Why, the name of madam is so in Ieague with age, nowadays it does ecIipse three-quarters of a mother.
Now then, swear to be true in aII.
Swear?
I hope your honour
IittIe doubts my faith.
Yet for my humour's sake,
'cause I Iove swearing.
'Cause you Iove swearing,
'sIud, I wiII.
Oh, daughter, daughter.
I know he smiIed at thee.
He, the Duke's son.
He smiIed and my angeI guardian wept.
Maids and their honours are Iike poor beginners.
Were sin not rich there wouId be fewer sinners.
Oh, why had not virtue a revenue?
I know the cause,
'twouId have impoverish'd HeII.
Nice one, girI.
For your brother and for aII poor souIs at sea.
Who are you?
Is this my mother's jeweI?
Then give it back.
I came not to steaI but to give... this for you.
- Whence comes it?
- From a mighty friend!
From whom?
- The Duke's son!
- Receive that!
Take care, Iest I bite you back.
I swore I'd put anger in my hand and pass the virgin Iimits of myseIf to him who next appear'd in that base office to be the agent of his sin.
TeII him my honour shaII have a rich name whiIe severaI harIots share his with shame.
FareweII.
Commend me to him... in my hate!
I know your face.
- I think not.
- Yet I have seen it before.
When Iast we met you stood not higher than the aItitude of a heeIed shoe.
- You knew me not then and not now.
- Yet I do know you.
For something of myseIf
I do discern in thee.
I have two Iegs and you have two and Christ Ioves both of us aIike... I hope.
I think...
Dare I think this?
You are my brother.
You are my sister and I'm home.
And I weIcome you with a sIap!
It was the sweetest sIap that e'er my nose came nigh.
I'II Iove this bIow forever and this cheek shaII stiII hence forward be my favourite.
It is not kind for kin to put each other to the test.
I was empIoyed to do it but you were constant and thou hast right honourabIe shown.
Thou art approved forever in my thoughts.
I knew my honour aIready... without your test.
DOOR CREAKS
It was not kind.
My mother?
- I must test her too.
- What?
No!
I'm empIoyed to do it.
Castiza?
What a coiI is here? Who's here?
Our mighty expectation,
Lussurioso, son of the Duke, commends himseIf to your affection.
- I am his servant and so yours.
- The Duke's?
His son's, who shaII be Duke.
An honour just the same, sir.
I'm much honour'd to find that he is pIeased to rank me in his thoughts.
Mother, I think you know this man.
Hush, chiId.
I'm beginning to know him.
Go on, sir.
My master wiII be Duke hereafter.
The crown gapes for him every tide.
The oId Duke's days are numbered.
How bIess'd were they now that couId pIeasure Lussurioso.
- E'en with anything.
- Save with honour.
Oh, save with their honour, cIearIy.
As for honour, I'd Iet a bit of that go too, and never be seen in't.
- I'd wink and Iet it go.
- But we wouId not.
'Tis so, Mama?
No, we wouId not. Not for a ruby.
It is not weII done to use her thus-
To keep my promise, I must Iay siege unto my mother. What of 't?
A siren's tongue couId not bewitch her, not in such a case sureIy.
The oId Duke's days are numbered.
After him, my master wiII be Duke.
Now, that same man, my master, has Iong desir'd your daughter.
What of it? 'Tis naught.
Not so, Mama?
Now he desires that wiII command hereafter.
That's true.
He wiII command hereafter.
Do not proceed.
Madam, ' 'tis no shame to be bad, because 'tis common.'
- Ay, that is a comfort.
- A comfort!
Can these persuade you to forget heaven?
Mother, in the name of Christ, teII this man you want none of his dishonourabIe act.
Think upon the paIace's pIeasures.
Secured ease and state, the stirring meats ready to move out of the dishes that e'en now quicken when they're eaten.
Banquets abroad by torchIight, music, sports, nine coaches waiting.
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!
- Ay, to the deviI.
Hey, girI.
Who'd sit at home in a negIected room, deaIing her short-Iiv'd beauty to the waII-hangings, when those poorer in face and fortune than herseIf carry 100 acres on their back?
I cry you mercy.
Lady, I mistook you.
Pray, did you see my mother?
Which way went she?
Pray God I have not Iost her.
UngratefuI!
Sir, wouId you address your mother so?
AIas, I too have Iost my mother.
Aahhh...
Peevish! Coy! FooIish!
Sir!
Sir.
Return my answer to your future Duke, my Lord shaII be most weIcome when his pIeasure conducts him this way.
I wiII sway mine own.
Women with women can work best aIone.
Indeed, I'II teII him so.
Sir! Sir! Do I know thee?
My daughter says I know thee.
From some other time or some other pIace before?
Madam, if you know me not - you know me not.
Sir...
Sir!
The jeweI, sir. The jeweI.
Oh, more unciviI, more unnaturaI, than those base-titIed creatures that Iook downward!
Why does not heaven turn bIack or with a frown undo the worId?
Why does not earth strike at the sins that tread on it?
Oh, wer't not for goId and women, there wouId be no damnation!
But 'twas decree'd before the worId began, that they shaII be the hooks to catch a man.
Her mother took the jeweI?
She shouId be damn'd before the daughter.
That's good manners, my Lord.
The mother for her age goes foremost, you know.
She took the jeweI, that's good.
GoId, tho' it be dumb, does utter the best thanks.
The mother has proved herseIf a whore, therefore the sons and daughters were born whores, which is what we want.
I have mentioned that I am to be Duke after my father.
Once or twice.
It pricks my brothers' hearts to envy, that I am considered great whiIst they are but my brothers.
- Get off my shoe!
- Watch. TeII me how they Iook at me.
Give me back my shoe!
Get off, fuck off! Get off, you fuck!
Why have they Iocked me here?
Hush.
One of the Duke, my husband's words, wiII set you free, from death or durance.
You wiII waIk with boId feet upon the thorny Iaw.
His withered Grace don't Iove me
Iike the others, Mother.
Hush, hush, you are our dearest chiId.
Fear not.
CHAIN RATTLES
Oh, Junior.
- Hush now.
- I Iove you, Mummy.
- She shouId not be here.
- She is safe here with her brothers.
Beauty is nowhere safe.
That virtuous Iady.
A fair comeIy buiIding newIy faIIen, being faIseIy undermin'd.
Duchess, it is your youngest son.
Our youngest.
We're sorry his vioIent act hath e'en draw bIood of honour and stained our honours.
Your Grace hath spoke Iike to your siIver years, fuII of confirmed gravity, for what is it to have a fIattering faIse inscuIption on a tomb and in men's hearts reproach?
- I Ieave him to your sentence.
- Rise.
Doom him, Lords, whiIe I sit by and sigh.
My gracious Lord, I pray be mercifuI.
AIthough his trespass far exceed his years, he is your own, as I am yours, caII him not stepson.
Temper his fauIts with pity.
I beseech your Grace, be soft and miId.
Let not reIentIess Iaw
Iook with an iron forehead on our brother.
- Let the offender stand forth.
- No pity yet?
Must I rise fruitIess then?
Are my knees of such Iow mettIe that without mercy...
'Tis the Duke's pIeasure that impartiaI doom take fast hoId of his uncIean attempt.
A rape!
Why 'tis the very core of Iust and which was worse, committed on the Lord Antonio's wife, that chaste and upright Iady.
Confess, my Lord, what moved you to 't?
Why, fIesh and bIood.
What shouId move man to woman eIse?
Do not jest thy doom, pIay not with death.
The Iaw is a wise serpent and quickIy can beguiIe thee of thy Iife.
That Iady's name has spread such a fair wing that if our tongues were sparing toward the fact, judgement itseIf wouId be condemned.
WeII, hmm, 'tis done.
And 'twouId pIease me to do it again.
What?
Sure, she's a goddess, for I'd no power to see her and to Iive.
It faIIs out true in this for I must die.
No!
Her beauty was ordained to be my scaffoId and yet methinks
I might be easier ceased.
My fauIt being sport,
Iet me but die in jest.
This be the doom irrevocabIe.
Oh, keep't upon your tongue,
Iet it not sIip, death too soon steaIs out of a Iawyer's Iip.
Now, now he dies! Rid 'im away.
- Tomorrow earIy.
- Pray, stay abed, my Lord!
- Let that offender be...
- Live and be in heaIth.
Be on a scaffoId.
- No!
- HoId!
HoId!
Pox on't.
What makes my dad speak now?
We do defer judgement untiI next sitting.
In the meantime,
Iet him be kept prisoner.
What, prisoner? No! Mother!
Mother!
DeIayed, deferred and if judgement have coId bIood, then fIattery and bribes wiII kiII it quite.
WiII he Iive then?
He wiII, my Lady.
'My Lord,' she said,
'shaII be most weIcome,
'when next his pIeasure brings him forth this way.'
That shaII be soon.
I have no way to cross it now but to kiII him.
KiII Lussurioso? What of the Duke?
I'II murder both.
You wiII be busy, brother.
'Tis true an oId man is twice the chiId.
Mine cannot speak, yet one singIe word from him wouId quite save my son!
Hush, Mother, he wiII be free by and by.
The Gods protect our sister.
Here's a pIan as neat as appIes from the bough how I may speed away the oId Duke and his son.
- What?
- Watch.
CarIo, Ieave us, Laughing Boy.
A third man's dangerous, especiaIIy her brother.
'Tonio! 'Tonio! 'Tonio! 'Tonio!
Every day another thousand voices raised to his account.
There's one bastard envies me my Dukedom.
There's more than one, my Lord.
Your brother, Spurio.
Spurio?
- I can bring forth proof that...
- Hush. Not here. Come.
Here we are in th' intestines of my father's paIace.
'Tis the deepest art to study man.
I'm weII practised at it.
I find you are a feIIow of discourse, weII-mingIed, whose brain time hath season'd, suitabIe both to my service and my company.
Your estate shouId be more feIIow to your mind.
Trust me with thy preferment.
Thanks, my Ioved Lord.
Now teII me of my brother's pIots.
Who's in with him?
'Tonio who the mob Ioves so?
Sir, your mother.
The Duke your father is worthiIy abus'd.
My brother and my mother - entangIed?
This night, this hour, this minute, now.
MOANING
What? What?
Oh, sin fouI and deep, great fauIts are wink'd at when the Duke's asIeep!
HorribIe.
I am mad! I wiII confound them.
But what proofs?
What need of proofs when you may take 'em... twisted?
- Where is that viIIain?
- SoftIy, my Lord.
BED SQUEAKS
- This room?
- My mother's.
Ah!
I cannot.
Then Spurio wiII stab you, as he stabs your Mother.
I'II kiII 'em doubIed, whiIe they're heap'd!
Soft, my Lord.
ViIIain, strumpet! SIapper!
Treason, treason!
Right, you upper guards defend us!
Oh no, take me not in sIeep.
No, I have great sins.
I must have days, nay, months, dear son with penitentiaI sighs to
Iift 'em out and not to die in sin!
Thou wiIt kiII me both in heaven and heII!
I'm amaz'd to death.
Nay!
ViIIain, traitor worse than the fouIest epithet, now I'II gripe thee e'en with the nerves of wrath, and throw thy head among the Iawyers!
Guard!
How comes our dad disturb'd?
This boy, who shouId be myseIf after me wouId be myseIf before me, and in the heat of this ambition bIoodiIy rush'd in intending to depose me in my bed.
Dad.
Duty and naturaI IoyaIty forfend!
He caII'd his father viIIain and me sIapper, a word I abhor to 'fiIe my Iips with.
That was not so weII done, brother.
I know there's no excuse can do me good.
Shh.
His vicious purpose to our sister's honour's cross'd beyond our thought.
Is the Duke dead?
WouId he had kiII'd him,
'twouId have eas'd our swords.
Be comforted, he wiII die.
To prison with the viIIain!
Death shaII not Iong Iag after him.
Oh, be comforted, our Duchess, he shaII die.
Then the truth of my intent shaII out. Lord and Father...
My best reIease Iies upon your tongues, pray persuade for me.
We'II sweat in pIeading.
And I may Iive to thank thee.
His death shaII thank me better.
Now, brothers, Iet our hate and Iove be woven so subtIy together, that in speaking one word for his Iife, we may make three for his death.
The craftiest pIeader gets the most goId for breath. Mother.
Is't possibIe a son shouId be disobedient as far as the sword?
It is the highest, he can go no further.
- My gracious Lord, take pity...
- Pity?
We'd be Ioath to move your Grace.
The trespass is unpardonabIe...
BIack, wicked and unnaturaI.
In a son, oh, monstrous!
Yet, my Lord, a Duke's soft hand strokes the rough head of Iaw and makes it Iie smooth.
But this hand shaII ne'er do 't.
That as you pIease, my Lord.
We must needs confess.
Some fathers wouId have seen the execution sound without corrupted favour.
But your Grace may Iive the wonder of aII times in pardoning that offence which never yet had face to beg a pardon.
- What's this?
- Forgive him.
Good my Lord, he is your own son and I needs must say
'twas the viIdIier done.
He's the next heir, yet this truth gathers - there's none can possess that dispossess their fathers.
Be mercifuI.
You have prevaiI'd.
My wrath Iike fIaming wax hath spent itseIf.
I know 'twas but some peevish moon in him.
Go, Iet him be reIeas'd.
'Sfoot. How now, brother?
Your Grace doth pIease to speak beside your spIeen.
- I wouId it were so happy.
- Go, reIease him.
Oh, my good Lord,
I know the fauIt's too weighty and fuII of generaI Ioathing, too inhuman, rather by aII men's voices worthy...
Death. Death.
'Tis true too. Right, then.
Take this.
Doom shaII pass.
Direct this to the judges.
He shaII be dead 'ere many days.
- Make haste!
- AII speed that may be.
We couId have wish'd his burden not so sore.
We know your Grace did but deIay before.
It weII becomes that judge to nod at crimes that does commit greater himseIf... and Iives.
Many a beauty have I turn'd to poison for rejecting me... covetous of aII.
Age hot is Iike a monster to be seen.
My hairs are white, but yet my sins are green.
Brother, Iet my opinion sway you once,
I speak it for the best, to have him die.
Surest and soonest.
If the signature come unto the judges' hands, why, then his doom wiII be deferr'd tiII sittings and court days, juries and further.
Faiths are bought and soId.
Oaths in these days are but the skin of goId.
In troth, 'tis true too!
Then straight to the officers and Iet the judges wait.
'Tis but mistaking our father's meaning, and where he nam'd, 'Ere many days'.
'Tis but forgetting that and have him die... now.
CREAKING
SCREW FALLS TO FLOOR
Brothers? Are you there?
You!
You Iied to me!
You brought me to this pass.
If I'd Iied to you, wouId I now try to deIiver you?
You've been deceived but not by me.
If you'd as Iife stay here, then do.
I'II cIose the breach.
Oh, you commanded me to keep watch upon your envious brothers.
Know that they intend to speed your execution
Iest your father makes aIteration of his edict.
They want me kiIIed?
In a word.
I'm much indebted to your Iove for this.
O Liberty!
Thou sweet and heavenIy dame.
But heII for prison is too miId a name.
Officers, here is the Duke's signature.
We are sorry that we are so unnaturaIIy empIoy'd in such an unkind office.
Fitter far for enemies than brothers.
But you know, the Duke's command must be obey'd.
- This morning then. So suddenIy?
- Ay, aIas, poor good souI.
The executioner stands ready to put forth his cowardIy vaIour.
Ready?
Ready?
AIready, i'faith.
We'II take our Ieaves.
Our office shaII be sound. We'II not deIay the third part of a minute.
Therein you show yourseIves good men and upright officers.
Pray, Iet him die as private as he may.
Do that for him, for the gaping peopIe wiII but troubIe him at his prayers.
It shaII be done.
Why, we do thank you and if we Iive to be... you shaII have a better office.
Commend us to the scaffoId - in our tears.
We'II do your commendations.
Destruction hies.
Fine fooIs in office!
- Things faII out so fit.
- So happiIy!
'Ere next cIock, his head wiII be made serve a bigger bIock.
ExceIIent! Now I am heir,
Duke in a minute.
The faIIing of one head
Iifts up another.
The Duke's son was in here.
There is another one, two ceIIs down.
- But his death's not commanded.
- Let's have a Iook.
'My son', no name, save onIy that,
'my son'.
WeII, he is his son, though his neck's somewhat thicker.
Keeper?
My Lord.
No news IateIy from our brothers?
Are they unmindfuI of us?
My Lord, they Ieft a message whiIe you sIept.
What was it?
They said, be of good cheer, you wiII not be Iong a prisoner.
That brings me no comfort!
I shouId've Iook'd for my reIease had they been worth their oaths.
How now! What news?
Bad news, my Lord.
I am discharg'd of you.
SIave, caII'st thou that bad news?
I thank you, my brothers!
'TwiII prove so - this is the officer into whose hands I must commit you.
Pardon us, my Lord.
Our office must be sound.
Here is our warrant, signed by the Duke. You must prepare to die.
- Sure 'tis not so.
- It is too true.
I teII you 'tis not, for the Duke, my father, has deferr'd me tiII the next sitting and I Iook e'en every minute, threescore times an hour, for a reIease.
A trick wrought by my big brothers.
A trick, my Lord?
Your hopes are as fruitIess as a barren woman.
Your brothers brought this powerfuI token for your death.
My brothers?
Desire 'em hither! CaII 'em up, they shaII deny it to your faces.
They're Iong gone. The command they
Ieft, when grief swum in their eyes.
They were Iike brothers, fuII of heavy sorrow but the Duke must... have his pIeasure.
The hour beckons, my Lord.
Lift your eyes up to heaven.
Thank you, faith, good, pretty whoIesome counseI.
I shouId, er, Iook up to the, er, heavens, as you said, whiIst he behind me cheats me of my head!
Ey, ah? That's the trick.
You deIay too Iong, my Lord.
Stay, good authority's bastards.
If I must die through my brothers' perjury,
Iet me venom their souIs with curses!
'Tis no time to curse.
But my fauIt was sweet sport, which the worId approves!
I die for that which every woman Ioves.
No!
Is our conspiracy discover'd?
Drive over them.
- My long grief...
- Hush, brother. Listen. l will cut into short words.
Last reveIIing night, when fIoodIight made an artificiaI noon at Aintree, some courtiers at the match...
Oh, Christ. She's dead.
As coId in Iust as she is now in death, which that step-duchess' monster knew too weII.
Then, with a face more impudent than his vizard, he harried her amidst a throng of panders and fed the ravenous vulture of his lust!
Oh, death, to think on't!
She her honour forc'd, deem'd it a greater dowry to her name.
To die with poison than to live with shame.
BehoId, my Lords.
A sight that strikes man out of me.
I had not mark'd that before - a prayer book, with a page turn'd up, pointing to these words,
'MeIius virtute mori quam per dedicus vivere.'
'Better to die virtuous than to Iive dishonoured.'
'Tonio! 'Tonio!
'Tonio! 'Tonio! 'Tonio!
Look! Look!
The buIIet went in there. Back of the head. Not at point bIank range.
She'd need to be a doubIe-jointed octopus. She did not top herseIf.
And, and, and, I heard someone say there were two different buIIets.
So, er, what are you saying?
I'm saying the Duke's Iot saw her off.
Yeah, or Antonio's?
- The nobIe Lord Antonio's!
- Yeah, why not?
Stitch that!
- Was it suicide, then?
- Sure it was.
I wouId do the same if he shouId come near me.
- No, you wouIdn't.
- I wouId.
- You wouIdn't commit suicide.
- I wouId.
Are you a cockney?
What about you?
Of course I am, you three cornered hats.
He's a fuckin' cockney!
Sister.
Here he is!
Fuckin' 'eII!
Passengers are reminded that smoking is no longer permitted on Merseyrail trains or underground stations.
There is no safety here.
Here I am safest, here with my brothers.
Was not this execution rareIy pIotted?
I am the Duke's heir now.
You may thank my poIicy for that.
Your poIicy for what?
Was it not my invention, brother to sIip the judges, and in Iesser compass, advising you to sudden execution?
Heart, 'twas a thing
I thought on too.
You thought on't too!
SIander not your thoughts with gIorious untruth! 'Twas not so.
Sir, I say 'twas in my head.
Like your brains, ne'er to make their presence feIt as Iong as you Iiv'd.
You'd have the honour on't, that your wit Ied him to the scaffoId?
Since it is my due, I'II pubIish 't, but I'II have it in spite of you.
Methinks y'are too boId, you shouId IittIe remember us, next to be honest Duke.
ShouId be as easy for you to be Duke as to be honest, and that's never in faith.
WeII, coId he is by this time, because we're both ambitious.
Be it our amity, and Iet the gIory be shared equaIIy.
I am content to that.
Here's where our oIder brother's corse Iies in state.
ExceIIent!
Now brother, aII's sure our own.
Canst weep, think'st thou?
'TwouId grace our fIattery much.
Think of some dame.
I'II try.
Now for yourseIf.
Our sorrows are so fIuent.
Our eyes o'erfIow our tongues.
Words spoke in tears are Iike the murmurs of the waters.
The sound is IoudIy heard, but cannot be distinguish'd.
How died he, pray?
FuII of rage and spIeen!
He died most vaIiantIy then.
We're gIad to hear it.
- We couId not woo him once to pray.
- He show'd himseIf a gentIeman.
But instead of prayer, he, he drew forth oaths.
Then did he pray, dear, dear heart, aIthough you knew it not.
My Lords, e'en at his Iast, with pardon be it spoke, he curs'd you both.
He curs'd us? 'Las, good souI!
It was not in our power, but the Duke's pIeasure!
Now, my Lords.
- Sweet heaven, defend us!
- Sweet heaven, defend us!
Why do you shun me, brothers? The saviour of the prison has forsook me.
I thank such sweet Lords as yourseIves I'm free.
- In heaIth!
- ReIeas'd!
We are both e'en amaz'd with, with joy to, to see it.
We are much to thank thee.
Faith, we spar'd no tongue unto my Lord the Duke.
Your deIivery had not been haIf so sudden but for us.
God, how we pIeaded!
- My deserving brothers...
- No!
In my best dreams I wiII think on it.
Saw you not their guiIt, crawIing Iike maggots on the faces of dead men?
Be sure I did.
Oh, death and vengeance!
HeII and torments!
SIave, cam'st thou to deIude us?
DeIude you, my Lords?
ViIIain, whose is this corse now?
Why your brother and the Duke's son.
PIagues!
Confusions!
- Darkness!
- DeviIs!
Our younger brother.
There's no advantage in the kiIIing of a younger brother!
ViIIain, I'II kiII thee!
Fuck off, you cheap pair of bastards.
The deviI overtake thee!
Oh, fataI!
Oh, most prodigious to our bIoods!
Did we dissembIe?
Did we make our tears women for thee?
Laugh and rejoice for thee?
You had a wiIe, you had a trick, forsooth!
The cIap eat them! There's none of these wiIes ever come to any good.
There's nothing sure in mortaIity but mortaIity.
Whose fauIt is this catastrophe?
We know not, sir.
- The fates.
- Not us, sir.
We'II Ieave you to your grief, good sir.
ShaII I kiII him th' wrong side now?
No.
Sword, thou wast never a back-biter yet.
I'II pierce him to his face, he shaII die Iooking upon me.
My veins are sweII'd with Iust.
This shaII unfiII 'em.
Great men were gods if beggars couIdn't kiII 'em.
Sirrah, I know thee.
Come... Are you not a pandar, or a pimp?
Did you not provide a Iady for my son?
- I was commanded-
- Yeah, good, good.
Can you do Iikewise for me?
CouId you not meet me with a Iady in some fair pIace, veiI'd from the eyes of th' court, some darkened bIushIess angIe?
My Lord, I couId.
An unsunn'd Iodge wherein 'tis night at noon.
And a Iady. You know a Iady?
One with two heaven pointed diamonds set for eyes in a face.
Far far beyond the artificiaI shine of any woman's bought compIexion.
I had such a one before.
She wouId not consent unto my Iust.
I had to have her kiIIed.
I had my way with her, thereafter.
Sir... I wiII coIIect you.
Soon, soon. You wiII rest easy.
- Where's the Iady?
- You shaII be witness.
Be ready.
Stand with your hats off.
Ah!
Art thou beguiI'd now?
Have I not fitted the oId surfeiter with a quaint piece of beauty?
Age and bare bone are e'er aIIied in action.
Here's an eye abIe to tempt a great man to serve God.
A pretty, hanging Iip that has forgot now how to dissembIe.
This mouth shouId make a swearer trembIe, a drunkard cIasp his teeth and not undo 'em.
To suffer wet damnation.
Is this the form that Iiving shone so bright?
Oh fuckin' 'eII, mate.
What are you gonna do with her?
He had me once and now he shaII again!
Does every proud and seIf-affecting dame camphor her face for this and grieve her maker with sinfuI baths of miIk, when many an infant starves, for her superfIuous outside, aII for this?
Who now bids ¡Ì20 a night, prepares music, perfumes and sweetmeats?
AII are hush'd.
Thou mayst Iie chaste now!
It were fine to have thee seen at reveIs, forgetfuI feasts and uncIean brotheIs!
Sure, 'twouId fright the sinner and make him a good coward.
Put a reveIIer out of his antic ambIe and cIoy an epicure with empty dishes.
Here, might a scornfuI and ambitious woman
Iook through and through herseIf.
See, Iadies, with faIse forms you deceive men but you cannot deceive worms!
Up and down, up and down, tiII they're cIean and sparkIy.
What is it?
Poison.
You'II heIp me in my deadIy enterprise?
Thanks.
Thank you.
You have Ieave to Ieave me.
If I'm missed by the Duchess, say I am privateIy rid forth.
What, here?
GIRL SCREAMING
(SOFTLY) Someone's near.
Another pair of Iovers.
This is a most exceIIent pIace in which to score.
MOANING
Who's that?
- 'Tis her.
- What?
'Tis yours.
What Iady is't?
A country Iady, a IittIe bashfuI at first, but after the first kiss, the worst is past with them.
You know now what you have to do.
- She's a somewhat grave Iook.
- No, I Iove that best.
In gravest Iooks the greatest fauIts seem Iess.
Give me that sin that's rob'd in hoIiness.
Take this,
'twiII stiffen your resoIve.
Cover your eyes,
Iest her beauty bIind you.
Madam, his Grace wiII not be absent Iong.
Is aII truIy secret?
I heard another pair of Iovers.
Is that her? Her voice is sweet.
Secret? Never doubt us, madam.
'TwiII be worth three veIvet gowns to your Iadyship.
How sweet can a Duke breathe?
PIeasure dweIIs within a perfumed mist.
Oh, Iady, sweetIy encount'red.
Sir, be boId with me, kiss my Iips.
Madam, I wiII.
- What's this?
- RoyaI viIIain, white deviI!
Brother, give us Iight!
That his affrighted eyebaIIs may start unto those hoIIows.
Duke dost see yon dreadfuI vizard?
View it weII.
'Tis GIoriana's skuII, whom thou poisoned'st Iast.
- It has poisoned me!
- Didst not know that tiII now?
CaII treason!
Yes, my good Lord.
Treason, treason, treason!
Oh, then I'm betray'd!
Poor Iecher in the hands of knaves.
A sIavish Duke is baser than his sIaves.
My teeth are eaten out!
Hadst any Ieft?
Then those that did eat are eaten.
My tongue!
'TwiII teach you to kiss cIoser.
- You have eyes stiII?
- They hurt.
The piII was a potion to prevent bIinking.
I gave it that thou'd miss not one bIinking moment of aII this.
'Tis but earIy yet. Now I'II begin to stick thy souI with uIcers.
I wiII make thy spirit grievous sore.
It shaII not rest but Iike some pestiIent man toss in thy breast.
Mark me, Duke, thou'rt a renowned, high, and mighty cuckoId.
Had not that kiss a taste of sin?
Why, there's no pIeasure but 'tis sinfuI.
Nay, to affIict thee more, here in this Iodge, they meet for damned cIips.
Those eyes shaII see the incest of their Iips.
CarIo!
Sweet Christ!
Brother, I do appIaud thy constant vengeance, the quaintness of thy maIice above thought.
CASTIZA LAUGHING
The fIy-fIop of vengeance beat 'em to pieces!
This was the sweetest occasion, the fittest hour, to make my revenge.
Oh, my heart wears feathers that before wore Iead.
The Duke is dead, dead, dead, dead!
Over whose roof hangs this prodigious comet In deadIy fire?
- A bIessing on our enterprise.
- Sweet angeI of revenge.
HUMMING
Who has seen the Duke my Father?
You saw you my Lord and Father?
And you?
And you?
Or you? What of you?
WeII, weII, he's sure from court, but where, which way his pIeasure took, we know not, nor can hear on't.
I heard he privateIy rode forth.
'Twas wondrous private.
No-one in court has any knowIedge of it.
My husband is oId and sudden.
'Tis not treason to say he has a humour or such a toy about him.
I think he's privateIy rid forth from shame, from infamy, from this house of incestuous scheming.
Yo... Brother... Is that not... oh.
It's him!
I say, it is. Very nice, brother.
When the Duke sees this, you are...
The Duke is fIed from shame, and so the Duke is here, in my person.
- Never the Duke!
- UntiI he is returned!
UntiI he does return!
UntiI he is returned!
So...
Guards!
- Let her be kept cIose prisoner.
- I am not going to be kept-
- Guards, take both of them.
- Don't you touch my IittIe spud!
- Spud, go home!
- Bye, brother!
Are you so barbarous to set iron nippIes upon these breasts that gave you suck?
Yes.
Oh, am I not your mother?
Thou dost usurp that titIe now by fraud, for in that sheII of mother is a bawd.
Come on, Duchess.
Brother and Lords, what's for breakfast?
- Piss off.
- Oh, sorry, Iar...
Shocking news broke today, as the Duchess and her son, Spurio were found in a compromising position.
Our own dam was the worser.
The Duchess made a whore out of herseIf, our ma a whore out of her daughter.
The Duke's son's great concubine!
A drab of state, a cIoth-a'-siIver sIut.
To have her train borne up and her souI traiI I' th' dirt.
Great! Never just the Duke's son.
First begins with one hen after, to 1000 proves a whore.
'Break ice in one pIace, it wiII crack in more.'
Oh, thou for whom no name is bad enough!
Son? Is this my son come back?
And do you know me now?
Wicked unnaturaI parent!
Fiend of women!
Did not the Duke's son direct a feIIow of the worId's condition hither, that did corrupt thee, made thee unciviIIy forget thyseIf and work our sister to his Iust?
Who, I? That had been monstrous!
I defy that man for any such intent, ain't none Iives so pure but shaII be soiI'd with sIander.
- Good son, beIieve it not.
- He was that man!
You?
My own son, tricked me?
In that disguise,
I was sent by the Duke's son.
He tried you and found you base metaI as any viIIain might have done.
A rich man tricked a beggar.
This is news, is it? It's good?
NimbIe in damnation, quick in tune.
There's no deviI couId strike fire so soon!
Sons! Forgive me.
To my own seIf I'II prove true.
You that shouId honour me,
I kneeI to you.
Nay. Brother, it rains,
'twiII harm your dagger. House it.
'Tis done.
I'faith, 'tis a sweet shower, it does much good.
Rise, mother, troth, this shower has made you higher.
To weep is to our sex naturaIIy given, but to weep truIy, that's a gift from heaven.
Nay, I'II kiss you now.
Kiss her, brother.
Let's marry her to our souIs, wherein's no Iust and honourabIy Iove her.
Let it be.
I'II give you this, that one I never knew.
PIead better for and against the deviI than you.
Thou make me proud on't.
- Thy name, I have forgot it.
- Vindici, my Lord.
- 'Tis a good name.
- Yeah, a revenger.
It does betoken courage, thou shouIdst be vaIiant and kiII thine enemies.
That's my hope, my Lord.
CHUCKLES
TeII me, what has made thee so meIanchoIy?
Why?
To think how a great, rich man Iies a-dying and a poor cobbIer toIIs the beII for him or how a usuring father boiIs in heII and his son-and-heir, with a whore, dances over him.
There is hope in you for discontent and want is the best cIay to mouId a viIIain of.
You know I might advance you and buiId fair your fortunes for it might be in me to rear up towers from cottages.
I wiII unbrace such a cIose, private viIIain unto your vengefuI sword, the Iike ne'er heard of.
What's his sin?
He is a royaI Iecher.
RoyaI... and a Iecher and royaIIy a Iecher.
More than once when one wouId not consent unto his Iust, he had them poisoned.
What's his name?
You know him.
Oh, thou aImighty patience,
'tis my wonder that such a feIIow, impudent and wicked, shouId not be cIoven as he stood or with some secret wind burst open!
Is there no thunder Ieft, or is't kept up in stock for some heavier vengeance?
THUNDER RUMBLES
There it goes!
- What?
- Nothing.
Thunder.
- I have imprison'd my own mother.
- I know.
If the Duke returns then 'tis treason.
Oh, yeah.
If?
If... he comes not back...
Who shaII be Duke then?
Me! I shaII.
Did I not say so?
I think you did.
So swear!
- You stiII Iove swearing.
- Swear!
My Lord, it shaII be so.
SCREAMING
Thus much by wit a deep revenger can puII off.
When murder's known to be the fardest off.
Oh, viIIain!
Oh, rogue!
Oh, sIave! Oh, rascaI!
Reverend majesty.
My father the Duke murdered.
- OId Dad dead.
- His Iips are gnawn with poison.
Where was that sIave that did affirm to us?
My Lord, the Duke was privateIy rid forth?
Oh, pardon me, my Lord, he gave that charge upon my Iife to answer thus if he was miss'd at court.
In fact, he was with a Iady.
Heavens, that faIse charge was his death!
No.
Impudent beggar, durst you to our face maintain such a faIse story?
Bear him straight to execution!
It's not right.
You've sentenced boIIocks...
Urge me no more. In this the excuse may be caII'd haIf the murther.
Away, Iet it be done.
My Lord, we're something boId to know our duty.
Your father's accidentaIIy departed.
The titIes that were due to him meet you.
Meet me?
I am not at Ieisure, my good Lord.
I've many griefs to dispatch.
WeIcome, sweet titIes.
Lords, taIk to me of sepuIchers and mighty emperors' bones, that's thought for me.
My Lord, it is your shine must comfort us.
AIas, I shine in tears
Iike the ApriI sun.
You are now my Lord's Grace.
I perceive you'II have it so.
'Tis, but your own.
Hooray for our brother the Duke.
Hooray! Hooray!
Hooray!
Then heavens give me grace to be so.
Hooray!
In the mean season, Iet us bethink the Iatest funeraI honours due to the dead Duke's coId body, and withaI, caIIing to memory our new happiness spread in his royaI son.
GentIemen, Lords... prepare for reveIs.
Time hath severaI faIIs.
Griefs Iift up joys and feasts put down funeraIs.
ReveIs, reveIs...
Yes! Leave me... to my grief.
One thing. That girI.
Castiza. The one I tried but faiIed to woo.
Now that you're Duke, you'II have no need of her.
- You can have any that you choose.
- I choose her.
Now I have no need to woo.
Now I command.
Echo! Echo! Echo!
- Is she here?
- She comes, my Lord.
She wiII come, certainIy.
I'II see to that.
I'm not pIeas'd by that iII-knotted fire, that bushing, fIaring star.
- Am not I Duke?
- Yes, yes, you are, yes.
They say, whom art and Iearning weds, when stars wear Iocks, they threaten great men's heads.
So, pIease your Grace, it shows great anger.
That does not pIease my Grace.
Yet here's the comfort, my Lord.
Many times when it seems most, it threatens fardest off.
Faith... and I think so too.
Here, take this. I'II start my
Dukedom with my mother's banishment.
Hooray!
Castiza, a virgin's honour is a crystaI tower which being weak is cIoseIy guarded with good spirits untiI she baseIy yieIds no iII inherits.
HippoIito, shut up.
'Know that I am now at Iast come to be the Duke.
Let it be known that you no Ionger hoId the titIe 'Mother' for crimes of incest and for crimes of intriguing against this state.
I, the Duke, banish thee, woman, to withdraw yourseIf beyond the bounds of the gracious state of our great city!
Know that I am now at Iast come to be the Duke...'
Shut up!
'..and with the titIes and grace that descends upon me, Iet it be known that you no Ionger hoId the titIe, 'Mother'!'
Is that fiery thing stiII there?
'When beggars die, there are no comets seen!'
You're gracefuIIy estabIish'd with the Ioves of your subjects and for naturaI death, I hope it be threescore year a-coming.
True. No more but threescore year?
- Fourscore I hope, my Lord.
- And fivescore.
I hope, my Lord, that you shouId never die.
Give me thy hand.
These others I rebuke. He that hopes so, is fittest for a Duke.
Thou shaIt sit next to me.
Take thy pIaces, Lords.
We are ready for sports.
Let 'em set on.
You thing, we shaII forget you quite anon!
Our brother shaII not Iive.
His hair shaII not grow much Ionger.
Saws't thou yon new moon?
It shaII out-Iive the new Duke by much.
This hand shaII dispossess him then we are mighty!
Is't so? 'Twas very good.
Do you think to be Duke then, kind brother?
I'II see fair pIay drop one and there Iies t'other.
'Tis weII.
Brothers and bastard, you dance next in heII.
- A voIunteer.
- Me! Pick me! Me! Me!
Who'II be our voIunteer?
Pick me. Me. No, don't pick him.
PistoIs! Treason! Guards! HeIp!
- My Lord, the Duke, is murder'd!
- No, I'm not.
Surgeons!
- Surgeons! Surgeons!
- How now?
- Murdered?
- Murdered!
How fares, my Lord?
FareweII to aII.
He that cIimbs highest has the greatest faII.
- My tongue is out of office.
- Air, gentIemen!
Thou'It not prate on't,
'twas Vindici murdered thee.
- Which one is he?
- Me!
- Thee?
- TeII nobody.
Whose groan was that?
That's thee and thy Father to my account.
Great heavens, the Duke's departed!
Here's a Iabour sav'd. I thought to have sped him. How came this?
Then I procIaim myseIf now I am Duke.
Thou Duke?
Reverend majesty!
Brother, thou Iiest.
SIave, so dost thou!
Base viIIain, has thou sIain my Lord and master?
A piteous tragedy... abIe to make an oId man's eyes bIoodshot.
Oh, unhand her there.
Most fitting reveIs.
This one kiIIed aII these.
None but Spurio, I and maybe Supervacuo.
It was a girI who kiIIed the Duke.
A deadIy hand wounded him.
The rest, ambitious who shouId ruIe and sway after his death were quickIy made away.
'Tonio! 'Tonio! 'Tonio! 'Tonio!
AII our hope Iies in you. Your hair wiII make the siIver age again.
When there was fewer but more honest men.
The burden's weighty and wiII press age down.
May I so ruIe that heaven may keep the crown.
The rapes of your Iady and of mine, have been quitted with death on death - my work is done.
Here's the payment.
God speed.
WiII you not stay?
Aye... um, stay a minute Ionger, huh?
Of aII things, it puts me most to wonder, how the oId Duke came murd'red.
'Twas aII done for the best.
AII for your Grace's good.
We may be so boId to speak it now.
'Twas somewhat wittiIy carried, tho' I say it.
I murd'red him.
- You?
- WeII, we, two.
None eIse, twas I aIone.
If you Iook into his ribs, you'II find my knife.
Thanks. I have soreIy missed it.
- Lay hands on those viIIains!
- These others knew nothing.
- Bear them to execution.
- That's my son!
Heart, my Lord, was't not for thy good?
- My good?
- You shouId be offering us titIes.
Away with 'em!
An oId man such as he.
You that wouId murder him wouId murder me.
- Look to the Duke!
- Get back!
Get back!
Is't come about?
'Sfoot, brother, you began!
May not we set as weII as the Duke's son? Thou hast no conscience.
Are we not reveng'd? Is there one enemy Ieft amongst those?
'Tis time to die when we ourseIves our foes.
When murderers shut deeds cIose, this curse does seaI 'em;
If none discIose 'em, we ourseIves reveaI 'em!
This murder might have sIept in tongueIess brass but not for ourseIves, and the worId died an ass.
Now, my Lord...
Since we are in forever, this work was ours which eIse might have been sIipp'd.
If we Iist, we might have nobIes cIipp'd and go for Iess than beggars, but we hate to bIeed so cowardIy.
We have enough, i'faith.
We're weII our mother turn'd, our sister true.
We die... after a nest of Dukes.
Shit!
Adieu.
Adieu.
Revenge! Revenge!
Revenge! Revenge! Revenge!
Revenge! Revenge! Revenge!
VlNDlCl: Why, brother, this is fate.
CARLO: lt is, but whose?
VlNDlCl: l set my fate at naught so that l have revenge, revenge...
At the Berlin Conference in 1885
Africa was divided.
Congo, became the personal property of Belgian King Leopold I.
On June 30, 1960, the nationalist
Patrice Lumumba, 36, became
The first Prime Minister of the new independent state.
He would last only months.
This is a true story.
Nobody knew about that night in Katanga.
Nobody was allowed to know.
Their mission was clear.
Retrieve three bodies and then disappear.
No grave, no memory...
Even in death they were afraid of me.
Will you help me?
The children may not know everything that happened, do you?
They probably wouldn't understand.
Tell them not ...
Say nothing.
You acted in the name of Congo, but not your party
Is not representative.
- It's now Lumumba's turn.
Let him continue talking.
Right,
The MNC does not represent
 every Congolese. Not yet.
But Tshombe of CONAKAT 
Katanga does not represent all of Congo.
Our party is big, yours is nothing.
There are 250 parties in Congo.
Plus those founded by the Belgians.
Mr. Kasavubu could take power
 but he does not have support in Accra.
But what am I to do give out visas?
Why did the government go it alone?
Ask them.
So you could sell your Polar beer to the Minister.
He could have 51% of the vote.
I did not know.
You know many things, starting with the protocol.
Is this a joke?
Not at all.
Please read the full text of my speech, not in newspapers.
I should talk about you and your rich province.
But I do not see the Congo as tribes and provinces, but as a whole.
We need to move beyond provincialism.
Do we have to hear your speech once again?
Do you think you're still in Accra?
You are two people, I represent many more.
We have 10,000 people. I could get CONAKAT not to mention Tshombe if you like.
At the next Pan-African
Conference
I will be happy to talk about your big party.
He derides.
- Your irony is inappropriate and insulting.
I can only say:
Read my speech.
Or not. But there will be no rewrite.
You travel a far to sell your beer.
Stay away from my region.
Because we do not forget.
Yes, I made some mistakes.
And it would all end badly.
We thought it our destiny to decide our country's fate but other, more powerful enemies were in control.
Why did they fear me so much?
When they eventually killed me, they made me more important.
I was but one vote for the dream of freedom and fraternity.
Words they could not accept.
But they were just words.
Everything was nevertheless a good start.
Do you remember?
I came from Stanleyville
A colonial administrative clerk, third class.
I was 30 and at the height of my career.
But my job was not
What I had imagined,
But I suppose I shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth.
Patrice Lumumba.
You can speak to the people.
Such a person we need.
The people here are hard.
After the triumph of Kasavubu some businesses flourished,
But not ours ...
We are on our last legs.
If you can do things to help business resume ...
It is even said that our beer causes impotence.
That is how far they will go.
If you can save the business
You will get a salary of Deputy Director.
Good salary, right?
It's very good, Director.
Within a month we will need to see improvements.
Can I do what I want?
- If you want ...
Come closer, my friends.
Test, it's free.
Girls?
- Beer, slyboots.
And not just beer. The best!
The King of beers. Polar!
I sold beer. Why not?
Polar or Primus, they all left me cold.
I was in the capital, that is what was important.
I love Primus.
Long live King Kasa.
Here is the competition.
Long live Congo!
Long Live Free Congo!
Long live independence!
That's strong language. Come here.
Take a Polar. At my expense.
When I met Joseph, he was an army sergeant but also an aspiring journalist.
And you?
- Joseph-Desire Mobutu.
To our health.
To our future!
He was not Mobutu Sese Seko
Kuku Ngwendu Wasahanga,
Father of the Nation.
Not yet.
Congo was still a Belgian colony.
Lumumba?
- Here I am. 
Along there.
Name?
Lumumba. Patrice, Emery.
You 're judicial file.
And you hope to travel?
Is that my visa?
Yes, you're lucky. Or have good connections.
Fork on the left!
Indigenous children learn to work and study, but are only interested in relaxation.
I do not speak Flemish!
Can you open this?
If the teacher loses the pedals, take over the primitive methods ...
Like only a small handful of others
I got my card identifying me as a "civilized person".
She showed me just how to buy alcohol in the European quarter.
Throughout the DRC?
- It wsa very Congo.
For political Lessons we used the gym, the association of employees, the association's indigenous staff and the Congregation of the Virgin.
No collaboration, but civil disobedience.
80 years is enough!
First the slave trade, the ivory trade and then killing for rubber.
Now we sell diamonds, copper, manganese and zinc.
Everyone knows that independence is imminent.
Uhuru! Viva! Viva!
Independence!
Do you remember it now?
The year 1959?
With its enthusiasm, the anger and its violence?
What nobody predicted was that everything would change.
MNC in the middle.
We will see that later.
It's King Baudouin. Come and listen.
They will admit.
... that everything leads to this one decisive step
In the life of
Our African peoples.
I owe it to my illustrious predecessors, the pioneers of our work in Africa ...
Do they keep anything on hand.
No, they've lost the north.
Then they have lost.
De Gaulle has admitted that little Belgium has no choice.
We're going to eat them!
You know, Maurice, they will think you were are cannibal.
A what?
Someone who eats human flesh.
If that is so,
I will begin immediately.
We decided for Congo without delay, and without haste ...
Run!
... that without which a democratic regime there is nothing more than deceit and tyranny.
Let him go!
To do this you will pay!
6 months later
Look.
The director was right.
He is smuggling out messages.
Bastard!
"I strongly protest ...
I demand my release as leader of MNC I am a delegate and participate in the Round Table
In Brussels. "
The pretentious monkey!
Do you think we are so stupid as to release you while show subversive behavior the very reason you're here?
You sit for two years and we take care of you, boy.
Do you see yourself in Brussels?
What would you say to the King?
What would you say to Bwana Kitoko?
He wants to be minister.
They all want to be minister.
Want to be decorated?
We'll decorate you.
Want to be called Excellency?
Is that it monkey?
Should we say Sir?
We found this.
Why is he bleeding?
- As usual. He protested.
We intervened and he defended himself.
Mr. Lumumba,
I've received orders from Brussels.
The Minister of Congo has requested that you are present at the Round Table Conference.
You are free to go.
Tomorrow there is a plane to Brussels.
Take it.
Patrice, welcome!
Good to see you.
How are you?
Will you go and meet Mr. Kasavubu?
- I will meet all Aboko representatives.
How is your relationship with Mr. Kasavubu?
- Very good.
Do you want to meet with European investors?
- Of course.
What are your expectations?
- They are high.
Will you meet with the Belgian Ministers?
I'm just a poor woman.
There are millions of us.
In their name I salute a freedom fighter.
Thank you, ma'am.
Do you think the MNC has a chance?
Were you wounded on board?
- In prison. It's nothing.
Tell me about Brussels.
- It's a beautiful city.
I mean the Round Table.
- Everyone is talking about you.
Which room?
- Room three!
There are no more oranges.
Three Flamingos in 1926.
Who goes to the third floor?
- Send Mathieu.
I do Bomboko.
What you see in this clown?
He has class.
- No, gratuities.
Make way!
There's work to be done.
No, no, no you can not leave now.
It's not over yet.
Back to top.
- Let us go.
Mr. Lumumba will meet you at 7 pm
Not now.
What do you mean
"Vague impulses independence"?
It's a reality.
Yes, it is stretchable.
It is not our fault that the date is not yet known.
Mr. Kasavubu, how nice to meet you.
I say that it is a crime.
You attach too much importance to a word.
Independence. A word?
God is a word but I believe it.
So we will end up giving the Congo to the Communists.
As France did in Algeria.
Anyone without a political mandate is to leave.
Men ...
Joseph, did you hear me?
- I do not understand.
I am a MNC deputy.
- But aren't you studying in Belgium?
Yes, but ...
This is for delegates from Congo.
I am a MNC deputy.
Joseph, it is the Rules of the Common Front.
Let them experiment with freedom.
Either way they will give Africa one of two lessons,
The European example of united, hardworking nation ... or the other primitive, that has been surpessed will return.
And then ...
And then?
We have an army, militias, planes, tanks.
We have the two largest parties.
We should take a common position.
You think to show a compromise?
Independence on June 15?
The minister will refuse.
Would you like us to give way on a date?
A Common Front would give us more coverage.
They want to save time.
Why?
Do they need to prepare their retreat?
Or to plot against us?
Conspiracy dismantlement?
Union Miniere in Katanga.
The copper, the diamonds ...
They will leave that to our government?
We have no government.
Wait for the elections.
We're not there yet.
I ask you
What should they do with independence?
It's not a nation, it strains already.
The Lulua's hate the Baluba's
Baluba's hate and the Bakongo's.
And canthe Bakongo and the Bengala's tolerate eachother?
The colonial administration holds them together.
And when that disappears.
- What then?
We must not make the same mistake as the French.
With their African executives.
Judges, police, the postal service.
All high positions are held by Belgians.
Without them, there will be chaos.
Good, good.
It is June 30 then.
Independence's a fact.
There remains one question: will she be federalist, as you want, or unitarian, as I want.
I will make a press release and we will both sign.
Let me read the text first.
Do you know the latest hit?
Leopoldville, May 1960
We won.
Their coalitions failed.
We did well?
- Even better than Abako.
In Leopoldville too?
- Of course not.
What is "president", Daddy?
- Nothing. Eat.
We must continue.
Until the end.
You do not know what you say, Maurice.
Anyway.
Half a revolution is not possible.
We must throw out the Flemish.
Expropriate the missionaries.
Chase out all the parasites
All the officer castes.
And who will replace them?
They can go to hell!
We did not need them.
You will not have it easy.
I know, but one thing must be clear.
Should I show a government form or is it to be an information circular? an Information Round with an eye to forming the government second.
I do not understand it yet.
The independence ceremony is on June 30.
If we have no government, as my unofficial mission is ...
It's an official mission.
Let me organize things as I was told by His Majesty.
Information first, then formation.
All in good time.
I will do my best.
But remember, time is short.
Good luck, Mr. Information.
I accuse Minister Ganshof and the duplicity of the Belgian Government, which I consider as dangerous to me and the government I want to form.
Brussels prefers a Congo without a leader on June 30
Instead of a Lumumba government.
In these circumstances there will be no head of state to on June 30.
Neither from my party nor our allies
The appointment will need
Mr. Kasavubu approval.
CONAKAT, but not Tshombe.
The coalition will not stand days.
Even as Commissioner of the Katanga province?
We can find better.
For Finance I accept your candidate.
But I want Thomas Kanza as Minister at the V.N.
His father was last year expelled from our party.
It gives me no pleasure.
The son is not the father.
He'll do a good job.
Gentlemen ...
Today is the day.
The Nationalist Block which I chair, will put forward the candidacy of Mr. Kasavubu for the post of President of the Republic.
I never disputed that it deserves that title.
My first act will be the appointment
Mr. Lumumba as Prime Minister of the Government of National Unity.
Unity, which is what the Congo now needs.
Is it not true that Katanga is not represented in the government?
Do you not fear separation?
Katanga is represented.
More than Tshombe in Katanga and Munungo.
No more questions.
Congo is united and will remain so.
Is that enough?
United or not, we want to emphasize this.
And money! And comfort!
And no more Flemish people who give orders!
No more bullying!
It's enough!
Moreover, we must cut their grass and our wives do their dishes.
We get so little bit and we do everything.
Come on. Sit with us.
We can not directly change anything.
I asked for a general amnesty to the king and promotions for you.
June 30 will be shown to be a memorable day.
Without distinction of rank, province or tribe.
For the unified nation.
United!
I'm going to sleep. Until tomorrow.
It's Tshombe and the full CONAKAT party.
I'll go back to Elizabeth City.
Yesterday I waited all day for the list of ministers.
You promised me that you'd send them to me.
We sent them on.
- Liar!
What's he saying?
- Slow down, Maurice.
Apparently you already know the list?
A lot of extremists.
We will use all the means of the unified structures of the country to fight.
All resources?
And you will deny the democratic vote?
- I suppose you'd prefer Communism.
Communism ...
We are no more communist than you
Do not argue with them, Thomas. They are fascists.
I do not like that tone!
That's independence.
Well, we're not done.
What a lot of dust!
Can we be that bad that we cannot leave a few paintings?
But they are owned by the Belgian state.
It's a direct order.
Run for your life. The Bantus are here.
Sire, they give away your Congo and make a pigsty.
They even showed them the wine cellar.
The governor has not bored of it.
Does no one answer the phone?
No, Governor Cornelis does not live here anymore.
He does not live here anymore.
This is the residence of Patrice Lumumba,
Prime Minister of Congo.
Already five months
I have not slept.
Are you tired, Daddy?
Give me that.
Read this and tell me what you think.
What time is it?
When will the car be here?
It cannot happen, Sir!
And not because I chair the ceremony, but because it's provocative.
Who provoked the first?
I have the speech of the King and the President is not in support.
They've refused an amnesty,
A symbolic gesture that is essential for the ceremony.
I appointed you as President of the Senate because I thought you had character.
Am I to be made wrong?
You need him to give the word.
Kasa Once is finished,
Patrice takes the microphone.
They should stay and listen.
You want the King, General Janssens, the bishop ...
The King, the General, the Bishop ...
That I forgot.
Exactly. Let them listen to the truth.
That's something different. For everyone.
Good.
Patrice, do you really have to say?
The independence of the Congo is the continuation of a process that resulted from the genius of King Leopold I, by him with growing courage a process started and was continued with conviction by Belgium.
When Leopold I began this enormous work, now completed, 
He did not do so as the conqueror but as an advocate of civilization.
It's up to you, gentlemen, to prove that we were right to trust you.
Avoid the name of the King.
Avoid rapid reforms and not replace Belgian institutions unless you are certain you can do better.
Gentlemen, the eyes of the world are on you.
May God protect the Congo!
Excellencies, dear compatriots,
Now, officially, the Republic of Congo appears on the world map, a fully independent and sovereign ...
Patrice, it's too dangerous.
You've improved.
You know what you're doing?
Do you really think you can tackle them?
- You heard him.
We must respond.
What will our children remember?
Kasa answers.
Listen to what he says.
Sire, your presence on this memorable day proves once again your concern for the people you loved and protected.
We will not disappoint you.
My dear compatriots, victors of the independence struggle,
For this independence of the Congo, even as it is celebrated today with Belgium a friendly country with whom we deal as equal to equal no Congolese worthy of the name will ever be able to forget that it was by fighting that it has been won a day-to-day fight, an ardent and idealistic fight, a fight in which we were spared neither privation nor suffering, and for which we gave our strength and our blood.
We are proud of this struggle, of tears, of fire, and of blood, to the depths of our being, for it was a noble and just struggle, and indispensable to put an end to the humiliating slavery which was imposed upon us by force because we were black.
Who could forget the shootings which claimed so many victims, the cells in which those were locked up who escaped the bullets of the soldiers that were used to dominating us?
All this, brethren, has made us suffer and our wounds are too fresh and painful to erase them from our memory.
All this, brethren, we proclaim loudly, is now forever and ever behind us.
The Congolese Republic has been declared.
Our country belongs to our children.
We are now all able to benefit from social justice and our children will benefit from our country.
Your Majesty,
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, compatriots, fellow strugglers, black brothers that is what I have wanted to say.
Long live independence and African Unity!
Long live the independent
Congo and its sovereignty!
There! Let's get him
And teach him a lesson!
Treason!
Get out!
Accelerate!
Let's go!
These are but isolated incidents.
Hardy also has a rebel camp.
The officers have been taken hostage.
They want you
They say they want to kill you.
Unbelievable.
What about Jones?
Silence.
Get your reports.
We will carry out all investigations calmly.
Minister Mpolo.
The Force Publique has 25,000 men.
They have stations aligned along the same wavelength.
They know everything in each camp before their officers.
They are crazy!
What do they want?
They want promotions!
I know, I heard them.
If I may, Prime Minister, they are tired.
Five months on end: riots, celebrations ...
- The Flemish General,
Janssens, puts them against us.
And he is against African officers.
Let us shoot him.
- There is no replacement.
I suggest Senator Lundula.
And you, Mpolo as Colonel.
Let us take a vote.
I will not vote for someone who wants to shoot anyone.
Even that is not military.
Mr. Prime Minister,
I was 7 years in the Force Publique.
I do not deny his qualities, but I think I am more proficient ...
- An excellent suggestion.
The new commander must come from its own ranks.
What is that?
Let us in!
We want the minister to speak first!
They are crazy! What do they want?
Where is the military discipline?
There they are!
Excellence ...
We do nothing. We have a petition.
We want an answer. Directly from you.
Give me the petition.
I will study it.
No, Sir! We want an answer now!
"We wish our military to be disciplined to carry out our mission and accuse General Janssens of unfair behavior.
We demand honesty and impartiality, which is impossible with officers in the Congolese army."
You mean white officers?
We do not want them!
- Black officers!
No officers!
I understand that you want equality and justice.
But I do not yield weapons.
I ask you to return to your barracks.
We have a strong, obedient army.
We've heard it all!
Jones speaks so!
- Answer now!
You are not even in mutual agreement.
I understand your indignation.
And I will got to 
Leopold and speak to the camp, in the morning. You have my word.
Now I ask you to return to your barracks.
Come on then, shoot.
You will come to Camp Leopold?
I promise you
We have 15 white officers hostage and their wives.
If you do not come,
We will murder them.
Gentlemen, the meeting is not over.
Hey, you there!
Damn Flemish!
Wait!
Maxence, come in!
They do not scare me.
I will write down their numbers.
You'll see what happens!
Idiot!
You hear me, motherfucker?
Dork!
Losers!
You're a disgrace' to the regiment.
You are not alone.
There are assholes everywhere, across the province.
In Madimba a white woman was raped.
They were shot!
You shame the Force Publique.
You are arrested.
Take them away!
Let me be clear.
Independence is for the citizens.
For soldiers there is only discipline.
Before June 30 you had white officers.
After June 30 you still have white officers.
It may be that the politicians said something
 else, but they lied.
I have always told the truth.
And if you do not understand
I will write it for you.
After independence equals for independence.
What are you saying, white?
So you will not go.
They have deceived us.
They lied.
We will not go.
Are you coming to bed?
I must finish.
You will sleep again at your desk.
Do not worry.
How can I not worry?
You sleep no more than 2 hours a night.
I will start to think that you are actually using marijuana.
They say that?
You have no idea what the servants tell me.
You have to be strong for the children.
If something were to happen to me ...
General, you know why you're here?
I wait until you tell me.
And I await your explanation.
I got the telegram.
- That's obvious.
Excellency!
- Excuse me?
You say, Excellency.
I want to know what you mean by:
"I myself do not contradict nor repeated.
Please consider this as a final warning. "
A General in Belgium obeys his superiors
So speak?
Excuse me, sir.
In Belgium there is order.
Here we are heading for disaster, and there is chaos.
Because your men and your methods are tired.
The Force Publique has to change like the rest.
I expect your resignation.
Mr. Lumumba ...
Excellence ...
- I've said what I have to say ...
General.
Get out!
Flemish or Walloon?
- Walloons.
100 francs.
- Why?
What's going on?
Nothing.
- Why, sir?
The Belgian ambassador.
Let him through the garden.
Do you have news, Mr. Ambassador?
Nothing that you do not know.
It's bad.
You were chased out of Camp Leopold.
But order will be restored.
I do not know what order you want, but I still cannot watch while my countrymen are murdered.
If you do not have the means, I do, and they are at your disposal.
An intervention?
- The situation is serious.
You can ask assistance from Belgium.
You have the right.
- I have a different opinion.
If you refuse, I will have to consult with our Atlantic partners.
Do you understand?
- Not yet.
But this is what I've decided.
First, General Janssens should leave Congo within 24 hours.
Secondly, you should warn him and guarantee his departure.
Thirdly, you are responsible for his actions during his departure.
He served Congo, Your Excellency.
He deserves respect and courtesy.
- Courtesy!
It's the fault of the Belgians: the uprising in the Camp, in this City
Camp Leopold, Elizabeth City ...
You spread rumours of a Soviet invasion...
Since the beginning
You've worked to conspire against me.
And now you threaten me with the U.N. and NATO
In the middle of the night to the Prime Minister!
Tomorrow I will hold a press conference and make your conspiracy, threats and insults public.
I've been advised to go to Brazzaville, but count me out.
Belgians will murder me there.
I complain and you become angry.
Allow me but I find that strange.
Then, I would ask you to leave.
I hereby absolve General Janssens.
For his own good and safety.
I ask him the travel by air at the first available opportunity.
I appoint Major Victor Lundula to
Supreme Commander of the Force Publique
I have also promoted Joseph Mobutu to colonel.
The Force Publique is now
The Congolese National Army.
The Belgians are worried.
How will you fight the atrocities?
These difficulties are inevitable.
They are caused by a few agitators and a big misunderstanding.
I have decided to stop them
President Kasavubu and myself
I will make a journey of peace throughout the country.
Are you going to Katanga?
- Everywhere.
Elisabethville, Coquilhatstad,
Stanleyville, Luluaburg ...
But I warn the
Belgian Government the situation must not be misused for a military intervention or to encourage riots.
Only had work can make us move forward.
Those who refuse to see and sabotage us, are enemies of the people.
What does Mr. Tshombe say about it?
- Will you go to U.N. ?
"Katanga, our beautiful and prosperous
Province, the largest source ...
... The main source of our wealth. "
What time is it in Elizabeth City?
Just as late in Luluaburg?
No idea. I only hope that this is the last stop.
We've travelled everywhere, all in 10 days.
I'm tired of this plane.
Congo is too big for us.
Do not say that. Congo is big and requires great things.
But it is not too large.
"Who says secession, says treason."
We're descending?
Airport Elizabeth City refuses to let us land.
I repeat, you can not land.
Orders from the government of Katanga.
What government?
This is it. Secession.
We can receive President Kasa Vubu, but the traitor Patrice Lumumba will never set foot in Katanga.
- That's Munongo.
Begin our descent.
- Impossible.
Do what I say!
- Impossible.
They have placed a truck on the runway.
We can not but go back.
We have underestimated Tshombe.
He does not do this alone.
The Belgians have encouraged him.
What do we do now?
We can choose war, shame, resignation and the loss of 70% of our resources.
We have no choice.
We must suppress the uprising.
By Union Miniere, the entire financial world is involved.
Imagine. The whole of Katanga.
It's 16 times bigger than Belgium.
They do not get such a gift.
We will call on the U.N..
Is that the best solution?
For a military operation the Russians ...
The Russians, and have them say that I a 
Communist puppet. The CIA would surely murder me?
What a calm.
It is wonderful, the silence.
Why are we going to Njili?
We said Stanleyville.
I got other directions.
You are under our command.
We decide not you.
I am Belgian, Excellency.
Attention!
Mr. President, Where do you want the troops to take up position?
Is it a trap.
It is strange that the President has these troops to behold?
No way!
Go provide a car.
Mr. President, our troops are here in order to honor and protect you.
You need them to take up position.
We refuse. You are no longer with you
Mr. President,
We welcome you with the honor you deserve.
Never mind. Go away.
Mr. President, you do not speak against "one" Belgian officer.
Look at those women.
They were raped by your troops.
Our men were assaulted.
You shame Africa and the world.
We are here to protect our citizens.
There should be no flow of blood.
If blood is flowing tonight, you are responsible.
Murderers!
- Bastards!
Murderers, sadists!
You raped nuns and white women!
The humiliation would not end.
They were ready for anything.
Even sacrificing their own citizens.
They needed someone to blame for all this.
They had, at any cost, the rebel silenced.
Hands on your head!
Out!
Get down!
Paratroopers!
The Belgian paratroopers are everywhere!
The white officers have hidden the ammunition!
They removed the paratroopers there!
Send troops to the airport!
Let the Russians come are not countries!
They've evacuated their families!
They will kill us all!
Is this photograph necessary?
Do not worry.
We'll pay for everything.
It will be in every ministry, every school every store and bar.
Excuse me.
We will not make it.
We follow him in two months.
Fix it?
- It's war, Patrice.
The U.N. is talking about genocide.
The U.N. is manipulated the U.S.A..
Anyway,
There are hundreds of deaths.
You had Kasai recaptured with no organized massacre.
And what have you achieved?
Most of leaders have fled to Katanga.
We checked Kasai.
- It was one massacre.
War means killing, kill or be killed. That's the price.
Who pays?
Always the same!
So far I've got you covered.
But I do not support such atrocities.
Mr. Prime Minister ...
- Enough comedy!
I am a soldier and an officer.
I have proven this.
I took over the Force Publique.
I follow orders ... if any.
And if there are none ...
I make my own decisions.
Women, children, old people. Trapped in a church and killed?
Is that what you decided?
Answer!
No, obviously not.
But this is war.
And a war is always dirty.
It makes people crazy with fear.
And at such times orders are useless.
You let it happen.
You have not executed the guilty.
Do you know what that will cost?
I will be held responsible.
You will isolate me even more.
You're not alone. I'm on your side.
You're not by my side.
You stand behind me.
I do not want a murderer by my side, and certainly not behind me.
What do you mean?
You should go!
Is that clear?
That's it.
Good.
Very well. Directly.
The president can see you now.
Mr. Timberlake, nice to see you.
I tried to reach you at the embassy.
I am far away.
- Everyone is lately.
My government has a proposal.
- A proposal?
I want to listen, but I doubt the reliability of the U.S..
You've probably heard the Bantu proverb:
"The hand that gives, prevails."
And your hand to me seems far too heavy. Excuse me.
Mr. Prime Minister ...
I am very worried.
The Congolese army ...
- I know.
The slaughter in Kasai.
I am appalled.
I'm talking to the guilty.
The Congo is not.
The problem remains with Katanga.
Our undisciplined troops have committed atrocities and U.N. betrays us by giving passive support to the Belgians.
Ghana supports us, along with Guinea but they have no money.
Do you have a solution?
The Russians.
They promise us airplanes, military advisers ...
And troops for Lundula.
He will replace Mobutu, whom I distrust.
Were you not afraid that the Russians would bring you into disrepute?
That was long ago.
We were already discredited.
What a beautiful place.
And so quiet.
I must insist.
May I ask the Russians?
I'd like to go with a better plan.
If you have one I'll run with it immediately.
I have none.
Joseph, now you have your own men ...
As long as they are paid ...
- Paid and trained.
We're investing in
Congo's future.
The future for us all.
I'll be honest with you
Kasavubu has disappointed us.
And Lumumba is in charge.
We need someone who will work with us.
I've been thinking.
I think about it constantly.
I guarantee you everything.
Eisenhower?
- Kennedy.
What will I win there?
Everything.
We interrupt our program to air a statement from the President.
Value compatriots,
Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, appointed by the Belgian king has denied his role.
He has ruled in an arbitrary manner.
He drags the country into in a terrible civil war.
Hence I think it is necessary that it must end immediately.
I ask the Congolese army and our brothers to stop the killings and that the weapons across the republic to fall temporarily silent.
Where's Justin?
- Gone to eat.
And Dieudonné?
- Yet again.
There's nobody here.
Take the car keys.
Where are you going?
- Parliament.
What is happening is outrageous!
Mr. Kasavubu can not dissolve what has been elected by the people!
We turned to no effort.
For the moment the Congo has enjoyed the admiration of the world
Kasavubu has given us a heavy blow and has dragged the Congo through the mud.
Silence!
The Prime Minister has the word.
Mr. President, respectable gentlemen,
I speak to you because it is my duty to inform you of events.
Too late!
- Congratulations!
I've never been against Kasavubu.
In any case, because
He is president and because of my actions.
It's true!
- Easy to say!
Some delegates, also in opposition, do not agree and say that he is a separatist.
The danger they fear is a reality.
He's right.
If the elected representatives of the people demand
Kasavubu to leave, he is deposed.
Do it!
Millions were spent on radio campaign against me.
Every day there has been a psychological battle fought.
In order to mislead the people
I have been named
Dictator Lumumba, Lumumba Communist,
Lumumba Moscow etc.
When we fought in the early days for our independence, was I prompted by the Russians?
Did I ask the Russians to the independence negotiations?
Who has given us 80 years of exploitation?
We are not the imperialists?
Queen Elizabeth is President of the Belgian-Russian association.
Does it show me to be a Communist?
If they hold Lumumba in contempt,
Lumumba then is the black sheep.
But actually they go on to attack the future of the Congo.
Dear brothers,
I appeal to your wisdom, your Bantu wisdom.
The situation is worse than you think.
We must unite, because divided we cannot save our country.
Let us forget our divisions.
Pauline?
Acute hepatitis.
We need urgent action.
Have you seen her?
- A Treasure. She looks like you.
What will she be called?
I thought of Marie-Christine.
They will bring her to Switzerland.
They say it's her only chance.
They hid that from me.
I want my baby.
You were not in Parliament.
What is it?
- The thick ...
The President wants me to arrest you.
I wanted to warn you.
And you say I'm involved 
I am a soldier.
I never butt in on political conflicts.
Have your men surrounded the house?
A Security measure.
I am not under arrest, but my house is surrounded?
For your own safety.
Many people want you dead.
My wife or my supporters,
Whom should I fear?
Send your men away.
- Is that a request or will you show me a warrant?
It's an order!
- Kasa you have been deposed.
And for you, he is not president anymore.
What would you do in my place?
I know you. This decision is not yours alone.
Who stands behind you?
Who?
Out of this impasse the army has neutralized
President Kasavubu and
Lumumba as Prime Minister.
This is not a military coup, just a peaceful revolution.
Will there be free elections?
But politicians have been arrested?
Is this a coup?
No military power will take control.
Again, this is not a coup.
What are the Americans doing?
- Involved in a Peaceful Revolution.
We are neutral Congolese and foreign technicians, we chose them, to ask for help to save our country.
Long live General Mobutu!
Not so fast.
Where's Lumumba?
- Do you support the Belgians?
How is payment reform going?
Has Lumumba been convicted?
The phone is still working, but for how long?
I will not wait until I am isolated.
There's a simple solution.
We go to Stanleyville and start from scratch.
Why?
We are neutralized. and I'm trapped and Mr. Kasavubu's a free man.
Katanga? You're kidding.
If you want to drown your dog ... then you don't torture him with shallow water.
Yes, I'm still here.
Excuse me.
I just read that my daughter has died.
I can not even go to her funeral.
I cannot do anything.
Thomas, it's you.
I am determined.
We cannot tay here any longer.
Yes, I know.
I cannot stay here under house arrest while my supporters are being killed.
Are you safe?
Listen ...
One of us must make a sacrifice.
I will definitely be arrested, tortured and murdered.
It's a sacrifice for the people.
Well, Thomas.
Do not worry.
Forget what I just said.
It was a joke.
Alphonse ...
I've a parcel to get?
I'll be right back.
I smoke the American brand.
Damn rain!
Runs right past your neck.
You must leave the main road.
The checkpoint at Kasimba saw a convoy.
How far from here?
- 16 km.
Maybe less.
Thank you, comrade.
There is no boat.
We'll use the canoes.
And how is it on the other side?
We look for cars or continue on foot.
No Patrice, I'm not going first.
Quick!
- I risk nothing.
They're hot on our heels!
I'll wait for the boat.
We leave.
Who are they?
I cannot see.
I must go back.
- No!
That is pure madness!
It is your task to reach Stanleyville.
And let them take revenge on my family?
What will they say?
- That's suicide.
They are not numerous. They will listen.
You ungrateful creatures!
This is pure madness!
Chief, we wish you no harm.
But if we return without you, we are slain.
And now they will kill me.
You still have regrets.
I gave you the power of the Force Publique.
When I die, you are also dead.
He's right.
- I'm for Lumumba.
Stop this nonsense!
Excuse me, Chief, but we recommend ...
Where were you arrested?
What about your children?
What?
Cannibal.
Very well, gentlemen, it's time to vote.
The proponents raise your hands.
Mr. Carlucci,
Will you cast your vote?
The government of my country does not intervene in the affairs of a sovereign state.
We'll respect your decision.
This is the message:
"Ask permission from the jew in order to receive. "
You?
- They arrested everyone.
Where are you taking us?
Katanga, 17 January 1961
I hope they do not ...
Internal bleeding.
Probably showing a perforated stomach.
Broken ribs.
If they are not brought in for an operation, it's only a matter of hours.
I warned you.
To never set foot in my country.
Civilians, soldiers, on this memorable day, the anniversary of our independence, we greet you with joy and pride.
On behalf of the Government we show a minute's silence in memory of the man we cry out as our National Hero:
Patrice Emery Lumumba.
You can pray as you wish.
Nobody knew about that night in Katanga.
The children may not know, do you?
They wouldn't understand.
Just tell them that I came
50 years too soon.
Tell them what we wanted for our country, was not wanted by others.
Dearest Pauline, if you read this, I am dead.
Tell my children that Congo has a great future, that our dignity is there to recover.
Tell them that during the fight
I had no time to hesitate that the purpose for which we gave our lives would be overcome.
Go get him.
Thanks.
Weep not for me, my companion.
History will be the final judge.
That history will not be written in Brussels,
Paris or Washington.
It will be ours, the story of a new Africa.
And on that day ...
I lived in my office and went home once in a while.
I knew he was hurting.
I couldn't do anything to help him except give him some money.
I couldn't do anything to help him except give him some money.
Why are you home so late?
I was busy.
Mom, I got paid today.
I'll leave it here.
Hello? Hold on.
Hongsheng, it's for you.
Who is it?
There's a TV series offering work.
Tell him I'm not here.
What's wrong with you?
Talk with him.
Hello?
Why are you calling?
What right do you have to call me?
Shut up, you're lying!
All your stuff is shit.
Listen, I quit acting, don't call me anymore.
It's OK if you don't want to be in the show.
Why did you treat him like that?
They deserve it.
How can you say that?
Everybody in this business knows you smoke drugs.
You're destroying your future.
I don't care, I'm not acting anymore.
Why don't you want to act?
It's all bullshit.
All the roles you played before were bullshit?
Yes.
We've acted all our lives, is that bullshit?
What do you think?
You bastard.
You can make any excuse for your drugs.
You've been lying to yourselves all your lives.
Your father and I have worked hard all our lives.
Who have we lied to?
Bullshit!
I worked hard all my life and it's bullshit?
I'm a liar?
Old Jia!
You're drunk. Don't go too far.
I need to be drunk today.
Tell me clearly, who did I lie to?
You lied to yourself.
Really?
I quit my fucking job as head of the local theatre.
I retired two years ahead of schedule to come here to serve you.
I lied to myself!
You came here on your own.
I didn't ask you to come.
He's right, I came on my own.
I deserve it!
I deserve it!
Do you think I look like Lennon?
A little bit.
Where is our family from?
What do you mean?
Are any of our ancestors from Europe?
No, your mother and I are from North-East China.
How about previous generations of our family?
Previous generations?
Previous generations?
My father is your grandpa... your grandpa's father is my grandpa...
There's no one from Europe.
Then why did Lennon tell me
I'm from England?
That's impossible.
We are from Jilin Jiutai.
Our ancestors' tombs are still there now.
Mom...
Mom!
What?
He's calling you.
Who's calling me?
The dragon.
What dragon?
Look at the cloud over there.
That's not a cloud, it's a dragon.
I was just talking to him.
He asked me to call you.
Stop lying. You must be dreaming!
It's true.
Get out!
Get out!
Shut up! Get out!
Hongsheng, who are you talking to?
Are you talking to us?
Hongsheng, what's the matter?
Don't move or I'll really come after you!
Hearing voices and seeing things... are common symptoms of schizophrenia.
These are also common side effects of heavy drug use.
It's hard to say if he's schizophrenic.
You need to monitor his symptoms.
His condition could make him violent and dangerous.
Watch him, he may have started using drugs again.
Why are you still awake?
I'm waiting for him.
Who knows when he will be back!
I'll wait until he comes back.
Why are you drinking?
You promised not to drink any more.
I don't drink every day.
Don't drink. You can't control yourself.
With him like this and your drinking.
What are we going to do?
Give it to me.
Stop drinking.
Leave me alone!
Hold on!
Where were you?
I went to Lijie's.
What were you doing?
Just hanging around.
Doing what?
You were doing drugs.
What's the matter with you?
Are you smoking again?
Why did you go in my room?
Why did you touch my things?
You quit for six months!
Don't waste all that effort!
It's not your business.
Don't move!
What do you want?
Where are you going?
Wherever I like.
You will die if you continue smoking!
It has nothing to do with you.
Of course it does.
I'm your father,
I have to take care of you!
Don't forget you've been a drunk all your life.
You're not qualified to take care of me, understand!?
Hongsheng, Hongsheng, Hongsheng!
Come back! Let him go!
Mom, come back inside.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
Where are you going?
Back home.
What about him?
Forget him. We can't help him.
He'll die if we don't help him.
I've thought this through.
Let him smoke to death.
We still have a daughter.
We weren't meant to have two children.
Stop! You're just angry.
If we don't leave, he'll destroy us.
How can we leave him now?
If you don't want to go,
I'll leave by myself.
Old Jia, you are too selfish.
I don't want to die here.
That's enough. Stop quarrelling.
Leave right now if you want!
If you walk out that door, you and I are finished!
Whatever you say.
It's not the first time you've said that.
I mean it.
If you leave, don't come back.
Mom!
Mom!
Come out and have a drink with me.
We're sleeping.
It's my birthday today.
I've promised your mother
I wouldn't drink.
Have a drink for me.
Go ahead, don't drink too much.
Bottom's up.
There's too much...
Do it for me.
It's really too much.
Are you a man? Drink up!
Hongsheng, you've drunk too much.
Stop drinking, OK?
I'm happy today.
I don't want to get drunk and start trouble.
I'm here, I'll take care of you.
I'm 29 this year.
I've done nothing but smoke drugs for 4 years.
Do you know what I've been thinking all these 4 years?
I've been wondering why you are my father.
Are you my father?
I am your father.
You are not my father.
I'm Lennon's son.
That's your imagination.
It's not my imagination.
You are a peasant.
Why can't a peasant be your father?
Tell me why you are a peasant.
My father was a peasant.
Look at me.
Your generation has never understood life.
Why are you alive?
Is your life interesting?
Are you happy?
Hongsheng...
I don't understand what you're talking about.
I'm going to make you understand life!
What is happiness!
Hongsheng!
You are my father.
I have hit you.
I will kowtow to you.
Hongsheng, what are you doing?
Old Jia!
How dare you hit my father!
You bastard, I'll kill you!
Let go of me! I'll kill him, let me kill him!
After 6 months of interviews, we finally began rehearsals for the play.
What we'd worried about so long had finally happened.
If it happened once, it would happen again.
The situation had gotten violent and dangerous.
The day he told me
I wasn't his mother... something inside me just shattered.
The strength that had held me up for such a long time just disappeared.
We were tired of living in fear.
We can't take this any longer.
We have to send him into the hospital.
I felt everybody wanted to hurt me.
I felt death coming closer and closer.
A sound in my head told me...
"This is not the end."
I had no choice but to fight... fight with everyone.
Who is it?
Hongsheng, someone's looking for you.
Are you Jia Hongsheng?
Yes.
Come with us.
Why should I go with you?
I haven't broken any law.
The Resident's Association has called... because of your disturbing the neighbors.
This is not the first time.
Please put that down.
I won't go.
You don't have the right to arrest me.
Please calm down.
You'd better come with us now.
This is a domestic matter.
We hope you will co-operate with us.
Go with them.
We called the police.
Name?
Did you hear me?
What's your name?
Lennon.
Which character for "Le"?
The same "Le" as in Lenin.
Which character for "Non"?
"Non" as in the character for peasant.
Your age...
My birthday was a few days ago.
I didn't ask your birthday.
Tell me how old you are.
My birthday was a few days ago.
What's your address?
Where do you live?
London.
You live in London?
Take him to the ward now...
Put on this uniform.
We'll call you for dinner...
Someone new!
How about a hand-shake?
You're my new friend, we can talk tomorrow.
Let's shake hands.
Shake hands, shake hands with him.
Is that building next to my house done yet?
The Soviets called it hysteria and the Chinese call it dementia.
This is a good place for a rest.
Why don't you speak?
Did someone hurt you?
Get up! Time to get up!
Older Brother, give me an autograph.
I saw you in the movies
"Weekend Lover"... and "Silver Snake Murder".
Give me your autograph and I'll give you a cigarette.
Give me your autograph and I'll give you a cigarette.
Nurse, come here and light his cigarette!
Give me your autograph...
What are you doing?
The actor is giving me his autograph.
Are you an actor?
He was in "Weekend Lover" and "Silver Snake Murder".
I can act and sing.
I can act and sing, too.
What songs do you sing?
I can sing "Little Grass."
I'll do the first verse, you do the chorus.
OK.
I don't smell good like a flower.
I'm not as tall as a tree.
I'm a little grass and no one knows me.
But I never feel lonely,
I never feel worried.
I have all my friends around me.
Eat a lot of apples.
We bought salted fish... it won't go bad.
We'll bring more next week.
Get up!
Get dressed!
What's going on?
Go wash your faces.
Hurry up!
Get me out of here.
This is no place to live.
I'll really go crazy if I stay here any longer.
They will examine you on Monday.
It's up to the doctors.
If you are not sick, we'll get you out of here right away.
If you are sick, you'll have to stay here for a while...
Do I look sick?
We hope you aren't...
Why did you send me here?
You needed a change in environment.
"Change in environment?" Shut up!
You want to destroy me.
Why would we destroy our own son?
You have nothing to do with me!
- Hongsheng, what's the matter with you?
- Don't come to see me again!
Come on. Take your medicine.
Why do I take medicine?
If you are told to take it, just take it.
I'm not sick.
Why do you make me take this?
It's not up to you. The doctor decides.
I won't.
You have to!
Take it away!
I won't take this. Get out!
Can I have a cigarette?
Do you think I'm sick?
I don't think so.
You are seriously sick! Really sick!
You are not sick. You came to experience a new kind of life.
But when can I get out of here?
Don't think about it.
You'd have to adapt to your surroundings, they won't adapt to you.
Don't be afraid of illness.
Thinking about it... will make you more sick.
I've been living here for 50 years.
Take it easy,
I was like you when I came.
I can't spend my life here.
Nurse!
Nurse!
Nurse!
Nurse!
Nurse!
What are you yelling about?
Please untie me.
I'm uncomfortable.
Will you be nice?
Yes.
Will you take your medicine?
Yes, I will.
This can't happen again.
I know.
When the night is cloudy...
I saw a light, showing me a new day...
Take it naturally.
I dreamed about the dragon again.
He stayed on the ceiling.
Staring at me with his eyes.
He asked me, "Who are you?"
I said, "I am Jia Hongsheng".
He asked, "Who is Jia Hongsheng?"
I answered, "Jia Hongsheng graduated from The Central Academy of Drama.
He's an actor.
He loves rock music.
He loves Lennon and Plant.
He once wanted to be a famous actor and start his own band."
He said, " You are just a human being.
You like noodles, eggs... and nice clothes.
You like to sign autographs.
You cy and laugh.
You can even beg when you need help."
I asked him, "Why am I here?"
He said,
"This is the punishment for your sins.
You will be clean after all these sins have been paid for."
I asked him, "Am I clean now?"
He didn't answer me.
With his eyes still staring at me... he flew away.
He said, " You are just a human being.
You are just a human being.
You are just a human being.
You are just a human being.
A human being.
A human being.
A human being..."
Get up!
Time to get up!
What's your name?
Jia Hongsheng.
When did you come to the hospital?
June 19th.
For what reason?
I hit my father.
How old are you?
What's your birth year?
Sheep.
What's your birthday?
March 19th, 1967.
What's your address?
Rm.1003 Building 23...
Anyuan Beili, Asian Games Village.
You are an actor, are you?
Yes, I am.
Where were you trained?
The Central Academy of Drama.
When did you graduate?
What films have you been in?
"Summer Expectation"...
"Silver Snake Murder"...
"Good Morning, Beijing"...
What's your nationality?
Chinese.
I heard you have British bloodlines?
Not really.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
Where's your hometown?
Jilin Siping.
Have you smoked drugs?
Yes.
When did you smoke the last time?
About a month ago.
Who is Lennon?
He's the vocal of a British band.
What relationship does he have to you?
None.
Didn't you say you are his son?
That's my imagination.
I just love his music very much.
Are you used to life here?
Yes, all the doctors and nurses are nice to me.
When did you take drugs for the first time?
When we rehearsed...
"Kiss of the
Spider Woman" in the fall of 1992.
How long were you addicted?
About 4 years.
What was the longest time you quit?
Half a year.
Can you quit for good?
I can.
Why?
Because I know I want to.
All right, you can go.
Wait, one more question.
You told your parents you saw a dragon?
Is that true?
It's true.
What did it look alike?
He looks exactly like me.
OK, you can go now.
Thanks.
First of all, we're sure he is not schizophrenic.
Unfortunately his nervous system... has been influenced by an excess of drugs and alcohol.
He needs treatment... to cure his hallucinations... and paranoia.
My suggestion is to keep him here for a while.
This will help to his recovery... and force him to stay away from drugs.
Hongsheng.
Hongsheng.
Hey, what are you doing here?
I just got here.
A doctor there said an actor was in the hospital.
I sneaked over after I knew it was you.
- What a coincidence!
- Sure is.
What are you here for?
Quitting drugs. How about you?
Me too. I also need to calm down.
Why aren't you over here in the drug section?
A lot of people bring drugs into that section.
It's hard to quit.
It' s easier in my section.
How long have you been here?
Three months.
How is it going?
Not bad. How are you doing?
Not so great.
Would you like an apple?
How long will you stay here?
I'd like to stay for a while... to quit drugs and alcohol.
Me too. I need to get clean.
Hongsheng, do you remember my girlfriend?
Yeah.
She's dead.
We were shooting up...
She jumped off a building.
Your Dad got a role a few weeks ago and made some money.
We've decorated the apartment.
The kitchen and bathroom are new.
We re-decorated your room.
I'm not sure if you like the style... if you don't, we'll change it.
We didn't touch your stuff.
It's all in boxes.
Your stereo didn't work.
Your father bought a new one for you.
What would you like for dinner?
Anything is OK.
Take a rest. I'll cook dinner.
Why did you begin using lard soap again?
It's not for you. I'll take it away.
Leave it here. I'm just asking.
We had brought them from home.
We started to use them after you went into the hospital.
Here, this is for you.
Hongsheng.
Yeah.
Want to listen some music?
OK.
What would you like?
Pink Floyd or Beatles?
Beatles.
OK.
Where is he?
I don't know. He was here a minute ago.
Please trust me today.
Let me be alone for one day.
I'm 30 today.
I feel a little bit strange.
Don't be so nervous.
He wants our trust, so we trust him this time.
I'm still worried.
We forgot his birthday!
Why didn't I remember?
It's been exactly one year.
Oh, you're home.
Yeah.
Sorry, we forgot it's your birthday today.
I'll go buy some beer.
I don't drink.
Have a little.
I quit.
Hongsheng, your sister got you a cake.
What else would you like?
I bought some noodles and minced pork.
How about some birthday noodles?
Great. I'll make them.
You scared me!
I thought there was a baby in here.
Want me to replay it?
OK.
Did you take your medicine?
Yes.
Don't stay up late.
What time are you leaving in the morning?
I'll call you at 7:00...
OK.
CITY OF GOD
Fuck, the chicken's got away!
Go after that chicken, man!
Get that chicken!
If it's a good photo,
I'll get a job at the paper.
- You think so, Rocket?
- Gotta take the risk.
You'd risk your life for a picture? Forget it!
You think I want to meet up with that motherfucking hood?
Get that chicken, bro!
Motherfucker!
I told you to grab that chicken!
Outta my way!
Get that chicken!
If Li'l Zé catches you, he'll kill you.
Yeah, well, he's gotta find me first.
Hey, kid! Get that chicken!
Get that chicken!
Shit! The cops!
Don't fucking run off!
Give me that.
Hey, Melonhead!
You fucking fag!
A picture could change my life, but
in the City of God, if you run away, they get you
and if you stay, they get you too,
It's been that way ever since I was a kid,
You're useless, man!
- Go get the ball!
- Fucking useless!
Hey, kid!
Give me the ball, I wanna play.
You wanna mess with me?
Fuck off.
What's your name?
Sorry,
I forgot to introduce myself,
My name's Rocket.
Some advice, Rocket.
Don't let Li'I Dice touch that ball. He sucks.
You lose, pal.
That's Shaggy,
To tell the story of the City of God,
I have to start with him,
But in order to tell
Shaggy's story,
I must tell the story of the Tender Trio,
Well, Shaggy?
The gas truck's coming.
What are you fucking around for?
You're not gonna chicken out.
The notorious Tender Trio was legendary in the City of God,
Shaggy,
Clipper,
and Goose,
Tagging along were always
Li'I Dice and Benny,
Shaggy's brother,
I never had the courage to follow my brother, Goose,
Okay, let's go.
Come on, Goose.
Let's go!
Stop this fucker!
Stop or I'll shoot, motherfucker!
Get out!
Hurry up, asshole!
Gimme the money!
Who wants gas?
More! You wanna die for your boss' damn money?
Shitloads of money here!
You see, asshole?
Fuck! The cops!
Clear out!
The place is crawling with cops!
- Shaggy!
- The ball, Goose, it's yours!
Back then, I thought the guys in the Tender Trio
were the most dangerous hoods in Rio,
Here! Buy some new balls.
But they were just amateurs,
Even my brother, Goose,
Rocket, give this money to dad.
But don't tell him it's from me.
Okay?
- Hey, Stringy!
- Yeah?
Look how much I've got.
We came to the City of God
hoping to find paradise,
Many families were homeless
due to flooding
and acts of arson in the slums,
A street light!
We'll have electricity!
The bigwigs in government didn't joke around,
Homeless?
Off to City of God!
There was no electricity, paved streets or transportation,
But for the rich and powerful our problems didn't matter,
We were too far removed
from the picture postcard image of Rio de Janeiro,
Do you think I can become a lifeguard one day?
I don't know.
Being a lifeguard is better than a fishmonger.
I don't want to sell fish.
It stinks.
- Are you insulting your father?
- No.
So what do you want to be?
I don't know.
Not a hood or a policeman.
Why not?
I'm scared of getting shot.
Put that thing away, kid.
Are you nuts?
Pointing that gun at me?
Take it easy with the kid,
Goose.
Li'I Dice is with me.
Right, I'm a gangster too.
That gas truck didn't bring much.
So what?
We rob gas trucks every day.
One today, another tomorrow.
No, we need to rob some rich guy's house.
That's the only way to get outta here.
Hell, no. What you need is to follow my plan.
That's it.
The little fart's getting too big for his britches!
He gets high and starts talking bullshit.
You two junkies aren't worth half as much as that kid.
What you got in mind,
Li'I Dice?
To be a real hood you need more than just a gun,
You need ideas,
And Li'I Dice had them,
- Is that the motel?
- Yeah.
We go in, grab the money and get out. No killing, got that?
I need this.
- Don't touch my gun, kid.
- Don't ever do that again.
- Don't point at me.
- Fuck you.
Don't point your finger at me!
Stop acting like a baby!
Here's yours.
- Awesome!
- Let's go!
- Not so fast!
- What?
You stay here and keep watch.
If the cops come, shoot that window over there.
Why me?
Let that dork do that.
Look.
I gave you this great plan, for free.
While that guy's absolutely useless!
- You just had the idea.
- Exactly!
You're just a kid, remember?
You cover us, okay?
You'll get your turn.
Stop trying to rush things.
You stay there.
This is a hold-up, bitch.
You should be studying or working.
You don't even look like hoodlums.
Instead, you ought to be working or studying, boy.
Shut up!
What a pain in the ass!
Okay, Clipper?
Shall we go in?
I didn't order anything.
It's on the house, sir.
Hand over the money!
Keep calm, all I want is your cash.
- Don't point that...
- Your wallet...
Hey, man.
What kind of whorehouse is this?
- You from the church?
- Yes, brother.
Give it to me!
Slut!
You're fat and flabby!
Wanna take her place?
What's going on?
The cops! Let's beat it!
Let's go!
Take that car.
I'll go get Li'I Dice.
Jesus, what a car!
Something fucked up.
Li'I Dice is gone.
The cops are shooting, let's go!
Slow down! Hold on.
You said you knew how to drive.
I do, so cool it!
Turn! Watch out!
You fucking asshole!
Hey, I didn't do it on purpose.
No one saw anything.
So keep your mouths shut, understand?
Hold on, I twisted my ankle.
Goose fucked up his ankle.
It fucking hurts.
Take him into the woods.
I'll shoot to distract the cops.
- In God we trust.
- In God we trust.
Pass me the telephone, Penguin.
Shorty is another notorious guy in the City of God,
But it's not yet time to tell the story,
It fucking hurts, Goose.
Shut up.
You sound like a damn sissy, man.
Climb up!
No one saw anything?
How odd!
A car crashes into a bar and no one saw a thing.
I suppose you didn't see anything either?
As usual, no one saw, no one knows.
So what's up, Shorty?
They're hiding in the woods.
Hello, Melonhead.
I have this feeling that they're out in the woods.
The motherfuckers.
They're out in the woods.
Felipe, lock up the car.
Rangel, come with me.
I can't see a thing.
How the hell can they see?
Fucking jungle.
They stole a fortune at that motel.
I know.
What if we took the money?
Are you crazy?
I'm not getting mixed up in that.
I want to exterminate these guys.
What? Since when is stealing from niggers and thieves a crime?
It won't be hard to nab them.
I have a stoolie in the City.
Did you hear those shots?
If I catch one of them,
I'll kill him.
Maracana!
Open the door.
What's the matter?
The cops are after me.
Shaggy!
The cops are on my ass!
Hide me!
Quick, come in.
Shit.
I thought the cops would be down there all night.
I had a vision, Goose.
You been smoking something?
- You've had a job, right?
- Yeah.
What's it like?
What do people say?
I worked with my father.
And fathers talk a lot of shit.
You know what, Goose?
I'm getting out,
I don't want to die.
This gangster's life isn't for me.
Wait!
The cops are still down there.
I don't give a shit.
I'm going back to the church.
I will say of the Lord,
He is my refuge and my fortress, in Him will I trust.
Fear not the terror by night, nor the arrow that flies by day.
- Stop, motherfucker!
- Don't move!
Stop, or I'll shoot!
- shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
The hold-up at the motel went down
as the bloodiest in history,
The destinies of the outlaws then took different paths,
I don't think this guy was involved in the heist.
See here?
He's a worker, not a hoodlum.
I'll make him one now.
Destiny put Clipper back into the hands of God,
Shaggy was in Bernice's hands,
And Goose was in my father's hands,
Why do you do these things?
You think I'm a fool?
From now on, you'll work with me.
Your younger brother will keep an eye on you.
You listen to me.
If I catch you with money that isn't yours,
I'll kill you.
That goes for you too.
Get changed!
You start work immediately.
Having a hood as a brother sucks,
You always end up footing the bill,
Don't worry.
Dad's mad at me, but he'll get over it.
Give me that, Rocket.
It's not for you.
You have to study.
Getting shot doesn't scare you?
I'm a hood because I got no brain.
But you're smart.
You should study.
I go to school because
I don't like physical work.
Promise me something.
That you'll never touch this gun. Promise?
Let's shake.
We'd better hurry.
I'm gonna sell a lot of fish.
And don't laugh.
You grinned when I got slapped.
- Who, me?
- I saw you.
What is it, Shaggy?
Cat got your tongue?
Your fidgeting behind me makes me nervous.
I'm thinking of what to say to you.
You're thinking, as well?
Don't.
It'll be your downfall.
My heart has chosen you.
And I follow my heart.
Are you pulling my leg?
You never heard of love at first sight?
Hoods don't love, they desire.
You cut down everything I say.
Hoods don't talk, they smooth-talk.
Well, I'll stop wasting my breath on you.
Hoods don't stop, they take a break.
Talking to you about love sure is complicated.
It's not love, it's a con game.
It's just that I love you.
You just might end up convincing me.
After the hold-up, there were constant police raids
in the slum,
Every day, someone went to jail,
someone was nailed,
But no one had seen anything,
No one knew anything,
No one blabbed to the cops
about where the thieves were hiding out,
Shaggy.
Why don't you change your life?
Get a job instead of lying around in bed all day.
- Good-for-nothing!
- What do you mean?
You think you can make money working? Go ahead.
That's right, Shaggy.
What do you think I do all day?
Take it easy, baby.
You know all I want is to be with you have kids, and a farm, raise chickens, grow pot and get high.
Sure! For me, that's nothing but smooth-talk.
What? I almost got rich with that motel job.
Are you kidding?
The cops are still looking for you because of the deaths in the motel.
What deaths?
What are you talking about?
Did you see anything?
You don't know shit, so shut up.
You weren't there.
I didn't kill anyone.
I bet it's those fucking policemen, and I'm the one taking the rap.
They even nabbed Li'I Dice.
So don't bring it up again!
- I don't care who did it.
- It wasn't me.
Let me just say.
I don't want my kid's father to be a hoodlum.
You're all alone, Shaggy.
- All alone?
- That's right!
- Clipper's gone religious.
- Hallelujah!
- Goose is working.
- Ass-kisser!
- And you?
- I haven't changed.
So what?
They've deserted me, that's all.
Then I'm deserting you too.
I'm splitting, Shaggy.
Come with me, if you want.
Otherwise, I'll go alone.
Fish for sale!
My brother had promised to stop messing around,
But a hood doesn't stop,
a hood takes a break,
Goose began messing around with Shorty's wife,
I have trout. But for special customers like you,
I also have a kisser fish.
Hey, that's a mullet!
Doesn't your husband go down on you?
No.
Mine, before entering me, has to use his tongue.
For about half an hour.
And from behind?
Do you let him?
Good God, no.
Doesn't it hurt?
The first few times.
Then you'll see, it's fantastic.
But you need a banana.
What for?
You're missing the good things in life, girl!
You take a banana, warm it up...
Put it up your thing, while he takes you from behind.
It's a real rush!
Ask your husband.
I couldn't. You don't know him.
He's liable to beat me.
Try him. Men go wild for smut like that.
Motherfucking nigger!
Slut!
Whoring bitch!
Rocket, give me your shorts.
Quick!
Take them off, dammit!
I'm not going naked in the street.
You want your brother to die?
Give me your shorts. Now!
Give me your shirt.
Your shorts! Hurry up!
I knew it. It's always me who forks up for that bum.
The bastard ran off.
That's his brother.
- That brat there?
- I'll castrate that fucker.
Fish! Fish for sale!
Hey, kid, come over here.
- Where's your brother?
- He's not working today.
- Oh yeah? Get in.
- I didn't do anything.
- Get in!
- What about my fish?
Hurry it up, kid!
I don't want to lose my fish!
Forget your fish.
Give me that.
My father will kill me.
That doesn't matter.
Let's go. There's nothing here.
That day, my father swore
he never wanted to see my brother again,
Let's go, Felipe.
And he never did,
No one ever saw him in the slum again,
The story of the Tender Trio was coming to an end,
Li'I Dice?
Shit, man. I thought you were a goner at the motel.
You're fucking loaded!
Don't, Benny.
That's our money.
Fuck you. Cut the crap and give me the money.
Benny.
Tell your brother Shaggy that Shorty is squealing.
I'm leaving the slum.
But Shorty had his hands full,
Let's go see, Stringy.
A neighbor called the police before sunrise,
The tabloids went to town:
"Man Buries Wife Alive in the City of God"
Along with reporters, the place was swarming with cops,
The hoodlums took off,
- You wanna die?
- It's you who's gonna die if you don't do what I say.
And show the lady more respect.
Let's go, dammit!
- There are cops ahead.
- Fuck them, let's go.
- Where to?
- Anywhere, just go.
What's the matter?
Have mercy!
This car is a piece of junk.
- My ass! Start the damn thing!
- It needs a push.
Push, Shaggy!
Push!
You?
You want to arrest the thieves?
Over there.
Nab that guy over there!
Run, Shaggy!
Stop the car!
This way! He's over here.
We got that sonofabitch!
- The bastard!
- He's a murderer.
On the day Shaggy died
I remember the crowds
and a camera,
I'd always wanted to have one,
Let's go to school.
- Well?
- Let's go to the beach.
But we have an exam.
So what?
Everyone else is at the beach.
Come on, let's go!
She's in a bikini, but doesn't want to go.
What's that saying you have?
The sun is for everyone. The beach, for those who deserve it.
I bought my first camera when I was 16,
Like all poor people,
I started at the bottom
with the world's cheapest model,
So, Rocket?
How are things going?
Any luck getting laid yet?
Zilch.
Angelica,
I was crazy about her,
So, Rocket, still clicking away?
She was gorgeous and the only girl in our gang who screwed,
I wanted to lose my virginity with her,
With her, buddy?
She's got a guy.
So? I'm not jealous.
Her father's a sergeant.
No one's perfect.
Closer together!
I was the official photographer of our gang,
The gang of groovies,
Everyone paid
to have copies of the pictures,
Tiago, move back a little.
Is this okay?
Perfect.
I need a joint.
Instead of smoking, man, you should snort coke.
It's far out.
You snort, Tiago?
I prefer a good toke.
If you like,
I can get it for you.
You can?
Then go on, move your ass!
But the choice stuff is coke.
That's a real nercotic.
Narcotic!
Your mouth is all salty, Tiago.
Screw you.
You want to be a lifeguard, Stringy?
- You're never in the water.
- My dad's a lifeguard.
I'll bet you a beer
I swim better.
You're on.
If you like,
I can go get you a joint at Blacky's.
I'd have done anything to please her,
Buy her pot, coke,
I could go to the top dogs
to buy quality stuff at a good price
because the local boss
was a former classmate: Blacky,
Who is it?
Rocket.
- How are things down there?
- Fine.
- And the kids?
- Fine too.
You want to buy or smoke a joint?
- Buy.
- Come in, buddy.
Who is it?
This was Blacky's turf,
But it hadn't always been his,
- Hey, Blacky.
- Fuck, Li'I Dice.
You show up like this at my place?
Who said it was your place?
Doña Zelia began selling drugs here
in order to raise her daughters,
She also gave away drugs to boys at times
in return for special favors,
Her favorite was "Big Boy",
One day, he grew very big!
Zelia's operation was so amateur
that he had no trouble seizing it from her,
Big Boy used the neighborhood kids as dealers,
What about my pot?
Stick it up your ass.
The best dealer
was Carrot,
He earned Big Boy's trust,
and moved up to become a manager,
Blacky, 20 for us and 5 for you, okay?
One day a buddy of Carrot's showed up,
His name was Aristotle,
My wife needs an operation.
His family had taken Carrot in
when he was down and out,
He couldn't refuse to help a brother in need,
Here's the dope. I want the dough no later than Friday.
- You've bailed me out, brother.
- Friday.
He's my buddy, practically my brother, Big Boy.
Give him another week.
Either you kill him, or I'll kill you.
Carrot had no choice,
I said Friday.
Don't do it, man.
Carrot wanted to kill Big Boy,
but it wasn't necessary,
Big Boy hadn't paid off the cops, He died in jail,
Carrot took everything that belonged to Big Boy,
but didn't want the apartment,
The place was ill-fated,
Carrot gave it to his most trusted dealer, Blacky,
Here. 150 bags.
Give me more.
That's how he took over the local trade,
But not for long,
Who is it?
Go see.
- Hey, Blacky.
- Fuck, Li'I Dice.
You show up like this at my place?
Who said it was your place?
Yeah, who?
Something wrong, Li'I Dice?
Li'I Dice, my ass.
My name is Li'l Zé now.
Li'l Zé had always wanted to be boss of the City of God,
ever since he was called
"Li'I Dice",
They're having fun, and not me?
I want to get out of here.
What, kid?
Your friend took everything.
What do you want?
That night, Li'I Dice satisfied his thirst to kill,
though he knew
Shaggy would never forgive him,
To avoid being punished he left the City of God,
He had to work hard for peanuts,
Yeah, Benny!
Li'I Dice and Benny managed well,
They had the gift of crime,
- You have more money than me.
- It was my idea.
The only problem was running into an older hoodlum
like my brother, Goose,
Li'I Dice?
Shit, man. I thought you were a goner at the motel.
You're fucking loaded!
Don't, Benny.
That's our money.
Benny, tell your brother Shaggy that Shorty is squealing.
I'm leaving the slum.
Goose!
From Shaggy. You'll need it.
From one hit to the next,
Li'I Dice grew up,
At 18, he was the most respected hood
in the City of God,
You're of age now, watch out!
He was one of the most wanted robbers in Rio,
Li'I Dice, how's it going?
Happy birthday.
I'm so glad you've turned 18.
Get lost, Tuba!
Excuse me, amigo.
Give me a beer!
Didn't you see me, prick?
- Sorry, man.
- Up yours!
The next time,
I'll waste you, asshole!
Fag!
Li'I Dice was ready for anything,
I wanna talk.
And he was itching to start,
Who are the fattest cats here?
There are tons of them.
Look at Jerry Adriani gold chain, snazzy clothes.
Look at Pereira and the chick he's with
Bernice.
She was my brother's girl.
Check out his car.
Then there's Blacky.
Covered in gold.
Gold chain, gold watch.
Look at Carrot, and his car.
They're all dealers.
They're all fucking loaded.
Hold-ups bring in chickenshit.
- The big bucks are in drugs.
- I see.
Especially in selling coke.
- But you need money.
- Not really.
We'll kill these clowns and take over their business.
- When do we start?
- Now.
Exu-the-Devil is the light that shines forth.
He brought you here.
Why remain in the City of God where God has forgotten you?
I know what you want.
You want power.
I have something which will give it to you.
To change your fate,
I give you my protector, boy.
But you mustn't fornicate with the amulet otherwise, you'll die.
The boy is no longer called
Li'I Dice but Li'l Zé.
Li'l Zé will grow up.
You'll stick with me,
I'll stick with you.
Li'I Dice became Li'l Zé
and he began to kill,
He started one morning,
taking over Jerry Adriani's racket,
By that night,
almost all of the rackets in the slum were his,
The only business he didn't touch was Carrot's
since he was a friend of Benny's,
All that was left was the apartment
But that would be easy,
Who is it?
- Hey, Blacky.
- Fuck, Li'I Dice.
You show up like this at my place?
Who said it was your place?
Something wrong, Li'I Dice?
Li'I Dice, my ass.
My name is Li'l Zé now.
Li'l Zé, see?
- You're a goner, bastard.
- Don't kill him. He understands.
Right, Blacky?
It's all yours.
I don't want no trouble, okay?
I should have taken this chance to avenge my brother's death,
You'll live, but you'll work for us.
Understand?
That's easy to say,
- Where are you going?
- He's clean, Li'l Zé.
What's your name, kid?
- Rocket.
- He's Goose's brother.
- Goose?
- The late Goose.
Quick, kid. Run along.
Tell everyone that this business now belongs to Li'l Zé.
And that we'll be selling coke.
Got that?
Cocaine.
- Where's the turf?
- Over there, on the left.
Selling drugs is like any other business,
The supplier delivers the merchandise
which is then packaged on the premises,
It's done in an assembly line,
Boring as hell,
Pot is wrapped up in "lids",
Cocaine is put into packets,
and then into bundles of 10 or 100,
You can even make a career in dealing drugs,
The kids start out as delivery boys,
They're paid to run errands
and take messages,
Then they become lookouts,
If the police arrive,
the kites disappear and everyone scrams,
Later, you become a dealer
or a "vapor",
When the heat's on,
the "vapor" quickly evaporates,
Moving up the ladder, you have the "soldier",
And if the guy is good at math,
he can become a manager,
the boss's right-hand man,
The police receive their part and don't make trouble,
Since Li'l Zé killed off all of his enemies,
there were no shoot-outs in the City of God,
You could drive there,
The playboys felt safe buying their drugs there,
The City teemed with addicts
and Li'l Zé grew rich,
I can't decide which to wear.
This one's cool.
If dealing were legal,
Li'l Zé would have been man of the year,
But things were risky for me,
I was afraid of him,
And he was everywhere,
What a drag this guy is.
Whenever I wanted to smoke a joint
I had to go see Carrot,
Half a lid.
Thanks.
But it was worth it,
I only smoked with Angelica,
She and Tiago had split up,
so I made my move,
I was about to win her over,
These pictures are really great.
You think so?
I look good here.
- You look beautiful everywhere.
- I'm serious.
Me too.
A setting sun, a deserted beach
a long kiss,
I was sure this was it,
But the Runts arrived,
Can I have a toke?
Here.
I'm going. See you later.
Hold on, Angelica.
- Your joint, man.
- Keep it.
What a cool guy.
That was my first run-in with the Runts,
Steak and fries, Benny.
Great!
Here.
A tip for you.
Really? Thanks.
- Wanna eat something?
- No.
Wanna trade this watch?
After Angelica left him,
Tiago began snorting more and more,
Is it your grandfather's?
No, my dad's.
When a guy is really hooked
he ends up in the hands of the dealer,
- Two bags of ten.
- One of ten.
Okay, one bag.
For Tiago, it was different,
Watch out!
Sorry, godfather.
Godfather, my ass.
Did I baptize your kids?
I'm sorry.
Now beat it.
Blacky, lend me your bike.
Hey, wanna race?
Where to?
Up to the highway.
- Okay.
- Ready? Go!
Pretty tough, wasn't it?
Yeah, you're good.
Where'd you buy those sneakers?
- Not far from here.
- The shirt, as well?
- No, uptown.
- Cool.
It's a designer shirt.
If I give you money can you buy me one?
Shorts and a shirt?
Buy whatever you can.
- What size are you?
- Measure me.
- With what, man?
- Shit, with your hand.
Shoe size?
Turn around.
Hey, Benny!
You got the digs?
- Just one pair of pants?
- No, there's more.
- You like it?
- Yeah.
There's some change.
Keep it.
Cool.
This is Benny.
- This is Rocket.
- Hi. I know him.
I've become a playboy.
Hey, gangsters, listen to this.
Watch out.
Groovies shake their asses before laying a big one.
Oh yeah?
Fuck off, you bastards!
Making fun of me?
Asshole!
Benny, didn't I tell you to shoot Carrot?
He's endangering the slum.
- Cool it. Go talk to him.
- I'm gonna kill that fucker.
Stop trying to wipe out everyone.
I'm gonna kill him.
Don't worry, Angelica.
The guys in here are cool.
Sure, I'm not worried.
You gonna dance, Benny?
What about Carrot?
Go talk to the guy.
Benny was the coolest hood in the City of God,
He gave away pot, paid for drinks,
Li'l Zé was the opposite,
He had one obsession:
to be the boss of the slum,
He wanted an excuse to take over Carrot's racket,
- Hey, Carrot.
- What's up?
You shouldn't let the Runts do hold-ups in the slum.
You look after your section,
I'll look after mine.
Got that?
I'm gonna get a drink.
- Hey, Rocket! How's it going?
- Great.
- Hey, Benny!
- How's it going?
- Hey, Tiago. How are you?
- Good.
- May I?
- Sure.
Wanna dance?
Is it okay at your place?
No problem.
My parents are out.
You'll be all alone with her.
You can lose your virginity tonight.
Not so loud, man!
Everyone will hear.
- You're beautiful.
- Thank you.
Shit!
Nothing's happening.
Look, man, I know the Runts are associated with you.
Think I'm a sucker, you little brat?
- You want to take my racket?
- I want to talk to you because you're fucking useless.
Get your hand away!
The Runts are screwing up our security, man.
Give the baby his bottle.
Carrot, just ask the kids to cool it, okay?
Carrot's useless.
He lets the Runts do hold-ups in his section.
The police come around and that's bad for business.
I'll do it only because I like you.
But you need to change that baby's diapers.
I'll show you who's the baby.
Tell the kids that in my slum no one robs or rapes!
No wonder you're "Little" Z é!
The Runts were kids who didn't respect the laws
of the slum,
They would mug residents, hold up bakeries,
especially in Carrot's section,
What are you doing?
You rob me all the time!
But they didn't know
that the City had a boss now,
THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING US
The City had became much safer
for residents,
There were hardly any hold-ups now,
You just had to go see Li'l Zé,
- Let's go.
- Don't hurt the Runts.
I won't touch them.
- Hi, Steak.
- How's it going, Li'l Zé?
- Wanna take a walk, Steak?
- With you? Hold on.
Mom, I'm going out with my friends.
That's the best chicken
I ever ate.
The old guy was scared shitless.
Feeling sorry for him?
You're crazy, man!
Why not stick up a bank or a supermarket?
Peanuts.
Drugs are where it's at.
Yeah, selling drugs.
But you have to start out as a delivery boy.
You wanna be a delivery boy?
It's a rip-off.
It takes a long time to move up.
You have to wait till an older guy gets killed to move up.
I don't wanna wait till some guy croaks.
I'm gonna do what Li'l Zé did.
I'm gonna wipe them all out.
Talking about me, kid?
The boss is here.
Come back, you brat!
They're quick, those kids.
They run fast.
They're all gone except you.
Any others?
You're gonna pay for the ones that escaped.
You choose. Shall I shoot you in the hand or foot?
Come on, choose!
Hand or foot?
Choose, for fuck's sake!
- Hand.
- The little hand, eh?
Cool.
Hey, Steak'n'fries, let's see what you're made of.
Choose and then kill one of them.
Leave it. I'll do it.
Butt out, Tuba.
This is for him.
Go on, Steak.
Go on, choose one and shoot.
Come on, I haven't got all day.
Kill one of them.
I wanna see what you're made of.
Well done!
You did it.
You're one of us.
Very good, Steak.
Get up, brat.
Go back to your rat hole.
Without limping!
Tell your buddies that no one robs in Li'l Zé's slum.
Go now. And no limping, okay?
Cool, Li'l Zé.
While Li'l Zé was winning the respect of the residents,
Benny was winning
Angelica's heart,
As for me, I was still a virgin, single and broke,
I had no choice,
I had to take a job
in a supermarket,
I worked long hours for chickenfeed,
I wanted to be laid off
so I could buy a camera with the severance pay,
But things didn't work out that way,
- It's the guy on the beach.
- Hey, bro!
- Still smoking good stuff?
- Yeah.
That guy's too cool.
Hey, kid. Come here.
Lift up your shirt.
We give these slum kids a chance and they don't appreciate it.
- What about my severance pay?
- What severance pay?
That fucking manager thought
I was part of the gang,
You're fired for serious misconduct.
Get out. Immediately!
I didn't get a single cent,
It was like a message from God:
"Honesty doesn't pay, sucker,"
The bus sure took a long time to come.
I should already be at work.
Shit, hide that gun.
Are you nuts?
It was Goose's.
It's broken anyway.
The company runs few buses on this line.
It's never anyone's fault.
It's always someone else.
It's my grandfather's fault.
And then, they make us squeeze!
Have a nice evening, ma'am.
I know that guy.
He lives in the City.
He'll recognize us.
So? He couldn't care less if we take his boss' money.
Okay. Let's go.
Well, boys?
Aren't you from the City of God?
Yeah.
I'll let one of you through without paying.
You should study so you can get out of the slum.
It's too full of cops and hoodlums.
Did you study?
I was in school and in the army.
I was the best marksman in my barracks.
This job was all
I could find afterwards.
But I do karate.
If I'm hired somewhere,
I'll leave the slum.
Do you fight, then?
I'm for peace and love.
But if I have to.
He didn't know he would have to,
But not yet, it's not time to tell Knockout Ned's story,
- We should be going.
- Let's go.
- Goodbye.
- Thanks.
See you.
I couldn't do it.
He was such a cool guy.
Yeah, totally.
That's Gerson's brother.
Let's go home.
There's nothing here except that bakery over there.
What will you say?
I don't know.
"This is a hold-up".
Here's my number.
- You like soul or groovy?
- Soul.
That one didn't work either,
The counter girl was just too fo xy,
And she flirted with me,
Will you call me?
I couldn't pull a gun on her, she was such a cool girl.
Yeah, I agree.
Excuse me.
I'm lost.
How do I get to Barra?
- To Barra?
- Yes.
I thought: "Tough luck for this guy from Sao Paulo, "
In fact, we were going there.
You're kidding.
- You're a lifesaver.
- That's right.
Because no guy from Sao Paulo could ever be cool,
The body's over here.
We found it, Chief.
The forensic expert!
- Not a pretty sight, eh?
- You said it.
- What a great singer.
- You like him?
I love music. What about you?
Tell me, do you also like pot?
I can't say
I've never tried it.
The devil recognizes his own.
Do you have papers?
I think so.
I have some.
I'd always been an ace at rolling a joint,
If I'd had the same skill with girls,
I'd never have lost so many chances to lose my virginity,
For a Sao Paulo guy you're really cool.
Thanks, bro.
What did they use?
A club or a rock.
And the child?
- Untouched.
- Thank goodness.
How long ago?
About four hours.
- Can we take it away?
- Go ahead.
The murderer has to be from the City of God.
You bastard! You motherfucker!
Did you have to kill your chick in the slum?
The place is crawling with cops now!
Come on, Li'l Zé.
Come on? Fuck you!
I had to avenge my honor.
Her family's turned me in.
You won't have any problems.
The cops are everywhere because of you.
You're dead meat, asshole.
Let up, Li'l Zé.
You've punished him enough.
You know the law.
Anyone who kills in my slum has to die as an example.
That was his business, Li'l Zé.
Listen, you sonofabitch, get outta the slum.
You showed no respect, understand?
You know what, Benny?
You're too nice. If you raise a snake, expect to get bitten.
He wasn't worth shit.
A dirty traitor.
Shut up, Tuba.
I'm going for a walk with my girl.
Okay, be careful.
When things calm down we'll get back to our business with Carrot, okay?
You need a girlfriend, Li'l Zé.
Know what I'm thinking, Benny?
That I'm so sexy?
That too. But I mean, you know what we could do?
Make love again.
I'm serious.
We could go away from here.
This violence sucks.
Go where?
To a farm.
We're really hippies at heart, aren't we?
A farm?
Peace and love?
Benny was just too cool to go on being a hoodlum,
He succeeded in getting everybody together
for his goodbye party,
The gangs,
The soul crowd,
The religious crowd,
One day, I'll go to church.
The samba crowd,
The groovy crowd,
And Li'l Zé, who had never danced in his life,
Want to dance with me?
Want to dance with me?
- I didn't hear.
- Want to dance?
No, thank you,
I'm with someone.
Hey, Rocket!
Come, I want to talk to you, buddy.
You can't just split with that chick.
Why not?
I'm gonna go live on a farm, smoke pot, listen to rock.
You wanna throw away everything we've accomplished for that bitch?
She's not a bitch, she's my girl.
We'll take over Carrot's business, it'll be yours.
Leave Carrot alone, he's a good guy.
He's a motherfucker!
See? Everyone's a motherfucker to you.
That's why I'm leaving.
I'm your friend, but I'm getting out.
You got to understand,
I have to go.
I love you, man, but I've had enough.
Motherfucker, let's see if you have any balls.
What is this?
You wanna die?
Fuck off, bitch!
Strip, nigger.
I wanna see your ass.
Hurry up!
Take it all off! Now!
I wanna see your ass.
Come on, faggot!
Let's go, nigger!
Show your ass to everyone!
Please.
Strip, dammit!
Hurry it up!
What's up, Benny?
This camera for a bag of coke?
I don't deal anymore.
C'mon, do it for me.
You're my friend.
- Is it stolen?
- It's okay, it's my dad's.
Your dad's?
Give it to Li'l Zé.
Rocket would love this camera.
- Yeah, here.
- Great.
Here I am!
- You wanna be a photographer?
- Yeah.
Here's a present.
Shit, dude! This is great!
Now move your ass.
Shake it!
You'll take some great pictures.
Give me that.
- Give me back the camera!
- No!
What's your problem?
Are you crazy?
They've killed Benny!
Fuck! Call an ambulance!
Where's the motherfucker who did it?
Z é, Benny is dead.
No! Call a doctor!
Get out of here, bitch!
It's your fault!
Motherfucker!
Where's Carrot?
Blacky's here.
He's in trouble.
I'm fucked.
- Why?
- I'm fucked.
And you are too.
I think I killed Benny.
Li'l Zé's coming to take your place.
We can get him, he's in the dance hall.
You killed Benny?
I didn't mean to. He moved.
I was aiming at Li'l Zé.
Come on, let's go.
Blacky.
You killed the coolest hood in the City of God.
Let's go get Li'l Zé.
Carrot knew that without Benny
only a miracle could save his business,
We're fucked, man.
But what better place
for a miracle to happen than in the City of God?
Look who's here.
My sugar babe.
- Let me by.
- Gimme a kiss, girl.
Let me by, please. Have you seen what you look like?
Come on, Li'l Zé.
Hi, honey.
Everything okay, baby?
The problem was simple,
Li'l Zé was ugly,
Knockout Ned was handsome,
Knockout Ned could get any girl,
Li'l Zé had to pay or use force,
It was a duel between the handsome good guy
and the ugly bad guy,
Let me go!
Just enjoy it.
You're mine now.
Hey, faggot, your broad's really hot!
I can't even look her in the face now.
Why didn't that fucker kill me?
Hold on.
Why didn't I kill that fucker?
Let's go back.
- What about Carrot?
- We'll get back to him.
You gonna kill him?
Knockout Ned, your chick's a slut.
Come out, motherfucker!
Come out, you loser!
Take it easy.
I'm going out. Let me go.
Gerson! Come back, son!
This doesn't concern you, kid.
We're here for your brother.
Let's talk, we can work it out.
My brother's a peaceful guy.
Is he too good-Iooking to come talk to me? Call him.
He hasn't done anything.
You know who I am?
- Li'l Zé, man.
- He's Li'l Zé.
Call that motherfucker!
Go on, man.
Calm down, I'll call him.
My arm!
I hurt my arm.
Carrot will have to wait.
That loser got what he deserved.
Let's go!
Gerson.
That bastard killed my brother.
I can't let that go.
Want a gun?
My son.
Calm down, mom.
Please, mom.
Do it right, asshole.
There's no other way.
How'd I let that loser hit me?
Shit, that's some hole.
- It's as if we were brothers.
- Shut up.
Both of us hurt in the arm.
You by one brother, me the other.
It would be really funny if we were brothers.
That Knockout Ned's not bad, eh?
He came out of nowhere.
Shut up, Tuba!
You're a fucking pain!
It was as if the City of God had suddenly found a hero,
God bless you, son.
That kid was just asking to be killed.
Well done.
You did a good job.
You'd better go hide.
I thought Knockout Ned would start a revolution here,
But God had other plans,
Steak, where are all the dealers?
They're hiding.
Li'l Zé is in a bad mood.
They get us hooked and then they go off and hide.
Do me a favor.
Go get some nose candy for me.
I'll try.
Tell them it's for Tiago, to keep my buzz going.
Steak'n'fries, go to Carrot's and tell him.
Li'l Zé says that if you kill
Knockout, he'll leave you alone.
Hey, Knockout Ned.
Did you hear that?
Grab the kid!
You heard the boy?
If you don't stick with us, you're dead.
I think you should join us.
We'll be partners.
Drugs aren't my thing.
This is just something between me and him.
Those guys aren't worth shit.
They'll do anything for power.
Like this kid.
They're all robots, like this punk here.
What's in your head, kid?
Can't you see you're wrecking your life with that maniac and a bunch of trigger-happy fools?
Are you crazy?
You're just a kid.
A kid? I smoke, snort,
I've killed and robbed.
I'm a man.
Shit, you have no idea!
He's attached to his gang.
You should join up with us.
Shall we kill him?
Steak, we're going to grind you.
Okay, I accept.
Great!
Tell your boss that Knockout Ned and Carrot are now in command.
But on one condition: no killing of innocent people.
I can't accept that, understand?
Okay, no innocent people.
Steak fucked up!
Have you a gun for me?
No, but we can hold up a gun store.
That's no problem.
I don't want to hold up anything.
I'm not a hoodlum.
This is a personal affair between me and him, okay?
I'm not a hoodlum.
He raped your chick, killed your uncle and brother, gunned your house, and you killed one of his guys.
If you're not a hood, then get out.
This is a hold-up!
The first time,,,
Where are the revolvers?
Knockout Ned saved a salesclerk form being shot by Carrot,
We said no killing!
That's the rule.
We want the boss's money.
Everyone keep calm.
You want us to go? We do too.
Look at the ground!
The second time, Carrot saved
Knockout Ned's life,
Ned learned that there's an exception to every rule,
Exception to the rule.
- Are you the manager?
- Yes.
This is a hold-up.
Everyone on the ground!
On the ground!
Give me the money!
I'm not kidding.
The first person who moves is dead!
The third time, the exception becomes the rule,
With the hold-up money
Carrot and Knockout Ned prepared to face Li'l Zé,
Carrot could protect his business,
Knockout Ned,
the best marksman in his battalion, wanted revenge,
First, the Italians.
This is a 9 mm.
- Let me see.
- Not bad, eh?
The sight isn't well-aligned.
I'll give you a good price.
The 12mm.
The "hand job".
See why?
An Uzi, 9mm. It's Israeli.
The star of David.
Jewish.
I want a 30-06.
Now we can start having fun.
The war's on.
Let's start with a prayer.
Our father who art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy name...
Hoodlums have guns, but can't shoot.
One bullet from Knockout Ned
was worth ten from Li'l Zé's gang,
Li'l Zé couldn't take it,
He counter-attacked,
The slum had been a purgatory, now it was hell,
I decided to get out,
That's how I became a reporter,
Great photo!
I bet it's by Rogerio Reis.
What did I tell you?
Like any pro,
I started at the bottom, way down at the bottom,
Without knowing what awaited me,
Instead of going home
I'd go over to the paper,
A guy from the City of God worked in the lab,
Check this out.
He helped me
move closer to what I loved most in life,
- Hi, Rogerio.
- How are you, Pierre?
This is Rocket.
He's a photographer.
Hello, Rocket.
- He's a fan of yours.
- Really?
You have good taste, Rocket!
- Well, I'm done. I'm off.
- See you.
What a cool guy!
What should have been a swift revenge
turned into an all-out war,
The City of God was divided,
You couldn't go from one section to the other,
Not even to visit a relative,
The cops considered anyone living in the slum a hoodlum,
People got used to living in Vietnam,
And more and more volunteers kept signing up to die,
This kid...
What do you want?
A boy from Carrot's gang punched me.
The war was an excuse for everything,
Li'l Zé's soldiers kicked my ass.
Take this.22.
The jerk who raped my sister is with Carrot.
Li'l Zé evicted my family.
Kill...
Be respected.
I'm Tiago, a friend of Benny's.
Can you read? Can you add?
I'm pretty good in business.
Okay, get to work.
What do you want?
To get my father's murderer.
What's your name?
My name's Otto.
What's the matter?
- He's a worker.
- But he wants a gun.
He won't last a week.
A year later, no one remembered
how it had all begun,
Take that!
For both sides, the aim was
to take over the enemy's business in order to buy
more guns and take over more businesses,
I smoke, snort,
I've killed and robbed,
I'm a man,
The media started taking an interest,
The police had to intervene,
A gang leader
from the City of God was arrested today,
Manuel Machado, aka Knockout Ned,
was hospitalized after being wounded by Li'l Zé's gang,
Our reporter interviewed him,
Is the war still going on?
It's still going on,
Have many people died?
Many have died,
Mostly innocent people,
Just knowing me is enough
to get you killed by Li'l Zé,
The police don't go in there?
They go after me, not him,
I've been in jail, while he goes on killing undisturbed,
And they don't arrest him,
Knockout Ned says the war will continue,
Police Chief Guedes
has promised to arrest both of the gangs,
Motherfucker!
I'm the boss here, but he gets his picture in the paper!
- Have you found mine?
- Just Knockout Ned's.
Keep looking.
At least my name's got to be in there.
- There's nothing.
- Can you read?
Just the pictures.
Nothing.
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?
It's just the want ads.
I don't care, read everything!
But there aren't any articles.
Want a bullet in your head?
Gotta show them who's boss here.
- Give me the camera!
- No way!
Take my picture, man.
I can't work it.
Go ahead.
I'll hold the Beretta.
Let me try.
Back off.
There's no click.
What a bunch of bozos!
I'm fucked, with you guys.
I have an idea.
I'll go get a guy I know.
Hang loose.
Here he is.
Take the camera.
Well, kid?
Aren't you a photographer?
Make the camera work.
We can't do it.
Take our picture.
- You fucking broke it.
- It wasn't me.
I found it.
It has to be wound.
What's your name?
Rocket.
Another picture, Rocket.
How about two rows?
What?
Two rows.
Everyone with their guns.
You're outside, for Christ's sake!
Talk to him nicely, kid.
Sorry.
Move in, please.
Another one.
I think the roll's finished.
Then show us the pictures.
They have to be developed.
Developed?
How much is it?
Take this money.
And bring back the pictures.
I have to remove the film.
Keep the camera.
Benny wanted to give it to you, didn't he?
- It's yours.
- Thanks.
Don't forget the pictures.
The photos, Rocket!
- Pierre!
- What?
Can you develop this for me?
I can't, Rocket.
I could get into trouble.
It's only for the paper's reporters. I could risk my job.
- Pierre?
- Yes, Rogerio?
Develop these for me.
This one too, okay?
I'm going to lunch.
You're lucky.
What size?
What?
For the enlargement, what size?
Well...
Whatever you think is best.
- Here.
- Thanks.
I'm in deep shit now.
I'm as good as dead.
Someone had signed my death sentence,
I wanted to bash the jerk's face in,
Are you Marina?
You stole my photos.
Because of you,
I'm dead.
Dead? Stole? What do you mean?
Not so loud.
Not so loud?
I'll be killed because of you.
You were gone, your photos were in the lab.
There's nothing I can do.
The photos in our lab are photos to be published in the paper.
I saw the photos,
I published them.
You stole them.
I did not. Here they are.
- Give them to me.
- Just a second.
Here are your photos.
Are there any others?
Calm down.
What's your name?
- Rocket.
- Rocket?
Nice to meet you.
I'm Marina.
Now, relax.
I have money for you.
For your pictures.
Here, when we use a picture we pay the photographer.
Do you want to be a photographer?
Yes.
Great start!
On the front page.
How'd you get these photos?
I live there.
Rocket, no photographer has ever been able to go in there.
If you could bring us more pictures of Li'l Zé, the paper would buy them.
We'd pay you.
Could you?
I don't know.
What's the problem?
The problem? I can't go there anymore at night.
And during the day?
It's too risky.
Look, man! They've finally understood that I'm the boss.
What's your photographer-friend's name?
Rocket.
He's good. I'll take more to show the others.
So, Rocket, is it yes or no?
It's a great opportunity.
Okay.
You made the right choice.
Very good!
I'll give you some film, lenses, and even another camera. I'll show you the equipment room.
There's another problem.
- What is it?
- Where can I sleep tonight?
I can't go back now.
This is a 135mm.
Will you be close up or far away?
Far away.
- Can you measure the light?
- Yes.
Aren't you too close?
I don't know what spurred me to go talk to them like that,
Maybe I was going to die,
but now I had a camera
and a chance to become a photographer,
Watch out for the dog shit.
Not to mention that the night was still young,
Want something to eat?
No, thank you, ma'am.
Nothing to eat?
Nothing to drink?
A joint?
Try this.
It's time to go to sleep.
I'll show you your bed.
You have hot water, don't you?
Yes. You've never taken a hot shower?
- No.
- What do you do?
We heat up the kettle.
Why are you standing there?
What room do I sleep in?
Unfortunately, there's only one room.
You have to sleep with me.
I won't go into the details of my first sexual experience,
Just relax.
Because, elsewhere
another more important sex scene for the slum
was taking place,
Carrot was helping
Knockout Ned escape
without firing a shot,
The policeman guarding him
was in the willing hands of the nurse,
And in the meantime
to eliminate Carrot, Li'l Zé was investing in munitions,
He invested heavily, even if he couldn't pay,
Remember the double-barrel?
I already have it.
This is a repeater rifle.
You don't have this one, the Browning.
It'll shoot down a plane.
I'm not shooting down planes.
And the one I asked for?
The AR-15, Uncle Sam.
You can't get them in Brazil.
My ass, Uncle Sam.
I have a solution.
The Rugger. Ever seen one?
It's like the AR-15.
Same caliber, but lighter.
With an infrared sight?
400 shots a minute?
It depends.
It depends, my ass!
Trying to fuck me over?
I'll fuck you over first.
You leave now without the money or the guns.
What do I tell the boss?
That's your problem.
You'll think of something.
You heard him, chubby?
Get out.
Beat it, fatso.
Li'l Zé had made a big mistake,
He should have known
that behind every salesman lies a supplier,
And they don't joke around,
Have you seen this?
What do they need an AR-15 for?
These stories will push the police to investigate.
They'll nab you.
And me, along with you.
Think I'm going to give you away?
Don't worry,
I'll take care of it.
But don't fuck up again.
Charlie!
Come here!
Listen, you tell him.
Let's go make that sleazy little dealer pay up.
Come here, kids!
Do you like chicken?
It depends.
We'll eat some chicken and have Carrot for dessert.
I have a present for you.
Here.
A big one for you.
Are you really giving us these guns?
Yes, but I want you on my side, against Carrot.
Then can we hold up anyone we want?
Not in the slum.
- Can you shoot?
- More or less.
More or less?
Hey, you guys, come help these kids.
I know. You do it like this.
Get that chicken!
C'mon, let's go.
If Li'l Zé catches you, he'll kill you.
Yeah, well, he's gotta find me first.
Hey, kid! Get that chicken!
Shit! The cops!
Hell, don't fucking run off!
Give me that.
Hey, Melonhead!
You fucking fag!
Get the hell out of here!
Coward!
Asshole!
Come on, let them kill each other.
They can fuck themselves.
Rocket! Take a picture of us!
What are you waiting for?
What's happening?
Shit!
Let's go!
Run! Run!
Watch out!
Kill one of these faggots!
Blast him!
Knockout Ned!
Take it easy. Don't move.
It hurts, man.
Easy does it, kid.
Why did you join this fucking war?
Knockout Ned!
Li'l Zé's been hit. Come on!
Wait here, I'll help you.
Just hold on.
- What's your name?
- My name's Otto,
I want to get my father's murderer.
Knockout Ned!
Li'l Zé's been hit. Come on!
I'll help you.
Just hold on there.
The fucking cops!
On the ground!
- Don't move!
- Hands over your head.
- You're the one I want.
- You're finished, pal.
Handcuff him.
Rocket, where are you going?
I got something to clear up.
Okay, lovebirds.
Come on, Li'l Zé, let's go settle our scores.
Not you.
You're a present for the media.
Does it come to 10,000?
Almost. That's all I have.
That's all there was, Chief.
We searched everywhere.
Let him go.
What about this ring?
Is it gold?
Fill it up.
You'll owe us the rest.
Fucking war!
Knockout Ned is dead and I'm dead broke!
You're fucked, eh?
Kids, we'll have to do a few hold-ups to get my business going again.
Your business, Li'l Zé?
What's your problem, kid?
This is for our friend, motherfucker!
A Soviet attack!
The business is ours!
This picture of the hood will guarantee my salary,
This one will make me famous,
lt'll even make the cover of a magazine,
I won't have to worry about Li'l Zé anymore,
But the cops?
Gangster, Self-styled "Boss"
Of The City Of God, Shot Dead
This photo could've gotten us killed?
I think so.
A least it got you a job.
Not a job, an internship.
It pays a little, doesn't it?
A little.
What about that lady journalist? Was she a good lay?
More or less.
You didn't like it?
I don't think journalists know how to screw.
Yeah, I guess so.
Cocoa robbed 3 houses in Barra.
Better kill him.
Who shot Roger?
- It was Beef.
- Kill that fucker.
We should kill the Chief and Gringo as well.
What about Cherry?
Let's go.
Us two, and 3 others.
It's a deal.
Have you heard of the Red Brigade?
No, but if they come, we'll kill them.
- Who knows how to write?
- Me, sort of.
Let's make a black list.
We'll kill them all.
Put fucking Nightowl on there.
And Croquet.
Leonard, too, he owes me money.
And China-Man, he thinks he's hot stuff.
And Claudio.
Where's Giant?
Come on, Giant!
I forgot to say,
my name isn't Rocket anymore,
I'm now Wilson Rodrigues, photographer,
Manuel Machado, aka Knockout Ned,
was hospitalized after being wounded by Li'l Zé's gang,
On leaving the hospital, our reporter interviewed him,
Many have died,
Mostly innocent people,
Just knowing me is enough,
just being my friend,
If he thinks someone knows me,
he'll kill them,
The police don't go in there?
They go after me, not him,
I've been in jail 3 times, while he goes on
killing undisturbed,
And they don't arrest him,
Knockout Ned says the war will continue,
Police Chief Guedes has promised to arrest
both gangs in the City of God,

<SYNC Start=1027793><P>What?

<SYNC Start=1423287><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1426425><P>Christ!<br>What is she doing in your car?
<SYNC Start=1430794><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1430862><P>Why is she in your car?
<SYNC Start=1432124><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1432197><P>-l kidnapped her.<br>-What?
<SYNC Start=1433858><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1435600><P>Are you crazy?
<SYNC Start=1436897><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1436968><P>We have the right<br>to take revenge.
<SYNC Start=1438936><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1439004><P>The bastards just threw us out<br>on the streets!
<SYNC Start=1443441><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1443508><P>-Why is that her problem?<br>-She can make us rich.
<SYNC Start=1446739><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1446812><P>Do you know<br>what she earns a year?
<SYNC Start=1448677><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1448747><P>-A million, without gigs.<br>-So what?
<SYNC Start=1452239><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1452317><P>You don't think that's a lot?
<SYNC Start=1454012><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1454085><P>Jean, others make a lot more<br>than a million.
<SYNC Start=1456576><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1456655><P>But they're not sleeping<br>in my car, are they?
<SYNC Start=1459556><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1459624><P>-l'm leaving.<br>-No, you have to help me.
<SYNC Start=1463651><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1463728><P>-l can't do it alone.<br>-l'm not doing it, Jean!
<SYNC Start=1466697><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1466765><P>Come on, it's easy.
<SYNC Start=1469529><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1469601><P>Do you realize<br>we could end up in prison?
<SYNC Start=1472468><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1472537><P>Only if they catch us.
<SYNC Start=1474368><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1474439><P>And if we're smart they will<br>never catch us. Never!
<SYNC Start=1478170><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1478243><P>One million dollars.<br>We split it fifty-fifty.
<SYNC Start=1482373><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1482447><P>No!
<SYNC Start=1484278><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1484349><P>l thought you were a friend.
<SYNC Start=1486442><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1486518><P>l am your friend,<br>but leave her alone.
<SYNC Start=1488383><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1488453><P>Absolutely not!
<SYNC Start=1489579><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1489654><P>l will do this!<br>On my own if l have to.
<SYNC Start=1492555><P><br>

<SYNC Start=1497019><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1497095><P>l don't have a job.<br>l'm sick of it!

<SYNC Start=1537102><P>-What's wrong?<br>-Nothing.
<SYNC Start=1540037><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1540105><P>-l can't sleep. That's all.<br>-Go sleep on the couch then.
<SYNC Start=1543768><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1545343><P>Do you really have to go<br>to Madrid tomorrow?
<SYNC Start=1548176><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1548246><P>lt's very expensive, and l think<br>we should watch our money.
<SYNC Start=1552512><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1552584><P>Don't worry, l'll pay you back.
<SYNC Start=1554814><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1554886><P>That's not the point.<br>lt's just so...
<SYNC Start=1557252><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1558523><P>Such a seminar.<br>Does it really take three weeks?
<SYNC Start=1562220><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1562294><P>l thought it was much shorter.
<SYNC Start=1564285><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1564362><P>What do you know about seminars?
<SYNC Start=1566125><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1566197><P>l don't tell you what a bottle<br>should look like, do l?
<SYNC Start=1569928><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1570001><P>Stop treating me like an idiot!
<SYNC Start=1572799><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1580345><P>l don't think<br>you're an idiot, silly.
<SYNC Start=1585373><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1585450><P>l'm very grateful that you're<br>helping me out with my course.
<SYNC Start=1590319><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1590388><P>Madrid is very important.
<SYNC Start=1593755><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1593825><P>And if l want a career,<br>l have to be there.
<SYNC Start=1599161><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1599230><P>l'd much rather stay with you,<br>but this is a one-off seminar.
<SYNC Start=1605396><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1605470><P>So l have to be there.<br>Do you understand that?
<SYNC Start=1610066><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1629294><P>Hello.

<SYNC Start=1655109><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1694025><P>Not bad.
<SYNC Start=1695515><P><br>

<SYNC Start=1698562><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1698630><P>l used a false name,<br>so we won't have to pay.
<SYNC Start=1701360><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1721820><P>Aren't those sleeping pills<br>dangerous?
<SYNC Start=1724220><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1725824><P>Not at all.
<SYNC Start=1727519><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1727592><P>l had to give her two more pills<br>last night when she woke up.
<SYNC Start=1730959><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1731029><P>That's not necessary now,<br>because you're here.
<SYNC Start=1734556><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1745310><P>-What's that?<br>-Liz's old clothes.
<SYNC Start=1750145><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1750215><P>l thought maybe<br>she could wear them.
<SYNC Start=1753946><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1754018><P>She's not performing.
<SYNC Start=1755144><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1755220><P>She can't keep wearing<br>that outfit.
<SYNC Start=1758678><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1758757><P>-Willy, we are not on holiday.<br>-l know that!
<SYNC Start=1763694><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1763762><P>But we might as well<br>make the best of it.
<SYNC Start=1765957><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1766030><P>And if you don't like it,<br>l will leave.
<SYNC Start=1768555><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1770168><P>Stop! Calm down.
<SYNC Start=1773763><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1776274><P>l'll go and see the one<br>who's going to make us rich.
<SYNC Start=1779471><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1792957><P>-Well?<br>-She's not answering.
<SYNC Start=1794549><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1794626><P>Stuck in traffic.
<SYNC Start=1795752><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1795827><P>-But it's live.<br>-l know, damn it.
<SYNC Start=1799194><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1799264><P>l should never<br>have given her a day off.
<SYNC Start=1801494><P><br>

<SYNC Start=1820145><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1820218><P>-We kidnapped her.<br>-What?
<SYNC Start=1823415><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1825423><P>-Who's this?<br>-That doesn't matter.
<SYNC Start=1828449><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1828526><P>We have Debbie, and if you<br>don't do what we ask...
<SYNC Start=1831393><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1831462><P>you'll never see her again.
<SYNC Start=1832895><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1832964><P>Who are you?<br>What do you want?
<SYNC Start=1835865><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1835934><P>We don't want<br>the police involved.
<SYNC Start=1838198><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1839304><P>Wait till we contact you again.
<SYNC Start=1841397><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1849347><P>l told them if you<br>don't do what l say...
<SYNC Start=1852714><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1852784><P>l'll cut her head off.
<SYNC Start=1855252><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1861659><P>She's not in pain is she?
<SYNC Start=1864526><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1869267><P>Jean, what are you doing?
<SYNC Start=1870962><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1873705><P>Jean, that isn't necessary.<br>She's already seen you.
<SYNC Start=1877300><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1877375><P>But she hasn't seen you yet.
<SYNC Start=1878740><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1882847><P>-Jean, l can't do this.<br>-Don't start!
<SYNC Start=1886214><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1886284><P>Think about what you're going<br>to do with all that money.
<SYNC Start=1889117><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1894692><P>Good, l'm going.<br>Our Marva is singing.
<SYNC Start=1900892><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1900965><P>Willy, don't do anything stupid.
<SYNC Start=1903866><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1903935><P>OKeep her tied up,<br>and don't talk to her.
<SYNC Start=1907427><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1911910><P>-You can count on me, Jean.<br>-l hope so.
<SYNC Start=1915073><P><br>

<SYNC Start=1981346><P>Too bad, Marva.<br>And now our next candidate...
<SYNC Start=1984713><P><br>

<SYNC Start=2042029><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2055353><P>Why didn't you tell me<br>it was so tight?
<SYNC Start=2059153><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2062360><P>Why don't you try<br>a different genre?
<SYNC Start=2064624><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2064695><P>Opera or gospel.
<SYNC Start=2067721><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2089720><P>Hello?
<SYNC Start=2090846><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2090922><P>-Are you alone?<br>-Where is Debbie?

<SYNC Start=2206003><P>Not bad.
<SYNC Start=2207698><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2211609><P>How long would it take to make<br>a complete song from this?
<SYNC Start=2214476><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2217815><P>That depends on inspiration.
<SYNC Start=2219282><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2219350><P>lt can take a day,<br>but also a month or longer.
<SYNC Start=2222945><P><br>

<SYNC Start=2231693><P><br>

<SYNC Start=2311075><P>He's at home. Alone.<br>Without food.
<SYNC Start=2315603><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2318616><P>He's home alone, without food.<br>l always leave the TV on.
<SYNC Start=2324816><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2324889><P>So he doesn't feel alone.
<SYNC Start=2327551><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2327625><P>But now he's alone without food.<br>He'll die from loneliness.
<SYNC Start=2332927><P><br>

<SYNC Start=2390343><P><br>

<SYNC Start=2395393><P>l don't want<br>to worry the fans...
<SYNC Start=2398328><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2398396><P>but it looks like we're dealing<br>with professionals.
<SYNC Start=2402230><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2402299><P>The police are working hard,<br>but have no leads.
<SYNC Start=2405894><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2405970><P>That's why l'm asking the fans<br>to keep an eye out...
<SYNC Start=2409269><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2409340><P>and notify the police<br>of anything suspicious.
<SYNC Start=2412673><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2412743><P>This abduction comes<br>at a very bad time, right?
<SYNC Start=2416338><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2416414><P>Yes. We were going to release<br>her new single next week.
<SYNC Start=2423252><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2423320><P>But we don't know<br>where she'll be next week.
<SYNC Start=2426084><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2426157><P>Oh, Jesus Christ!
<SYNC Start=2428557><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2428626><P>Come on, Jean.<br>lt's not that bad, is it?
<SYNC Start=2432255><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2432329><P>To console the fans...
<SYNC Start=2434820><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2434899><P>we've decided to release<br>the single tomorrow.
<SYNC Start=2438130><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2438202><P>A great idea, Michael.
<SYNC Start=2440500><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2440571><P>Debbie's bike was found<br>in a field...
<SYNC Start=2442835><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2442907><P>not far from the freeway.
<SYNC Start=2446468><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2446544><P>The police<br>have searched the area...
<SYNC Start=2448444><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2448512><P>but have failed<br>to find anything.
<SYNC Start=2451003><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2513310><P>Good evening.

<SYNC Start=2515112><P>Hello.
<SYNC Start=2516545><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2535332><P>There's been a breakthrough<br>in the abduction of Debbie.
<SYNC Start=2540565><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2540638><P>A man entered the singer's<br>apartment at around 10 p.m...
<SYNC Start=2545541><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2545609><P>and took the entertainer's dog.
<SYNC Start=2548703><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2548779><P>-lt took only minutes...<br>-They also kidnapped her dog.
<SYNC Start=2553807><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2553884><P>-What?<br>-Last night.
<SYNC Start=2555909><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2555986><P>The suspect is a tall man<br>in his late twenties.
<SYNC Start=2559922><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2559990><P>He didn't have to force his way<br>into the apartment.
<SYNC Start=2563426><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2563494><P>lt seemed he had the keys.
<SYNC Start=2565428><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2565496><P>Her manager said that he's<br>afraid the dog will be used...
<SYNC Start=2570957><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2571035><P>to demand a higher ransom.
<SYNC Start=2572764><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2572836><P>Or to put more pressure<br>on Debbie.
<SYNC Start=2575669><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2575739><P>He thinks the kidnappers<br>won't stop at anything.
<SYNC Start=2578264><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2578342><P>Such animals.
<SYNC Start=2579502><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2584181><P>Where are you going?
<SYNC Start=2585512><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2620551><P>l thought l could count on you,<br>god damn it!
<SYNC Start=2623019><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2624088><P>Why did you get that stupid dog?
<SYNC Start=2626784><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2626857><P>-Els was...<br>-Who's Els?
<SYNC Start=2629382><P><br>

<SYNC Start=2634730><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2634798><P>And no talking!
<SYNC Start=2635924><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2636000><P>The girl was hysterical.<br>l had to do something.
<SYNC Start=2638730><P><br>

<SYNC Start=2647306><P><br>

<SYNC Start=2649539><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2661392><P>l will never forget it.<br>He was a real gangster.
<SYNC Start=2667024><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2667097><P>A voyeur.<br>Nobody's safe anymore.
<SYNC Start=2673093><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2673170><P>What are they going to do<br>with our Debbie?
<SYNC Start=2675638><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2675706><P>Hypocritical bitch!
<SYNC Start=2677799><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2677875><P>She's always complaining<br>about the music, about the dog.
<SYNC Start=2681606><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2681679><P>Be quiet!
<SYNC Start=2683840><P><br>

<SYNC Start=2690452><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2690521><P>He is a tall, thin man<br>of North-African descent.
<SYNC Start=2696756><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2696827><P>That is typical<br>of that stupid bitch.
<SYNC Start=2699728><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2699797><P>She blames everything<br>on the Moroccans.
<SYNC Start=2702322><P><br>

<SYNC Start=2789544><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2791655><P>l can't really refuse, can l?
<SYNC Start=2794954><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2797327><P>lt's quite personal.

<SYNC Start=2807928><P><br>

<SYNC Start=2842738><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2845242><P>Do you want an honest answer?

<SYNC Start=2849213><P>l've never slept with any<br>of them, and l never will.
<SYNC Start=2853047><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2854184><P>Do you know why?
<SYNC Start=2855583><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2856820><P>Because l've got talent.

<SYNC Start=2894213><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2894291><P>Yes.
<SYNC Start=2896623><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2896693><P>Today?<br>Same time, same place?

<SYNC Start=2902132><P>Don't do anything stupid, pal.
<SYNC Start=2903895><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2903967><P>Why would l?

<SYNC Start=2922549><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2922619><P>A summer's day.
<SYNC Start=2924018><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2924087><P>The cycle doesn't end,<br>our blood doesn't change.

<SYNC Start=2935899><P>There can only be two reasons...
<SYNC Start=2937526><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2937601><P>why you make this beautiful poem<br>sound so trite.
<SYNC Start=2942971><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2943040><P>Either you've never made love...
<SYNC Start=2944769><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2946777><P>or you just can't communicate<br>anything valuable to others.
<SYNC Start=2950713><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2950781><P>Don't let her get to you.<br>She's just a bitch.
<SYNC Start=2954308><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2954384><P>No, she's right.<br>l'm worthless.
<SYNC Start=2956648><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2956720><P>-That's not true, Marva.<br>-lt is.
<SYNC Start=2959814><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2959890><P>And on Sunday?
<SYNC Start=2961016><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2961091><P>When we do the puppet show<br>for the children?
<SYNC Start=2963389><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2963460><P>That's different.
<SYNC Start=2965291><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2965362><P>Children accept me for who l am,<br>and adults...
<SYNC Start=2969128><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2969199><P>only look at the outside.<br>lt's not fair.
<SYNC Start=2973465><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2975005><P>See you tomorrow.
<SYNC Start=2976199><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3017114><P>You don't like it?
<SYNC Start=3018741><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3018815><P>Sorry, but it's<br>the first time in my life...
<SYNC Start=3024048><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3024121><P>that l've heard real instruments<br>play something l made myself.
<SYNC Start=3028319><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3028392><P>And it is fantastic!
<SYNC Start=3031828><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3035832><P>lt is really fantastic.
<SYNC Start=3038767><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3040670><P>-Does it have a title?<br>-"'Lucky Manuelo."'
<SYNC Start=3044902><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3044975><P>Or "'Lucky Manuela."'
<SYNC Start=3046101><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3046176><P>That depends on who sings it.<br>Man or woman.
<SYNC Start=3048576><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3048645><P>Then it's "'Lucky Manuelo."'
<SYNC Start=3050943><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3052315><P>Are you not going to sing it?
<SYNC Start=3054044><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3054117><P>No, it's for my--<br>for someone l know.
<SYNC Start=3057746><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3057821><P>She's not that famous yet,<br>but she is very talented.
<SYNC Start=3061052><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3064795><P>You would be<br>very satisfied with her.
<SYNC Start=3068196><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3068265><P>She's a really good singer.
<SYNC Start=3070733><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3073203><P>l'd have to meet her.
<SYNC Start=3074795><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3077274><P>Do you have a pen?
<SYNC Start=3079003><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3082779><P>532-2376.<br>Her name is Marva.
<SYNC Start=3088649><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3088718><P>lsn't she dead?
<SYNC Start=3089980><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3090053><P>No, this is a new one.
<SYNC Start=3092351><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3092422><P>Call her tomorrow at 9:00<br>and ask her over.
<SYNC Start=3095949><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3096026><P>You'll see l'm right.
<SYNC Start=3097584><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3104801><P>By the way, how's Debbie?
<SYNC Start=3106098><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3107637><P>She's all right.<br>The dog is with her now, so...
<SYNC Start=3111937><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3114377><P>Jerry is never this nice.
<SYNC Start=3116174><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3116246><P>That's not true.<br>How old is he?
<SYNC Start=3118908><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3119649><P>Five.
<SYNC Start=3120946><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3122486><P>He's my only friend.
<SYNC Start=3124147><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3125088><P>Don't you have...
<SYNC Start=3127921><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3127991><P>any other...
<SYNC Start=3130459><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3130527><P>male friends?
<SYNC Start=3132154><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3138301><P>l usually don't have<br>enough time.
<SYNC Start=3140826><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3142172><P>And if l do have time,<br>the men are too scared.
<SYNC Start=3144640><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3149980><P>l haven't had sex in two years.
<SYNC Start=3151971><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3154050><P>l would never last that long.
<SYNC Start=3156018><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3158421><P>Me neither.
<SYNC Start=3159581><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3172969><P>l can't untie you.
<SYNC Start=3174402><P><br>

<SYNC Start=3194991><P>ls it nice, girls?
<SYNC Start=3197289><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3200997><P>l think the telephone<br>will ring later.
<SYNC Start=3203295><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3206469><P>Don't you believe me?
<SYNC Start=3209029><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3211441><P>Why would the telephone ring?
<SYNC Start=3213534><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3213610><P>Because someone<br>is going to call us.
<SYNC Start=3215942><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3216012><P>Dad, please. lf you made another<br>cassette, just put it on...
<SYNC Start=3220972><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3228858><P>l think that's for you.
<SYNC Start=3230587><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3234598><P>And l think it's good news.

<SYNC Start=3262993><P>He wants to see me at his office<br>this afternoon for an audition.
<SYNC Start=3266429><P><br>

<SYNC Start=3274671><P>Willy van Outreve...
<SYNC Start=3276571><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3280310><P>You can kidnap me<br>any time you want.
<SYNC Start=3284110><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3286883><P>l've never been so happy.
<SYNC Start=3289078><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3308672><P>Should l do it again?
<SYNC Start=3310003><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3310073><P>No. Can you wait outside<br>for a moment?
<SYNC Start=3312803><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3319649><P>That won't work.
<SYNC Start=3321082><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3323787><P>You know what they always say?
<SYNC Start=3326585><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3326656><P>Make the best<br>of what you've got.
<SYNC Start=3329489><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3329559><P>There is still no breakthrough<br>in the kidnap case...
<SYNC Start=3332050><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3332128><P>that has gripped the nation<br>for the last few days.
<SYNC Start=3335359><P><br>

<SYNC Start=3354847><P><br>

<SYNC Start=3362859><P>-lt's beautiful here.<br>-Do you think so?
<SYNC Start=3365794><P><br>

<SYNC Start=3381307><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3381378><P>when it's still light outside.
<SYNC Start=3383403><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3383480><P>You're joking.

<SYNC Start=3390687><P>lf you do what l tell you,<br>everything will change.
<SYNC Start=3393713><P><br>

<SYNC Start=3452415><P>This is my first time<br>in general.
<SYNC Start=3454383><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3454451><P>Don't you have a boyfriend?
<SYNC Start=3456146><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3457954><P>Do you still live at home?
<SYNC Start=3459945><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3460023><P>Yes, but not for long.
<SYNC Start=3461354><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3461424><P>They get on my nerves,<br>especially my dad.
<SYNC Start=3463949><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3464027><P>He has no faith in me at all.<br>You know what l mean?
<SYNC Start=3467690><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3467764><P>He hums his own compositions<br>into a tape recorder...
<SYNC Start=3470232><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3470300><P>and then he wants me<br>to sing them.
<SYNC Start=3472825><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3472902><P>He is such a loser.
<SYNC Start=3474802><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3474871><P>You shouldn't talk about<br>your father like that, Marva.
<SYNC Start=3478307><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3482679><P>Are you sure Debbie<br>did this too?
<SYNC Start=3485307><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3485381><P>They all do this, sweetheart.
<SYNC Start=3487008><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3487083><P>All of them.
<SYNC Start=3488948><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3500730><P>Michael has gone to a meeting.<br>Can l take a message?
<SYNC Start=3504723><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3504801><P>No, l just want<br>to know something.
<SYNC Start=3507269><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3507337><P>A singer came by today<br>for an audition.
<SYNC Start=3510306><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3510373><P>Do you know if she...
<SYNC Start=3514605><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3514677><P>if she was good?
<SYNC Start=3515871><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3515945><P>No sir,<br>l'm afraid l can't help you.
<SYNC Start=3518971><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3530927><P>l guess l can forget<br>about a career now?
<SYNC Start=3533122><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3534297><P>Don't worry.
<SYNC Start=3535855><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3539936><P>You'll get your chance.
<SYNC Start=3541301><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3551581><P>Do you think this will have<br>lasting effects on Debbie?
<SYNC Start=3554072><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3554150><P>lt is clear that Debbie<br>won't come out of this unharmed.
<SYNC Start=3558484><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3558555><P>She obviously has<br>a zest for living...
<SYNC Start=3560523><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3560590><P>but someone who experiences<br>such a thing...
<SYNC Start=3563821><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3563893><P>could fall apart completely.
<SYNC Start=3566487><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3575805><P>Why did you change the channel?<br>l was watching it.
<SYNC Start=3579138><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3582211><P>-Finally.<br>-And? How did it go?
<SYNC Start=3585942><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3586015><P>Very well.
<SYNC Start=3587312><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3590019><P>l sang, and we ate<br>in a Chinese restaurant.
<SYNC Start=3594854><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3594924><P>He said l'm very talented and<br>he is going to make me a star.
<SYNC Start=3599657><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3601264><P>How did you like the song?
<SYNC Start=3602492><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3602565><P>"'Lucky Manuelo"'? Beautiful.
<SYNC Start=3605295><P><br>

<SYNC Start=3617270><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3617347><P>You look so different.
<SYNC Start=3619212><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3619282><P>What do you mean different?
<SYNC Start=3621682><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3622685><P>Just different.
<SYNC Start=3624312><P><br>

<SYNC Start=3627481><P><br>

<SYNC Start=3636933><P>l've always said it.<br>Marva should sing Flemish songs.
<SYNC Start=3640926><P><br>

<SYNC Start=3643837><P><br>

<SYNC Start=3715278><P>-The police are here already?<br>-We're all alone, Jean.
<SYNC Start=3719078><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3720616><P>Don't be afraid.<br>l didn't give you away.
<SYNC Start=3722880><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3724620><P>Why not?
<SYNC Start=3725951><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3726022><P>Because l am going to do you<br>a favor, if you do me one.

<SYNC Start=3753838><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3753916><P>She's in Madrid.
<SYNC Start=3756043><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3756119><P>We didn't tell anyone<br>about what we're doing.
<SYNC Start=3758849><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3758921><P>Very smart.<br>ls your friend trustworthy?
<SYNC Start=3761355><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3764794><P>Here. Just in case<br>we need each other.

<SYNC Start=3771791><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3771868><P>Do you know who's going to be<br>on "'Wheel of Music"' tomorrow?
<SYNC Start=3775133><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3776873><P>The same as always, probably.
<SYNC Start=3782334><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3782411><P>Your daughter.
<SYNC Start=3784208><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3789218><P>Her very first<br>television performance.
<SYNC Start=3793985><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3805201><P>Well? What do you think?
<SYNC Start=3807761><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3809405><P>Why does she have<br>to wear a mask?
<SYNC Start=3811965><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3812041><P>l already told you, madam.
<SYNC Start=3813702><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3813776><P>Michael wants to create<br>a mystery around her.
<SYNC Start=3816904><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3816979><P>l think he should be here<br>to pay his mystery.
<SYNC Start=3819470><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3819549><P>He's very busy at the moment,<br>but you'll get your money.

<SYNC Start=3829555><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3829625><P>ls it worth it?
<SYNC Start=3831217><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3832428><P>Of course, Mom. Doesn't everyone<br>want to be famous?
<SYNC Start=3835192><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3835264><P>Yes, and l wonder why.
<SYNC Start=3837061><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3837133><P>What do you mean?
<SYNC Start=3838760><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3838835><P>Why can't anyone be happy<br>with a normal life?
<SYNC Start=3841360><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3841437><P>Who could be happy<br>with a normal life?
<SYNC Start=3844065><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3844140><P>-Me.<br>-You?
<SYNC Start=3845698><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3845775><P>Yes, me. l have a beautiful<br>daughter and a good husband.
<SYNC Start=3849074><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3849145><P>-Oh, yeah?<br>-And he's also a good father.
<SYNC Start=3852080><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3852148><P>He doesn't drink,<br>he's honest, he's sweet.
<SYNC Start=3854742><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3854817><P>l have a family, and l won't let<br>anybody destroy it!
<SYNC Start=3858014><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3858087><P>Come here.
<SYNC Start=3859384><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3861591><P>-What is going on?<br>-What do you mean?
<SYNC Start=3863889><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3863960><P>Something isn't right.
<SYNC Start=3865825><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3865895><P>Why is that Michael<br>suddenly giving you a chance?
<SYNC Start=3868591><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3868664><P>He says--
<SYNC Start=3869824><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3869899><P>You didn't do anything<br>with him, did you?
<SYNC Start=3871890><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3873636><P>Why do you say such a thing?
<SYNC Start=3875263><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3876839><P>l want the truth. Marva!
<SYNC Start=3878807><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3880977><P>Nothing happened.
<SYNC Start=3883036><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3883112><P>Really?
<SYNC Start=3884272><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3888084><P>Really, Mom.
<SYNC Start=3890780><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3895491><P>"'Lucky Manuelo"'<br>is the new single...
<SYNC Start=3897516><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3897593><P>by a singer who apparently<br>wants to stay unknown.
<SYNC Start=3901552><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3901631><P>Tonight is her first big<br>television performance.
<SYNC Start=3905829><P><br>

<SYNC Start=3907303><P>Here's Lonesome Zora<br>with "'Lucky Manuelo."'
<SYNC Start=3910739><P><br>

<SYNC Start=3930791><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3930860><P>l'm much more nervous<br>than l thought.
<SYNC Start=3933226><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3933296><P>l don't even want to go<br>to the recording.
<SYNC Start=3935787><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3935865><P>l'll sure be watching tonight.
<SYNC Start=3937594><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3937667><P>l wouldn't miss it<br>for the world.
<SYNC Start=3939828><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3939902><P>Why don't you come<br>and watch it at my house?
<SYNC Start=3942894><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3942972><P>-l might be less nervous then.<br>-Are you serious?
<SYNC Start=3946567><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3946642><P>At your house.<br>With the mother of the star.
<SYNC Start=3950908><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3986949><P>Listen, Marva.
<SYNC Start=3988576><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3990386><P>lt'll be live tonight.
<SYNC Start=3992217><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3993456><P>No studio tricks,<br>like we used on the single.
<SYNC Start=3996289><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3996359><P>lf you don't learn<br>to feel what you sing...
<SYNC Start=3998793><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3998861><P>it'll be just as bad later<br>as it is now.
<SYNC Start=4001329><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4001397><P>-l'm nervous.<br>-That's very normal.
<SYNC Start=4004833><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4004900><P>Even the biggest stars<br>are nervous every time.
<SYNC Start=4008893><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4008971><P>But they always manage<br>to touch us.
<SYNC Start=4011166><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4011240><P>Every single time.<br>Do you know why?
<SYNC Start=4014403><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4014477><P>They're talented.
<SYNC Start=4016035><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4017980><P>And unfortunately, talent is<br>one of the few things people...
<SYNC Start=4024180><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4024253><P>can't fake yet.
<SYNC Start=4026847><P><br>

<SYNC Start=4049003><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4049078><P>l don't know. l just arrived,<br>and they're not here.
<SYNC Start=4051638><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4051714><P>They left a note saying they're<br>going to think of themselves.
<SYNC Start=4055741><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4055818><P>Typical! As if she's<br>ever done anything else.
<SYNC Start=4058719><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4058788><P>l just hope they didn't go<br>to the police.
<SYNC Start=4060983><P><br>

<SYNC Start=4065988><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4066062><P>No, you're the first one.
<SYNC Start=4067927><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4067997><P>And the last!
<SYNC Start=4069430><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4069498><P>l want you to act as if they're<br>still there. Understand?
<SYNC Start=4072661><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4074070><P>-Why?<br>-You have to do me this favor.
<SYNC Start=4077665><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4077740><P>Just pretend she's still there.<br>Protect the fort until the end.
<SYNC Start=4082302><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4082378><P>Yes, but l...
<SYNC Start=4085575><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4085648><P>We have an agreement, pal!
<SYNC Start=4086979><P><br>

<SYNC Start=4109672><P>-We have him. He's inside now.<br>-Good work, Jim.

<SYNC Start=4132951><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4133028><P>l just thought<br>he'd care more, that's all.
<SYNC Start=4137226><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4157353><P>lf it was my daughter,<br>l'd be beside myself.

<SYNC Start=4188041><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4188951><P>l hope not, but l think l will.
<SYNC Start=4192011><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4192087><P>That's such a shame after<br>all you've done for that girl.
<SYNC Start=4196046><P><br>

<SYNC Start=4402763><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4402831><P>But that blue wig was too much.
<SYNC Start=4405664><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4405734><P>She didn't need it.<br>Her own hair was so beautiful.
<SYNC Start=4409693><P><br>

<SYNC Start=4831415><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4833395><P>Especially for you.

<SYNC Start=4859754><P>OOK, let's hope for the best.

<SYNC Start=4874502><P>He had a simple background

<SYNC Start=4878240><P>He never had a fair chance
<SYNC Start=4882108><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4882177><P>He seemed to be condemned

<SYNC Start=4885914><P>To a life without splendor

<SYNC Start=4890085><P>But he wouldn't be oppressed

<SYNC Start=4893722><P>He clung to a glow
<SYNC Start=4896657><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4897792><P>He knew that fate is a part
<SYNC Start=4900989><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4901062><P>Of what you do for it yourself
<SYNC Start=4904225><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4904299><P>Lucky Manuelo
<SYNC Start=4907564><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4912107><P>He fought for his happiness,<br>he fought for his right
<SYNC Start=4915907><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4924419><P>He was a victim<br>of his own destiny
<SYNC Start=4927411><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4927489><P>He seemed destined<br>from an early age
<SYNC Start=4930925><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4932427><P>He would disappear in the crowd
<SYNC Start=4935760><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4935830><P>But not according to him
<SYNC Start=4939698><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4939768><P>His friends smirk with pity
<SYNC Start=4942498><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4943672><P>His friends laughed at him
<SYNC Start=4947039><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4947108><P>Who is born without money
<SYNC Start=4951670><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4951746><P>Doesn't get ahead

<SYNC Start=4974202><P>Life doesn't give any presents

<SYNC Start=4978073><P>Life doesn't give what you want
<SYNC Start=4981975><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4982043><P>But then Manuelo speaks to you
<SYNC Start=4985945><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4986014><P>With a clear voice
<SYNC Start=4988209><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4989784><P>You have to believe in yourself

<SYNC Start=4993388><P>You have a strength inside<br>that can make the sun shine
<SYNC Start=5000351><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5000428><P>After the darkest night

Porphyria:
Excess of porphyrins in the blood.
Subject may become egocentric, irritable or aggressive.
May lead to acts of violence.
Your young man?
This is Grandma Margot.
My mom.
You're very pretty, Joseph. Very charming.
My compliments.
How's Dad?
Your father's fine.
He adores Spain.
I wouldn't say Spain is perfect. I'm more...
What's the word?
- Circumspect?
- Yes, "circumspect. "
I'm forgetting my French.
Oh, I've made a stain.
- Where?
- There.
No, there's no stain.
These suburbs are so ugly!
Why hide out here in the suburbs?
In the outer suburbs.
Vaucresson's almost the country.
- If I were famous...
- That's why I hide out here.
The Marriage Knot
- I started it.
- About time!
It's not easy to find in Malaga.
Even a bestseller.
If you'd sent us a copy...
Maybe I was scared you'd not like it.
Dad would've pretended to read it, but I think it's excellent.
The start, superb!
You were rough on New York.
And on poor Edouard.
You do lay into him!
Does he look like him?
He's giving me a look.
Yes. He must be wondering why you talk all the time.
Joseph's story
Remember, you'd say to your father:
"Here we go!
She's giving us her glazed look! Help!"
How do I look now?
The poor Spanish doctors say I'm fine now, but that a break in Paris couldn't do any harm.
Yeah, sure! What hicks!
They're just not able to run such tests.
- When do you start?
- Tomorrow at 9:00.
But how will I get to Porte Champerret by 9:00?
I won't take these suburban lines!
You can loan me the car.
You won't be able to look after me.
This kid won't stand it.
I can find a nanny. It's not that hard.
You don't have one?
I've only been back in France for 3 weeks.
- Unbelievable!
- Maybe... but you'll see, I do have a pretty house.
What do you think?
Nothing too fancy, then?
No. Just a house.
- Not like New York.
- That's the idea.
I wanted a normal place where I could live with Joseph.
No dinner parties every night or cocktail parties.
No Edouard...
- No accursed poet.
- Exactly.
You have to bring him up!
Calm down, will you?
Stop clowning around. Silly boy!
You don't want kids, then you love them.
Yes, but I wanted him.
Yes, sorry.
No mirror here?
Yes, there is. In here.
- Edouard didn't want kids.
- Yes, OK.
I never understood women who want to become mothers.
I know.
You don't have a TV?
I was so looking forward to French TV!
Why no TV?
It's not that bad, is it?
I'm lost without TV!
Oh, hello.
Yes, of course she's here.
We were going to phone you.
Want to say hi to your grandson?
Your grandson, you know?
Joseph the American.
Grandpa says hello.
OK, I'll put her on.
Well, how are you doing?
Oh, not even a two-hour flight.
What? Well, the house is OK, but I've seen better.
The tests tomorrow.
Yes, same to you, same to you.
He's worried sick!
Ah, time for a nap.
Yes, beddy-byes.
I'll take you both out for a meal tonight!
Know any good restaurants?
No. This little fellow has a set pattern: afternoon nap, and bedtime at 8:00.
Let's go, just us two.
Phone some home-help service.
You'll have a girl here in no time.
I'd love to eat out with you.
If I abandon him, he'll hold it against you.
Don't make an enemy.
The window's on the catch
'cause it's hot, isn't it?
- Aren't you hot?
- I am.
I'll leave the night-light on.
You have a rest.
Be quiet. Don't behave like your grandma.
I'll leave this door open and shut the other.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
You're brooding, Brigitte.
You've got your back to me.
Only because
I'm washing the saucers, Mom.
Thinking I was a bad mother, aren't you?
That I wasn't a "proper mom"?
Sometimes I think that, yes.
Making up for it with your son.
But you're right, I was a terrible mother.
Awful.
But I was sick. Sick!
Long before you and Dad realized that.
I was a suffering soul, Brigitte.
A lost soul... I'd gone astray.
You don't like your name.
I'm sorry, I can't help it.
It's your name.
It's the name Dad and I chose for you.
We so loved Brigitte Bardot.
We just adored that name!
You're too hard. Too rigid.
Stiff. You're stiff.
You were so scared of me!
So scared of me.
Weren't you, my love?
What a childhood I gave you!
All that anxiety. All that fear.
I'd give anything to let you forget.
It's hot in here.
I'm running a temperature. Feel.
On fire, aren't I?
A little.
I'll get some air, then.
I'll go in the garden.
I haven't seen it yet.
- How are his reflexes?
- All normal.
- When did it happen?
- Around 6 PM.
Was he already unconscious?
I don't know. Probably.
- Didn't you find him?
- No, my mother did.
The lady who came with you wants you.
Well, what's going on?
I don't understand it.
They say his spinal column and head are OK, but they don't know when he'll come out of the coma.
Well, there's no sense in you staying.
I'll tell you which key is which.
You can get a taxi home.
- What's wrong?
- You're staying here?
Well, of course I am.
I can't stay in a strange house alone.
Your father never leaves me alone.
You take a taxi and go home.
Your son's in a coma! What does he care?
He won't realize a thing.
Your father wouldn't have let me come if he'd known.
I'll get sick...
I'm staying tonight if you like it or not!
- Either go home or come with me...
- No!
So, keep your ass on that chair till I say!
What about my tests tomorrow?
As soon as you get home, call me.
- You do have my mobile number?
- Yes!
Well?
Too soon to say.
We'll have to wait, but your little boy seems pretty tough.
Is the coma normal?
In certain cases of cerebral bruising, yes.
I'll come back tomorrow morning around 8:00. Good night.
- Valerie, are you coming?
- Yes.
Things are tense. It's been a long day.
This is no time to say this, but I really liked your book.
I lived in New York for a while.
It brought it all back.
- The sensations...
- Thank you.
Look, I'm sorry.
We can talk about books...
No, I shouldn't have... I'm sorry.
Don't worry. Everything will be OK.
Is everything OK?
What time is it, please?
She didn't phone...?
Who?
No, ma'am, it's not allowed in here.
It disrupts the electronics.
Thanks. I'll pay you back.
102 Fahrenheit.
- That's high.
- He's running a fever.
Where the hell has she gone to?
You left her alone? Anything could happen!
Look, if she calls, leave me a message.
Damn, not on the cell phone!
Excuse me, what's the number here, please?
Wait, I know. Call Clemence.
Maybe she went to see her.
- Clemence who?
- Favereaux. An old friend.
Brigitte? Is that you? Well, I never!
Have you heard from my mom recently?
No, we haven't.
Why? Is she in Paris?
Yes, since yesterday.
Thanks, Mrs. Favereaux.
Excuse me. Goodbye.
Adrenaline ready?
Of course I heard the phone!
I didn't think it was you.
You were far too busy with him to worry about me.
If you're interested, I had my tests.
And I'm very disappointed.
What news?
Not much. They examined me.
I go back Thursday.
You're not interested...
Sorry about last night. I wasn't well.
You sensed it, didn't you?
I feel so bad in hospitals.
They smell of sickness, death...
This morning, I feel just fine!
A good night's sleep and I feel great!
Mrs. Fisher...
We're so sorry.
Your little boy just had a cerebral edema.
We did all we could to save him.
What are you doing, Jose? Come here.
It's nothing. C'mon.
Mind your wrist.
Does it still hurt?
Jose's story
Where's Mom?
There.
Well, what's up?
No kiss?
What did the hospital say?
It's OK. But he hurt his wrist.
Any fool can see that!
We'll look after you tonight, kid.
You didn't find a babysitter?
- Oh, shit!
- We're going clubbing.
I feel awful.
You should! I only get weekends off!
Know why I forgot?
I found a job. On Lozach's site.
I start next week.
Oh, is that good?
Hi, gorgeous!
- Hi, gigolo.
- OK, Carole?
- Why're you back here?
- To say hello to you.
I was downtown, but the hot chicks are here!
Nice kid... Hello.
Gotta go. Milo will bug me.
So long, little bastard!
There are customers!
You OK?
Can we have 2 J & Bs on the rocks, please?
Violet suits you.
2 J & Bs.
30 "Mali," 30 "Burkina. "
I can get you more.
No. I've earned too much this year.
Yeah, it's been a good year.
- Who's that guy?
- An Armenian.
Just bought the Park Hotel in Vaucresson.
Don't hit on clients.
What's it to you?
This isn't a convent!
You should've been a streetwalker.
Huh? Why didn't you?
'Cause I limp, Milo.
I wanted to be a wrestler.
I'd have liked to hit.
And get hit...!
How do you know I don't like that?
I've got stuff that's more used than these.
How's little Jose today?
What's he done this time?
He did it on the washbasin.
Where was Carole?
Showering.
Your wife dolls herself up!
She's not my wife after 2 months.
You'd like her to be!
- Keep him this weekend?
- Costs more.
Are you working?
I start on Monday.
If you work, it's 300. If not, 150.
300 francs she's charging us? She's crazy!
Mom! Fatou wants 300 francs to mind Jose!
You better do more overtime, girl!
This is Jean-Jean, my future ex.
Works for the water company, but only drinks beer!
- Can you light me up?
- Sure.
Where's the Rover?
Park it miles away again?
No, just opposite.
Isn't that your waitress?
- After midnight, she's not.
- What, then?
Just a beautiful lady.
- Well, I'll be going.
- OK, thanks.
- I'm pleased to see you.
- Oh, yeah?
So why are you leaving?
Are there too many cops inside?
Why do you say that?
I have no trouble with the police.
Still seeing that kid?
- I'm all for youth.
- And blacks?
Sure!
A pretty girl like you...
A pretty girl with a bad leg.
Didn't you notice? Didn't Milo tell you?
My Dad did it to me.
He knocked me into shape. I was wild.
In fact, I still am.
There's my car.
- Hope to see you soon.
- Me, too.
Bye!
How'll we manage next week?
I work every evening!
She's working for once!
Can't he look after your kid?
No, I start a job Monday at Lozach.
Well, I work, too, kids!
Hey, I didn't ask to be a grandma!
It was your choice.
I was in love. It happens.
In love with who?
Where's the father?
He's the Invisible Man!
- Kids come too soon.
- Exactly!
I'll take Jose, but not before Wednesday.
- Thanks, Grandma.
- That's OK.
At least he's polite. Hang on to him.
Didn't we come to dance?
Yeah.
All this talk about kids is getting on my nerves.
Leave me alone!
Just let me die!
Let me die!
Do you like my new dress?
It's great.
- I swiped it.
- Where from?
You know, Leone's.
That real expensive store by the supermarket.
What I do know is, one day, you'll get caught.
I'll never get caught! I'm too smart!
Milo keeps saying:
"You're too smart!"
He tried to kiss me. I was mad.
Been out with Milo, too?
No way. Perish the thought!
Not even before you were with me?
I don't go for Milo.
He's not my type. I have some taste!
Who's Jose's father, then?
That Alex we saw today?
The passport dealer?
What do you care? Don't go on.
Come here.
Let me take my shower.
Leave me alone.
So, tell me who Jose's father is.
I won't tell you.
After 2 months, you're bugging me like a husband.
You're the one I want.
I want to spend my life screwing you.
Let's do it in front of the bedroom mirror.
No.
I want you here.
The bedroom's too far.
Betty's story
Three weeks later
Oh, hello, Antonia.
No, but... I'll tell her.
As soon as she's back on her feet.
Yes, I promise.
Yes, I'll tell her.
Goodbye, Antonia.
- You know Antonia?
- Know what?
They're your first words in 3 weeks.
Don't get cold, on top of it.
I am glad.
How do you know Antonia?
She works for your publisher.
- Been many calls?
- Not that many.
I said you needed rest, you couldn't talk.
Did Dad call?
Every night.
Can't have been easy.
What?
Telling him...
Oh, I didn't.
Anyway, he never asked after the child.
Should we tell Edouard in New York?
Ah, the father! I tried, of course.
I couldn't reach him.
Vanished!
His newspapers say he's gone on a literary world tour.
- Did you tell anyone?
- Tell, not to tell...
Why go upsetting everyone?
You didn't tell anyone?
Answer me!
Don't get worked up!
I told the funeral parlor.
The formalities...
The death certificate... Someone had to.
How's this doing?
Lunch with Clemence Favereaux
Back around 4. Mom
I did some tidying-up. What do you think?
Try to do some work
It's only me!
Go home, Mom. Leave me alone.
Why are you on the table?
- Who's that?
- Bernadette's boy.
You know, Clemence's daughter.
- What?
- There's a problem with their vacation.
Listen or you won't understand.
He was supposed to stay with his godmother.
The poor woman broke her leg.
They were devastated.
They'd kissed their vacation goodbye.
The tickets, Mauritius...
First vacation in 5 years!
You telling me they're going on vacation without their kid?
Some people leave their dog.
Shoes off!
They asked you...?
- No, I offered.
- Oh, did you?
For a week? A month?
You bring a little boy here?
How can you behave like that?
I don't believe it!
You're unfair!
Is it a crime to help a friend?
Yes, it's a crime!
I'll never get used to you! Never!
You can be so selfish!
I've looked after you!
- Devotedly!
- He's sleeping here?
Not in Joseph's room.
He's sleeping here?!
There's plenty of room.
We'll make up a bed on the floor.
- Now what?
- I'm phoning the Favereaux.
I'm returning him. Their number?
I don't know it by heart.
- They've gone!
- I don't believe you!
They're on a plane to Mauritius!
What kind of people entrust a kid to you?
Don't they know you're completely crazy?
Where are you going? Where...?
The bathroom... Want to make peepee?
Make peepee?
Come on...
Be good. What's your name?
They didn't say?
No, I don't remember.
- What's your name?
- Jo!
Sorry, it's Joseph. It's not my fault!
- Going?
- Out.
This late? It's dangerous.
Good. I may get murdered!
- Were you worried?
- You shouldn't go off like that.
Why put Joseph's jacket on him?
Why? You idiot! Lunatic!
You had my kid buried anywhere, anyhow!
- Where are you going?
- For my tests.
If we're not wanted...
Yeah, get lost!
Hospital! What an outing for him!
Oh, here's my taxi! Come on.
I'll look after him.
Stop torturing yourself.
It does me good! Come on.
Take that off.
Do you understand me?
Take that off!
I've never seen such an ugly kid!
Not bad. Is that where you live?
Where's the TV?
No, there's no TV here, pal.
I want TV!
Yell! I don't care!
You didn't want TV.
It's for you two. It'll keep you busy.
By the way, your lodger isn't clean.
He needs changing.
- I've forgotten how.
- Me, too!
Didn't the Favereaux leave any spares?
It's a funny way to look after him.
What's that?
Interested in dead dogs?
I haven't finished it.
Think I feel like reading?
Mom...
Sir wanted the TV on.
Why turn it off? 8 PM isn't his bedtime.
- What a fuss!
- Turn it on!
Mom!
- Now what?
- He wants his mother.
See to him, calm him down, but leave me alone.
Take him out. Where's his parka?
I don't know.
When you put Joseph's jacket on him, where was it?
I said I don't know.
It's not good for me to get worked up.
Put him to bed.
Oh, shit!
C'mon!
I'll leave the little light on.
Hope is fading of finding the boy alive...
Leave the TV alone!
I turned it off for your sake.
Do what you like!
No, it's OK.
I've watched enough TV.
Telephone!
Ah, it's you, Brigitte.
- Who's speaking?
- Clemence Favereaux.
Your mom there?
No. She's at the hospital for her tests.
You're back from your vacation?
Vacation? No.
We're not going away.
I'm phoning, because your mother promised to visit us.
As we haven't seen or spoken to her, we were worried.
She didn't visit?
No! She forgot us!
Ask her at least to phone us.
Yes, I'll tell her.
Thank you. Goodbye, dear.
Yes, goodbye.
So, who are you?
The search goes on for little Jose's kidnapper
I'll make some tea.
- Where did you find him?
- No more Darjeeling.
Down in the projects.
I did it for you.
You lost your boy, I found you another one.
After Jose Novacki's disappearance, hope of finding the child alive is fading.
This morning, our reporter spoke to Carole Novacki, the boy's mother. Here is what she said...
You didn't report Jose's disappearance for 2 days. Why wait so long?
No one knew where he was.
We thought he was at his babysitter's.
Police are questioning your partner,
Mr. Diembele.
He's not my partner. He's my tenant.
A young African man?
Yes. He's my tenant.
Francois's story
I don't understand "tenant. "
She says you're just her tenant.
Did you get on well with Jose?
Sure, I got on well with him.
Not sorry he disappeared?
Of course I am.
You don't look it.
It's not like he was my own kid.
Let's go back to last Wednesday, the day the kid disappeared.
His mom's story doesn't tally with yours.
Who was looking after him?
His grandmother or Mrs. Fatou?
It kept changing. I don't recall.
Try.
His grandma, from Wednesday on.
Before that, Fatou.
That's complicated. Be clearer.
Tell us about Wednesday, the day he disappeared.
Again?
From the beginning.
I didn't pick just any child.
At least give me that.
I found the same kind of boy.
More or less.
Yes, more or less.
His mother must be worried sick.
Did you consider that?
No, it goes right over your head.
Do I call the cops or go to the station?
You'd turn me in?
This tea's too strong.
That would be stupid.
- Really very stupid.
- Why?
They'd immediately think you kidnapped him!
- Me?
- Of course!
To compensate for losing your own child.
Your book got such coverage.
You're famous.
The media will have a field day, making you a kidnapper.
But hang on, I didn't do it.
You did!
- A field day...
- You took the kid!
No one'll believe you!
They will! I'll tell them the truth!
- Truth?
- About my life!
My own childhood!
How you tried to kill me!
How you kidnapped this kid!
I'm going crazy!
You want me put away in a hospital?
Yes! That's the best solution!
So you can't destroy everything!
I'll tell them I didn't do it!
I'm going away!
Right now! Anywhere!
I'll call the police from the airport and take the first plane!
Why would I kidnap him? I don't like kids!
It wasn't me! I won't confess!
How dare you accuse me?
You took him. Now you're blaming me.
Stop yelling. It wasn't you, OK.
Yes! OK! That's right!
Where are you going?
To clean him up. He peed himself.
You left the cinema at 5 PM. And then?
I went to pick up Carole...
You mean Mrs. Novacki?
Yeah, right. Mrs. Novacki.
Remember what the movie was?
Give me a break!
I don't give a damn about film titles!
It was some Van Damme thing.
Van Damme...
It says here you did a month in jail.
Were you dealing?
Just dope. None of the hard stuff.
I'm clean now, I'm in work.
Stop treating us like idiots, Francois.
You've been together for 2 months.
This kid's always in your way.
He cramps your style, doesn't he?
- I'm not dirty!
- You are!
So, we'll take this off.
We have to clean you up. Help me.
Early to bed tonight.
I'm taking you home tomorrow.
We'll do it while she's asleep.
What on earth is that?
What is that?
What did you do to yourself?
We need to talk.
Well, come in, then.
What do you want?
I'm entitled to know what you intend to do.
You didn't hit him, did you?
What? What are you talking about?
I don't hit children!
Well, really!
I never hit you!
Did you hit him?
You gotta be kidding.
- You're totally crazy.
- Yeah, right.
As well as the housework and dishes, you do babysitting?
Doing her housework doesn't bother you?
- No, it doesn't.
- OK, it doesn't.
Maybe the kid does, though.
A kid that age can be a pain in the ass.
Kept your movie ticket?
- Why?
- That'd change quite a lot.
Maybe you never went.
Maybe you found Jose.
Maybe you took him someplace.
Maybe he went too far and started screaming.
And you... tried to calm him down.
Maybe you also went too far...
Oh, look at your face!
Cool it! We don't have any proof.
You're Mr. "Presumed Innocent. " Know it?
Isn't that a Van Damme movie?
- Can I go home then?
- Yes.
You can go home. But don't go too far away.
Stay within reach.
We'll carry on slogging away.
And one day, we'll nail you.
- When are you leaving?
- You can't wait!
- Many more tests?
- One. Friday.
The last one.
You leave Friday evening.
My ticket's for Wednesday.
I don't care. I'll pay.
You buy airplane tickets like bus tickets.
- And then what?
- Then what?
Once I've gone?
I'll tell the police.
Tell them what?
That I found him in the street.
- I'm going to bed.
- Do.
See you tomorrow.
Despite the police's efforts,
Jose Novacki is still missing.
Carole Novacki, the child's mother today refused to make a statement.
Mrs. Novacki, excuse me...
Can I ask you a question?
Francois Diembele, the African man who's been there for 2 months, was held for questioning for part of the day by local police.
He was released a few minutes ago.
What are you doing?
You going out with this whore?
Eat shit and die!
I won't let a little brat fuck with me!
Have the cops seen enough of you today?
Swallow that with some wine.
You'll have sweet dreams.
Give me your hand.
There anything left to eat?
Didn't the cops feed you?
- Hey, kid!
- Yeah.
Don't talk bad to Carole.
- Oh, no?
- No.
Show her some respect.
If I can help, ask.
It hurts to see you suffering alone.
She isn't "alone. "
- Any more rose?
- You've had enough.
I'll get some.
What a pain in the ass!
You're not "alone. " I'm here!
Know what I'll do? Dump all you guys.
I've had a bellyful of these shitty projects.
It reeks of death.
- New hairstyle?
- Don't you like it?
I get hassled by the cops all day.
You go to the hairdresser's.
I don't wanna let it get to me!
That won't bring Jose back.
So, don't pull that damn face.
The cops accused me of hitting the kid.
Said he has marks all over.
The Armenian's muscling in!
You act like I don't belong.
I'm tired of all this.
Well, go to bed if you're tired.
Alex - 49 Allee de la Chenaie - Vaucresson
Alex...
Alex's story
Get up, lazybones.
Alex, wake up.
- Is it tomorrow?
- Yes. My taxi's coming.
- Why didn't you wake me?
- I'm going without you.
- What?
- I'm going alone, my love.
- Are you joking?
- No.
You're the one who's kind of a joke.
Must you look so happy?
I am happy!
I'm going to see the sun, my friends!
- Punishing me?
- Yes.
- But why?
- For lots of reasons, hon.
For your mocking look when...
Yes, when people think you're my son.
Your exasperated look when I get tired at 3 AM.
How you look at girls...
For making me feel lucky to be with a guy 20 years younger.
You still on welfare?
I'm on minimum benefit. 500 francs a week.
Not bad. I'd have thought it was less.
Very funny.
I've decided not to leave any money.
I've put the phone and the electricity on direct debit.
- Got your Visa card?
- The machine swallowed it.
Poor darling!
Well, make the most of the house.
Feel free to use the phone and don't catch cold.
Kiss me.
Poor baby
Bitch!
Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Busato!
5'8", 150 pounds. Fit as a fiddle!
- Is Carole here?
- No.
What'll it be?
- She still work here?
- Yes.
She does, but she isn't here.
- What'll it be?
- Nothing, thanks, pal.
You ain't the only one!
Don't hit on her.
Miss, can I see your purse?
You're still as dumb as ever!
- You scared me.
- You fell for it.
Other than faking passports, you've never done much.
- Heart murmur.
- Even as a kid, you were scared.
Remember how I'd tell you,
"We'll make loads of money!"
- I'm fragile.
- That's the problem with you.
You're cute, you're really charming, but are you a real man?
How dare you?
By the way, you got problems?
Your kid was kidnapped?
Some say he's your son.
That's unproven.
You don't seem too worried.
I was real depressed at first.
I have this funny feeling...
Maybe Jose's safe and sound, after all.
Maybe he found another family.
Another mother.
A good mother, this time.
I wouldn't win any prizes for motherhood.
I need to get up to stupid shit.
Nothing works the way I want it to.
Remember the sex bomb I was at 16?
I thought I'd screw 'em all.
Now I'm average.
And you? How's your life?
- Need money?
- Got any?
I'm with this poor guy, a laborer...
It's tough.
Have you got any scams for getting cash, Caroline?
The cemetery trick on a widow.
Go to a cemetery, find a rich widow...
Yeah, I've already tried that!
I got myself one in Vaucresson who's loaded.
I shouldn't have...
- She ugly?
- Ordinary.
A fat ass.
Know what?
She went on vacation for 3 months!
She left me alone in her home with no cash!
Come and stay if you're feeling lonely.
No way.
- But I've maybe got an idea for you.
- What?
- Her fine house...
- Yes.
Just sell it!

- A banana split.
- Oh, thanks.
"The mother believes he is alive
"and being well-treated. "
Leave that paper alone.
I'm going. Talk about something else.
"She spoke emotionally
"about the Christmas she would have wanted to give him. "
Easily pleased!
Think she'll let me visit him?
Look. It's like a flower.
It moves like that when there's some wind.
Isn't it pretty?
You'll be seeing me in 3 hours.
What? "What model airplane?"
We haven't a clue. Who gives a damn?
Yes, I'll put her on. See you soon.
He's so worked up!
Hello, Dad.
Weren't you keeping her till Christmas?
3 months! I've got her for life.
- Well, bye, hon.
- Yes, bye, Dad.
Maybe it'd be easier to tell them?
"I've found this boy. What do I do?"
I'll handle it another way.
How?
My way.
I'll miss you.
You're all I have.
You've got me and Dad.
He hates me.
Well, goodbye then.
Goodbye, Joseph.
I'm not called Joseph.
You stay here.
Wait. Don't move.
Stay there.
Where are you going?
Betty!
Are you on your own?
No, wait, he's mine.
He's mine. He's my little boy.
I'm sorry.
Alice's Garden
Oh, I like that one.
The elephant? 2 elephants.
Let's take that one. You want it?
- The big one?
- The little one.
- The little one?
- You think so?
I think we'll take the big one.
- The big one? Are you sure?
- No, he's too big.
Come on.
You're very strong.
- In you get.
- Get in the car.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Need a hand?
- No, it's OK.
You've got your hands full. Let me do it.
Is it for him?
My godson.
His mom's away till Christmas.
I'm looking after him.
Does it help you?
Does it help me?
I don't know... I really don't.
I tried to call several times.
Didn't your mother tell you?
No.
Can't wait for me to go!
What's his name?
Can I call you?
Yes, of course you can.
Goodbye.
"Mom, I've decided
I'll never give the boy back.
"Not to his mother or to the police.
Or to anybody...
"I won't send him back there.
"You won't be troubled.
"I'll be spared any apologies, confessions or explanations.
"Only you and I will know.
"I don't want to lose him. "
- Second floor.
- Thank you.

Make a snowman!
That's a good idea.
- What'll we put here?
- A carrot.
Would you like to have a snowball fight?
Telephone!
Hello. This is Jerome Castang.
I got your number from the hospital.
Am I disturbing you?
Not at all. I'm shopping.
How are you?
I'm in Milan.
- Pardon me?
- Milan. In Italy.
At a medical convention.
I'm phoning you, because I've fallen in love with you.
Well, there you go.
Is it serious, Doctor?
I'll call when I get back.
Yes, do that.
Goodbye.
This the home of Betty Fisher, the famous writer?
Given up the world tour?
No, passing through Vaucresson.
It's part of the world.
Do you mind?
Is he eating with us?
So, is this him?
Edouard's story
I called your mother.
She gave me your address.
So it seems that you need me?
She said you're not doing so good...
She said that?
Yes, that you'd be pleased to see me.
Have my company.
Margot is a bit weird.
Nice house.
All thanks to your masterpiece?
You think it's a masterpiece now?
- You read my review?
- Exactly.
- Couldn't stomach it?
- It was harsh.
- But fair?
- No. Just harsh.
Well, you sure pulled it off!
4 years in New York, a 6-month marriage...
You make it a bestseller.
What do you want: beef or fish?
- Yogurt.
- OK.
Don't you ask me?
What do you want?
No, it's OK, I didn't mean it.
One thing, though, I did find... touching with this book, but I couldn't put it in my review is... let's say... your debt to me, in a way...
This one or that one? That one? Sure?
I showed you New York in the first place.
- You want a percentage?
- No.
What I would have liked, though, is a little word of thanks... as an epigraph.
It would've been nice. It's the done thing.
You're talented, but badly brought up.
Introduce my son.
He's a friend's son I'm minding.
It's not Joseph.
That's a bit much.
Oh?
- You don't believe me?
- 'Course not.
I think it's pretty disgusting.
You already distanced me from you and your success.
Now you stop me from seeing my son.
I'm not.
I said it's not him.
If it's not him, where is Joseph?
He died.
Last autumn.
He fell out of the window, died of a brain hemorrhage.
I don't believe you.
Check the death certificate.
- Where you going?
- I don't want him to hear.
When you "dismissed" me,
I thought you couldn't go any lower.
I hoped you changed.
Playing the grieving father isn't your forte!
You have no idea what it's like to go through that!
Don't mourn a child you never wanted!
"Me! Me! Me! My career!"
Remember what you said?
"I'll never understand this need you have for a child. "
Do you know why I came?
So we could get back together.
But I'd forgotten what you're capable of,
Miss Novelist.
Making up Joseph's death...
Some stupid damn thing to keep me from you two.
To screw everything up. Even that. Bravo!
Well, so long!
I won't let you get away with it.
You're going to have me on your back.
I'm warning you.
Sorry, I wasn't expecting you so early.
I've cut a few corners, because my friends, the Barskys, who are friends and clients, have been looking for the past...
- 6 months.
- At least.
...for a property near Paris like yours.
Lots of charm, as you see.
Lots of taste!
A view of Vaucresson Hill.
Large living room, mezzanine.
Brushed aluminum.
An opportunity like this is becoming quite... rare in a market that has been bled dry.
Bled dry...
- Will you sell it furnished?
- We haven't discussed that detail.
Why not? We'll have to see.
- Nice, huh?
- Yeah.
It works well...
Well, they love it.
Especially her!
I said 24. They're offering 18.
Million?
It's OK, I'll get 20.
Care to think it over?
No, 20's good.
You're quite right.
Mustn't dally with Russian money.
Nor ask where it comes from.
There he is.
- How's life, Diembele?
- Great.
- Enjoy the breather?
- Yes, thanks.
That's OK, but we better close the case.
Yes. Enough playing around.
I'm on vacation in a week.
You won't ruin my vacation in Thailand, will you?
Be seeing you.
D'you want a photo?
It's all over the papers.
I can just cut it out.
'Cause of the cops, you ignore me?
Have you all gone crazy?
D'you think I'd hurt Carole's kid?
What about when you put some alcohol in his bottle so he sleeps better?
Someone took the kid.
He didn't rent a hotel room.
Pass me the box of Dash, please.
Maybe the real father took him...
Who knows who he is?
He has one! He's not a test-tube baby!
No one's looking for him.
I'm sorry, but Carole had too many men.
The racing guy, the Total guy, the guy called... uh... Alex...
- Busato.
- It's him!
- No. Why?
- It's him.
It's Alex Busato. Know why?
He's the only one whose name you knew!
That's no proof.
You didn't forget his name.
He kidnapped Jose! He's hiding him.
And I know where.
If you smile, I'll bust your head open!
You're from the projects.
- What're you doing here?
- I don't know you!
What about Jose Novacki?
And Carole? Carole Novacki!
Now listen: I won't take the rap for you.
I wanna live an ordinary life with Carole, you hear?
I won't let a motherfucker ruin my life!
I can hurt you, too.
Asshole!
Some prepare their vacation, others answer the phone!
Police.
Jose Novacki... His father kidnapped him.
Alex Busato.
49 Allee de la Chenaie, Vaucresson.
Who are you?
Merry Christmas.
May I?
I went shopping in Paris. So, I thought...
My husband was in such a rush.
I only got a glimpse.
- It concerns our future.
- That's pretty.
- Is it mink?
- Blue fox. Does that shock you?
No, why?
That I'm covered in animal pelts.
Give me a hand.
I want to see the bedroom. Coming?
Terylene is a little bland for a bedroom, isn't it?
Sorry, excuse me.
I'll open the door.
- Get in touch.
- OK.
- Don't wait too long.
- No.
Mr. Busato?
Police.
- You Jose Novacki's father?
- Me?
No, me!
No, but I... Who told you that? Carole?
It's a serious case.
Abducting a minor. No news for weeks.
We've just been informed about your possible paternity, so...
You think I'm hiding him here?
We'll just have a quick look around.
Go ahead.
Almost as nice as my house!
- Well, Merry Christmas.
- Our apologies, sir.
That's quite all right.
Merry Christmas to you, too.
Goodbye.
Who could've told you about him?
- I don't know.
- Some asshole.
I hate these long days.
Holy shit.
I'm quitting!
Keep him in bed.
See you tomorrow. Sleep tight.
Good night.
This is Jerome Castang. Merry Christmas.
Thank you. Merry Christmas to you, too.
Can I come and see you?
When?
Now.
I'm doing this so badly.
No, you're not doing badly at all.
It's not very convenient.
You're not alone?
Yes, I am, but...
What's your address?
Betty? It's Edouard.
Your husband, remember? Are you home?
OK, you're not home.
Well, where are you on a night like tonight?
What about poor Edouard's Christmas?
You're making it worse for yourself.
I have a proposition.
Propositions are for before, not after.
What's your proposition?
To go away.
Go where?
To Canada.
I've had a job offer. A new hospital.
I have a month to make up my mind.
And how long have I got?
As long as you want.
If you say no, I'll be sad.
I'll still read your books.
Is he the problem?
Who?
Hello. Want breakfast?
Come on.
What's your name?
His name's Jo. Jonathan.
His mom's staying here over Christmas.
She left him with you on Christmas Eve?
Canada goes for him, too.
- Where's Carole?
- I don't know! At the bar?
No, pal. She's absent!
What's she up to?
You don't know where your girl is?
She's playing you for a sucker.
Alex has stolen her!
That shitty two-bit pimp!
A woman's precious.
Gotta look after a girl like Carole.
Aren't you sick of these guys around her who don't know what love means?
Oh, I love this little painting.
Is it a Marco Gilli?
You starting to have regrets?
No, no regrets. I'm just wary.
You might get carried away.
You might be a pervert who gets carried away.
You might tell your husband.
Just for fun!
Can you get me a drink?
A vodka or something.
What if your husband goes crazy and won't buy the place?
My, you're anxious!
I'd like an answer.
You buying the damn house?
My husband's OK with the price.
No problem there.
- But 20 million...
- ... is a big check?
Exactly.
- Maybe there's another solution.
- Yes?
If you sell us the house "officially" for 15 million instead of 20, we'll give you 5 in cash.
In dollars. What do you say?
I raise the price by 5.
$10 million cash.
You launder twice as much, OK?
Asshole!
Are you OK?
You look pale.
It's winter.
Go ahead.
It's only natural...
See, it does work. You have to be patient.
Helping out a friend?
6 weeks is a lot of babysitting!
What do you want?
You think I'm jealous, huh?
Jealous of your success?
That's all over.
Do you know what being a writer is?
Ever thought about it?
Do you get up early to write?
No, not at the moment.
No one understands my writing.
You know that.
You're doing great, you move in higher spheres.
I'm still a small-time journalist.
To each his own.
But why not do it together?
Tell me why I should support you.
I'll give you a reason. A good reason.
Him.
The kid...
I watch TV, I read the papers.
Little Jose who disappeared...
Poor Betty.
How could you do something so dumb?
You're like your mother...
You're a bit crazy.
I said a gun, not a rifle.
It's all I've got.
It's 2,000. Know how it works?
I don't have 2,000. I'm unemployed.
I can rent it to you. 500 a week.
Hey!
Why didn't you go to bed, hon?
Think of the kid's real mother,
Carole Novacki.
She doesn't care about her kid!
Seen her face on TV?
She obviously doesn't care.
She whores, does lousy jobs, her boyfriend's out of work.
She's bound to agree to...
That's right! To sell her kid to us.
They're poor! The poor will sell anything.
Listen! I've fixed up a meeting with her.
Tomorrow night.
She saw there was money in it.
She was very keen.
- Offer her money?
- Right!
We dump the kid somewhere we're sure he'll be found.
He goes back to his mother.
A year later, no one will remember the kidnapping, and Carole gives us what we bought.
How high can you go? A million?
Hey, that's life, kid.
Don't look at me like that.
You have no choice. I know everything.
What a bunch of morons!
I saw it already.
- Not worked in 8 days?
I'd had a bellyful of the Ranch!
I'd had enough of Milo!
I've got a great new job.
Receptionist at the Park Hotel.
Night receptionist?
That's right, but at least I work!
I'm not on welfare! I bring home the bacon!
You've smoked all my dope?
Oh, no, here it is.
- Want me to do you one?
- No.
This hooker gear's for work?
Don't you like my knickers?
Everyone else does.
Seen the watch? It's a Diagem.
It sparkles, but it's not real.
The Armenian can't hire me. It's an advance.
- The Armenian?
- Yes. I like working for him.
He doesn't keep asking after Jose.
It does me a lot of good.
Enough with this Armenian!
- You weren't with him.
- Oh, no?
Why ask me, then?
It wasn't the Armenian.
- You were with Alex.
- Get off my back!
"Where were you?" "Who with?"
What's it got to do with you?
We're not married!
You're no use!
Can't even earn 100 francs!
You were with your Alex!
He's Jose's father! I'll get him!
- I'll fuck him up!
- You won't! Nobody's Jose's father!
Know how many guys I had that week?
Eight, nine, I don't know!
His father's one of that lot!
Or one I had the week after! Who cares?
The last day
Ready?
Let's go.
"You can never replace a child. Ever.
"But you can love another.
"Not the same love, but it's love.
"For someone else...
"When you read this,
I'll be at the other end of the world.
"I know it's unfair, to you and to me.
"I did enjoy getting to know you.
"But nothing's possible between us.
"I'm leaving for reasons
"which concern my past life
"and big secrets
I'm unable to share with you. "
Can I talk to Carole Novacki?
- Who is it?
- Is she there?
I want you out
I hope you'll have gone when I get back
Tell her it's about Jose.
It's OK for tonight, 8 PM at the Belgian Bar.
Who are you? Are you Alex?
Just say, "8 PM, Belgian Bar. "
My wife's waiting in the cafe opposite.
Why are you calling me?
Your guy phoned.
Meet him at 8 at the Belgian Bar.
Bye.
- Who was it?
- Nobody.
Open it and check.
- Come on.
- No! No way!
Orly, quick!
There's 400 francs on the clock.
Never mind.
BELGIAN BAR
Singapore, East Asian Airways.
Flight 813, 2 tickets.
Thank you.
- Hello, sir.
- Hello. Kuala Lumpur, please.
I have 1 seat in business.
Singapore, stopover in Bangkok.
- Any luggage?
- Yes, one bag.
- Ma'am, please...
- Calm down. Get off there.
I'm sorry.
Mind the clasp, sir.
Passengers on East Asian Airways,
Flight 813 to Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, whose seat numbers are between 35 and 47, are requested to go to Hall F, Gate 32 for immediate boarding.
Just sit there.
What seat number?
Number 21-A.
Mine's 23. We've got time.
Do you want a tissue?
No, thanks. I dislike flying, but I'll be OK.
I hate it, too.
One thing in common.
We won't be boarding for 10 minutes.
I'd like to change her.
Will you keep an eye on Tom?
- No problem.
- Thanks.
I'll be quick.
Tom, stay here with this man and be good.
- OK.
- Be right back.
- How old are you?
- 4 and a half.
Great.
Mom's coming.
- You got any other pets?
- No.
No, don't touch that.
Wait here a moment.
- Is that a fox?
- Yes.
- Is he nice?
- Yes.
- Your name's Tom, right?
- Yes.
Wait for your mom.
Don't move.
That little boy's Jose Novacki.
Let's go.
A few weeks later, Betty wrote to her mother from Singapore.
She did not blame her for the past.
She was eternally grateful to her for this child that Margot had given her.
Betty got a letter back from her with excellent news about her health.
She ended: "Who is this 'Joseph'?
"I thought your son was called Jose. "
Does your father know you're here?
No, he doesn't, and he needn't.
I would like my photograph taken.
But I can't take your photograph without your father's permission.
You mean even you are afraid the camera will steal my soul?
Then no woman will come to your studio.
Please, come this way.
Liu, take her photograph.
Ladies.
Liu.
Don't worry. I won't tell my father about your Shadow Magic.
Thank you, but...
I plan to tell him myself.
That you are the one ruining his business?
Well, yes.
If you tell him that, he'll never accept you.
Does that mean if I don't tell him,
I would be accepted?
Look right here.
Straight into the lens.
He's touching her!
A little smile.
You are captured forever.
I need another plate.
Excuse me.
Poor Liu.
He's unusually distracted.
He's been so busy... preparing for his wedding.
His wedding?
Liu is engaged to marry a widow.
I brought more plates.
- I must go.
- Wait!
I'll bring the prints to you.
You needn't bother.
I'll send for them.
He's coming, he's coming.
What's going on?
You should know better.
Why humiliate yourself?
People like us... we're born small... and we die small.
That's our fate.
Master Ren... my father is sick.
I need some time off.
You told me he was doing well.
Yes, but-- but now he is sick again.
I have to go.
We need new film.
Like this.
Claire?
She's in England.
No. No.
I say... Chinese film.
Local people, local scenes.
- You know?
- Chinese people.
- Chinese film.
- Film.
You're crazy.
Who'd want to see that?
They can walk outside their door and see it anytime they want.
Bloody fantastic.
- We are in trouble.
- What kind of trouble?
Local people, local scenes.
Sure.
I can see you fine from here.
Why should I look in there?
Uncle... when this machine looks at you... your image is saved.
In a hundred years, your image will still be there.
I'm 70 now.
That would make me 1 70!
- Right.
- How would I look then?
Exactly as you do now.
You won't have aged a bit.
Say no more. I'm ready.
If you please.
I feel better already. Your turn.
Look at the hole.
Good. Good.
Good.
Good, good, good.
Slow down, will you?
Beautiful. Huh?
- It's a good shot.
- Good.
Beautiful!
I'm overwhelmed.
Love China.
First emperor... build this wall... to defend against... foreign invader.
Like me?
Less dangerous.
China doesn't need more walls.
It needs someone like you to carry this... this magnificence to the outside world.
Just think of it.
You, me... recording life before it changes... show it to the whole world.
Might even go down in history.
Whole world? Huh?
Where?
Where is that?
Liu, leave that photo shop... and become my partner.
The future belongs to the moving picture.
Liu, what is this all about?
I've come... to apologize.
I want to say...
I'm truly sorry, but...
I must continue with Shadow Magic.
I can't help it.
Without Shadow Magic...
I'm nobody.
I know our show hurts the opera.
I'm sorry.
You needn't concern yourself.
You're no competition for my father.
Western culture can't overshadow our opera.
Even if there were
20 Shadow Magics in town... there would be only one Lord Tan.
The people will always love him.
Of course. You are right.
Actually...
I came to see you.
You came to see me?
Why?
Don't you know by now?
You're the most beautiful girl
I've ever seen.
I love you and I think you love me too.
You must not speak like this.
We cannot see each other.
But why?
You know why.
Wait!
Just wait and see.
I'm going to make a name for myself!.
Where is Liu?
He's absent again, Master.
Again?
Please, have a seat.
His father must be very ill.
Liu is a good son.
Tell me, why do Chinese people bow?
If I look at your shoes...
I know you're poor... you're rich.
Oh, Liu.
If only all Chinese people were as charming as you are.
All Chinese people are charming like me.
Others as kind as you?
Well, they are when you get to know them.
Good.
Raymond, I must go now.
Too late.
Master Ren will be upset.
- Hang on a sec.
- Huh?
Put a feather in my cap.
Look at this.
- It's from the British envoy.
- What?
"The envoy wishes to entertain
Her Royal Highness... the Empress Dowager--"
Dou Fouai--
- Dou Fouai?
- Yeah.
"with a presentation of Shadow Magic, the latest innovation from the West... at the Royal Palace."
Hah!
How about that?
We're going to the Royal Palace!
Us!
Wait until Claire gets a load of this, then, eh?
I told you I'd amount to something!
Hello, Fu Guan.
Master Ren knows you lied to him.
Your father was never sick.
You haven't been at home.
Wait, I can explain.
I should hope so.
Where have you been all this time?
I was--
No more lies!
I've been making films with the foreigner.
- What did I tell you?
- Please, Master Ren!
I know I betrayed your trust.
I lied to you.
I was wrong.
I beg of you.
I'm not a bad person.
I'll prove to you
I have a loyal heart.
He's trying to sweet-talk you.
We have important work to do.
I don't have time for this.
I'll give you one last chance.
But you must come to your senses... or I will cut you off.
Now, get up.
We have much to do before our visit to the Royal Palace.
The Royal Palace?
We're going to take the empress' picture!
On her birthday!
At the palace!
Isn't that exciting?
Master... please allow me to work for you and Raymond at the same time.
What?
Raymond, the foreigner, and I were also invited... to the Royal Palace to show Shadow Magic.
It's our big chance. Let us do our show first, then I'll assist you.
Please, Master.
Our city is changing every day.
They say the time will come when men will cut off their pigtails... and women will unbind their feet.
We can't turn back the clock.
I want to record life before it changes forever.
So our children will understand us... and the rest of the world will appreciate us.
So many people... are touched by our films.
For the first time...
I feel part of something bigger than myself.
Please, Master Ren.
Let's do this together.
Let's make our own shows... and present them... to the whole world!
You could be like Raymond-- your own master... free from your wife's family.
Please, Master.
- Chang!
- Yes, Master.
You are now my chief photographer.
Tell Liu he is forbidden to return to Feng Tai.
Fu Guan, come here!
Back to work!
Didn't expect you back so soon.
No takers at the photo shop, eh?
Here's the ungrateful little wretch!
Liu! Come with me.
What's the trouble, old man?
You're the trouble!
You've ruined my son's life!
You foreigners have no respect!
No loyalty!
No tradition!
You just want to use us!
And you!
You've brought me nothing but shame!
How could you betray a dear friend like Master Ren... who has been so good to us, and ally yourself with this foreigner?
So he can play his dirty tricks and cheat our people.
I'll tear you apart!
Now you will obey me.
Marry this woman.
Do it!
Apologize to your father.
Say you'll return to Feng Tai.
Please.
Say you'll marry her.
Do it.
You bastard!
You continue to disgrace me.
You are no longer my son!
You can stay with me, Liu.
I've got plenty of clothes.
Hey.
You could be the first moving-picture man in all of China.
Was she your intended?
The widow?
I think you're well out of that one, mate, eh?
Eh?
I think that alone calls for celebration, eh?
Raymond, I can't wear this.
- I feel foolish.
- Come on.
You really don't like my present?
Come on.
No.
Look, Liu, you've got nothing to be ashamed of.
Nothing.
Listen, look.
We'll sit in the back, yeah?
That way you can see her and she won't be able to see you.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
The foreigner!
How could he appreciate opera?
I can't believe they let him in.
Hey, Liu, are you Chinese or a barbarian?
Traitors don't belong here.
Look at the two of them.
He isn't applauding.
He's insulting Lord Tan!
Well, my friend, this appears not to be such a good idea after all.
Perhaps I'd better leave.
- No, Raymond. We can't leave.
- You stay.
You enjoy the show.
You stay.
Don't shame me more in front of my people.
He's leaving in the middle of the performance!
He should be taught a lesson!
Go away!
Don't touch me!
You devil! You devil!
Because you, I lost everything.
My job, my family, my honor.
The woman I love.
I meet you, it's my downfall!
If you want to quit, go ahead, quit.
I don't need you.
I didn't come halfway around the world to be held back by a coward!
Go ahead! Leave!
It's okay.
Huh? Leave!
Let me tell you something, Liu.
You've changed.
You're not like these other people anymore.
You've got nowhere to go back to!
Wait, wait!
Liu, wait, wait!
I'm sorry, Liu.
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry.
After the private screening... hey, we'll be laughing.
You all listen to me.
I'm the one.
I'm the one who has been invited to the palace!
You think I'm nothing... but I'll show you.
This way, please.
You may begin.
We are very intrigued by the foreigner's technology.
Indeed, Your Benevolent Majesty.
They know how to entertain.
You are right, Your Majesty.
They invented this just for your pleasure.
Shouldn't we be leaving, Master?
She likes me.
Fire! Fire!
- Get away from him!
- What? I'm trying to help!
The barbarian and his accomplice must be punished.
They threatened Her Majesty's life.
What do you suggest?
Execute them.
Lord Tan... you wish to say something?
Please inform Her Majesty...
I believe this young Chinese man meant no harm.
Like so many others in our country... he was led astray by foreign influence... but I believe he can mend the error of his ways.
Small employee.
I'm responsible.
The young man knows some of the foreigner's tricks.
Her Majesty feels he might be useful to us in the future.
You may rise.
Lord Tan, your performance today so pleased Her Majesty... she finds her spirit made forgiving by the beauty of your art.
The young man will be released.
The foreign conspirator... will be expelled from the country.
Thanks to Her Benevolent Majesty!
Guards!
Hey! Liu! Liu!
What's going on?
Where are they taking me?
Long live Her Majesty!
Is there a Liu Jing Lun here?
- I am Liu.
- This package is for you.
From England.
"Dear Liu.
It's hard to believe that one's fate can change in the blink of an eye.
We were parted from each other in flames and smoke... without even being able to say good-bye.
I find myself looking at the ocean between us.
Memories of you bring smiles to my face.
Our Shadow Magic was the one thing in my life that made me feel truly alive.
That is why I need to continue filming.
Wherever I find interesting people... or wherever I see interesting lives...
I want to be there with my camera.
Enclosed are the films we shot in China.
I want you to have them.
Our friendship is preserved in the fond memories of these frames.
My thoughts are with you.
Raymond. "
Why is it blurry, Liu?
I need a lens and I can't afford it.
A lens?
Like eyeglasses... for the projector.
I know what you need.
I'll trade you something that might work.
I'll take a look.
Jewelry Tower!
One night only!
"Shadow Magic Show" at Fu Shou Hall!
Come one! Come all!
Shadow Magic at Fu Shou Hall!
Shadow Magic?
If we wanted to, we could ruin it.
We could ruin nothing.
It will come sooner or later.
This is only the beginning.
Father, can we go?
Liu has not invited us.
Forget about Shadow Magic.
Liu was almost killed.
Crazy!
What am I doing?
What am I trying to prove?
We can't escape what drives us.
Tell me how I'm going to feel this time.
Take a seat and you'll see.
There's Liu.
Father?
You came!
Where are your glasses?
How can you see without your glasses?
I can see what I need to see.
Show me to the front.
Go on, Liu.
- We should leave.
- We might go up in smoke!
I love Shadow Magic.
I'll take the risk.
Wel--Welcome.
Welcome, everyone... to-to Shadow Magic.
Tonight, for the first time... we will see ourselves... the way we are.
We will watch our lives unfold... as we live them every day.
Why put out the lights?
Certain things should be kept in the dark.
I was already in the dark.
Hey! That's me!
Do I look that old?
My camel! That's my camel!
Next should be me!
It is me!
Thrilling!
What do you see?
A man and a camel on a street.
What's so thrilling about that?
Shadow Magic is good for the eyes.
But you can only see it... not hear it.
Your ears feel something's lacking.
Now that you mention it, it does seem that way.
That's why you need us talkative comedians.
We bring the pleasure to your ears.
Shadow Magic has no mercy.
Everything is magnified... larger than life.
- The thin--
- The fat--
- The round--
- Wrinkle upon wrinkle!
- There's nowhere to hide!
- Nope!
Our people know how to be courteous.
- Can't you tell?
- Look!
How are you?
Have you eaten?
Thank you. My pleasure.
Why do we greet each other like this?
It means:
"I've had the pleasure of eating.
If you haven't, come to my house."
- Have you eaten?
- My pleasure!
That's too much eating!
Of course! But eating is the main talent of our civilization!
So true!
Ling! Come in. Please sit.
I want to try.
Here.
Now count evenly.
One, two, three.
My friend Raymond... explained to me--
He said, if we love each other... it's all right to show affection.
I never knew I was so fast!
You're amazing!
That's incredible!
I can't believe my eyes.
Those mountains.
The river-- how it sings.
The horizon-- it seems to extend forever.
That's neat!
My son--
My son did all this!
Ding Jung Shan, the first
Chinese film ever made... was produced at Feng Tai Studio in 1905 by Liu Jing Lun and Ren Jing Feng.
It starred Peking's legendary opera singer Lord Tan Xinpei.
At the turn of the century... a handful of foreigners brought motion pictures to China.
The name of the first Shadow Magic showman remains unknown.

THE TAXIDERMIST
- It's a stork.
- I don't think so.
- Nice beak, huh?
- Move your hands though.
If he bites you, your hand will crumble like a cookie.
Did you hear him?
Then behave yourself.
- What kind of animal is this?
- An African Marabou.
Know what it uses that beak for?
To dig into carcasses.
That means dead animals.
The neck is all plucked so it can dig in better.
It's a kind of vulture.
- Does it even eat mice?
- Yes, everything.
All kinds of junk.
You know what they call him? Scavenger!
When it smells dead bodies it's like ragu sauce for a Neapolitan.
It feeds on all the carcasses, it keeps the environment clean.
- Do they feed it carcasses?
- It feeds on a bit of everything.
- You're not interested?
- Let's go.
- Sorry.
- He was explaining things to us...
I'll go play with him.
Valerio, if I'm not wrong.
- You seem very interested.
- Yes, it's my passion.
- I'm a taxidermist.
- You embalm animals.
Good! It's the first time
I say that word...
I know because my dad was a hunter.
At home I still have a fox, an aquatic bird.
- Are you from here?
- Yes.
So your dad must have been one of my clients.
That's impossible.
- I know everyone from here.
- He passed away a long time ago.
I'm sorry... sorry.
I have all types of animals, if you come you'll be stunned.
- I'm curious to see.
- I have a rhinoceros!
A rhinoceros!
It's four meters long!
- An animal that big...
- I'll show it to you.
I saw live ones a few times.
Monkeys, cercopithecus...
I have some great things.
I'll come visit, as soon as I have time.
It was nice meeting you, you're a bright kid.
Thank you.
- See you?
- You will. See you soon.
Hello?
Signor Profeta?
Signor Profeta!
- A bit dirty...
- Sorry, can't even shake your hand.
- If I'm bothering you...
- No bother at all!
Give me a minute to clean myself up a bit.
I'll wait here.
- Can I get you some coffee?
- No, nothing.
Just a minute.
I'll look around in the meantime.
I'll be here.
Bird's eyes, mammal's eyes...
Now get ready for the big surprise.
Here it is.
It's a shrew.
Very rare!
Imagine, my cat caught this and what a battle to yank it out of its mouth!
But I managed to and I created this masterpiece, excuse my arrogance.
It's beautiful, especially since it's so rare.
It's amazing.
Look at its whiskers.
A steak, mixed salad, and mozzarella salad.
Two stewed fish, salad, and two portions of eggplants.
- Where?
- Table 7.
So?
- I wasn't expecting you.
- It was a surprise.
Actually I have to tell you something.
- What is it?
- I have an idea, I'll throw it at you.
I'd like you to work with me.
I'd like to, but you've kind of... caught me off guard.
- I'd have to give notice here.
- Of course.
How much do you make a month?
1 million five, in summer time 1 million seven.
I could offer you two million.
When work increases,
I can do 2 million five, 3 million...
- Know what that is?
- A turtle.
A land turtle.
Pick it up, see how heavy it is.
Know what this is?
A Boa...
Constrictor.
Do it this way though...
Not like this.
Good.
What's important is to not pierce your fingers, this wire pierces.
Now the wing can take shape, the wire is in so you can shape the wing as you please.
Wait.
Thanks, but I have to admit that I had the help of a guy who is hiding right now.
Valerio, why are you hiding?
Come here!
A round of applause!
Come here, Valerio!
You just disappear like that?
You know where the workshop is, you could have come by.
I did come by, but you owe me an explanation.
What's the problem?
I don't understand.
You disappeared, why?
I left for work, you know what the job's like and how much I make.
Truth is,
I just need to be alone right now.
I started this job, and I want to dedicate myself...
I heard he's tied to the camorra.
- To the camorra?
- Yes.
That's your imagination, you've convinced yourself.
He's a great person, he taught me things I didn't know.
How to kill animals?
Then you'll move on to humans?
- Are you against it?
- Yes. Don't you like animals?
There are people who get attached and want to keep them around even after they die.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Great, perfect.
Are you sad?
You haven't laughed all morning.
Now I'll make you smile.
- Your first paycheck.
- A month has flown by.
Glad you say that, it means the job isn't a burden.
- That means you enjoy it.
- It's my passion.
You can't imagine how glad I am to have found you, to have picked you,
- you're just what I needed.
- Don't exaggerate.
Don't contradict me!
Peppino Profeta is hardly ever wrong.
And this is one of those times
I'm not wrong.
You've earned another little reward from Peppino.
Here.
- Like it?
- You shouldn't have...
What I should or shouldn't do is my business.
- How much did it cost you?
- What's the big deal?
Do you like it?
That's what matters.
I wanted to tell you that two girl friends of mine from Rome are coming in.
We'll have a good time, take them out to dinner...
- When?
- Next week. You decide when.
You seem worried, maybe I made a mistake.
- You prefer to go out with Manuela?
- No, it's not Manuela.
You say the word,
I'll call someone else and...
- Jeez, I regret having asked you.
- No! Do it.
Should I? Don't make me look like a jerk.
- Don't worry.
- I'll organize it.
They're coming specially from Rome.
What a great smell!
Almost ready, ten minutes.
Surprising!
A toast to this lovely evening!
And to our cook.
"Maria, look, the baby talked!"
"What did he say?"
"Dad, you're such a jerk!"
"He's right!
You brought the wrong kid!"
No biting!
Is it comfy?
All four of us in here?
Good!
- Gimme a massage.
- Let's see if I know how to...
- What a beautiful hand!
- Really?
Uncle, shut off the light!
You come home at this hour?
- Unfortunately yes.
- Unfortunately yes?
Don't you care that he has to go to school and I have to go to work?
It's four in the morning!
You have to adapt yourself to this home and this family.
- Will you quit shouting?
- He won't knock it off!
First him, now you start too...
- You think you're in the right?
- No.
Why don't you knock it off?
Waking up the whole building... I wake your son up because he bugs me with that thing.
You bug us when you come home at this hour.
- When you want to be the dad.
- Never mind dad. Don't mention him!
- Enough, make a decision.
- A decision? He has to leave!
- So he'll leave!
- I'm sick of this!
- Fuck you!
- No, you!
- Sorry, Peppino.
- What are you doing here?
I fought with my brother.
Can I crash here for a few days?
- The room's over there.
- Just for a few days, then...
Grab some sheets, if you're hungry get something in the kitchen.
- Don't make noise, I have to sleep.
- Thanks.
Goodnight.
Once I went to do a job on this street, but I couldn't find the way out.
But I had gone in!
I should exit where I came in from!
I couldn't find the exit.
Then all of the sudden on the corner I saw a tall man, more or less your height, gray, long hair, blue eyes.
"How do I get out of here?"
He looked at me.
I was stunned by his calmness.
He came near the car with silent steps...
Seemed like he was flying.
"You're tense, huh?
You're going through a bad period.
But don't worry, you'll come out of it.
And you'll come out of here too.
You called me and I came.
I'm always behind you.
Just call me and I'll come.
The exit is there."
I'd passed by there 300 times!
The exit was right there!
Sometimes exits are right in front of our noses but we don't see them.
But they are there
He said he can't wait anymore, we have to deliver it.
It didn't turn out like I wanted though.
So you're not satisfied.
- Come here.
- Excuse me.
Go ahead, I'll catch up.
This is the third time.
The boss is expecting you tonight.
If it were up to me, I'd have chopped off your head already.
You've got a guardian angel. Don
Pasqualino's expecting you tonight.
I sent for you three times, you never came. I got angry.
- I was embarrassed.
- No need to be.
We've known each other for so long.
Embarrassed to come here because of 20 million lira?
Don't do these things to me.
- It's a rough period.
- I'm not thinking about the money.
I sent for you because I need a favor from you. Only you can.
- What can I do for you?
- You have a trade that you do very well.
Nobody's better than you.
You know what your trade is, right?
- Want me to embalm an animal?
- Not an animal.
But you know how to open and close.
Why are we going to Cremona?
What do you care?
I'm going to Cremona,
I'd like to know why.
- What do we have to do?
- Is it important to you?
No, it's not.
If you don't want to tell me, no problem
Just pretend we're going for a ride.
- A few hours, no way!
- I can't perform miracles.
- If you want me to fix the car...
- We gotta get moving.
- Let's see what the piece costs.
- Call me a taxi.
I'll show you to the office.
Come here, Fabio.
The gas pump needs to be changed.
Come.
As soon as the car's ready, rush to the hotel.
- Remember where it is?
- You explained it to me.
Don't worry.
- When's this taxi coming?
- I called for it ten minutes ago!
- Here it is.
- See you at the hotel.
- Sorry... You could have asked for one.
- I was about to.
- If you need anything...
- Very kind of you, no thanks.
I'm waiting for the car to be repaired.
It'll take a while.
Take this fucking bag and get lost!
- Pay me and I'll go!
- With a kick in the ass.
Go, beat it!
You're not here for your pretty face, but as a favor to your father!
Yeah, but don't touch my ass!
Get your hands off of me!
Hands on you?
Take a look at yourself!
Go away. Away!
You're a thief! Shame on you, who do you think you are?
Bastard... But I stole 200,000 lira from the register.
I did good, right?
He deserved to be punished.
Wanna get something to drink?
Sign here, thanks.
- Please, first floor.
- Thanks.
- Are you kidding?
- No, it's nice here.
Stay for a year, then we'll see if you still say it's nice.
My parents are used to it, but they're old.
But it's good for the body, cold weather tones you up.
- What time is it?
- Why?
I'm worried Peppino will be waiting for me.
I have to go soon.
Do you want to leave?
- I'd like to stay.
- But?
But I don't want to give a bad impression.
- That dwarf won't get mad, don't worry.
- That dwarf...
He gets mad alright.
It's so big!
It's so beautiful!
But I can't do it here.
- Come on, don't stop.
- I'm dying to put it in my mouth.
- No one's here.
- And if someone passes by?
I'll keep watch.
Wait.
I'll keep watch.
- I can't do it here.
- I'll keep watch!
- I'm really good, you know?
- No, I don't know, show me.
But in this situation...
I want you! I'm dying for you!
I can't do it here, sorry.
I don't feel safe.
Can't we go to your place?
We can't go to mine.
- Sorry, you're right.
- You could have called!
- You'll never guess what happened.
- You should've called.
- I tried to.
- Bullshit, I was here all night!
Now I'll explain to you.
Reception, good evening.
Fine.
Signorina Deborah? Leave your ID, it's on the first floor.
- Hello, Deborah.
- It's a pleasure, Peppino.
I don't know if Valerio told you what happened tonight.
- Is there a problem?
- I couldn't go home.
- We'll take care of it now.
- I didn't know this was the set-up.
- Me neither.
- What?
I didn't expect this either.
I booked two rooms, but those jerks didn't tell me there was a convention.
There's a lack of rooms, they only gave me one, I have to make do.
- I'll try calling someone.
- Wait. I think we can find a solution.
I'll call a friend.
She always wakes me up at night.
- You're calling at this hour?
- Well... That's what friends are for, right?
Call her!
Outside line please.
If she wants to go to her friend's, let her.
She doesn't feel at ease, let her go to her friend's.
- Should I call or not?
- Do whatever you want.
I think we can work it out.
There's an armchair.
I can't sleep knowing you're uncomfortable.
I'm not uncomfortable.
Want to swap?
Don't worry, I'm fine.
What a pain in the ass! Just sleep!
Thanks, I'll do the same for you.
Good morning.
I won't ask if you slept well or it'll seem like...
What about you?
I slept well.
- You woke up early.
- Yes, pretty early, we had breakfast...
Guess what? She's coming with us.
- Who?
- Deborah. To Rome, she has a friend there.
I couldn't say no.
We're going that way anyway.
We're almost there.
What's she doing here?
She was supposed to get off in Rome, she called her friend but she was in Sicily.
She called another one but her mobile was off...
Point being?
If she can stay for a few days, if it's not a problem...
- Two days?
- I wanted to wake you, right Valerio?
- Why didn't you?
- He said to let you sleep.
- We did the right thing?
- No, you didn't.
You let me sleep for too long, plus we should have made this decision together, but instead you two did it alone.
Even if you said no, it was two against one!
- She livens things up.
- Come on, we'll have fun!
Come here.
- Don Pasquale.
- Everything okay?
- Everything's fine.
- What's new? Is everything going well?
I brought my nephew and his girl here to go for a ride.
Your nephew and his girl...
That's the guy you're always with.
- My nephew.
- Nephew my ass!
I told you, don't let people see you with young guys too often.
I know everything.
All the money you borrow gets spent on them!
The cost of living has increased!
The fun you have increases and my wallet size decreases.
I'm glad you're having fun, but take it easy with the money.
They'll drown you with your clothes on.
Congrats for everything that's going on.
- Things are going well?
- Very well.
If there is a problem,
I'll straighten it out.
So far, so good, as long as it stays that way, relax.
I want Peppino!
Take it easy though.
#Ever since I was born#
#I've had a pretty huge vice#
#that I never lost, #
#who knows why. #
#My grandfather used to say to me#
#that in doing this he laughed#
#and so I do the same. #
#Everyone laugh with me. #
Come here.
Good one, you deserve a kiss.
- Enough.
- Let me do your lips!
Just a bit!
I did it to him!
- Look what she did to me!
- But you're a kid!
Lipstick bothers me.
- Wait...
- No, enough.
Please, just this.
- Will you get her out of here?
- She's just playing.
- What am I, her doll?
- I swear, you look great.
You look great.
I have to be honest.
Look how she dressed me!
- Can I go dancing like this on Saturday?
- Yes, you're beautiful.
- Careful, it'll rip.
- Excuse me, foxy blonde.
- Just five minutes.
- You can't stay here.
- I was all alone there.
- Are you crazy?
I'll sleep here, I'll be good.
If you say that, I made a mistake bringing her here.
After all I've done for you!
- I don't get you.
- Just five minutes.
- Don't touch me or I'll kill you.
- Take it easy!
- Stop, don't touch me.
- Last time.
Last time what?
Peppino, stop it.
Are you crazy?
- What's with you?
- Nothing.
I thought you liked it.
Sorry.
We should have another party like last time. Me, Rita, you, and Deborah.
What kind of party?
What do you mean?
A nice dinner, you can make spaghetti with prawns.
Lobster, wine, champagne...
- Then whatever happens, happens.
- What's that mean?
Two men, two women, what happens, happens.
We'll entrust ourselves to the champagne's bubbles.
Then we'll mix it all up.
No, Peppino.
I don't think so.
- Why?
- Because with Deborah...
How do you know she won't like it?
Maybe she'll like it.
I can assure you, she won't like it.
Why are you getting all grumpy?
You're so uptight!
I'm joking.
Plus, I see nothing wrong with it.
I was joking, I beg your pardon!
You're so uptight!
- Everything okay?
- Yes, I'm almost done setting it up.
I wanted to tell you...
What are we going to do about this problem?
The girl's gotta go, it was only supposed to be a few days.
It's been ages already!
You're right, we've been meaning to tell you.
Now that I have a monthly salary, I'm going to rent a room in a hotel and we'll move out.
Money, hotel...
I don't get you.
You thought going away would resolve the problem?
I asked you a question.
"What are we going to do about the girl?"
There's a problem that needs to be resolved.
I don't think leaving with her is going to resolve the problem.
If you need time, a week, 15 days, a month, that's no big deal.
You're going to throw away your hard-earned money on a hotel?
Let's find a solution and...
Eat breakfast!
I'll get you a cappuccino and bun.
- Thanks.
- Fool.
There she is.
Where were you? I've been looking for you for an hour!
- I found a job!
- Really? Congratulations!
- Who's that?
- Signor Leo
- Can I go?
- Yes, see you tomorrow.
You're all settled in now, you even found a job!
Thanks.
- You can leave.
- Where are you going?
Want to be alone, do my own thing tonight.
- What about the car?
- You keep it.
You have to go get Deborah!
Go, or she'll get mad.
You're gonna walk alone?
Where are you going?
Oh please!
Peppino Profeta is never alone!
I just do this and
I have thousands of friends around.
- Can't I come too?
- For what?
- You're still here?
- I'm waiting for Valerio.
- Want a lift?
- No, thanks.
You sure?
There it is.
I hope we're not going somewhere else.
Where is it?
It should be this way.
Here it is.
Peppino tripped.
- What a great night!
- We enjoyed too.
It's been so long...
Plus this kid is fantastic.
- The bottles?
- Which?
I asked the waiter for two bottles.
I'll go get them.
Be right back.
- He forgets everything!
- I didn't tell him.
- Well?
- Wonderful, great. I'm pleased with you.
As agreed,
200 for you and 200 for you.
- The night is over.
- What? We just got here!
- It's over?
- What?
It's over.
I'm tired, I want to go to bed.
And Valerio?
- Let's see what he says.
- It doesn't matter, I decide.
It matters to me.
You leave nice and easy and we can meet up with Valerio another time.
Where are you?
- Already warming up?
- Warming up.
- Are the glasses missing?
- You're the only thing missing.
I'm coming up.
Slowly.
Brace yourself.
- Where are they?
- Who?
- They're not here? Where's Roberta?
- In the bathroom.
What a night!
Let's get undressed, we'll get ready for them.
- Give me a hand.
- Let's get ready for them.
In such a hurry!
What's this Roberta got?
- You like her, huh?
- Thanks, I can hardly move.
Take off your shirt.
Wait.
Don't rip it, I like it.
Don't worry, Peppino will buy you a nicer one.
- And if we don't find it?
- Who cares!
My, how drunk you are.
Having fun? A great night.
Seems like you're calling a dog!
Be more gentle!
Where the fuck were you?
Tell me!
- Where did that fucking dwarftake you?
- Nowhere.
If you wanted me to leave, you could have told me.
- I'm leaving!
- Where are you going?
- Stay here!
- Don't touch me!
- You have to stay here!
- Fuck you! You make me sick!
Take it easy, this isn't your house!
- You dirty pig!
- Don't you dare!
- Don't ever touch me again!
- I didn't do anything!
- Look at the state you're in!
- What state am I in?
- You smell like shit!
- How dare you!
I'm fucking fed up.
I smell like shit?
Don't you ever dare!
Who you been with?
Nice!
- Having fun?
- Are you bored?
Kind of tired, can we finish another time?
Want something to drink?
- Deborah, want something?
- No, thanks.
Nothing? An ice cream?
Want an iced tea?
- What is it? Are you bored?
- No. Are you having fun?
It's not my favorite sport, but I wanted to do this thing with Valerio.
You remind me of a friend, you know?
- Your friend?
- Yes.
He was small like you, very intelligent, great personality.
- But he's dead now.
- How did he die?
We never found out, he went for a swim in the sea and never came back.
That's what they told me.
He fought with a guy he loved to death.
- And to give vent to...
- A girl?
- A guy.
- Uh a guy.
- The little guy was in love with a man!
- A handsome guy, really tall.
- Like Valerio?
- Yes, similar.
They fought and he went for a swim to vent, he ran in and then we never saw him again.
- How does it end?
- That's it... They never found the body.
- You didn't find the ending yet?
- What ending?
Now we'll put our heads together and finish it, you're creative.
I'm not making it up.
- It's beautiful
- You don't believe me?
The little guy falls in love with a young man.
You remind me of him because it really happened.
Then a bitch from Cremona came along, not knowing what she's risking.
You don't know what you're risking
For your own good, fuck off, get lost!
- Are you insane?
- Get lost!
Peppino Profeta has already waited too long.
You want me to go?
If I go, you'll be alone.
- Who says so?
- Valerio pities you.
He feels sorry for you, I know him.
- You make him sick.
- Who told you?
With those fake plastic lips, shaped like a pussy.
At least I was able to fix myself, you can't be fixed.
- But if you want, I go away.
- There's one thing you can't fix, your brain!
- Don't you dare touch me!
- Beat it, you whore!
I won't touch you, you make me sick!
- Look at you! Let's see how you end up!
- Peppino Profeta has never touched shit!
- What are you saying, Don Pasquale?
- Don't embarrass him,
- he practically ate his plate too!
- He did it to please you.
- What? Is that true Peppino?
- No way!
We shouldn't do these things for wives.
What are you saying?
Wives should stay at home, raise the kids...
- Really?
- It's normal.
- What's wrong?
- Peppino!
Lad, this is no way to behave.
- What's wrong?
- My head's spinning.
- Did you drink too much?
- Something's wrong.
- Do you know what's wrong?
Peppino's problems.
Peppino!
What the hell's your problem? We're waiting downstairs. You forgot everything?
- You're right.
- You're supposed to be a gangster?
- Dress you up.
- You're trash!
- This is the last time. We'll wait downstairs.
- Move it! Droogie!
Mr Gangster!
- Where will we dump him?
- In Verona.
- What is it?
- It's late.
- Excuse me...
- Yes.
Did you pack everything?
Hold on, mom!
- Been waiting long?
- No, five minutes.
Deborah, Valerio, there's a surprise.
- How are you?
- Good. Look at your belly!
- Peppino's not supposed to know?
- We never heard from you.
What brats! Aren't you going to say hi to uncle Peppino?
How are you?
How should I be? Fine.
- Youngsters are so odd.
- They're youngsters. Who understands them?
A bit ungrateful. They forget the good things and abandon you.
- What are you doing here?
- Uncle Peppinos of no use... bye!
- Why are you here? In Cremona.
- Just passing through.
Signor Pietro, how's he behaving?
- Not true, he's a great kid.
- Thank you.
Did you tell them about all the fun we had together?
- Valerio was supposed to.
- I didn't have a chance yet.
- You never mentioned such a friendly uncle.
- Too kind, signora.
Well, it's time for me to get going.
- Want to stay for dinner?
- Why don't you stay?
My wife's a great cook.
- Will it make you happy?
- Of course.
You're glad that I came.
I see it in your eyes.
- You saw each other often?
- More or less.
I just remembered, I have an appointment.
You're so kind, thanks for the hospitality.
Are you leaving tonight or will you stay a few days?
I haven't decided.
Like I said,
I live in absolute carelessness.
I've got all the time to decide,
I could leave in 15 minutes...
- Excuse me, I feel sick.
- A year...
- Wait!
- Excuse me Peppino.
Goodbye, it was a pleasure. If you're still here tomorrow, you can come for lunch or dinner.
- We'll see.
- Goodbye then.
- See you soon, I hope.
- You've been very kind.
- May he show me to the door?
- Please...
Now you've gone overboard!
Can't you see this is a special situation?
Why are you ruining things for me?
You're exaggerating.
Calling or passing by work is acceptable, but...
I've been here for two weeks and you never managed to find free time to talk to me for five minutes.
I have to talk to you.
It's a special time for me, don't you get it?
A baby's growing in her belly, she'll give birth soon, we're a family, we're happy together now.
You don't understand.
You can't find two minutes to talk to Peppino? Is it that hard?
I need to talk to you.
- That's it.
- Let's talk.
Let's talk, just like that...
This fucking fog!
Where are you going? We might get run over in this fog.
Can we meet up tomorrow?
- After work, for an hour.
- Are you off duty?
No, I have to go back home.
What time do you have to be back in the barracks?
I have to take care of Deborah, she might feel ill.
If tomorrow you're not on "clean-up duty", don't forget that this jerk needs to talk to you.
How do you feel?
What the fuck did he come for?
- First of all, take it easy. He came.
- So I saw.
- We moved, we lost touch with him...
- He called me a few times.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- It was pointless.
After all that he did?
You must be kidding!
Don't you realize?
So you knew he would come.
- No, I didn't know.
- Yes you did.
- Why were you afraid?
- Who said I was?
I saw you, you think I didn't notice?
- You were all weird, how come?
- Knock it off. Now you're starting too?
Why, what did he say?
Look me in the eyes.
Something happened between you, didn't it?
- Tell me the truth.
- How dare you?
- I think you're hallucinating.
- Hallucinating?
He gave you two million five for doing jack shit.
- If you think that, you're a bitch.
- I always thought that.
Do you think I'm stupid?
Can't you see he's dangerous?
- You have to do something.
- I have to do something?
- Do what?
- I don't know.
They want all kinds of things, trucks, motorcycles, bikes, walkie-talkies, because if you buy something big, you're not just any old ranger, you're an important ranger, you gain the power to decide.
I already bought a truck.
You with a jeep, me with a truck...
We'll be in charge there.
- It's a wonderful idea.
- It's nice, but you'll isolate yourself in that place and once you lose interest in the animals, and want a little action, there's nothing there.
- Then there's Mombasa.
- Mombasa?
It's a beautiful place.
In the hotel area, there are skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, like Las Vegas.
I've been there, it's beautiful.
Chock full of fun, women, chicks...
And kind of outside of the city, in the suburbs, there's a nightclub where all the foreigners go.
If a pretty boy like you walks in, you'd knock them dead, I can assure you.
My friend said that it's packed with chicks there.
Seriously, you'll have to say,
"Enough, no more for me".
- It's nice...
- Maybe we'll talk more about it.
I gotta run, it's Deborah's uncle's birthday.
- Wait...
- No, it's late.
I don't want to make a bad impression on the relatives.
There's a bar nearby, we'll just get a beer.
- A beer won't hurt! An aperitif!
- Just one beer, then I'm going.
You warm up with the second bottle of wine, with the third, you defrost.
- It's good.
- We went a bit overboard.
Yes a little.
Damn you, how did you end up here?
It's not that bad.
Depends on how you look at it.
If you're convinced you're happy...
The sea... maybe I miss it a bit.
But...
Why? You're in a sea of troubles.
- You think I'm that bad off?
- Why, you think you're fine?
We won't live with her folks forever, we'll get our own house.
You'll have a career as busboy, then a waiter...
- Head waiter.
- Head waiter!
You, Valerio, handsome as a god, will settle for becoming the head waiter in a restaurant!
You could have had the world at your feet!
- Just had to go like this!
- I can be happy this way too.
- I don't need to be an engineer...
- Why settle?
Woe to the man who settles.
You have to keep looking ahead.
At age twenty, your life is over, the baby, Deborah, that's your life.
You make me mad.
As they say...
- You're happy.
- Yes.
Then don't think about it!
Cheers!
Sorry, maybe it's the wine that makes me lose control.
I budded into your personal business.
I don't really care,
I'm leaving tomorrow at 10:00,
I'm all ready.
- Do you know where you're going?
- Of course!
I could even go to South America.
Cuba, wherever I want.
You'd like Cuba, huh?
- Or even Thailand.
- My My!
Isn't that Peppino?
- Valerio's with him too.
- Where?
What the fuck do you want again?
If you dare come back here...
What are you fucking laughing about?
And don't touch me, you make me sick.
Goodnight signora! Don Pietro...
He was talking about work, about a project he had long ago.
I swear.
Signora, do you believe me?
I believe you, but you could have called...
- It was my brother's party.
- I'm mortified.
We were embarrassed.
- Forget about it.
- Mom, forget it!
Mum I told you to stay here, leave him alone!
Goodnight.
- Valerio, excuse me.
- Yes, signora.
- Here.
- Thank you.
- You sure nothing's wrong?
- No, really.
- Everything's fine.
- That's what you always say.
Deborah won't talk to me about it, neither will you...
We'll talk tomorrow, it's better that way.
- OK, goodnight.
- Goodnight. Thank you.
Sleep.
Are you sleeping?
- Cuba?
- Cuba!
Havana!
- Let's go!
- We go?
- Right now?
- Yes.
Lover's getaway?
You're cute together.
- Don't you gross yourself out?
- Why?
- Am I gross?
- Kind of.
Aren't you ashamed to run away with a 50 year old dwarf?
- Gimme a minute.
- You're imagining things.
Nobody's here, who are you talking to?
- I'll catch up with you.
- If you get in the car, she'll disappear.
- She's not here, it's all a bad dream.
- Be right there.
You want to go with him? Then go.
And me?
What'll I tell to my son?
Valerio, now you're pissing me off!
I said hold on!
Can you give me a minute?
What difference does it make if I stay?
I could even stay, but it's the same.
I said hold on!
A friend came to get us, she's restless.
I wasn't expecting her!
Please, put that thing away.
When Peppino's in trouble, she gives me a hand.
- Why don't you put it away?
- No, why?
- Relax, we're leaving.
- I care about her!
She has magic powers, she makes people disappear.
- That's not necessary.
- You wanna disappear?
- Peppino will disappear?
- No one will disappear.
We're leaving, put it away.
Relax, be a good girl.
Behave!
It's not my fault!
Disappeared.
- The suitcases.
- Put it away.
Grab the suitcases.
- Please, put it away.
- She's tense, she gets pissed!
Move!
- We're leaving.
- Don't shout.
People are sleeping.
Disappeared!
Move!
Enough.
Come on! It's ready!
It's 7:30!
'THE CIRCLE'
PRODUCED AND DIRECTED BY
JAFAR PANAHI
It's a girl.
Who is Solmaz Gholami?
- Solmaz Gholami?
- Here.
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.
Congratulations.
The baby is born. It's a girl.
- A girl?
- Yes, a beautiful girl.
- Yes?
- Pardon me.
My daughter has had a baby, but nobody's told me what it was.
- Nobody told you?
- No.
I'm going to ask.
- It's a beautiful girl.
- A girl? Are you sure?
But the ultrasound image showed it was a boy.
Sometimes this happens.
Her in-laws will be furious and ask him to divorce her.
They wanted a boy.
My poor daughter...
Everything's going to be fine.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Hello.
Sorry we came in late.
They called us just now.
How is our boy doing?
- We haven't heard anything.
- Since last night?
- No, nothing.
- Let's go there and ask.
Excuse me. Hasn't Solmaz
Gholami given birth yet?
Of course she has, it's a girl.
- But they expected a boy.
- Are you sure?
It's a girl, l'm sure.
- Where are you going?
- And you? I've been looking for you.
- What's the matter?
- It's a baby girl.
- Does he know?
- The whole family is upstairs.
That's not good.
They expected a boy.
- My God.
- My poor daughter.
Go and tell your uncles.
- Right away.
- Hurry.
Excuse me.
Do you have any change?
- No.
- Thanks.
- No answer.
- What shall we do?
- Deutschmarks? Dollars?
- Where's the gold necklace?
- Here.
- Give me the number.
Hurry.
Wait here. I'II be back as soon as I sell it.
Are you all alone?
- What did he say?
- Nothing.
- Hey you, wait there!
- Arezoo!
Maede!
What did you say?
I'II teach you a lesson.
- She's crazy!
- You idiot!
Arezoo!
Arezoo!
They'II take her to jail.
Stop talking. Come with us.
Keep moving.
You can't park in here.
You on the grey car, keep on
driving. You're blocking the way.
Get out.
- How are we going to get out?
- Keep the street clear.
You cannot park in here.
- We have free passes.
- She did too.
You cannot park in here.
Get out. Make way.
What are we going to do now?
- What are we going to do?
- Let's call again.
- What about my gold necklace?
- You can't get it now.
How can we get to Raziliq?
We don't have money for the bus ticket.
Don't worry.
I'II work something out. Let's go.
- How much for the local call?
- $ 2 tomans.
Alright, give me a token.
- A cigarette, please.
- What brand do you prefer?
Anyone costing less than $ 1O tomans.
There's no answer.
You can't smoke in here.
You'II get us into trouble.
You'd better not smoke.
Let's go and look for Pari.
- Hello, excuse me.
- Hello.
- You know where's Abdullah shop?
- Abdullah?
- Yes.
- What does he do?
- I was told he worked here.
- Do you know the address?
- Manoucheri corner.
- There's no Abdullah here.
There's Abbas, the paintings seller,
Madji, the antiques seller... and Youssef, who sells old teapots.
- Are you sure?
- I've been here for 4O years.
He has a daughter named Fereshteh, but everybody calls her Pari.
I never heard of them.
- What's his name again?
- Abdullah.
There's a stand over there.
Abdullah is the owner's name.
See if it's him.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Wait here.
Arezoo.
Alright, you're free to go.
What are you doing?
Don't take that.
Wait for Abdullah to come back.
Please...
Don't take them.
Please!
- Come on.
- Did you get the address?
He wouldn't answer me.
- His boss is not even there.
- I want to show you something.
- No, come on.
- Please. Just a minute.
What is it?
Look, it's Raziliq.
It's where l'm taking you.
Look how beautiful it is.
It's paradise.
The Sabalah hills.
There's a river right here.
If only we could get there!
It'd be the end of our problems.
I used to play with my brother here.
But the painter was careless.
He forgot the beautiful flowers.
It's been closed for 6 months.
The cheese is already stinking.
The stench is spreading all over.
Do you know where he is?
- No. Does he owe you money?
- No.
I haven't heard from him.
Everybody's been asking.
- He's probably gone into hiding.
- Thanks.
- We wasted the whole day searching.
- Can we still manage to go?
- We lost the chance.
- Do you want a ride?
I wish I could smoke.
There must be some other way.
Come on.
Wait here.
I won't be long.
It's alright. Wait there.
- Where were you?
- Downstairs.
Are you alright?
- Hassan!
- Yes?
- Where are you going?
- I'II be right back.
Why did you leave?
You were gone for too long.
I spent 1O minutes looking for you.
- And?
- I got the money.
From whom?
Arezoo! Was he a relative?
- Who?
- That man.
Yes.
- Did you smoke?
- I didn't have time.
We have to go now, or you'II be late.
Here. Take the money.
- Take this too.
- What about you?
- I'm not going.
- Why not?
- I can't. Stop talking, go.
- But we made a promise...
- I can't go. I'm not going.
- I won't leave withou you.
Enough. Hurry, go.
Otherwise you'II miss the bus.
- But why?
- Head for the bus station.
Get in, hurry.
Go on, darling, and don't forget:
At the end of the line, you must look for the bus station.
- Go on, good-bye.
- Come on, get in.
Arezoo!
- What's the matter now?
- I need to know why.
It's none of your business.
You're gonna miss the bus.
You did everything you could to get the money.
I can't go. I got scared when I touched the money.
- Scared of what?
- Of being rejected.
Two years in prison, and nobody went to see me.
What about your son?
I don't know where he is, nor if he's still alive.
It might be tough on him to see me again.
Go on, or you'II miss the bus.
Come with me.
- I can't. Everywhere is the same.
- No. We'II be in paradise there.
I need some time.
I wouldn't stand seeing that your paradise does not exist.
Go. You're going to be late.
Go on, please.
Go, go.
Don't forget. Look for the bus station at the end of the line.
Alright? Take care.
Good-bye.
Arezoo.
- What's the matter now?
- Take care you too.
Go on, now.
Be careful.
Excuse me, where can I buy tickets to Sarab?
Sarab?
It must be on counter 15, or 16.
- Sarab is on the west...
- West of Azerbaijan.
Azerbaijan...
I think it's on counter 3.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- I want a ticket to Sarab.
- It's the last bus.
There's no seats available.
I'm in a hurry.
- The seats are all taken.
- No seats?
None.
Look again.
- Please, try once more.
- None.
- Just the back seats.
- Alright.
A seat in the back. Name?
Nargess Mamizadeh from Raziliq.
- How old are you?
Are you traveling alone?
Where's your student's ID?
I forgot to bring it.
- I can't sell it, then.
- Please.
I can't sell tickets to unaccompanied women.
You must have an escort or bring an ID.
- I need to go home.
- ID or escort.
- I don't have one now.
- It's your problem, not mine.
- Please, just this once.
- I can't.
- Please, I need to go.
- Are you really a student?
- I can get into trouble.
- I'm a student.
- Really?
- Yes.
Alright.
- You said Nargess Mamizadeh?
- Nargess Mamizadeh...
- From Raziliq.
- Right.
Are you really a student?
Yes.
Here. Pay to the cashier and go to the boarding platform.
- How much is it?
- $ 1,12O tomans.
Where is the platform?
Downstairs.
You'II see the bus.
Nir and Sarab, departure at 6:3O p.m.
- To Sarab?
- Yes. You can get in.
- Where do I sit?
- At the back.
Nir and Sarab, departure at 6:3O.
Boarding now!
- When do we leave?
- In 1O minutes.
- I'II be back in 5 minutes.
- Don't be late, I won't wait.
- I'II be right back.
- Hurry.
Can I see that shirt at the window?
Which one is it?
Show me.
- The white one with needlework.
- With red embroidery.
Latest fashion. It was made in Turkey, fine work.
Very nice. A shirt for fiancés.
A really beautiful model.
- You won't be disappointed.
- How much is it?
Choose, first. What's his size?
About 2O years old.
But is he fat or thin?
Short or tall?
Did you forget your boyfriend's size?
Women are all the same, they all have bad memory.
Even those who have your good taste.
If the shirt does not fit, you can change it.
How much is this shirt?
God has sent this lad.
- Come in.
- I'm looking for a shirt.
Come in, don't just stand there.
Come inside, l'II show you.
- Where are you from?
- Khoramabad.
- And you?
- Tabriz.
- Let me see the collar.
- What for?
Just for measuring.
Is your boyfriend like him?
Do they have the same size?
Let's see.
- I'm looking for a shirt.
- This is for her, not for you.
Is this the right size?
Take a look.
Sorry for bothering you.
Mehdi, come help this lad.
- How much is it?
- For you, nothing.
$ 5,2OO just for you.
That's not much.
As long as you're happy.
- Should I wrap it up for present?
- Yes, please.
I can show you the latest models.
Here you have $ 5,OOO tomans minus $ 2OO.
Which one do you want?
This one? Very good.
What size?
- The same as hers...
- The same as the one I just sold.
The 6:3O bus to Sarab!
Can I help you?
Is anybody there?
Are you looking for someone?
- Is Arezoo here?
- Arezoo?
Maryiam...
Maryiam Parvin from Jerman.
Is she German?
- No, from a village in the north.
- There's nobody here with that name.
- Arezoo is not here?
- Arezoo? Who's that?
- You bought her something to drink.
- She left a long time ago.
- Where to?
- I don't know.
Hello.
- Is Abdullah here?
- No.
- When will he be back?
- I don't know.
- What do you want from him?
- I'm looking for his daughter Pari.
- Are you alone?
- She said she'd be here.
Some other woman came looking for her too.
Said she wanted to talk to her.
That was my friend.
I was waiting right there.
- Do you have her address?
- At the end of the street, 2nd alley.
3O Sirus Ghorbanipoor.
- I'm sorry?
- 3O Sirus Ghorbanipoor.
Thank you.
- Yes?
- Hello.
- What do you want?
- Is Pari there?
- What?
- I'm looking for Pari.
- What do you want?
- I'm a friend of hers.
- Friend?
- We came out of prison today.
- Have you been to my stand?
- Yes.
Go back to where you once belonged, you slut! Why did they let you go?
You belong in prison.
Go back to there.
To you, Pari is dead.
You're such an idiot.
Why did you get out?
Your life outside won't be easy.
You should've stayed there.
- Who is this?
- Open the door, father!
Quiet. The neighbors will hear you.
Open the door!
- We're not leaving.
- Stop!
- When did she get out?
- This morning.
And I only get to know now?
Let me in!
Get out of my way, father!
Stop!
I won't hurt her!
I just want to talk to her!
Calm down!
Get out of my way, father!
I won't hurt her!
Her friends came looking for her at the stand.
Hossein told me.
He should've told me if anybody came looking for the address.
She is here.
Why did they let her go?
Mohammed!
Abbas!
Don't let her go out!
She will never step into this house again while I live.
Pari, wait!
- To the circle, Hossein.
- Get in.
Mom asked me to bring you the purse.
- Thank you.
- Your cigarettes.
What's this?
- It's for you.
- I don't want your money.
Be good and go back home.
- Where to?
- Morad Theater.
I'II drop you at the circle.
It's in the area.
Alright.
Are you okay?
Yes, l'm fine.
Try to get up.
Need any help?
I'm fine, thank you.
- Tickets, please.
- I just came to see an employee.
- Who?
- Monir.
- She's at the box office.
- Thank you.
Monir!
Pari! What are you doing here?
- I don't want to bother you...
- l'm so happy to see you.
Come on! Let her in.
Sorry about the mess.
- It's fine.
- When did you get out?
- This morning.
- But it should've been 8 months ago.
I was released and imprisoned again under certain charges.
Charges against you?
I've got a long record.
- That's all in the past now.
- Not yet.
- Why not?
- I ran away.
Ran away?
How did you do it?
I escaped with a group.
- But why?
- I have something to do.
Well, tell me...
- Are you alright?
- Yes. Listen... l'm looking for Elham.
Have you heard of her?
- Elham who?
- Elham Saboktakin.
She was in prison for 5 years but nobody knew the reason.
- The pseudostudent?
- Yes.
She came to visit me last year.
- One, please.
- There you go.
She told me she was getting married.
One never knows about her.
I never got the invitation nor heard from her again.
- Is she working at the hospital yet?
- I guess so.
Which one?
I can take you there, it's on my way home.
Is your husband coming to pick you up?
He's a driver for some company, always out on trips... a month here, 6 months traveling.
Kashan, Isphahan...
Hello.
- Are you almost done?
- Yes, come in.
- She's wife number two.
- Your husband got another wife?
I found out coming out of prison.
Nobody had told me anything.
At the beginning... my daughter was afraid of me and used to hide behind her.
But now that I came to know her,
I realized she's a good person.
She took care of my children for 4 years.
She quit her job to take care of them.
But she's still the second.
- May I?
- Yes, please.
- I realized you had a guest.
- Thank you.
- Help yourself.
- Thank you.
Thank you very much.
She's called Pari, too.
In fact, Parvaneh.
I call her Pari after you.
What about the children?
The girls are at home, but Ali is out.
- Where is he?
- With a friend.
He and his friends!
Do you still have to do a lot of time?
Yes, a lot.
Was that man released?
No.
Did you marry him, then?
How much time does he still have to do?
He was executed.
When?
3 or 4 months ago.
Did you see him again?
They allowed us to be together his last night.
My God!
It's there.
Come to my house afterwards.
Let me give you the address.
No.
I have some business with Elham.
Tell her I would've visited her too if it weren't for the kids.
I'II tell her. Thank you.
- Should I pick you up later?
- There's no need, thanks.
Pari!
Do I owe you money?
- No, why would you?
- I was always broke in prison.
No.
- I don't remember who I owe to.
- You owe us nothing.
Everybody loved you very much.
Except for Zari, but she's eased up.
- Don't you really need money?
- No.
- Take care.
- Don't worry.
- Bye.
- Bye.
I'm looking for Mrs. Saboktakin.
- Elham Saboktakin?
- Yes.
- I think she's not in.
- Could you call her, please?
Elham Saboktakin, please come down at the front desk.
- Doctor Kazemi is in.
- No, I need to talk to her.
Let me check her time card.
She's here, probably at the Emergency Room.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, but you have to wear a chador.
I wasn't aware. I haven't got one.
- It's required.
- What can I do?
- Do you have some ID?
- I don't have that either.
- Who are you looking for?
- Mrs. Saboktakin, from the ER.
Alright, take this.
But bring it back, please.
Thank you very much.
- Pari! Hello.
- Hello.
- How are you?
- Fine.
I'm so happy to see you're out.
- But it isn't over yet.
- Really?
Come on.
- How did you find me?
- Monir told me.
Congratulations.
- On what?
- On your marriage.
- Thank you.
- Who is he? A relative?
No. He's a doctor here.
- Which speciality?
- Ears, nose, and throat.
Come here.
- The doctor was looking for you.
- Thank you.
Have you heard from your parents lately?
Sit down.
I didn't go back to Anzali.
Just once, when he proposed to me.
To tell you the truth, l've been avoiding my family.
Are you happy?
Very.
He is a good man, from a good family.
I have a home, a life.
He has a daughter from his first marriage.
He's not so old, though.
His ex-wife didn't please him.
They were relatives, but she wasn't good for him.
He's invited me many times to visit his family in Lahore.
- He's from Pakistan.
- Really?
- But l've never been there.
- Why not?
What if they stop me at the border?
He knows nothing from my past.
I'm afraid he might find out.
You've changed so much.
What did you say?
- Yes?
- Elham.
I'm coming.
- Yes?
- Are you alone?
- Yes.
- You just arrived?
- Mahin wouldn't fall asleep.
- You were called.
I know, it was nothing.
Are you going home soon?
I'm just about finished.
- So Mahin didn't go to sleep?
- I managed to make her to.
- Don't be long, I need you.
- I'm coming.
Wait here.
- Listen, I need your help.
- What for?
I'm pregnant.
Pregnant?
- But you're not married.
- I need to have an abortion.
I tried other places, but had no luck.
- How old is the fetus?
- Almost 4 months.
Everybody wants the husband's permission or the ID and... you're in an advanced stage of pregnancy.
I told them my husband died.
Now they want his parents permission.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know where to go.
Wait here. I won't be long.
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
I'm looking for Mrs. Saboktakin.
- She's at the ER.
- No, she's with Dr. Kazemi.
Dr. Kazemi is at Unit 3.
Thank you.
- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't stay there.
You can't stay by this door.
- I was looking for you.
- Did my husband see you?
I wanted to see him and meet the source of your pride and happiness.
- You should've stayed there.
- I haven't got much time.
Go to the dressing room. I'II take a look and meet you there.
My daughter is dead!
My God, my daughter is dead!
Excuse me.
Mrs. Saboktakin, please.
- Call Mrs. Saboktakin.
- She's busy.
- It's urgent.
- She's busy.
She tried to commit suicide.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
But if she survives, there'II be a scandal in the family.
- How did that happen?
- We don't know yet.
- For what reason?
- How am I to know?
What am I going to do?
I don't know,
I don't know of anybody.
With so many doctors in here?!
Who would accept?
You know as well as I do...
The first pregnancy,
4 months already... without the father's permission and no document whatsoever!
- Who would accept?
- Your husband.
He's a doctor, he knows people.
How can I ask him?
What can I tell him about you?
What about the husband's permission?
What would I tell him?
- You never smoked before.
- Now I do.
You're in a hospital, you can't smoke in here.
I feel like it.
I couldn't smoke all day.
Sometimes I even chew tobacco.
- Your dinner is getting cold.
- I don't want to eat.
Take this, you might need it.
There's nothing I can do.
Where are you going?
I'II call you, if I work something out.
Never mind.
My husband knows nothing about my past.
Nor him, nor the hospital...
You made him curious.
He asked who you were.
I'm so sorry.
Do you remember you used to think I didn't like you?
Well, I never hated you.
Not even now.
But you've changed so much.
So much!
Come on, pick up the phone.
- Please, have you got any change?
- Here.
- Could you dial for me?
- Sure.
What's the number?
If a man answers the phone, call Zahra. If not, hand it to me.
- Who do I say I am?
- A friend.
- It's a child.
- Ask for Zahra.
I want to speak to Zahra.
Watch out for the patrols.
Hello.
How are you?
Your voice sounds strange.
Is your husband home?
You're the one who wanted that jerk.
Now you have to raise his children.
I miss you. Why don't you come and see me?
Are you alright?
Do you need any help?
I couldn't before.
- I'm on sentinel duty.
- I'm fine.
Can't you go out a little?
That's not good, Mom.
How are the kids?
Are they getting along with the others?
I don't know if l'II be on duty next Friday.
I promise.
If I can.
- Does this belong to your child?
- Thank you. See? We found it.
We'II put it in here so it won't fall out again.
Do you know of any hotel or boardinghouse around here?
- Right there.
- Thanks.
- Where is your Mom?
- I don't know.
- You don't know? Is this bag yours?
- Yes.
- Did you drop it? Where's your Mom?
- My Mom?
I don't know where she is.
- Where did she go?
- I don't know.
Did she leave you alone?
What did she tell you?
'I'II be back.'
- What did she tell you to do?
- To stay here.
To stay here and not leave?
Yes.
- Where did she go?
- I don't know.
I want my Mom. I'm scared.
I'II find your Mom.
Which way did she go?
Are you her Mom?
- No.
- I thought she was your daughter.
- You didn't see her Mom?
- No, just the child.
- But her Mom was here, I saw her.
- I was busy, I didn't see anything.
Don't cry, we're going to find your Mom.
This good lady is going to find her.
- I want my Mom.
- Take care of her, I won't be long.
Ma'am...
Do you have a cigarette?
Here.
- What about a light?
- No.
A good family will take her in.
She'II get sick with melancholy.
It'II take some time, but she will be fine.
She's so sweet, she'II be loved.
All children seem wonderful to their parents.
Stop that or l'II change my mind.
My heart is broken.
This is the third time l've tried to leave her.
I thought... l'd never have the courage to abandon her.
Some family will find her... and take her away.
A future awaits for her somewhere.
Then she'II be safe.
God knows how much l've suffered.
It's not easy.
No mother can abandon her child without regretting it.
Nobody has taken her in yet.
The social service will take care of her. She'II be better off.
How can you say that?
What about you?
Why didn't you check in the hotel?
I can be looking for something else.
Whether a boardinghouse or not... wherever you go, you'II need a passport, some ID... or a pass from the police.
Without a man, there's no place you can go.
Maybe. Now go and rescue your daughter.
How about a ride?
Come on, get in.
What's going on over there?
I'm in trouble!
Please, do something.
Tell them we're relatives.
Tell them we're married.
I'm Nayereh and my daughter's Neghar.
IDs. Good evening, Hajji.
How are you?
- Are you alright?
- Fine.
We've got a problem.
- What's the matter?
- They're not helping.
- See for yourself.
- Let me through.
It's not what you think, Hajji.
- Then why did you get in the car?
- Because you stopped.
That's no reason.
That was my first time.
Please, let me go. I have a daughter.
My daughter is all alone in the streets.
If I don't go, l'II lose her.
Everything was a big mistake.
It won't happen again.
Please, let me go.
Don't make things difficult.
The van is on the way.
I beg you.
Good evening, Hajji.
How are you?
His papers and insurance.
- Everything is okay.
- What's your relation to her?
She's just a passenger.
- What happened?
- Ask your men.
- Are you relatives?
- No.
- Did he force you to get in the car?
- No.
Then why did you?
Are you paying the bills, honey?
Throw this gum away and tidy up your scarf.
Please, Hajji.
I'm not like that.
She could be my daughter.
I was going home.
- Did you call home?
- Why?
Your family left a message.
Family pictures...
My employee's papers...
She could be my daughter.
Please, let me go.
She was alone in the street.
I pitied her.
I have no time for that!
I work hard all day and at night...
I try to earn a little extra with this piece of junk.
I need to feed my family.
Please, let me go.
Have you no shame?
If there were others,
I would've given them a ride too.
- Where were you coming from?
- The station.
And she was all alone!
Such a bad weather, there was no one else around.
Besides, it's not ilegal.
Put that camera away.
They're recording, Hajji.
- Are we on the tape?
- Yes.
It's just a wedding tape.
It won't be shown.
Let them go.
Thank you, Hajji.
Let's go, guys.
These are my wife and daughter.
It's not what you think.
She's just a passenger.
Give me my papers back.
Let me kiss your hand.
My papers, please.
I have to work tomorrow.
Think of my reputation.
- Go home and don't get in trouble.
- Sure, sure. Thank you.
Seen what you put me through?
To the van.
Move!
Where are you from, pal?
It doesn't matter.
And you?
- I'm from Rhoramshahr.
- And him?
- Abadan.
- Me too.
- Which area?
- Baham Shir.
Do you know Hassan Jashour?
- The soccer champion?
- Yes.
I do.
Do you know Khalou Hassan?
- Yes.
- Is he still alive?
I don't know.
He's got a beautiful voice.
Have you heard him singing?
Yes.
Can you sing like him?
Please, sing, l'm feeling sad.
- Shut up! Where do you think you are?
- Please, let him sing.
We're all feeling down.
Put this cigarette out.
You can't smoke here.
Sorry.
My friend is depressed.
- He asked me to sing.
- Sit down and remain seated.
- Want to light one up?
- I can't, l'm on duty.
The other soldier's asleep, and that guy is my friend.
The driver wants to smoke.
Come on, just one.
Then you can tell me if you liked it.
You're a nice fellow.
I like you.
- What brand is this?
- What's the difference? It's for free.
They're smooth.
Here, let me light it up.
You're nice.
What about you, boss?
- Here.
- Thanks, but I don't smoke.
Come on, try one.
The boss is smoking.
- Go have a seat.
- Alright.
- Take one for your friend.
- He doesn't smoke.
- Then light one up for me.
- Okay.
Here.
Thank you.
Get inside.
Go on!
Guard! Guard!
- My medicine. It's in my purse.
- Talk to the chief later.
Yes? Sorry, sir.
I didn't know who it was.
At your service. Yes, of course.
Sure, sure.
A moment.
Solmaz Gholami?
Is there a Solmaz Gholami in here?
- Is your name Solmaz Gholami?
- No.
No, sir. She's not here.
Yes.
I think she was transferred to Annex 5.
Yes.
Sure.
Anything else? Good-bye.

Hava... wake up, dear.
It's 10:30. You're late for school.
- I want Hava.
- Go away, now.
-Where is she?
- I don't know.
You should go and play with boys.
- I'm not leaving.
- Hava is now a woman.
She's no longer a girl.
It's your birthday, sweetie.
Come down.
I'm buying you a beautiful gift.
Come down, now.
- What?
- Come down, Grandma will tell you.
Why don't you tell me?
Come down first.
Come on.
What are you going to buy me?
Grandma will let you know.
I'm off now.
Why did your mother kick me out?
Wait a minute for me, please.
I'll get some money, then we can go together.
OK, but hurry up.
I really want an ice cream.
Don't go without me.
I want one, too.
Hava, come on down.
You're a woman now.
You can't go on the roof.
You can't play with boys any longer.
Listen to your gran. Come down.
Hava, get permission to come out.
It's too windy to be up there.
You'll fall.
How come she was allowed to play yesterday?
Mum, gran says
I'm a woman now. Am I?
Hasan, you can go in and play with Hava.
Mum, gran doesn't let me play.
You mustn't play with Hasan or any boy.
You're all grown up now.
You have to cover up your hair from now on.
Look, gran. I bought a veil for Hava.
Let me see.
May I go and play?
It's very pretty. Well done.
Hava, let's measure you up for your new veil.
Come here, sweetie.
Hava, come over here.
I need to measure you.
Mum, let me go play with Hasan.
Come here.
I've got to measure you.
Please, Mum. ice-cream is waiting.
Hava, just sneak out.
Come here, daughter.
Please, Mum, he'll go without me.
Let me measure your veil.
Let me cut the veil. You'll ruin it.
Good girl. Come over here.
Hava, go and get the needle.
- Mum, I'm begging you.
- Get the needle first.
- Is it good quality, Mum?
- Excellent quality.
- What do we need to do?
- We'll stitch it here.
Let's go.
Let's go, Hava.
Let's buy an ice-cream.
It's getting late.
Hava, where's the needle?
I couldn't find it.
Time for you to come inside, now.
Come inside.
Come inside.
Hava, I'll wait for you outside the mosque.
Don't forget, outside the mosque.
Come inside.
I won't.
Come inside.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, gran.
Hava, it's ready. Come over here.
Now, let's see... anyway, no-one goes out at noon.
Maybe we should let her go out for the last time.
I remember when she was born.
She was born at noon.
I asked if it was a boy or a girl.
They said, ''A girl!''
I already know all this.
I gave birth to her, after all.
You were distracted then.
But, gran, if I were born at noon,
I'm not a woman yet!
But it is noon.
No. it's still morning.
Let me play with Hasan until noon.
Please, gran.
Will you let me?
Go and check the time first.
Make sure it isn't noon yet.
- I'll go check.
- OK.
She never stays still.
Look, gran.
It's only... it's only eleven.
It's not noon yet.
I still have an hour. if I don't go,
Hasan will think I'm sulking.
Will you promise to be back by noon?
- I promise.
- God won't forgive you if you lie.
- Don't be late.
- I promise.
How will you know it's noon?
I'll take the clock with me.
Can I go now?
- You promise?
- Gran, a minute just went by.
- I'm losing time here.
-You've to be back by noon?
How will you know the time?
I'll take it with me.
Look, time is flying by.
I'll show you how to measure time.
Come over here. Sit down.
When the stick casts a shadow when the stick casts a shadow.!.. it means it's morning.
When there's no shadow you'll know it's noon.
Put this scarf on. God be with you.
When the stick casts a shadow it's morning.
When there's no shadow you'll know it's noon.
You have to be back at noon.
OK, dear?
Hey, kids...
Khaled...
Khaled, have you seen Hasan?
- Which Hasan?
- Hasan, the orphan.
His sister took him.
- Hello.
- Hello to you, too.
- Can you call Hasan?
- He has homework.
Please call him.
How come your gran always throws him out?
He can't come.
Hasan, don't come out until you've finished your homework.
Hasan, open up. It's me.
I'm over here, Hava.
- There you are.
- Hi. What are you up to?
- Come out and play.
- I have to do my homework. it'll be too late by then.
Can you not come out?
Teacher won't like it.
- How many exercises?
- Four.
Do you see this stick?
When its shadow is gone,
I have to be home.
Do you have to do your homework?
- Hava...
- Look, Hasan.
It's shadow is getting smaller.
When the shadow is gone,
I have to be back home.
Can't you give the homework a miss?
Teacher will spank me.
Not if I teach you a neat trick.
Bring your notebook.
It's a real nice trick.
Bring an eraser too.
See where he marked yesterday's homework?
Rub out his remarks.
Pretend this is all new stuff.
- He'll know.
- No, he won't.
Tell him you wrote it today.
OK, I'll rub it out later.
- Hasan, finish your work first.
- My sister is back.
- I'll wait here.
- No, you'd better leave.
Where should I wait for you?
- Wait for me at the seaside.
- Promise you'll come?
I promise.
Can you give me a hand?
What do you want me to do?
Come grab the other side.
Straighten this side up.
What's that?
This? It's a stick.
A stick? What's that?
This here... this is its shadow.
What does it mean?
When the shadow is gone,
I have to be home.
It's tiny now, but before it used to be this long.
Now it's really small.
Would... would a cloth this big be enough?
-Yes.
-Wait a second.
Hi. Do you want to sail with us?
- No.
-it'll be fun.
I'm waiting for Hasan.
Sure? We'll sail over there.
- Over there.
- I don't want to.
I'm waiting for Hasan.
I've got something to show you.
Won't you come?
No.
Leave my stick alone.
I have to be home when the shadow is gone.
We need you to rescue us... in case the sail... the sail comes unstuck.
Come, let's go.
Come, let's go.
Come, let's go.

Come, let's go. lt's so pretty. lt's so pretty.
Do you want it?
- It has such a pretty tail.
- It's cute.
How about a swap?
Your scarf for the toy.
Hasan, where are you?
Only this much is left of the shadow.
I have to be back soon.
I'm really angry with you.
All I wanted to do was say goodbye.
When I left home it was this long, now it's tiny.
Tiny. if you're not coming, say so.
I'll go and play with someone else.
Take this money and buy some ice-cream.
Hasan, hurry up. I'm late.
Hasan, get a move on.
Did you buy the ice-cream?
They'd run out.
I bought sweets instead.
Let's eat.
Hand it through the bars.
It's sour.
Let's eat it together.
Then I'll have to say goodbye.
Come out.
It's really sour.
Give me some of the lolly.
Do you want more?
Do you want some more?
Lollipop.
It's almost shadow less. Hurry.
Do you want some more?
Reach...
Hava...
It's the last one.
Hasan, the shadow's gone.
Goodbye.
Second tale:
Ahoo
Ahoo...
Ahoo...
Ahoo...
Ahoo...
Didn't I give you a final warning?
You're cycling again despite your bad leg?
Ahoo, didn't I warn you?
Ahoo... get down.
Stop riding now.
I'm talking to you.
Why are you cycling?
Don't you have husbands? if you don't get off, I'll sort you out right here and now.
- Won't you get down?
- No.
Ahoo, you'll regret this.
Ahoo, I brought Mullah Osman.
Ahoo, why have you become rebellious?
Have you had too much sun?
Get off that! What you're riding is not a bicycle. It's devil's work!
Get off that bike, dear.
You really shouldn't be riding it.
Have you told her the whole story?
Remember when your hand was asked for...
...with a handful of gifts?
Why do you want to ruin your life?
Come back to your life.
Neither God nor I approve of this.
You're at the edge of an abyss.
Get down off that bike, dear.
Your husband needs you. if she won't listen, end the marriage.
Do you agree to a divorce, dear?
Yes or no?
Yes... I concede.
Make it official.
Shall I recite the verse?
Shall I recite the verse?
Our marriage is annulled.
Her husband chased her on a horse...
Do you have any water?
Ahoo, stop! Get down!
Return to your life.
Ahoo, don't run away.
Hello.
Ahoo, your husband is a good man.
He still loves you.
Your old granddad is here to help.
Get off... get off that bike!
Ahoo...
I'll give you a count of 1.
Ahoo... one!
Two!
Three!
The devil's got into you!
Four!
Get off right now!
Five!
Six!
Last chance.
Seven!
Ahoo, dearest. We'll drag you off that thing if we have to.
Your brothers are on their way.
You've insulted our honour.
Your husband has divorced you.
What are we to do?
For God's sake, daughter. Return.
Shame on you. I curse you.
You didn't listen to your granddad
At least heed your father.
Fear your brothers.
Ahoo, return home now.
Third tale:
Hoora
Where to, madam?
To the market. I want to buy some things for the house.
Tell me exactly what you need, madam.
Then I'll take you to the right place.
Household goods, you know.
Household goods.
Top priority is a fridge which I've never had.
All my life I wanted cold water.
Now which one was it?
Ah, this one was the fridge.
Let's buy that first.
What's next on your shopping list? ironing board... bath tub... samavar...
Bedroom lamp shade...
Who are you buying all this for?
For myself.
I want to buy everything
I've never had.
Don't forget I also need a gas oven.
I tied a knot for the oven...
Ah, that's the one.
Which one was the washing machine?
For that we need the other market.
I've inherited some money.
Loads of money!
- How do you plan to carry all this?
- I'll manage.
Lord, why can't I remember this last one?
Do you know somewhere
I can lay out my things...
...to see what's missing?
My memory is not what it used to be.
I even forgot to feed the rooster before leaving home.
I hope it doesn't die.
I have a feeling
I'll never remember this one.
Bring the new pot here for a cup of tea. it'll be just what we need.
Right away.
I can hardly walk any more.
Madam, a refreshing cup of tea coming up.
Well done, son.
I'll find a match for the oven.
Tell the kids to gather everything in one place.
I've seen the large salt cellar...
...but not the little one.
Tell them to be careful with my make-up kit. It's important.
How come this tea-pot is so... naked? it has no shame! it has no shame.
It's not my fault.
After searching the entire market, you came up with a naked pot?
It's completely transparent.
They didn't have any other type.
I would be ashamed to use it.
Let's take it back.
Put it back in its box.
OK, let's go return them.
Hey, guys.
The old woman's gone.
She's gone.
I told you they wouldn't accept it.
To hell with them.
My own pot is better.
It's full of memories. if that lousy bastard had married me
I would have a son like you.
You remind me of him.
Since I have everything now, will you become my son?
Thanks, but I have a mother.
That's a pity.
Two things are bothering me.
First, the rooster
I left at home without food.
And the second thing is this...
We bought the rice-cooker and the cutlery...
...but I can't find the small flowerpots.
The old lady is here.
Put everything back.
Because the tide is low ships won't come any closer.
Some of the lads have small boats.
We'll carry your stuff to the ship.
I'm out of breath and my legs are killing me.
Put the kettle on, dear.
- And sort out my shopping, please.
- Leave everything to me.
We'll go fetch the boats and the floats...
Lads, let's fetch the boats and take her things to the ship.
Let's go.
One of you should stay behind.
- He should stay.
- Me? Me?
The one wearing an Afghan outfit.
The white one.
You stay behind and make a cup of tea.
What did I buy all this for?
I wish I had a son like you.
You're very sweet.
White and beautiful.
Will you let me adopt you?
I already have a mum and dad.
But I have so many things now.
Won't you reconsider?
Can't you choose one of the black kids?
But you're prettier. You have blond hair and white skin.
You're the one I want.
- Come back with me.
- Like I said, I have parents.
- Hello, madam.
- Hello.
What's the story with all these things?
Are they yours?
Yes, mine.
We were amazed to see all this stuff on the beach.
The kids are fetching boats to carry the stuff out there...
...to the ship.
At your age, what do need all this for? if it was all ours, we could get married and start a new life.
I have never owned any of these goods before.
Every single item has sentimental value for me.
When I was poor, no-one cared to help me out.
Take tea with me.
Lad. Put the kettle on, please.
- What are you doing here?
-We were cycling.
We were left behind.
Then you have time for tea.
The floats are here.
Load the stuff while we have tea.
As long as we leave before the tide gets any lower.
OK. What do you do again?
We were in a cycling race.
There was a girl there whose husband tried to stop her from cycling.
She disobeyed him.
A horseback preacher divorced her on the spot.
Her brothers, uncles and father all pleaded with her to stop.
Finally, her brothers carried the bicycle home on horseback.
Did you win the race?
No, but she borrowed a bike and continued the race.
- No, she was left behind.
- No, she finished the race.
- Left behind.
- She finished the race.
I came over to buy household goods.
I had tied a knot on every finger for various items.
I bought everything save this last one.
I can't remember this one...
...no matter how hard I try.
Make sure you tie them tightly!
Can you think of anything
I might have left out?
Let's have a look.
It's getting late. Let's go.
I have to leave now.
But you promised us tea. it was not destined.
Don't leave anything behind.
The last item was it a sewing machine?
No!
May be a rice-cooker?
Mirror and candelabra?
By the way, madam.
What was your name?
Hoora.

In the early '80s, a friend gave me... a record that complicated my life.
It got me hooked on Latin jazz.
In 1 995, for the final scene of my film, Two Much... some of my favorite musicians... played in Miami's Lincoln Road.
It was a highlight of my filmmaking career.
A magical night.
I was filming the miracle of music.
That's when I began dreaming... of a whole film about this most exciting form of music.
"CALLE 54"
"New Jersey"
Paquito D'Rivera was born with a sax.
Tito Rivera, his father, a classical saxophonist... ordered Paquito's first sax when he was only three.
Paquito became a child prodigy.
"The world's smallest sax player"
"Paquito D'Rivera"
I owe a great debt to Paquito.
There's no remedy for the blues like the sound of his sax.
A Paquito solo can brighten the darkest day.
Dad's best gift wasn't my sax but my mother.
Eliane Elias--
Latin jazz in all its elegance.
Born in Sao Paolo, she was the daughter of a classical pianist.
She began playing piano in her teens with Vinicius de Moraes... remaining with him until his death.
"Puerto de Santa Maria"
"(Cadiz, Espana)"
For years, there were many attempts to merge flamenco and jazz.
Most remained attempts, impressive as some were.
Chano Dominguez was the first
"bilingual"musician of the form.
His music produced a miracle-- a handshake between
Monk and Camaron.
"The Bronx"
"(New York)"
In the late '60s...
Puerto Ricans clashed with police.
It climaxed in an assault on a Bronx precinct house.
The quarter was dubbed
"Fort Apache. "
Hence the name of the group formed by the Gonzalez brothers...
Jerry and Andy.'
The Fort Apache Band.
Andy visits the old family home where he andJerry grew up.
Some of the big hits of the '70s were created here.
Here, tradition and the avant-garde, old and new, merged.
Dizzy Gillespie played with them when they were still kids.
The room under the stairs was Jerry and Andy's.
Jerry's back in his parents'homeland--
Puerto Rico.
"San Juan"
"(Puerto Rico)"
He's the poete maudit of Latin jazz, the last Caribbean pirate.
No one's ever seen him without his trumpet.
Yeah. And I wanna hear three clicks before the downbeat.
Let's do it! Okay.
"Betty Talks about Liz"
Michel Camilo is one of the top all-round musicians.
Whether it's jazz, classical,
Latin American music or film music...
Michel is in his element.
Every time I see him play...
I feel like I'm witnessing a miracle.
"New York"
Little horsey, how's it going?
Gato Barbieri was the revolutionary of Latin jazz.
Aproduct of May '68, he is one of the last survivors.
I was famous from the '7 0s up till '82.
It was a great time because things... were electric between music and filmmakers.
We formed one big family--
Glauber, Godard, Pasolini...
Antonio das Mortes.
It's impossible to live without Rossellini.
I stopped recording in '82... and I only started again in '96... because I saw music was like a toboggan... going downhill fast.
For years I lived in a cocoon... cut off from everything.
The mood wasn't like before, understand?
The cinema back then, the music back then... that's all changed now.
All I want is to play.
That's what makes me feel free.
It's cold out, but... it was a nice journey.
I wrote this piece... like it was for a movie.
First we're in Macchu Picchu, then we'll be in Bolivia.
I'm quiet as a lagoon bird... but sometimes I'm a puma.
This is my mother,
Ercilia Ortiz Puente.
Okay, let's get started.
This is the restaurant ofTito Puente.
At your service.
Let me show you a few of our murals... designed to help our young people... remember our music, our culture.
This is the king of Latin jazz, who wrote "Manteca"...
"Tin Tin Deo" and "Night in Tunisia"... and all those famous standards,
Dizzy Gillespie.
We're indebted to him for the growth of Latin jazz.
Here's one of my mentors,
Mr. Mario Bauza.
Mario is another pillar of Latin jazz... the author of standards like "Tanga."
Another mentor, the great Machito... who contributed to our music... and the spread of Latin American music here in the US.
Cal Tjader, the great vibes player of Latin jazz.
Also very famous.
Next to him is my brother,
Charlie Palmieri... a great veteran pianist.
He started the Duboney Orchestra... and conducted several recordings for me.
The great Miles Davis... the famous trumpeter who loved Latin music.
He'd hang out in Latin bars listening to congas and bongos.
This is Mongo Santamaria... a master of the conga for years.
Next to him is the great Cachao.
Double bass player.
He's still king of the bass.
Next to him is the great Chano Pozo, the composer of "Manteca"... and other standards with Dizzy Gillespie.
All these musicians are pillars of Latin jazz in this country.
I grew up with them.
Today, Tito has his place in the Latin jazz pantheon... alongside the fathers of the music of which he was the king.
"Tito Puente's"
"La Habana"
"(Cuba)"
I'm taking a walk. I haven't been here in years. It's changed.
How's it going?
When Chucho Valdes was a kid, his father, the great bebo... head of the Tropicana Orchestra, brought him to hear the stars here.
Bebo, my father, took me to the shows.
Everything playing at the Tropicana.
I think the Tropicana was an important stage... in the careers of Cuban musicians.
The best in Cuban music... and the best artists came through there.
I'm the sender.
I'm gonna treasure this shirt!
"New York"
Sundays, Chico O'Farrill, a Cuban of Irish stock... who came to New York in the late '40s... conducts his big band at the club.
This is it.
Birdland.
Chico started out playing trumpet... but turned to composing and arranging... for the bands of Machito, Count basie...
"Jazz Nightly"
Stan Kenton and benny Goodman.
Chico was the architect of Latin jazz which he launched worldwide.
As he says.'
"The big band is my instrument. "
"Birdland"
The next one we would like to play for you... the band recorded version... by "the Bird", Charlie Parker,
Flip Phillips, and Buddy Rich.
It's called "Afro Cuban Jazz Suite."
Alright!
"Stockholm"
"(Sverige)" bebo Valdes, Chucho's father... was bandleader at the Tropicana when he left Cuba in 1 960.
On a European tour, he fell in love with a Swede.
Abandoning everything, he retired to Stockholm with his new family.
He spent 20 years playing in hotel bars.
I fell madly in love with this woman.
And I still love her.
It's been 37 years.
I'm old now, but I look at her and it's still like the first day.
I invited bebo to play with Israel Lopez "Cachao"... a Cuban 20 days his junior and a friend for more than 60 years. both started playing in short pants... but this is their first recording together.
Go on, say "seven!"
Cachao, say "seven!"
Afro-Cuban music and Caribbean music... have the same roots.
These roots are in Africa.
When Monk played the piano, he'd suddenly jump up and dance.
He'd do steps that were signals to the percussionist... to hit harder-- and bang-- with the foot... like a rumba dancer.
I think the basic rhythm comes from Africa.
When he got up to dance, he was like a rumba dancer.
A genuine rumba dancer, really African!
Afro-Cuban music and jazz... are like cousins.
And their common grandfather is Africa. bebo Valdes had boasted of a granddaughter... who won an Italian prize for piano.
Like his other Cuban grandchildren, he'd never met her.
"Sony Music Studios"
Chucho Valdes hadn't seen his father in five years.
We met in New York. I invited them to do a dialogue with two pianos.
Hey, you're as fat as a toad!
Everything's fine, Dad.
Glad to be back here.
I feel washed out at dinner parties.
I could easily doze off.
I work for a big American firm.
I can tell that I've lost my fighting spirit.
HOW I KILLED MY FATHER
I'm worn out.
Your employers sense it too and it shakes your confidence.
Younger men are fighting for your place...
- How are your nights?
- Bad. I sleep poorly.
And then there's all the rest...
Sexually, I mean...
It's not my wife, it's life in general.
I have a son...
He's two now.
I've worked out that when he turns twenty,
I'll be an old man.
In other words,
I'll have no hold over him, no prestige in his eyes.
And so I'm unable to show him any affection.
I look on him... as a stranger.
Almost... as a threat.
That's one aspect of fatherhood.
I'll examine you now but I must explain that the key to your "profile", as we call it, are the lab tests.
They're costly but thorough.
They'll show your body's oxidation rate... the rate you're rusting at, if you like, and ageing.
This is a classic crisis.
We all go through it.
We don't all age equally.
Ready?
Got the champagne?
Don't worry, we've got twelve crates.
Isa!
DeaR SiR,
I RegRet to infoRm you ofyouR fatheR's passing. he died a month ago, unexpectedly, and so could not RetuRn to FRance as he'd intended...
Good evening.
- Wonderful party...
- Yes.
Is our host around?
I haven't seen him yet.
Doctors are always late...
His wife's here.
Where?
That blonde woman.
The elegant one.
Patrick...
- Is there enough?
- Eight more crates.
My friends...
May I have your attention, please?
I'd just like to say that I'm particularly happy to be awarding our town's order of merit, one of our oldest and most cherished traditions, to a man who has distinguished himself as a doctor of talent and innovation.
I won't introduce Jean-Luc Borde since this is his home...
Thank you. Thank you all.
I'm very touched.
I wanted to say that when I moved here, ten years ago now,
I was warned that Versailles was a cold, bourgeois place that would reject any newcomers.
That's what they said.
I looked around and saw otherwise.
I was like an orphan and you adopted me.
If you now feel that I've accomplished something, that's because one must love a place to succeed there.
And with your encouragement,
I shall try to press on and move forward in my field.
But not to make us a pack of breezy centenarians.
After all, we know life is a burden...
Thank you.
Thank you all.
And especially lsa, our hostess.
- How are you?
- Very well.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
Yes, it's me...
I simply followed the flow of people when I arrived.
- When did you get here?
- This afternoon.
I should have warned you but I decided to chance it.
The man of the moment...
Feted in your own home?
It's the usual thing here.
I spoke to a few people...
They seem relaxed, not at all mannered.
A little like you were just saying.
A very good speech.
It hit all the right notes.
If this is too much for you, tell me.
No, I don't think so.
I'll make myself scarce.
So soon?
You're such a rarity.
I thought you were dead.
Isa, this is... Maurice.
Are you Jean-Luc's father?
What's more, it shows!
He doesn't look like he ever won the jackpot.
No one makes suits like that now.
What's that cloth?
Terylene...
Right, I'm going.
When d'you need the car tomorrow?
At nine.
You do the glasses,
I'll see to the bottles.
Sorry, he refuses to come.
- I'll ask him.
- No, you mustn't.
Isa tells me your brother works for you. For long?
No, he had trouble at work, so...
Your father could stay here.
In the attic room.
No, I don't want to impose.
Do you think it's a good idea?
Yes, of course...
What about your things?
A small bag at the station.
Patrick can pick it up.
- He can do that.
- I'll go.
I can't say that I know a great deal about you.
He spared you the details.
Thank you.
- You have many paintings.
- You don't like them?
I can't judge. My awareness of art ends with Whistler's Mother.
You must be retired now.
Not quite, actually...
What did you do there?
I had a medical lab, with a pool of African doctors.
It did very well.
I felt I was doing useful work because the country had nothing like it.
But there was a series of violent political events...
That upset things a little.
Perhaps you heard?
I haven't really followed.
It must all seem so far away here.
Third world poverty, bamboo huts...
You realize they kicked him out.
- He didn't say that.
- Of course not.
- He's an old man now.
- He's sharp.
- He's funny.
- Funny?
Original.
Yes, I suppose he must be.
These pills confuse me.
Only the blue one is new.
It's to relax you.
Take one and a half before bed.
You slept better last night.
I woke up once but I read.
Why do you think he's here?
I don't know...
To piss me off.
He wants to make up with you.
I don't buy that.
Why not?
There are times in life when you have to.
Only if you're a father.
Are you angry with him?
No... Not that I'm aware of.
Or I've forgotten.
Last time I saw him,
I was a student in Tours.
He breezed through to say he was happy I'd chosen medicine.
Then nothing more...
The dark continent.
Perfectly well. Yes.
Yes, my bag is here.
Thank you for your welcome.
We met last night.
That's right. You have an appointment with Dr Borde?
No, not at all. I'm his father.
He is expecting you?
- He's very busy...
- I can imagine.
I wanted to see where he works.
Follow me, then.
How many rooms are there?
Ten.
It's a five-star hotel!
All this greenery...
Have you been with Jean-Luc long?
Almost three years.
So he trained you, in a way...
Physiotherapy...
The ladies are there now.
I couldn't harm them.
Where are you from?
- Lebanon?
- No.
Syria?
I studied here but was born in Damascus.
I know it, a wonderful place.
I was a conscript there during the French mandate.
Yes, we gave you a hard time too.
Do you plan to stay here?
I'd like to go back one day...
Yes, it's hard being between two worlds.
Your serotonin rate is still low.
I'll alter the treatment but the results are good.
Do you feel better?
Yes. I still have a few circulation problems.
- You still swim?
- Three times a week at the Ritz.
Good.
You mentioned botox injections.
Yes...
We'll start with the forehead.
We can work on the frown lines and prevent the muscular spasms.
Three or four sessions should do the job.
- You're here?
- I didn't want to bother you.
I've seen it all.
It's magnificent.
Can you see to Mrs Ziegler?
I'll go right away.
You do the tests here?
She said you keep a stock of growth hormones.
Forgive my ignorance but what do you do? lnject them?
I don't see any other way.
And that slows our inevitable decline...
Precisely.
Do you want to try?
No, I don't want to delay the call.
That's good, you have no anxiety or regrets...
This may surprise you but I no longer think of death.
In short, you cover the whole field.
- Do you run it all alone?
- No, I have partners.
It's doing well, almost too well.
Is the waiting-list long?
Fairly, yes.
Well, it isn't an emergency service.
Sure you won't have one?
You're an ascetic.
I'm impressed by your success.
Really?
It's not your style of medicine.
True, it's aimed at one level of society...
The rich need care.
They're human beings too.
Is that cynical enough?
We don't work miracles.
- You're in great shape.
- So-so.
The engine's faltering.
The usual things...
Basically, you're at a loose end.
You're drifting.
In a way. I spent a few days in eastern France.
I have a place there, going to ruin.
I don't remember.
Everyone there is dead or almost.
I soon left again.
I was born there but felt nothing.
- I don't believe in roots.
- You make your own.
It's wherever you end up feeling comfortable.
If you were happy in Africa...
Why am I here?
You said things had been a little hairy lately.
I spent a week in jail with nothing but cornmeal to eat.
Not much fun.
Charged with what?
I didn't kill,
I didn't steal.
As you may know, when those countries blow up, the army moves in, clans change and, even at my level, anything to do with the former regime is swept aside.
They seize your property and money.
You're reduced to nothing, stark naked...
That's life.
How old are you now?
Yes... in a few days.
You have a charming wife.
Very well-bred.
The best side of the bourgeoisie, as I imagine it.
That's an unknown land for me.
But no children?
You don't want any?
Did she say that?
No, good Lord, we've barely met.
I set you a bad example.
- I'll walk back.
- We can give you a lift.
No, don't upset your brother.
I'll walk, it's mild.
Good night.
Still not curious about your begetter?
He's like a plainclothes priest.
In any case,
I'm not a lot like him.
- Had a nice little dinner?
- Interesting.
- You talked?
- He did, mainly.
- Is he after money?
- No.
Does he feel any remorse?
Not his style...
He won't dandle me on his knee now.
But you knew him.
A little...
- The way he treated mum...
- She was no angel.
You're right there...
Let me say this, Solange...
First off,
I think you're a great girl.
I mean it! Everyone says you're too good for me.
The thing is...
I don't know how to tell you this...
I don't want to hurt you...
But... What?
Hold on...
You've met someone?
You're kidding, right?
Who?
The guy from the Sofitel?
The valet parker?
Where?
Senegal?
The old Tarzan spiel. At Club Med?
And you fell for it? It's a trap.
You're by the pool, bored as hell.
Some jerk brings you a drink...
How long has this been going on?
Six months?
What was I going to say?
Nothing, babe.
That I love you, that everything's cool...
Hold on, we can talk.
Solange, give me five minutes!
Give me one more chance.
Okay, then, get lost!
Piss off! Bitch!
Max, can I have my bottle?
Look who's here.
My brother, the doctor.
Evening, doctor.
Well, what did you think?
It's not bad...
- Did you write it?
- Yes, all on my own.
- Did you laugh?
- Yes.
When did you laugh?
I can't remember exactly but...
There's a "but". Tell me.
I need input,
I'm still working on it.
It seems pretty good to me.
The humour is...
But it went down well.
You never give anything away...
- I like your hair.
- Yeah?
Laetitia, Jean-Luc, my brother...
- Want a drink?
- Malibu.
Max, give us a Malibu.
She's not bad. I can set you up.
I have to be going.
God, you're so uptight!
I don't believe it...
Don't piss me off.
I came here for your sake.
- What time is it?
- Two.
I'd given up waiting for you.
I have a pain in my chest.
Want something to drink?
Here, have some water.
Hello, Maria.
Come in.
Everything okay?
I'm like a pig in clover.
The coffee's delicious.
Don't worry, I'm not going to move in for good.
Stay a day or two.
- Are you off to work?
- I'm late...
- Did you sleep here?
- Yes.
Here, I've brought you a tie.
Very smart...
I'm too scruffy for you?
No, but if you go out...
I know you haven't mentioned anything but I assume you're hard up.
It's none of my business how you ended up like this...
You have a pension?
You didn't contribute?
I was careless.
You're broke?
So, you expect me to...
What?
Help you out.
After all, why not?
I can give you a decent monthly allowance.
I don't feel obliged, not at all, but it seems natural since I can afford it.
There, I've said it.
Think about it.
I heard you.
Thank you.
Why didn't you speak to Dufour?
- He disgusts me.
- He's a lawyer.
So let him plead...
Can't you see them for lunch?
- You drank too much.
- Two glasses. I was bored.
- I bet I won't sleep...
- You've already decided...
I'm sorry.
Men find you so attractive...
That Swiss guy was staring at you.
Which one?
The young, good-looking one with the longish hair.
Yes, perhaps...
Funny, some guys have sex written all over their faces.
I wasn't bored.
Good. You talked a lot.
That's true,
I tried to keep it lively.
Is that him?
At this time of night?
Surely he wasn't with a hooker?
I think that if I'd met him by chance
I'd have fallen for his charm.
There, you see.
But have you seen his eyes?
When he's silent, they're pure ice.
He judges you calmly, down to the bone.
Isa...
Are you ill?
No, but I'm very hot...
It's stifling here.
I'll get up now.
Have you taken something?
A drop of scotch...
I mixed it with a sleeping pill.
- What pill?
- I don't know.
A green one, a capsule.
That feels good.
Thank you.
Your pyjamas are funny.
Should I call Jean-Luc?
No, he'd be furious.
I'll stay here a little longer.
Does this happen often?
Often, no...
Don't mix things... you don't know where it may lead.
Yes, doctor.
- Do you feel better?
- Yes.
Take my hand.
Your hand is cool.
FoR a fling with you, theRe's nothing I wouldn't do
FoR a fling with you
I pRomise I won't be late ifyou fix me a date
FoR a fling with you
FoR a quick spin
As dawn peeks in,
BefoRe the night has fled
FoR a quick spin
As dawn peeks in, nestled in youR bed
I'd give it all away, neveR mind what people say foR a fling with you
I could damn myselflike this, foR a single stolen kiss...
You've missed so many of his birthdays.
I'm making up for lost time.
This was Patrick's idea.
I've never seen Jean-Luc like this.
Are you listening?
See that guy...
The old guy on his own, by the toilet door...
That's my father.
What's he doing here?
I didn't invite him.
- How old were you when he left?
- Search me.
Four.
- I think he's pretty classy.
- Yeah...
He looks better with that tie.
You're acting as if I'm making demands.
You're not but I'm tied up until September.
I may be gone by then.
What do you mean?
Great song. I didn't know it.
You and your brother get on well.
Why wouldn't we?
I'm glad you can let yourself go occasionally.
Yes, it happens every ten years or so.
I'm not an adventurer like you.
My father's the last colonial doctor.
Want a drink?
Yes, vodka.
- I butted in.
- Not at all.
It's amusing to see you together.
We don't know how to talk.
We advance, retreat, avoid each other...
Oh yes, we talk about money.
We're both clumsy.
Don't take it badly but I'm stunned by your success.
As a child, he was a bundle of nerves, a bit dyslexic...
- He had long bouts of inertia...
- What a memory!
And have these fits of rage.
Our parents see us as kids.
That's their problem.
Everyone changes.
You're above all human emotions now.
But I remember a man who stood up at dinner and said
"l'm going to blow my brains out."
That's true.
It did happen once.
Okay?
You're new. D'you live around here?
No.
Coming with me?
Strange, all these pictures...
You like them? I did them.
- Where did you learn?
- At my gran's.
She had a little perfume shop.
I used to help her out.
I'd see the women's faces and felt like drawing them.
I picked up a pencil to pass the time.
People liked them so I kept it up.
Colours are important for me, see.
Reds, ochres, blues...
Blue, a little like your eyes.
I want to kiss you.
I need to stop at that shop.
I'll only be five minutes.
You wonder why we're here.
A little.
She insisted.
You get on well.
Yes, she's very kind to me.
She has her good side.
Poor little rich girl...
I can't justify myself to you.
There are things you don't know and that I won't explain.
We don't know each other.
What did you do before?
Nothing much use.
That's why I'm here.
I've done a bit of acting.
You have the looks...
I worked on markets, flogging US army surplus.
- That sells well.
- Sort of.
I got screwed but it was my fault.
So Jean-Luc took you on...
It's not killing me. It's cushy.
I come and go, I park... I wait...
Is your brother kind to you?
He's kind, yes...
He's made a big success of his life but...
It hasn't made him human.
It'd be wrong to criticise him.
I was a Catholic as a child, a scout, very pious...
I wept on the day of my first communion.
From 20 to 24, I was a Communist, at the end of the war.
Then I seemed to lose every form of ideal in my life...
But I'm not saying
I have no beliefs.
Hello, lsa.
Hello, Cyril.
My father-in-law.
Maurice Borde...
We'll be in touch. You look great.
He has very impressive hair.
Almost leonine.
Is he one of your suitors?
No, he's sweet but a bit of an idiot.
I have no suitors.
- Never?
- No.
Well, just once, but I ran a mile...
I suppose I'm the faithful type.
If the feeling's shared...
I don't know and I don't want to know.
That girl you saw, his assistant... there was something.
Something very banal but I'm sure it's over.
We know each other by heart.
I know what he's about to say.
He's so different from the people I knew.
And intelligent too.
That's true.
I know I've been lucky.
He certainly has been.
Even if I'm sorry we have no children.
It's a choice...
No, I really wanted children.
More than anything.
I think Jean-Luc feels the same but it's dangerous for me, so...
Were you advised not to?
Jean-Luc's been my only doctor for years.
Sometimes, a second opinion can help.
I feel so jealous at times, in the street, in parks, when I see all those blissfully pregnant women or others with strollers...
I don't like feeling that way.
Myriem... You're not there?
You must be out with your son.
It's Sunday.
I'm upstaiRs.
I have to go andjoin the otheRs.
My paRents-in-law aRe an ad foR sixty-yeaR-olds.
They'Re not my patients, maybe that's why.
My bRotheR with his cuRRent "paRtneR". he's doing some gReat dives into the pool.
And my fatheR...
Yes, he's still in occupation. he's stuck heRe like glue. he's smiling and Relaxed, chatting to my wife and bRotheR.
It looks so idyllic.
It's all a pathetic sham.
- Okay?
- Fine.
- You're not swimming?
- No.
I don't like my body.
You're pretty slim.
You were chubby as a child.
I was downright fat.
You wouldn't do any sports.
Patrick!
Let me take a photo of you three.
It's more peaceful here.
Playing happy families soon tires me.
You agree it's meaningless.
Are you being evasive or do you think I'm a fool?
Don't you have the perfect reply?
I'm listening.
You haven't responded to my offer.
I thought you'd given me a few days.
Perhaps you felt insulted.
I'm sorry.
What does a stranger expect?
I thought you didn't want to talk about it.
It suits you to think that.
Probably.
But, deep down, it is interesting.
How do you cancel it all out in one go?
You become someone else.
That's ambitious.
I thought my life was mapped out, in a long, straight line.
Times were different then.
Then it all came to a halt overnight.
I'd finished with the day's patients.
It was a Thursday.
I went into St Antoine's Church.
The organist was playing.
The one you liked.
Remember him?
Vaguely. His daughter wore braces.
I went to a bar, I had a drink...
An aperitif...
And I stayed there for at least an hour.
I felt incapable of going home.
The last train to Paris was leaving and I took it.
I went to a small hotel near Denfert-Rochereau.
There was a travel agency nearby with catalogues to go anywhere...
Asia, Africa... New countries waiting to be developed.
I could have gone anywhere.
I couldn't resist.
I had to leave.
It was a matter of survival.
What was so unbearable?
Not other people.
It wasn't your mother.
She was beyond reproach.
But I was a changed man.
I no longer recognized myself.
You mean no one was stopping you.
Oh, I thought about returning.
But the idea of standing before you...
I'd never have found the words.
I was caught up in another system.
There's no changing it now.
Does it work?
Do you end up forgetting?
The trouble is, you do.
On the highest bRanch,
A nightingale sings
Sing, nightingale, sing
You whose heaRt is so light...
I have loved you foR so long
I'll neveR foRget you.
His father came through with a present.
About time...
Wait, there's some wine.
I love the way you said,
"There's some wine."
Really?
As if nothing else existed.
That must be where the truth lies.
I've heard about an apartment we could visit.
If you like.
What have you done with your father?
I don't follow his every move.
He's had a depressing life.
He's touched you.
He's a case.
He's like you, I suppose.
Make the most of it while he's here.
You'll regret it when it's too late.
I think my strongest memory with dad...
It's odd saying "dad"...
I feel like I'm speaking Russian.
If I said "popov", it would mean as much to me.
I think my strongest memory with "popov" was the day he forgot me at the supermarket checkout.
I spent the afternoon with Teddy.
Teddy had been forgotten too.
When his mum fetched him, she kept saying, "Naughty mummy."
And Teddy just kept wagging his tail and licking her face.
Dad didn't fetch me. No.
He had a business meeting that lasted ten years.
It was on the 200th floor.
The lift broke down,
Dad was trapped up there in the clouds.
He could only pee or call my brother who kept me posted.
My brother has a direct link to dad, see.
Since he was born, they've had at least three weeks together.
A lifetime compared to my twelve hours...
Well, twelve... counting the six spent waiting at the supermarket, of course!
- Drink?
- No thanks.
I've finished.
They thought I was a customer.
I must look the part.
- Do you come here often?
- Yes.
You're beautiful like that, without make-up.
I don't know what time it is.
We can walk a little longer.
You're expected at home...
I don't think so.
I want to stay with you.
You have nothing to say?
It's very cruel of you.
You're together?
Where were you? At your thing?
- Yes.
- Until this late?
The meeting ran on and on.
I'm going up.
Good-night, Maurice.
There was a call for you.
From Africa.
Jean-Toussaint something...
Ah, yes... I'll call him back.
Who is he?
A friend, a doctor.
A remarkable fellow.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
You seem remote.
Why tonight, not yesterday or tomorrow or in three weeks?
What do you mean?
We don't have to do it for the sake of it.
What's got into you?
It's what I feel. I'm not angry.
I'd rather you were.
You think so?
You're miles away.
No, I promise I'm not.
If you know better, tell me.
I don't know anything.
I'm trying to understand.
Perhaps you're hiding things.
What would I be hiding?
We had it because you decided.
It seemed unreal to me.
Don't make a fuss about it.
What are you up to with him?
I enjoy talking with him.
About what? What can he tell you?
That he won a Nobel Prize?
That's a stupid thing to say.
Are you flirting with him?
You turn him on?
- You're not choosy.
- You're insane.
Can't you sleep?
You can't either.
I want a glass of water.
I have some here.
Did you have women out in the bush?
I wasn't a monk.
Professionals mainly.
Right. Whores are handy.
No strings attached.
As you say.
Never more than that?
My head may have spun occasionally but the union of two bodies, the fiery ecstasy of love...
I've never known it.
Put my mind at ease...
It's not hereditary, is it?
No, who said it was?
- No one.
- Look at Patrick...
You can tell he's hot-blooded...
But it's no crime to be of a more placid disposition.
It's just a small part of ourselves.
An appendage.
We're not even sure it belongs to us.
- I'm exaggerating.
- No, it's true.
The truth is, 90% of the time, we fuck alone.
Your view's darker than mine.
Maybe...
But you're past all that now.
Old age must be a relief.
Once, I remember, he turned up dressed all in blue.
And I politely led him to the electricity meter.
Later, I learned to read the signs, of course.
My brother helped me.
"A man in a cap is the postman, a fat man's the neighbour,
"if he's selling calendars, slam the door on his fingers."
My brother's got flair.
Always one step ahead.
At three, he was top of the class, at five he was dissecting frogs...
What marked me most of all was that at the meter, dad smiled at me.
I felt comfortable and I said,
"Mum told me where the gas meter is but I forget now."
Looking back,
I think that's the longest sentence
I ever said to him.
Come in.
He threw a fit last night.
We got back too late.
So?
What is he thinking of?
You told him it was nonsense?
I've thought about what you said.
I'm looking for my test results.
Would you check them?
If you like.
- I wondered if you were up.
- That colour suits you.
Thank you.
Don't let me disturb you.
Come in, we've nothing to hide.
I've been on this treatment a year.
I expected better results.
With your background, the results are good for a man of your age.
You told me to walk.
Well, it exhausts me.
You expect to gambol like a lamb?
You can't dance the night away.
What's wrong with you?
How many to go?
Four more appointments.
All this could end overnight.
Just a minute.
Can you undress?
Don't gawp at me.
I only asked you to undress.
I'd like to see you naked.
You have a beautiful body.
Solange... Give me five minutes.
Okay, go ahead, get lost!
Piss off! Bitch!
There you are...
I was telling Laetitia I enjoyed it.
Really? I'm not too useless?
It's lively, it's funny...
It's full of truth.
It doesn't seem your style.
Why?
Because you seem a bit... a bit old-fashioned.
You see the type of career
I could have had.
Care for a drink?
Can you get us two glasses of champagne, honey?
She seems very fond of you.
I'm about to screw up...
She wants to pull out all the stops, white wedding, the works...
Bravo.
She has a friend setting up a video business down south.
I'm thinking about it. I don't know if I can do that to Jean-Luc.
Does he need you?
He's a crap driver.
He has his wife, his chauffeur, his handmaiden...
Everyone has a part to play.
Hats off to him. His pills and hormones are a gold-mine.
You're pretty scathing...
You know, the years soon pass.
Don't get bogged down in messy situations.
If you have a real opportunity, don't hesitate.
Take it.
This is Jean-Toussaint Diallo.
I took the liberty of inviting him round.
He's spending a few days in Paris.
He's here to contact relief organizations.
It won't be easy.
We're not always welcome.
They tend to be generous.
It's fashionable, fortunately.
- Did you meet there?
- I've known him since he was 16!
Your father was my mentor.
He changed my life. He persuaded my parents to let me study.
He encouraged me, he was always there.
- Where did you study?
- Montpellier and Czechoslovakia.
I know you're a doctor but what's your field?
Gerontology.
An ugly word but Europe is old.
We miss Maurice.
He's very popular, everyone knows him.
I hope he'll come back soon.
You knew he was coming?
He had mentioned it.
He said things are much quieter there now.
That's good.
People are even going back.
You mean you want to?
I didn't expect to but it's possible.
I'd get the lab back, with a new team.
They just need you?
No, of course not... We'll have to get things running again.
- Just as you left it?
- Not quite.
No strings attached?
A few debts to settle.
How much?
I can't say exactly. At the most...
500,000 francs.
That's quite a sum...
That's for sure.
Hi.
- Give us five minutes.
- What time's your...
Please!
It would be a loan, all signed and official...
I can draw up a repayment schedule.
- Three years at the most.
- You're joking.
I couldn't possibly accept otherwise.
What's the link with Diallo?
He turns up just after you...
There's no link.
He has nothing to gain.
He's just an intermediary.
You were undesirable but you can go back if you pay!
You... I mean, if I pay!
What's to say they won't rob you and throw you back in jail?
You're mistaken. I have guarantees.
Diallo is...
I know, a "remarkable fellow".
He loves you like a son.
How touching.
But I don't see why I should trust him!
Why?
Because he's African?
Please, don't give me that...
Sorry...
I was being absurd.
It's not the money.
I could get it for you.
But why go back to those warlords, civil wars and the heat?
You want to fall ill so I can fetch you?
You can't start anew at 75.
It's irresponsible and immoral!
You follow nature's cycles.
You step down, you tend to your roses!
I don't have any roses.
Fleeing's a mania with you.
What do you want to do?
Take the last train?
Go back into exile like an eccentric?
With that same clean conscience?
Who'll fall for that?
It's chronic abandonment.
Can't anyone rely on you?
Such as who?
Nobody needs me here.
All right then... if you feel as free as a bird...
But I won't help you like this.
I won't drag you down deeper.
True, we don't know each other.
I've seen you for... two minutes in the car... fifteen at the cabaret... a bit longer at the pool.
But at the pool... the others were there too.
I wasn't alone.
What more can I tell you?
I've done things all these years...
I've drunk...
I've eaten...
I've slept...
Inevitably, I've slept.
Maybe I've only slept?
Can we go?
- It ran on and on.
- No sweat.
Had a wild old time?
Shit...
- What now?
- What d'you suggest?
Didn't you see him?
He was in the middle of the road!
Try driving slower...
Nice work.
So change it!
At 55,000 miles, it's junk.
- You've been drinking.
- Yes, I have!
Look, we're all okay...
- I thought you could drive!
- No, I can't even do that!
You want to fire me? Go ahead.
Do me a favour!
- We'll talk when you sober up.
- Fuck!
I wait for hours at your fucking fundraiser!
- Calm down.
- It's your job.
Don't.
I'd belt you but you can't fight back.
It had to end like this.
He'll forget by tomorrow.
A Renault Dauphine.
We had one when I was little.
What do you think?
It's big, it's nice and quiet...
Why do you want me to live here?
It's better for you and your son.
I'm fine where I am.
I won't have you keeping me.
I was mistaken.
You won't change, Jean-Luc.
It's our last day then?
Are you sure?
Where will you go?
I'll land up somewhere.
I'll let you know.
I looked carefully at your test results.
It's not my speciality.
As I said before, you should get a second opinion.
But, quite frankly,
I see nothing to stop you from having a child.
I don't understand.
Mistakes can happen.
How could he be that wrong?
- Fear...
- Fear of what?
I won't sing the praises of fatherhood.
But there are many ways of avoiding it.
That's a horrible thing to say!
What's all this? Hot air?
A hoax that you flog?
You have to be a pretty bad doctor.
A charlatan.
- Who did you see?
- A specialist.
That's all? Nothing to say?
I say you're useless and you don't react?
We did try.
I stopped us from going further.
- I don't understand.
- It was to protect us.
What do you mean?
Deep down, I couldn't...
It was like a threat...
Explain.
I think it scared me, physically.
Looking after a child, raising it...
Worrying, punishing...
I'm not suited for that.
- You should have said.
- You'd have left.
You don't know!
Well, I thought so.
Because I need you.
That's cheap talk!
How else can I say it?
You call that love?
What you've done is worse than lying.
You've robbed me. Mutilated me!
Don't touch me!
You shrivelled, little man!
Your words are empty and hollow.
What are we? Business partners?
A sort of showcase?
There I was, a dumb bitch, greeting, opening doors, smiling, arranging flowers...
All that's nothing. It's empty!
To hell with it.
Have you eaten?
Did you raise your funds?
I have a few promises.
That's good.
I was just going.
I'll see you out.
You're still hanging around?
I was waiting for you.
I have to pay you to get rid of you?
Run, run, go after him!
So, you have some scruples?
Idiot.
Off to pack your knapsack and sneak away?
You can't fuck her so you get your kicks another way?
- She'll be back.
- She said so?
You're all she has.
Why do this to me?
- I wasn't thinking of you.
- You never have.
Why would l?
Because it's natural?
I'm not obliged to love you.
It's hell being your son.
You've ruined everything since you conceived me... with your ice-cold cum.
How can you look at yourself?
Aren't you ashamed you're not dead?
How dare you, you prick!
Jean-Luc...
Open the door...
Open it...
Please...
Please, let me in.
Listen to me...
My whole life has slipped away... without me grasping anything.
I haven't touched things.
I've learned nothing.
I don't want you to end up like me.
Forget me.
I didn't make you, you made yourself.
And you'll carry on doing it.
That's all you need to know.
It's up to you.
Let me in.
Don't turn me away.
Open the door.
Don't leave me in this hole.
What can I possibly say?
What's between us will always be there.
Alive or dead.
Is that why you came?
Who knows why we do things?
You look like you did when we went to Spain in the Dauphine...
You'd lost your wallet, with all your documents, all your money...
We were at the roadside... and you kept saying,
"We're done for...
We're done for..."
I was there... and I didn't know what to do.

Ripped by:|MARIUS POP - marioland@email.ro
l"ll come back after the holiday.
You"d better.
That"s my girl.
The King of Hell pulls out liars" tongues. l"ll remember that!
Ready, lift!
Some priest.
Making promises he won"t keep.
Welcome.
Evening.
Where"s the Missus?
She"s not here. She"s gone to a spa.
She was ill, with what we don"t know.
That"s too bad.
This is for all of you.
Thank you.
So how"s O-Shin been?
She started back today.
That"s good.
That"s a load off everyone"s mind.
But the more I think about it, the madder I get.
Some samurai he was.
Don"t say that. Think about it.
The problem was that all of you got so excited.
He was just a kid.
Shall I bring some tea?
No. l"m going.
At least tell me your name.
Ryosuke.
Here. l"m so glad you"re better, O-Shin. l"m sorry for all the trouble I caused.
You don"t have to apologize.
Damn him!
You never quit, do you?
At least I start.
If you"ve got something to say, why not say it?
All that "born a samurai" talk.
What?
What I mean is, if you were raised a samurai... you should have seen through him.
An old samurai family... of retainers to the Shogun?
Don"t make me laugh.
What does that have to do with this?
Or with you?
No matter how far they may have fallen... someone born a samurai walks and talks like one.
You can tell just by the way you bow.
You don"t know how, do you?
Miss O-Shin, you have a customer. l"m glad to see you.
I thought you wouldn"t come back.
Listen to the waves.
It"s high tide.
It makes everything really damp.
You shouldn"t be carrying this.
We get inspected, you know. l"ll put it away.
Got any sake?
Of course.
Bring some.
You don"t talk much, do you?
Tell me about yourself.
Tell me about yourself.
Who are you?
Me? l"m the lowest of the low.
So when you were five, your mother died.
Then what?
What can a kid of that age do... but beg?
The winters were cold... 
but it's warm if you sleep with a dog. 
I slept with a great big one. 
That dog followed me everywhere... 
like he was protecting me. 
Everything I was given I shared with him. 
Stop it.
No more.
But my real bad luck hadn"t even begun yet.
When I was six, an old town watchman picked me up... and got me work in a drinking place in Akasaka.
I stayed there till I was 18, but he cheated me out of... the money I was supposed to get.
Then I was hired by the owner of the Matsukawa restaurant.
He said we"d decide on my pay once l"d learned to cook.
That was lucky.
No, it wasn"t.
I worked like a slave for five years, then I asked him to let me cook.
"A fool like you will never have a decent trade," he said.
The next day...
my stuff was out in the street.  l"m a fool. L"m stupid.
That"s why I get the short straw.
I bought that knife because I want to do something crazy.
In that case, l"m not giving it back to you.
Give me a damn drink!
If you"re hard up... you shouldn"t be coming here, you know. l"ve got money.
The next day I went back and showed the guy my knife... and he gave me some.
Not five years" pay, though.
You didn"t.
But that makes you no better than a thief.
That old man was the thief.
So... will you think again about moving in with me?
You deserve better... than a woman like me.
No, no.
You"re a fine woman.
You"ve suffered enough.
It"s time you took things easy.
Well? Will you live with me?
Here come the others.
Who"s that man walking with O-Shin?
She"s in love again.
With him?
Yes.
I see.
Yes, you can see that from here.
I keep telling her that people with bad luck...
I keep telling her that people with bad luck... will only make her unlucky, too.
But she"s always so nice to them.
She"s got a good heart.
She just shouldn"t keep giving it away.
Misfortune added to misfortune only doubles the misery.
So what will you do?
There"s no real work for a man with no craft.
My whole life has been one... of being cheated and trampled on.
Now it"s my turn.
Can you understand that?
Yes. l"ve got no future in this world. l"ll take back what"s mine, then bid life goodbye.
I know exactly how you feel.
That"s exactly how my elder brother must have felt.
Your brother?
Yes.
Let"s not talk about this anymore. l"ll bring more sake.
What"s this brother of yours doing now?
He died last year.
Died?
He jumped in the river.
Why?
He worked for years as a wood-carver, but he wasn"t going anywhere.
He"d get frustrated and angry.
My father"d taken a stroke, and he wasn"t going to get any better.
My brother had no hope. l"m sure he thought he was a burden to me.
I know how it feels to be driven into a corner like that.
But that just made a waste of everything you"d gone through.
I don"t think that.
I do.
There must have been something else he could do.
He could have made sandals, or glued paper bags or something.
That was selfish.
Ryosuke... do you really think that?
If you think someone could live... making sandals or gluing bags... then l"ll say the same to you.
If my brother should have lived, then so should you.
Isn"t that right?
You don"t have parents to burden you... you"re young, you"re healthy.
You could do anything you wanted.
Let"s think about this together. l"ve got money if you need some.
My father and my brother are dead.
I can give it to you.
Don"t be stupid.
Didn"t you say my brother had made... a waste of all my trouble?
You won"t waste it, will you?
Say you"ll think about it.
Please.
I beg of you.
O-Shin.
600 mon, 400...
I wouldn"t.
He"ll only bring you grief.
That sort of thing just ends up with the guy turning into a pimp.
The Missus wouldn"t lend you money for that.
Do your work here, and think of yourself.
What l"m saying is... that women are always falling for that line... and taking on burdens. l"m sure right now you"d walk through fire for that man... but that won"t last.
It"s over in a moment.
O-Shin.
But for him, it"s now that matters.
It"s this moment.
It"s whether he turns into that side street or not.
Whether he lives or dies.
I just want to keep him going straight ahead.
That"s all. l"m leaving.
Already? l"ve got business at the lumber market tomorrow. l"ll come after that.
What is it?
You"re sure?
I am.
Hey, Gonta.
Hey, Gonta.
Later, later. l"ll drop by on my way home. l"m coming in!
Bring sake!
Where"s Brother Bunji?
Sorry. Very sorry.
Down there on the right, you fool.
Bunji! L"m coming in!
This is no night to drink alone.
Let"s make some noise.
Come in here, then.
O-Kichi has a shamisen.
You"re right!
You sure dampened down their party.
Well, l"m a fireman, aren"t I?
Play your shamisen.
Where is it this time?
Hachioji.
Well, l"m not going.
I certainly hope you haven"t signed a contract with them.
That"s for moving expenses. Take it.
Of all the...
It"s a great place.
It"s a busy post town on the highway into Edo.
And l"ll... buy out your contract there before winter comes.
You won"t catch me dead there!
Is this what I get for letting you feed off me all these years? l"m through with listening to the likes of you!
What?
You"re very bold all of a sudden.
Don"t tell me... you and that old man... l"m free to make any promises I want.
Don"t push me... you bitch!
Hey, l"m sorry, l"m sorry. l"m sorry, l"m telling you.
Forgive me.
Don"t. No!
Stop it.
Stop it!
You won"t listen to me, huh?
You? Move in with that geezer?
Don"t make me laugh.
You try something like that and he"ll get hurt.
Miss Kikuno, are you all right?
That beast.
You hate to see a thing like that.
It gets you down.
"The wind howls, the rain pelts down."
The bridge could wash out.
Let"s go.
Here.
That won"t do any good! l"ll never get home in this.
You must be hungry.
Come and have lunch with us.
All right, I will.
They"re leaving across the way. l"ll go see how high the river is.
Don"t. You never know what"ll come blowing along in this wind.
It"s stopped.
See? That"s the end of that storm.
Get out!
The bridges at Kuroebashi and Hachimanbashi are washed out!
What are you doing?
It"ll flood!
The crest"s coming downstream right now!
And it"s flood tide, too! lt"ll come in from the sea as well!
Hey!
What"s happening?
We have to go.
The house was left in my care.
Don"t be a fool! Hurry!
Take me with you.
Wait.
Go.
We"d better go.
You take O-Shin and get out of here.
You, too.
You"ve done all you could. Get your things.
Miss!
Only take what you"ll need!
O-Shin!
Come with me and let"s get out of here.
Is that the Missus"?
Huh? Oh, this?
We can"t leave her money-box.
We"ll take it for her.
Give it to me.
It"s heavy. L"ll carry it.
Quick! There"s no time to waste! l"m not going with you.
What? l"m going with them. Give me that.
What are you talking about?
I came all the way here to help you!
Give it to me! l"m in charge of this house!
You"re coming with me!
I am not!
Hold it!
What do you want?
Miss Kikuno wants you to give her that money-box.
The hell I will!
You think that coward"ll get you out of here?
Don"t!
Stop!
No!
Ryosuke!
Ryosuke!
It"s over.
I took care of him.
I can"t stomach a man like that!
What are you talking about?
Where are you going to go now?
To the magistrate.
Ryosuke!
No!
Run for it!
Are you going to throw away your life over a man like that?
Get out of here!
Go to Osaka!
Come back when things cool down. l"ll look after O-Shin till then.
Go! Quickly! l"ll wait for you. l"m counting on you, miss!
It looks like... we missed our chance to get out of here. l"m sorry, O-Shin.
Don"t be silly. l"m fine here with you.
But it"s a weird feeling, isn"t it?
Everything"s so quiet.
The river crest"s gone by.
Now the sea"s going to rise bit by bit.
Where are you going?
It"s almost dark. L"ll find some candles.
Good Evening
It"s just a wall giving way.
It"s nothing.
What are you doing?
What is it?
If worst comes to worst, we go out that skylight... onto the roof.
It looks like it"s stopped rising.
It"s not coming up so fast, but it"s still coming up.
O-Shin, which is your best kimono? l"ll wear this one.
You"d better put on your best one, too.
We"re going to die, aren"t we?
Don"t be silly!
But that"s what they dress you in for your funeral.
Not on your life!
The water"s going to ruin our clothes, so we should wear our best ones!
Now stop whimpering.
You"ve got to wait for Ryosuke... so get busy!
We"re not going to let ourselves die here.
Look... the Milky Way.
"It is a rough sea...
"reaching to Sado Island.
"Look! The Milky Way."
I guess growing up a samurai you learn lots of poetry.
That"s a fib.
All that about me being of samurai blood, it"s lies.
It"s hard to come down in the world as far as I have.
It"s one long, sad day after another.
You can"t go on without something to prop you up.
That"s what my samurai story was.
That feels better.
Now I can die with a clear conscience.
"Die"? But you said...
Miss.
So we are going to die?
We"ll be fine.
Hello!
Hello!
You on the roof!
Have you seen the people from the "Ashi no Ya"?
Miss, it"s Ryosuke.
Ryosuke!
O-Shin!
Ryosuke! l"m coming!
O-Shin! Miss!
You really found yourself... a good one this time, O-Shin.
Ryosuke!
Hurry up! Lt"s half-swamped already.
All right.
Miss.
Quick, get in.
No. Three of us will sink that boat.
Then l"ll take O-Shin and be right back.
Never mind that.
Listen to me.
You"re safe now.
You"re in the clear.
The sea"s come and swallowed up everything.
It"s like the sea"s been watching... and it"s come to save you.
So... get going.
And make sure you both do things right.
I know, l"ll give you this. l"ve been squirreling money away for years.
There"s lots of it here.
But, miss, you have a...
A child back in my home village?
That was a lie, too.
Make a ball of your lies
and knead them with tears l"ll be right back!
Don"t worry about that.
Hurry before the boat sinks!
Get going!
Don"t make me angry!
Miss!
Miss!
"Good evening."
Well, here I am... alone at last.
And it feels fine.
Directed by Kei Kumai
Come on!
This is heavy!
Come on.
We have no time now.
Everything must be set right... or the master will be unhappy.
Let's go. Come on.
Madam, since I've been serving you for 24 years... may I ask you, why must you do this?
Please.
At least not on your birthday.
I'm 40 years old.
It is time to do something.
Otherwise,
I'll feel sorry for myself.
You're not gonna tell me something's wrong with the banquet, are you?
This is so tight,
I could hardly breathe.
Madam, everything's fine with the banquet.
Good.
I had a strange dream last night.
I dreamed that my lord had taken a second wife.
- He was so happy.
- You know how it is.
A man is happier the more wives he has.
Are you suggesting that I should consider...
May not be such a bad idea.
- I will do it then.
- Madam!
Madam Kang is dying!
Her blood is everywhere!
Come quick!
Mother, may I?
Go, go, go.
Don't disturb me.
I'm busy.
Madam Kang is dying.
Her baby refuses to be born.
No, you will not go.
Ailian, it is your
40th birthday party.
Lord, madam is worried that it might damage... our young lord's marriage to the Kangs' daughter... if she does not go over to help.
It will be a while before the guests arrive.
I will personally make sure that she is not late for the banquet.
Be late... and you will no longer belong to the Wu family!
Hey! Come back here!
Stop right now!
Communist, come back!
Be careful, madam.
I'm sorry.
Sorry. No men are allowed.
Someone is in labour right now.
Thank God you've come, madam.
Meichen.
It's Ailian.
Can you hear me?
Sorry, Ailian.
Forgive me for not telling you.
Too embarrassed.
It's all right.
It's good fortune to have a baby, even after 40.
No, please!
- You can't go in!
- Don't let him come in!
He can't go in there.
Father, I beg you.
Mother's dying.
The foreign doctor has come.
Where's the hot water?
Mr Kang, I've studied medicine.
I can help.
Leave me alone.
Doesn't he know that it's forbidden for men to see such things?
What if I can save her life?
Madam Kang will lose all face.
She would rather die than have any man but her husband see her there.
What good is face if she dies?
Pray for her.
I must talk to you before I die.
Please, take care of Lin Yi for me.
- Is she still conscious?
- Yes.
Andre, no!
I'm sorry.
Get out! Get out!
Get me a pan of hot water and some fresh towels.
Now!
Has your mother returned yet?
Where is she?
Lord.
Old Lady was wondering why we couldn't start yet.
She's losing patience.
You tell her we're almost ready.
What are we going to do?
Women. Never trust a woman!
- I heard you shouted at Madam Wu.
- Did I?
You know their family.
They own half this town.
You know that I needed her help, and she did help.
I've worked too hard here to let you make trouble for me.
Father! Father!
My master wants to give this to you.
I appreciate your master's kindness, but I cannot accept this.
Please give it back to him.
How dare you make all of us wait for you!
Madam Kang will live... and there is a foreign man, a priest.
Go apologize to my mother and guests.
We talk after dinner.
Let her be, my son.
Come sit by me, my daughter-in-law.
Let us begin.
Enjoy your meal.
If I were him, I'd spend money on a concubine, not a banquet.
The Japanese have virtually taken over Manchuria.
Maybe they will be satisfied, then leave us in peace.
They will never make it that far south.
Fengmo, here comes your future bride.
Welcome, Mr Kang.
Please, follow me.
I can't wait for your wedding banquet.
Daughter-in-law, what kind of a girl are you going to find for my son?
I haven't thought about that yet.
Tell me, why do you want another woman for your husband?
I think it is time for me to retire from my duties.
What do you mean?
I somehow felt... my husband deserves a younger wife.
She's crazy.
My mother tried to kill herself when my second mother came.
And my second mother took poison when my third mother came.
She arranged it all for him.
- I can't believe it.
- Congratulations!
Thank you.
You have such a wonderful wife to arrange a concubine for you.
That's really something.
Let's toast your first concubine.
What?
- What are you talking about?
- Stop pretending to be shy.
We just heard your wife say... you deserve a younger girl.
- But...
- Second wife.
You must invite me to the wedding banquet.
Come on! Gan bei.
- Let me get some more wine.
- Just call a servant.
No. It's my pleasure.
They said you are giving me a concubine.
Why didn't you tell me?
Don't you like the idea?
Is there anything else, madam?
No. You can leave now.
Good night.
Ying?
You can call me in the night if you need anything else.
Will you be jealous of her?
I'm 40 years old today.
I'm no longer young.
I like your hair's fragrance.
You had too much to drink today.
Who is she?
And how old is she?
Is she pretty? Look.
I want someone just like you.
It will be all right.
Trust me.
She will serve you better than I.
Will you still take care of me... when the new one comes?
Since that day I marry you... twenty-four years ago... it has been my duty to serve you and make you happy.
I thought...
I would hold you like this until I died.
Father of my sons?
Father of my sons?
Let's talk about it tomorrow.
I think it might be better to put you into younger hands.
Tomorrow. Do it.
I want to go to sleep.
Can we talk just a minute?
No.
Do it now.
Please.
Do it!
Aren't you coming to bed?
No.
I have a bed ready.
Hurry up. Hurry up!
Hey, you, stop!
- Time to eat.
- My God!
- It's very funny.
- What time is it tonight?
My father is going to kill me if he finds out I'm doing it again.
Then don't get caught.
Wait.
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
- The matchmaker brought me here.
- Matchmaker?
Oh, no! One is broken.
Thank heaven you're here!
I was terrified!
Stupid, stupid girl.
I told you to follow me.
Why don't you listen?
This girl is so perfect for your family.
Her mother left her, and her foster mother raised her... in order to get a dowry.
If not for the war, she wouldn't give her up so quickly.
If you could be so kind... to add another, say,
50 pieces...
Fine. I need to speak with her alone.
Of course, madam.
I'll leave her to you.
Go. Go!
What is that in your hands?
I told them to bring nothing.
I brought you some fresh eggs,
15 of them.
Not one is older than seven days.
Come closer.
I would like to see them.
But one got broken on the way.
Her feet are so big, like a monkey's.
She's a country girl.
Must have gone barefoot since birth. I think...
I hope you like them.
I had nothing else.
Do you think you would like to stay here?
The matchmaker told my foster mother... that I will not starve here.
She told me to please you above all else.
That necklace is very beautiful.
It's the only thing I have from my real mother.
What is your name?
I have no real name.
My foster mother called me
Little Orphan when I was small... and Big Orphan when I got big.
I can give you a name if you wish.
Chiuming.
It means "bright autumn."
You will bring the brightness to my lord's autumn.
Yes. I like it.
Don't you?
Mother, do you think a young girl would suit a family like ours?
It's very generous of your wife to arrange it for you.
More grandchildren will make the Wu family even greater.
There is a law forbidding concubines now.
- These matters are not for children.
- Grandmother.
I'm not a child.
I'm 18 years old.
The Kang family has requested that...
Fengmo will receive some foreign education... before he marries the daughter.
Ask the priest from the orphanage that you met at the Kangs'.
He can teach Fengmo.
- I do not want to be married!
- Fengmo.
The priest can come in, but not his god.
Madam Wu has requested that I come for an interview.
He's here. The foreigner.
The same man you met at Madam Kang's.
And he said you sent for him.
Send him in.
Don't stand there with your mouth open like a fish.
It's a pleasure to see you again, lady.
Please forgive my rudeness.
Please sit down.
I should thank you for saving my best friend's life.
We did it together, didn't we?
How would you prefer
I address you?
I forgot to ask your name last time.
May I borrow your brush?
You can call me Andre.
You can write in Chinese?
Yes.
- How long have you been here?
- Three years.
Have some tea.
What country are you from?
I was born in America, but China is my home now.
What made you come to China?
My church asked for volunteers, and... well, here I am.
I have heard you have an orphanage.
Why would a foreign man like you... like orphanage work?
It's a job for women.
Why should such a pleasurable and important job be done by women only?
Do you miss your family?
I don't have a family.
Your parents didn't arrange a wife for you?
No. I'm not married.
Is it because of your religion?
Yes. I'm a priest.
Sister Shirley tells me you're looking for a tutor for your youngest son.
Yes. How much are your fees?
I don't require any fees.
Thank you for your kindness, but... it would put the Wu family in a lower position... if you didn't accept the fees, wouldn't it?
No, not at all.
We all have the same position in the eyes of God.
Then we should give the money to your god.
I'd rather not take money, but...
I will accept some clothing and food... for the children of the orphanage.
That can be arranged.
Thank you, madam.
Classes will begin the week after the wedding.
I hope you understand, our Old Lady... does not want you to talk about your religion in your class.
Grandma!
- Is he your grandson?
- Yes.
I have three sons and two grandchildren.
I'm sorry. Ying?
- Where's Ying?
- It's all right.
I like kids.
Come, come.
Come here.
I don't bite.
What is this?
A lion? A dog?
Get out of the way!
Young Lord, this is your teacher.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Congratulations on your wedding.
It's my father's wedding.
I'm sorry.
Madam Wu invited me to this wedding.
- I would never think...
- Congratulations, Mr Wu.
You see, in America, men have only one wife.
You're not in America now.
Forgive me.
What do you think about getting a second mother?
I think it's disgusting.
My father has young wives.
But I'm the daughter of the first wife.
Great.
Foolish thing!
What is there to fear?
Just lie back... and it be over soon!
Consider how lucky you are.
Do you have a home to run to?
Or a mother to give you rice?
Just obey your duty... and you can grow fat and comfortable... like me!
Your hands... are like a washboard!
Please forgive me, lord.
You are hurting me!
What's wrong with you?
Stupid girl.
Take off your clothes.
Come... over... here.
Lord, I beg you, please don't!
Open your mouth.
Lord, please, I beg you!
- Good morning, lady.
- From now on... you must call me Elder Sister, not lady.
Yes, lad...
Elder Sister.
You are a member of the Wu family now.
Sweeping the floor is the servants' job... not yours, child.
Yes, Elder Sister.
I hope you understand...
I put the entire happiness of our lord in your hands.
Fengmo, what do you want?
I've just come to see you, Mother.
How are you feeling?
I'm quite well. Why don't you say good morning to your second mother?
Good morning, Second Mother.
You should know the family rules.
Send a servant to let me know before you come.
She's so young, and Father is so old.
Send her home.
This is not something for you to decide.
Mother, this is wrong.
Andre says that even in Western countries... everyone is supposed to have a monogamous relationship.
Well, how does a foreigner know about Chinese?
Fengmo, police! Move!
Let's go!
Stop!
It was my father-in-law's library.
My husband had it closed after he died.
I've read most of the books here.
Dream of the Red Chamber.
You don't know how many times I've read this.
Do you think a woman is capable of learning as much as a man... or is her mind inferior?
Inferior?
No, but they certainly are different.
Do you think a woman is happier... if she reads less?
I don't know.
But I do know that a book doesn't know whether a man or woman is reading it.
If this is satisfactory,
I'll have them clean it for you.
It's perfect.
Madam?
Young Lord is in jail.
Why?
They said he is involved with Communist activity.
Nonsense! I have to go get him.
Madam, you are a woman.
You can't.
But how can I tell the lord?
We're expected at
Madam Chiang Kai-shek's reception... for the American ambassador to Nanking.
Here's the invitation.
He is suspected of being a Communist.
Without an order from the Shanghai police bureau...
I can't release him.
Are you suggesting that I tell
Madam Chiang... that you would prefer to keep her guest in jail?
May I have your name, please?
Is that really a letter from Madam Chiang?
Yes, it is, thanking me for opening up the orphanage.
How did you know he couldn't read English?
I took a chance.
The lamp is the sun.
The Earth.
The moon.
So, the Earth moves...
Around the sun.
And the moon moves around the sun. Yes or no?
Yes and no.
Excellent.
My grandmother is the sun.
My father is the Earth.
My mother is the moon.
And I cannot escape their gravity.
Interesting.
My parents don't care if the Japanese are right next door.
And our government is more interested in making money from the war... than in fighting them.
So what are you saying?
This concubine thing makes me sick.
She's just a girl my age.
This place stinks like a mouldy tomb.
They want me to be like them.
I must get out of here.
Then why don't you go?
Saying and doing... two different things.
Let's get back to astronomy.
It's important to keep studying, no matter what happens.
Fengmo, you're a very lucky young man.
A total lunar eclipse... occurs once every 18 years in the same place... and we can see one tonight.
When the Earth blocks the sun's light from reaching the moon... the moon seems to disappear in the Earth's shadow.
Here.
My mother likes to look at the stars too.
It's beautiful.
Mother.
Andre's brought a telescope.
We've been looking at the moon.
Both hands.
- I can't see anything.
- No, try again.
Is that better?
Mother, why don't you come to class?
Chiuming can come with you if you think it doesn't look right.
She can study too.
That way you won't be the only woman.
I'd be honoured if you joined us, lady.
I do not know how to keep from getting pregnant... when I sleep with the father of my sons.
Another baby will surely kill me... but how do I compete with my husband's younger wives?
Fengmo's tutor told him
American men... can only have one wife.
It is so pitiful you had to find a concubine for your husband.
The girl... where did you find her?
You like her?
Does he like her?
I like her.
She's an ordinary girl... but a good one.
You sound like you hired a maid.
Meichen, I feel like a frog... living in a well... only seeing the small portion of the sky.
I have wanted to visit you many times, Ailian... to discuss our children's wedding.
But since that foreigner is there, it would be too shameful for me to meet...
He saved your life, Meichen.
Besides, he's just a priest.
Fengmo even suggested that Second Lady and I... should join the class with him.
You seem so changed, Ailian.
You got one!
- I caught a duck!
- There he is!
Madam, I believe this is yours.
Thank you.
Please, go away.
Go away.
Good-bye, ladies.
It's all right.
He's gone.
He scared me to death.
Did you see his hairy chest?
No wonder they say that foreigners are half animal.
My little precious!
My poor little baby.
Are you all right?
Lady! Lady! I must speak to you about the foreigner.
He must have starved to death in his past life.
It's because of your generosity he takes all the leftovers... you usually give to the servants.
Mother, the day after tomorrow is Andre's birthday.
- We must have a banquet for him.
- A banquet?
Young Lord, he's not family.
I don't think Old Lady and your father will agree.
I have an idea.
Foreigners like a huge cake... with a candle in the middle for their birthday.
All right.
We can make one for him.
But how big?
Big enough.
I saw these yesterday.
I thought you might like them.
Come see. Take it. Take it.
I like the way you massage me.
Take a seat.
I've been worried about Fengmo.
Perhaps you should attend a few classes... and make sure everything's all right with him.
You must be joking.
I would fall asleep.
Why don't you go?
Perhaps... if Chiuming came with me.
I will tell my mother.
I can't relax with her!
She doesn't know how to comfort me. You could.
No, you must not think of me that way.
It is unfair to Chiuming.
Unfair?
You are so naive.
She's just a puppet.
How could you buy a puppet with a heart?
She cannot compare with you.
I only do this because you made me.
Do it, now.
Now.
Ying!
Madam, I'm here.
I'm too old.
I can't take care of you forever.
Any questions?
I have a question.
I hope you don't mind.
Not at all.
Have you ever seen your god?
I thought we were prohibited from discussing religion.
This is not religion.
Why don't you tell us?
No, I have never seen Him.
How can you believe in what you can't see?
Faith.
He's in everything.
In bread. In water.
In sleeping. In waking.
In feeding the lost children.
Teaching Fengmo and Chiuming, and talking to you now.
Faith.
Is it selfish if any individual puts his happiness...
before the happiness of his family?
But if a person is unhappy, how can he serve his family?
A question.
Are all Chinese marriages arranged?
Marriage has to be arranged.
- Why?
- Marriage is a family matter.
And family is the most important obligation here.
Our sorrows and joys belong to the family.
What happens when we die?
That's always a very good question.
When we die...
our soul will be free.
Then I can't wait for my soul to be free.
I always wonder...
why Western people like to go to church...
to confess how guilty they are.
Well, I always wonder why Chinese people like to pray for more money...
sons and beautiful wives.
Are people in your country...
allowed to do things that are forbidden by society?
In theory, everyone's equal...
and has the right to pursue whatever makes them happy.
I don't think
I have that kind of right.
I've got something to show you.
I brought a photo of my sister and my mother... so you can see how Western women dress.
That's my mother and sister.
They're so beautiful.
You must miss them very much.
Is that you?
You were so cute.
- Big and hairy now.
- Like a bear.
Who is laughing so loudly?
Your son and your wives, lord.
They are having classes.
Here's the birthday steam cake.
Be careful. It's hot.
Long life, teacher.
How did you know it was my birthday?
- We made a cake for you.
- Eat it while it's hot.
I put a lot of sugar, sweet beans and dried fruits in there.
I had to steam it for two hours.
The candle kept falling down.
It's all right now.
But be careful.
Hey!
Why did you blow out the candle?
I worked so hard.
I made a wish.
Doesn't it smell delicious?
You first.
You don't like it?
No. I like it very much.
We just want you to feel you're at home.
Fire!
The orphanage is on fire!
God!
Stay there.
It's too late!
Give me some water.
Give me some water!
- Are you all right?
- Elder Sister!
Breathe. Are you all right?
Where are they taking them?
Our lady has ordered to move the children... to the Wu compound.
Let it go.
You gained two kilos.
But it's all in your ears.
It's mine! It's mine!
You can't get me.
Children.
What have you done?
He's dead.
- You killed him.
- He's dead.
You killed him!
Here's something sweet.
I hope the children enjoy their watermelon.
Madam, thank you.
We appreciate it very much.
Never mind.
Thank you.
You're alive.
That's all that matters.
You know, I think
Second Wife is distracted.
Her heart is somewhere else.
Once she has a baby, she will be part of the Wu family... and her heart will be settled.
Madam, would you send me away if I said something... that might make you angry?
Have I ever sent you away yet?
Go on.
I think you should not have risked your life saving that foreigner.
- People are talking.
- About what?
Unmentionable things.
If I hadn't gone into that burning orphanage...
Andre...
I mean, that foreigner and his children would be dead.
I think we should not let Old Lady find out about what happened.
Very strange.
Those foreigners... they like to hold your hands to show their appreciation.
Makes me embarrassed.
Madam, if I were you...
I would not let that foreigner touch one hair on my body.
You even let him stay on our compound.
And the servants, they do not like serving people from the orphanage.
You should see lord's face.
He's not happy with this either.
What else?
I think you should arrange for Fengmo's marriage... and make the orphans go away from this house as soon as possible.
I thought I had lost it.
I knew it was yours.
The clasp was broken, so...
I fixed it.
Thank you.
Why don't you put it on so you don't lose it again?
Let me help you.
It's the only thing you have from your mother... isn't it?
Electricity. It sounds good.
But it's a waste of money.
Hey, bring me some tea.
Wu, how 'bout your new wife?
Don't be so shy.
You're part of the club now.
We all have several wives.
Isn't that so?
I'm so used to the first wife.
Second Wife, she doesn't know how to take care of me.
I have an idea.
Come with us to the flower boat.
There you can really relax, huh?
- No, my mother would never allow me.
- Your mother?
Come on!
In the dark there's no difference... between a concubine and a flower girl.
That's right.
No, no, no, I can't.
I can't.
Leave him alone.
Go home to your wives.
We'll go there without you.
Let's go.
Is my son gonna be absent from the table tonight again?
Chiuming, where has your husband been the last few nights?
Ancient, he's been going out with Mr Kang.
Daughter-in-law...
I hope you haven't been so busy attending classes... and taking care of the orphans... that you have neglected your duty to the others.
Yes.
Let's eat.
There's my father. Look.
Fengmo, there's your father too.
- Hey, don't let him get away.
- I can't.
- So shameful.
- Grab him. Bring him back here.
Awful. I really wish I wasn't from this family.
Madam! Madam!
Old Lady says she's not going.
She's afraid of this electricity.
Lord says he cannot go either.
Should I still put the basket in the boat?
No, we cannot go without them.
Mother, everyone is going.
The Wu family will lose face if your mother appears without your father... at the celebration.
- Maybe I shouldn't go.
- No.
We are going.
Just wait till Old Lady finds out about this.
Electricity!
And so... we bring our humble town... into the modern age.
Electricity.
Electricity.
Why?
Can you tell me why?
Could you translate?
I don't understand the dialect.
All right.
This is a story about a girl... who had to disguise herself as a boy... in order to go to school.
In the three years, we shared the same window.
- My feelings for you...
- I can understand.
My feelings for you grew as deep as the sea.
In pairs birds fly.
Lovers' shadows... forever entwined.
Your smile makes my heart break.
But you know my father has already arranged my marriage.
A thousand words in my heart.
Still, to express my feelings...
I know not where to start.
What?
Nothing.
I miss you.
I cannot sleep at night.
I miss you.
- They flew away together.
- I eat but do not taste.
I miss you.
I pick up the brush but cannot write.
I miss you.
Without you my life is a waste.
I miss you.
They were separated... and died from love sickness... and were buried together.
A pair of butterflies... emerged from their grave... and flew away together.
If I cannot be with you in this life...
Then I will be with you in the next.
You know the story?
All love stories end the same, don't they?
This is a Western butterfly story.
It's one of my favourite operas.
Just listen.
Why do all love stories end in tragedy?
Someday you will understand.
No, Mother, I want to know.
Is love a sin?
Love is never sinful.
It's the most beautiful feeling we can have.
I'm sorry. I think we're forbidden to talk about this topic.
- What if love is forbidden?
- Fengmo, stop it.
Teacher, Mr Wu would like to speak to you.
Let's stop now.
I hope you understand.
It is not appropriate to talk about relationships... between a man and a woman in my house.
What's wrong?
Father, some boys threw stones and mud at us.
They said we are bananas... yellow on the outside, white on the inside.
They say you like that rich Wu lady.
It's all right.
Let's wash up.
It's all right.
I have been concerned about the rumours.
It's not only your face.
It affects all of our reputations.
"Create in me a clean heart,
O God."
Now that you have enough foreign education... you will marry the Kangs' daughter on the moon festival.
- I do not love her.
- Love?
Nonsense.
Your marriage was decided before the two of you were born.
If you force me, I will join the Communist army.
Then you are not my son.
You must be careful of the foreigner.
You do not know who he is and what he really is up to.
I don't understand why you trust him so much.
Old Lady wants to move that foreign devil out of the Wu compound.
Lady, I'm so concerned about you.
It seems you don't watch out any more.
Are you listening to...
Good evening, Elder Sister.
What are you doing here at this hour?
- Where is Fengmo?
- I haven't seen him.
- I just saw you right here with him.
- It's not true!
You think I'm blind?
I hope you understand.
Your job is to serve your husband.
He doesn't like me.
He kicks me out of the bed.
I don't know what to do.
- He goes to the flower boat.
- You lie again.
It's true. I swear it!
It's true.
It's also true you're Fengmo's second mother. Who do you think you are?
I shouldn't have brought you here.
Daughter-in-law... is the priest still living in the servants' quarters?
The orphanage is being repaired, Mother.
We give you money to run the family, not on someone else.
Teacher?
I have a question.
Can't it wait until class?
If we die, our soul will be free, right?
Yes, that's true.
I heard you saved the foreigner from the fire and went to the opera with him.
Does the priest teach class about men and women?
Move him out of my house.
Help!Somebody help!
Second Lady has killed herself!
Stay here!
What is he doing?
She's conscious.
Let me die!
Stupid girl. She can't even play dead correctly.
She's going to be all right.
I have to speak with you.
Thank you for saving her.
I can't imagine what would have happened today without you.
- I have one request.
- Anything.
Let her go.
I can't.
- It's beyond my power.
- You brought her here.
You can set her free.
I'm sorry. I can't.
How can I face my family?
What would people say?
What would people think if they knew
Fengmo was in love with her?
How did you know that?
She told me.
She'd rather die than live here any longer.
Shameless.
Ruin the name of the Wu family.
- She seduced my son.
- Seduced?
You brought her here!
If I didn't, she could have died of hunger.
Why are you so cold?
You sacrificed that young girl... on the bed of a man old enough to be her father!
Did you really think you could free yourself by imprisoning another?
Who do you think you are?
A saviour?
You come to China to save our Chinese children... to save us?
Why don't you go to your country to save yourself and your country first?
I thought I knew you.
Good-bye, lady.
A long time ago... there was a little frog who lived at the bottom of an old well.
He thought... the sky was just this little patch of blue... above his head.
- He had no idea...
- Madam Wu!
Where's my son?
Where's my grandson?
Where's my daughter-in-law?
Heaven! Are you trying to break my old bones?
Ying!
Where the hell are they?
- I will go look for them.
- Go, go!
Why don't you come home with me?
Two wives not enough for you, Mr Wu.
Come home with me.
She is free now.
You can be free too.
But... she is young.
- Times have changed.
- And you're so old.
The other day... when you gave me that birthday dumpling or whatever it was... that's the first time I celebrated my birthday since I was a child.
I feel like I belong here now.
Come.
Here. Can you walk?
Let me help you.
Put me down.
- Let me take a look.
- I'm fine.
Let me see.
I'm a doctor, remember?
- It's all right.
- Let me see.
Maybe you sprained it.
Does that hurt?
- Yes?
- It's all right.
It's all right.
Why are you crying?
Where have you been?
On your knees!
Beg for forgiveness from your ancestors.
Ancestors, I beg for your forgiveness.
Apologize for driving your second wife away!
Forgive me for driving my second wife away.
Beg for forgiveness for breaking the family rules!
I beg for forgiveness for breaking family rules.
Beg for forgiveness for losing face.
I beg for forgiveness for losing face.
Beg for forgiveness...
Great Grandma!
It is a blessing that she did not live to see this war.
I've heard the Japanese have killed hundreds of people in the north.
May I pray for her?
Pray then.
My mother can have one more heaven to go to.
Forgive me, Father.
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
You are not really leaving, are you?
I am.
Where are you going?
As far away as possible.
Fengmo, I'm sorry.
It's hard for me to explain to you.
You're my son.
But I think only you can understand.
Mother... how could you?
How can I understand you... when you bought a girl to warm my father's bed?
How can I understand you... when you drove Chiuming to try to kill herself?
How can I understand you... when my father visits the flower boat every night?
How can I understand you when you betray us with my teacher?
Because... it has taken me 40 years... to feel the way you feel about Chiuming.
I have come to say good-bye.
I am joining the Communist army.
So you've decided.
You can find Chiuming in the missionary school near Wuxi church.
How's your mother?
Changed.
Go see her.
Thank you for all you have done.
Take care of my mother.
God bless you.
I've heard... you sent a message to tell the foreigner... to come for my care.
Yes.
I told the servants not to give him your message.
Why?
I'm not dead yet!
Children! Children, in the house!
Put your things down!
Inside! Inside!
In the house, hurry!
Quickly, in the house!
Get in, hurry!
Under the bed!
Now! There's no more time.
Now! Go down!
Get on the boat!
Get on the boat!
I'm not leaving.
You want to die?
- I'm not leaving with you.
- Get on the boat!
You don't understand.
I'm sorry.
Come with me, woman.
Now!
Not this time.
I've served you for 24 years.
Not any more.
- Listen! You belong to me.
- No. I belong to nobody.
You're nobody without the Wu family!
Don't leave me alone!
I'm scared!
If you no longer care for me, think of your sons!
My lord is looking for her!
They had a fight and she disappeared.
Take the children.
I'll meet you at Wuxi church.
It's too dangerous.
The Japanese have taken the town.
She must be trapped there!
Daughter?
Where are you, daughter?
Last night a foreign priest asked me... if I was still alive to give this to you.
- He was here?
- He saved our lives.
Tell me. Where is he?
Tell me the names that
Father Andre had given you, children.
Honesty.
Kindness.
Faith.
Truth.
- Humanity.
- Mercy.
- Light.
- Grace.
- Sunbeam.
- Star.
Dawn.
Charity.
Rose.
Mother, I don't have a name.
Your name will be Love.
Do you know who Tyler is? 
Yeah. He's a da waar director. 
What's a da waar? 
A big shot.
Did you know he's in China?
Yeah. He's remaking The Last Emperor. 
Don't be nervous.
You're not auditioning for a part.
What's your name?
Yo Yo.
I used to be a cameraman, but I got shaganged. 
What does "shagang" mean?
Means I have lots of free time.
As fast as you can, load the film and start shooting.
You sure are pretty.
Thanks.
Who are you?
You may call me Lucy.
I'm Tyler's assistant.
What's the job?
To shoot a "making of" documentary.
This is an important film...
...about one of the world's greatest directors.
Why not hire an American?
Why not cut the 20 questions?
Do you speak English?
No.
Good. You won't need it.
Look over this contract.
We'll notify you tomorrow.
- You pay me how much "mar-nee"?
- Not "mar-nee." It's "money."
- Then what's "mar-nee"?
- Money.
My pronunciation sucks but you understand?
You will shoot everything. 
Wherever he goes, you go. 
It's 24-7.
Mind your own business
and no talking to the press. 
You are just a pair of eyeballs
recording events. 
You have no copyright, 
no final cut... 
... and no creative control. 
The last thing we need is
your creativity. 
- Do I have the right to quit? 
- Only if we say so. 
Months Later
It's a boy!
Cut!
A perfect little baby.
You want to do it again, Mr. Tyler?
Shall we do another take?
Yeah.
Back to one, everyone.
Let's do it again.
Stand by.
Action!
Cut.
- Problem?
- No, no, no. Towel.
No, it's not you. You're...
You're very, very, very good.
- Are you sure?
- Oh, I'm sure. It's me.
It's my problem. You take a break.
Attention!
Everybody sit down!
I think this is the key.
Chinese Imperial Palace, two colors: red and gold.
Red walls, gold roofs.
Red stands for blood, the gold for money.
Blood and money.
Asian conception of power.
Who could flaunt power like this?
Only the emperor dared do it.
When Bertolucci made his film about the emperor...
...he empathized with him, treated him like an ordinary person.
Showed his life from when he was a kid...
...and assumed the throne as if it were a tragedy. Which is true.
But he did it because that would appeal to Western audiences...
...and guarantee the film's success.
You know, make money.
I don't think that's the right point of view.
The problem is, you have to break down modern prejudices...
...modern preconceptions.
I mean, God...
I'm Chinese and I thought
Bertolucci's portrayal was moving.
You're not Chinese.
You got a Chinese face, but you were brought up American.
You want to know what a Chinese thinks of an emperor...
...ask Yo Yo what's his opinion.
Yo Yo, do you think the emperor was a tragic figure?
No. He had all these beautiful babes.
A different one every night, all state-subsidized.
I've only had one, who divorced me.
I'm a tragic figure.
Tell him exactly what I said.
He had lots of beautiful women.
- The emperor.
- Yes. All paid for by the government.
His wife divorced him, so he thinks his life is a tragedy.
That's it. That's what it's like to live with it.
That's what ordinary Chinese people think of an emperor.
Good. Very good!
No money, no woman.
That's a tragedy.
Tragedy, tragedy.
I just love you, kiddo.
I also "I love you" too!
He'll be like this today
and tomorrow. 
No one knows what he's thinking
or what we're waiting for. 
Trust Tyler.
He's the best director in the biz.
He needs a thousand extras in the most expensive location...
...for his creative process?
This place opens to the public soon.
As his assistant, it's your job to tell him to shoot something.
Peter, don't forget why you survive in Hollywood...
...is not because you have talent.
It's only because you work for someone who does.
Stand up!
Do you want them to get changed?
- They're waiting for you.
- Jesus.
Everything I'm doing is just...
It's a load of junk.
It's got no inspiration, Lucy.
No vision. Complete waste of time.
Tell Peter it's a wrap.
I can't shoot any more of this crap.
Tony gets here tomorrow.
You should have something to show him.
Yo Yo. Tell Peter, everybody, finished.
- Finished. Peter.
- Finished! Finished.
- What are you doing?
- Following orders. What are you doing?
Trying to finish this movie, not stroke his ego!
What? If the director isn't ready, the film will be crap.
- Shut up!
- Hey, what's going on?
He said he's not paid to do what you just asked.
He said what?
You...
Here... Not clear...
No good, movie also no good.
Money. You're wasting your time.
Clear as a bell.
Yo Yo says that without the right idea at the heart of your movie...
...shooting it is just the same as taking a piss in the ocean.
Peter, it's a wrap!
- I love you.
- I love you, I love you, I love you.
- It's a wrap!
- I speak Chinese!
Shit, another day wasted. Damn it!
- Hey, kid, how are you?
- How was the trip?
Very long. My ankles are killing me.
It's a great set. Great, great, great.
Peter, my boy. You let me down, kid.
You let me down.
You probably think I came here with a contract...
...but I got you a one-way ticket back.
Don't beg. I do not like begging.
Well, can I get you a diuretic?
- For what?
- Your ankles.
As long as it's not Chinese herbs.
- Where's Tyler?
- I'll see what I can do.
- This way.
- Thanks, kid. Tyler!
We've seen all the dailies and we're very, very satisfied.
We've seen all the dailies and we're very, very satisfied.
This could be a fabulous picture, Tyler.
But there's a problem:
You're over budget, behind schedule and the investors are getting crazy.
Out of respect for you,
I can hold them off a day.
But you gotta make a choice.
I have to make a choice?
I choose to scrap the film. Listen.
- Just shut up for a second and listen.
- I'm listening.
I could shoot and bring it in on budget, but you'd end up with junk.
Uninspired trash that has no truth in it. None!
I've been waiting for my God of truth...
...but all I get is the back of his head.
He's walking away.
He's left me in the dark.
I'm sitting in this black hole of depression and I can't get out!
- Tyler...
- No! Listen to me!
I've looked from every point of view:
From the Eastern, from the Western, from a child's, from an artist's.
And all I get is a description of the emperor, you know?
I mean, an...
A superficial representation...
...that doesn't transcend banal reality.
It doesn't have God's light in it.
There's no epiphany.
There's nothing poetically definitive.
I realize that none of our films have.
There's nothing I can do about them.
But about this I can, and that's what I choose to do.
We've known each other how long,
30 years?
You believe me when I tell you I respect you?
Then for God's sakes, help me with this.
We've brought in a new kid to finish the picture.
An MTV kid.
Steven somebody, I forget his name.
He'll take over. He gets no credit.
Your name stays on the picture.
If you agree to these terms, you get your salary.
You save face, you make money.
You cannot leave my name on it.
I don't care about the new guy.
You can't leave my name.
That's the point of me scrapping it.
- I might as well kill myself.
- You got one other choice.
- I'll tell you what it is.
- Yeah?
- Kill me. Go ahead, do it.
- Kill?
Kill me.
There comes a time in the affairs of men, Yo Yo. Should I kill him?
Should he kill him?
You asked for it.
Well, I already made a deal with Mitsutomo.
The kid will finish the picture.
Your name stays on it.
You have no choice.
The law of karma dictates that...
...for every cause there must be an effect.
The Buddhist's goal is to transcend suffering and reach Western paradise.
Lucy.
I need to reload.
What does Jing Jie mean?
I don't know how to translate it.
- "The level one can attain."
- Could you be more specific?
- $20 and I'll tell you.
- Why are you treating me this way?
What, are we friends now?
I'm just an employee.
- Just a pair of eyeballs, remember?
- Greedy bastard.
Over there.
This is you. This is me.
This is Tyler and this is Buddha.
You can see this far.
I can see this far.
Tyler can see this far.
And Buddha can see for eternity.
That's Jing Jie. 
Buddha is the highest, then Tyler, then me, then you.
Like the saying, "A rat can't see past her nose." Consider that a freebie.
I'll give you a freebie too.
Go to hell.
- What's that mean?
- Go to hell!
Buddha says, "The death of the body isn't the end of life.
It's the beginning of a new life."
Ask Yo Yo if he believes that.
Reincarnation certainly makes the idea of death a lot more inviting.
Do you believe in reincarnation?
Nope. It's all a big hoax.
After you die, that's all she wrote.
He's depressed.
Can't you say something more cheerful?
We Chinese have a saying.
"If this life is bad, it doesn't matter.
The next life will be better."
We Chinese have a saying: "If this life is bad, it doesn't matter.
There's another life waiting."
So death is not so bad.
Woody Allen said he'll take a change of underwear, just in case.
The Chinese are very good at comforting themselves.
Chinese... 70 years...
Older people die.
Good finish.
Everybody drinks. Cheers.
Good life. To a good life.
To a good life.
A happy funeral.
How do you say "funeral"?
Pay up.
What are you trying to say?
If a person dies after 70, it's a "happy death."
- He's trying to say...
- No, I get it.
I think I get it.
What he's saying is:
If you go to an older person's funeral in China...
...when you come out of it, you feel uplifted and happy.
It's the same feeling you get when you see a really witty comedy.
- A comedy. A really funny comedy.
- Very comedy.
- Xiju?
- Yes.
- Xiju is...
- Comedy.
- Comedy.
- What is the word for "funeral"?
- "Funeral."
- Comedy funeral.
Comedy funeral.
Comedy funeral!
Comedy funeral?
Comedy funeral?
Tyler, I don't know how to tell you this.
The Japanese had a meeting with the crew and didn't inform us.
They told everyone because of your health...
...you had to return to the States for rest...
...and Steven will take over as director.
After the meeting, they told Peter in private that he was fired.
The Japanese brought over their own producer. Yo Yo was fired too.
- Tony wants you in the makeup truck.
- Okay.
Before he leaves, I need to clear up some things with him.
It's only going to be a little break.
I need the rest anyhow.
It's not going to be long.
Give my love to Lilian.
Tell the kids I'm sorry I don't have gifts. It came on so quick.
I understand your situation.
Take care of yourself.
Yo Yo.
Camera.
Yes.
Change.
How long?
- Four...
- Four minutes.
You...
...sit. Sit.
I shoot you.
Sit.
This way. Good.
Four minutes.
My gift to you.
You have a God-given talent.
And you just...
All he needs is the right opportunity.
My work finish? My English no good.
So you say yes or no?
Yeah. My work finish too.
I'm going to get on my horse.
What time come China?
Work for you. Free.
I want you to give me comedy funeral.
Comedy funeral! No problem!
I'm waiting for your news.
My God, the truth is standing around.
It's a woman!
Got really short hair.
She's trying to tell me everything.
Hey, what's wrong? Are you okay?
Hello? Hello? Somebody help!
Lucy! Lucy!
Lucy!
Somebody help!
Lucy, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
- How long you been here?
- About two hours.
My English not good.
I can't believe it.
Maybe it's my fault.
I came here to help.
Now look what's happened.
All right, thank you. Go home.
No. This is not your business.
My bag.
I said get out of here!
We had a misunderstanding.
I hope I didn't hurt you.
I just wanted my bag and helmet.
Tony's having a private meeting, and...
Hey, man. Thanks.
You're a good guy.
We could become friends.
Be cool!
Sorry, baby.
It's like he expected this.
These last few days, all he and Yo Yo...
...that Chinese guy who was here, have been talking about is funerals.
He kept saying he wanted a comedy funeral.
I thought his spirits were low and he was joking.
But just before he passed out...
...he told me he wanted Yo Yo to give him a comedy funeral.
I don't know. But if he dies, does that count as his will?
It sounds like he authorized it.
Does he think Yo Yo can organize his funeral?
He's controlling how he'll be remembered.
He's proving that he's asking face from nobody, giving face to nobody.
He's confused. He thinks we deserted him, so he's deserting us.
He's got huge pride.
Poor Tyler.
For the sake of friendship, you should handle the funeral.
Quiet.
Comedy funeral. 
Comedy funeral! 
A comedy funeral, no problem! 
She's going to tell me everything. 
Help! 
Lucy! Lucy! 
Oh, my God! Tyler! Please! No! 
Yo Yo, give me comedy funeral. 
No! Oh, my God, Tyler! No, please! 
Yo Yo, get an ambulance! 
Is this his will?
I think he's had a nervous breakdown.
It's an authorization.
You're responsible for his funeral.
- What did that idiot say to you?
- This idiot says he's gonna do it.
Moronic.
Sorry I can't be with you.
I gotta go to Japan for a few days.
Excuse me. Hello?
Hey, Mike, how are you? I'm in China.
I'm on my way to the airport.
Well, a little problem has come up.
Princess Diana's casket... 
... is adorned by flowers
from her sons... 
... and a handwritten card... 
... from her mother. 
Thousand of mourners
line the route... 
Over here!
Out drinking again?
Yellow hair doesn't suit you.
- You should dye it back.
- Why?
You look inbred.
You disappear for five years!
Now there's some big mystery!
I'll tell you. But only if you promise to keep it a secret.
Just because I drive a Cadillac, doesn't mean I'm rich.
Concerts rely on sponsors.
I don't make a cent off the box office.
And no fires...
...or floods this year.
So no benefit concerts to profit from others' suffering.
You bonehead! I don't need your money.
I've got a big job for you.
I don't have any to give you anyway!
On the way over, I thought:
"If he needs 20,000,
I'll just give him 2000."
My treat.
So, what's up?
You're a bigtime promoter, right?
I'm the best.
How about a funeral?
A funeral?
If we're talking John Doe, forget it.
But, say, that Russian sub...
- What's it called?
- The Kursk.
Right, the Kursk. 
Now that's a show! I'd definitely be able to pull it off.
Center stage. A huge replica of the ill-fated sub.
Top models strutting back and forth in sexy navy outfits.
We'll get Celine Dion to sing
"My Love Will Go On."
Really!
Why didn't I think of this before?
I'm being serious.
- All right. Whose funeral?
- Someone in the arts.
Well, that depends.
It's got to be a big shot.
And he can't be an asshole.
Or a child molester.
There are limits to what we can do.
Akira Kurosawa, for instance.
There's a death you could make some money on.
Bigger than Kurosawa.
Who?
Couldn't be Chinese.
- Tyler.
- Which Tyler?
That Tyler!
Oh, that Tyler?
Of course, that Tyler.
We're in business.
Welcome.
Hi, Lucy. Mitsutomo's producer
Nakati-san is waiting inside.
I'll be working for him.
They felt that my experience was valuable, so they kept me on.
I know this may hurt Tyler's feelings, but I gotta work too.
Tyler might find it surprising, but not me.
Excuse me. How is Tyler?
Is that really important to you?
Let me speak frankly.
If Tyler unfortunately passes away...
...well, that's a great selling point of the film.
But we need permission to use his name as the director.
You speak for Mr. Tyler now.
I hope that you will give us that permission.
Tyler doesn't want his name on the film.
That's because he is unable to speak.
Name a price.
Name a pretty high price.
It's worth it to us, and I know you need the money.
Tyler's going to recover.
I understand your feelings.
The doctors said it's a matter of time.
He's going to die.
That's true of you as well. You'll die.
It's just a matter of time.
I've heard enough from both of you.
Lucy. Lucy, come... Lucy, come back.
What happened? I am very upset!
Cut that light. No backlight.
Soon as I roll, start pouring.
And make sure it bubbles.
Hi, I'm not in, 
and I'm not telling where I went. 
Leave a message. 
Hi, Yo Yo. It's Lucy. 
I need to rent a car... 
... and find a place to stay. 
I had no one else to turn to. 
- I'll do it.
- Stay in the car! Get back in the car!
Cold?
I've got a three-point plan.
First, dry clothes.
Second, hot soup. Third...
- What?
- I'm working on it.
What's your plan after he dies?
Go ahead and cry.
You've been holding it back too long.
Thanks.
You can sleep with me if you want.
No, that's not what I mean.
I mean, hotels aren't cheap.
Not that you don't have money, because I'm sure you do.
It's not the money, it's just...
So if you don't care about, you know...
If you're not afraid...
What the hell am I talking about?
Could you come here and hug me?
Forget it. Forget it.
Maybe I should go.
- Why go to the hospital now?
- He needs me.
I'll show you a hug!
Don't be afraid. It's okay.
Don't cry. I'm here for you.
If anything happened to you, how could I go on?
Stop gazing at me like that.
His office is upstairs.
- You play pool?
- A little. Tyler loves it.
Snooker's more my style.
Wang, she's here.
What the hell?! You said 10!
- Well, just meet her.
- No, no, no!
I'll introduce you.
No way!
This is an international occasion!
This demands formal attire!
Keep her busy.
I'll meet you upstairs!
Let's roll.
Allow me to introduce you.
This is...
Is it George or Louis this time?
Louis!
Louis Wang.
GM of 3W-Dot-Com Productions.
This is Tyler's assistant, Lucy.
She'll be supervising the funeral.
On behalf of our comrades at 3W-Dot-Com...
...please accept our condolences over Mr. Tyler's tragic death.
- Please allow me...
- Excuse me. Tyler's not dead yet.
But he's real close.
And it doesn't look good.
Well, whatever the outcome...
...our hearts are heavy with anguish.
Go ahead.
It happened so suddenly. We haven't had enough time to discuss it.
There is no comfortable event...
But our company has a credo.
We will fight the tough battle.
We will fight the big battle.
We will win the battle that cannot be won!
- We will...
- Mr. Wang. How can you do that?
He means there's nothing they can't do.
- I understand Chinese.
- I'm sorry.
My company has a policy that when meeting with a foreign guest...
...each side only speak their native language.
What? Is that necessary?
I would respect your policy...
Cut the crap, all right?
When did you become so pragmatic, like a goddamn American?
Stick to the point.
Get down to business.
Let's get down to business.
First, the location.
Because of the time, this is still just a rough sketch.
- But it gives the general idea.
- What's with the U.S. flag?
Duh. Tyler's an American.
That's the Temple of the Ancestors.
Tyler filmed there.
Let me explain our reasoning.
We eliminated some choices.
A funeral home was out of the question.
Too spooky and didn't follow
Tyler's wishes.
We also considered a place familiar and dear to him:
A sound stage.
But that's too small and limiting.
And you can't tell it's China.
So after much deliberation...
...we chose a venue of immense cultural importance!
- The Forbidden City.
- Perfect.
Tyler's an American, but his laolao...
...the mother of his mother, was Italian.
So we kick it off with Zhang Yimou...
...directing Turandot. 
Turandot? What?
The opening's going to take two hours?
We won't do the whole thing.
Just a few arias.
Like "Nessun Dorma."
What do you think?
I prefer "What a Beautiful Jasmine."
It's adapted from a Chinese folk song.
So it's Italian, but sounds Chinese.
Like Puccini knew Tyler'd die in China.
It's fate.
Next we'll have...
...a stand-up comedy routine:
"The Joke Is on Tyler."
Like your talk shows, only more depressing.
And then, to get the emotion flowing...
...rock star Zang Tianshuo performs his chart-topping anthem.
Friend, oh, my friend
Do you ever think of me? 
If you've found happiness
Then let our memories be
Friend, oh, my friend
Do you ever think of me? 
If you can't stand it
Please tell me
Next up, director Chen Kaige...
...and Tyler's favorite actress,
Gong Li...
...will award his corpse...
...a Golden Rooster for lifetime achievement.
If Gong Li cancels, we'll get Zhang Ziyi.
He loves her.
The last section is
"Tyler's New Life."
This kid is Tyler's reincarnation.
But Tyler's white.
How'd he become Chinese?
If he dies in China...
...he should become Chinese.
He should come out the way he went in.
But that doesn't benefit
Sino-U.S. friendship, does it?
It could injure the feelings of the Chinese people.
- We wouldn't want that.
- What about the American people?
All right, let's not argue about it.
Look...
...Tyler's memory belongs to the world.
Because he's white now, doesn't mean he should stay white. Let me finish.
So although he dies here...
...he doesn't have to come back Chinese.
Be cool!
He should return to the people...
...who need him most.
Now since Africa's film industry is still in its start-up phase...
...how about an African baby?
- What?
- African?
A little black kid shooting across the sky! The skin is black.
The kid still has Tyler's voice and speaks English...
...returning from the dead to tell his fans:
"I love you."
Shit. We have to do it that way.
Only three colors to choose from, unless we turn him into a bird or fish.
- Then we have more options.
- Dark black or mocha?
True crimson.
Check this out.
Change the color, not the sex!
- They're sick.
- It's a virus!
- Maybe he'd be happier as a girl.
- Shut up!
An Asian footprint isn't enough.
We want global coverage!
Do whatever it takes!
We'll rent a Russian satellite.
You tell him, worldwide TV gets broadcast rights...
...but he pays the satellite fee.
With a global broadcast...
...we are talking billions of viewers.
Turandot will make money.
This thing's really snowballing.
Makes me nervous.
Don't sweat it, I'm here!
We have to resolve the time zone problem.
For European viewers, early morning would be ideal.
Keep them up all night.
- The Chinese audience comes first.
- Good point.
Things are taking shape.
Everything's about set.
I hope Tyler holds out a few more days...
...so I can get this stage up.
We're bleeding money like crazy.
I've been so busy, I forgot to ask:
Who's paying for this?
I'm going to need some cash.
Tyler should pay. You front cash to get it rolling, then...
"Should pay"? He has to pay!
Don't worry. I got it covered.
Make sure of it.
Don't worry about this.
He's sure got some fight in him.
The machines are keeping him alive.
And gives you more time.
How's it going?
It's all set.
Come out, we need to talk.
I keep forgetting to ask about the money. What's your budget?
It won't be cheap.
We don't have any money.
You'll have to think of something.
What do you mean,
I'll have to think of something?
Tyler never mentioned money at all?
He's totally broke.
Then what the hell am I doing?
He's not my father!
I'm totally screwed!
No one's forcing you.
Mr. Zhang is exiting the bathroom! 
I'll secure the hallway.
Mr. Zhang is the Genghis Khan
of Chinese T. 
His investments are quite aggressive.
A ferocious appetite!
You produce half of all TV dramas, correct?
I heard all about you!
So that's really you?
Sure as hell ain't you.
Have a seat.
I heard you're doing online casting for Golden Lotus. Any luck?
I'd go with a character actor.
Yo Yo.
Shut up for a second. Listen to
Mr. Zhang's condition for sponsorship.
My terms are simple.
Here's what I want to happen.
This mystery woman...
...will accompany Tyler...
...throughout the funeral.
- Who's this?
- Tyler's lover!
Impossible!
At his age? Are you kidding?
Maybe for Clinton's funeral.
What?
Of course, it's just an act.
She's an actress.
Your Golden Lotus, right?
The funeral...
...will launch her career.
The media loves that shit!
She'll be famous overnight!
Famous before her first role?
Exactly!
If we agree...
...Mr. Zhang foots the whole bill.
- Five million.
- You said four! The price went up?
It always does.
At four million, we only see a silhouette.
For five million, the veil comes off...
...and during the ceremony she gets three big close-ups.
Not a bad offer.
All right.
But only if she cries on him for at least 30 seconds.
She can cry for 10 minutes for all I care.
Sit down for a second.
I'll even throw in a bonus.
Remember how Tyler reincarnates as a baby?
The part about his New Life?
For another 500,000...
...I guarantee the baby recognizes only her!
The first word it says will be her name! Your name?
Nina.
Nina's better off as Mr. Zhang's midnight snack.
If he's spending money, we should make him famous.
Some plastic surgery, dye your hair blond...
...you can come as Tyler's bastard son.
Mr. Zhang! You don't like that idea?
We can discuss it.
But the concept does have its merits...
Why'd you do that?
I find an investor and you pull a stunt like that?
His conditions were outrageous.
It would ruin Tyler's reputation.
So what?
You know what filmmakers are like!
They'll sleep with anybody!
Everyone knows that.
If that's too much, then what isn't?
Why throw money away at your funeral?
They expect a return!
No one's losing money. It's like the
Olympics: a brand-building opportunity!
Who wouldn't love to say, "Our company sponsored Tyler's funeral"?
How will you do that?
Hang banners at the funeral?
Print logos on the invitation?
Sell airtime? That's your idea?
Exactly. If the sponsor's brand is worthy of Tyler's reputation!
If Kodak and Microsoft give us money, big money...
...they can wallpaper the place!
Something like:
"Tyler's friends bring you..."
Not "Sponsored by," but "Lovingly dedicated."
"Dedicated" isn't right.
"Lovingly brought." "Lovingly sent."
- "Lovingly brought."
- "Lovingly brought."
"Lovingly sent."
And I'm not interested in small fish.
Fortune 500 only.
- You can't park here.
- I'm leaving.
Isn't this disrespectful of Tyler?
No, it's good business.
Thanks.
Thank you, Father.
All right, all right.
All right, sweetheart. Okay.
You all right?
Well, thank God we got the old devil back.
Yeah, but he won't let me tell Yo Yo he's recovered.
Did you know they're using his funeral to sell advertising?
He doesn't want to stop them.
He likes the whole thing.
He said it wasn't what he expected, but even better.
By the sound of it, it sounds interesting.
Almost like a French farce.
Yo Yo and Tyler are both scoundrels.
And scoundrels, you never know which card they're going to play.
I have no idea how this crazy mess will end up.
Only God and Hitchcock know that.
We may see two possibilities, but never the third. That's suspense.
Start from the angel.
Five, four, three, two, one.
And you're on.
This is Victor Lee...
...reporting live from downtown Beijing with an amazing exclusive.
It's 9 a.m. local time
and you must stop what you're doing... 
... to watch the latest development... 
... of the incredible story
of Don Tyler's funeral. 
Ladies and gentleman.
We have just entered a new century...
...and Hollywood's most colorful director, Don Tyler...
...has given his Chinese friend the right to organize in China...
...a most remarkable funeral.
At the funeral, advertisers will be allowed to make product placements.
Today, the world's largest advertisers are here...
...to participate in an auction of those ad spots.
Not surprisingly, the competition will be ferocious...
...with prices expected to go sky-high.
Yes, sir!
No! Hey, hey, hey.
They really are selling you.
Aren't you angry?
Tony. Do you think he should be watching this? We should end this.
This is my medicine.
This is the best show I've seen on TV.
This is absurd. This is really crazy.
This is the theater of the absurd.
This kid's wonderful. I knew it then, but he's brilliant, Yo Yo.
Call the network.
We should get paid for this.
It's much better than that Survivor crap at home.
...prices high!
What'd you just say?
I have no idea. You're up.
Now I would like to invite the organizer of Tyler's funeral...
...Mr. Yo Yo, to explain the rules of the auction.
In accordance with Tyler's last wishes...
...the advertising space will be divided into three areas:
On-site signage, funeral platform placements...
...and rotating billboards.
We'll start by auctioning the billboards.
I hereby declare the proceedings open!
For rotating billboard number one...
...we'll begin at $ 100,000!
I have a bidder! $ 100,000.
$400,000. $ 500,000. $600,000.
One million!
One million, going once!
One million, twice!
One million, three times!
Sold!
Sold.
Oh, what shit!
This is a beautiful image.
It's like I can smell it.
I'd love to get my teeth into one of those.
Sold!
At the organizer's request,
Love Island DVD's bid is disqualified.
- Be cool!
- What's going on?
- The last bid is voided.
- Wait! Why? I demand an explanation!
Your player reads low-quality DVDs, right?
Our Super Error Correction made us the market leader!
Love Island reads DVDs of any quality!
I'm sorry. We can't accept your money.
Why not?
He's kidding!
Super Error Correction is piracy!
Legal DVDs don't have errors!
TV networks run our ads. Why not you?
That's unfair competition!
Tell it to the TV stations!
Personally, I hope you go bankrupt!
I hereby declare that billboard three is reserved...
...for a public service message!
FIGHT VIDEO PIRAC Y
Who gave you the right to do that?
This happens again,
I'll rip your damn head off!
Hear me?
Who do you think you're talking to?
Listen up!
I am in charge here, not you!
You'll get your money!
But shoot your mouth off again, it'll be your funeral!
Money-grubbing weasel!
Is video piracy more unethical than advertising at funerals?
Funeral advertising is profiting by stealing from oneself.
Video pirates profit by stealing from others.
I never expected a bum to know about protecting intellectual property.
You can bet he's got a lot of surprises.
I told you he's a genius.
His imagination is boundless and he has the principles to contain it.
That bastard just cost us a stack of money.
Does that monster think he's an angel?
He booked a one-way ticket to hell.
But that's how he is.
Mostly, he seems like a devil, but sometimes he's an angel.
Oh, sweetie, you're in love with him.
In your dreams.
I'd rather go to hell.
Good move, we'll all be there.
Yo Yo for sure.
You wouldn't be caught dead anywhere else.
Of course.
I don't know anybody in heaven.
All my friends are in hell.
And now poor Lucy will be there too.
Go see your sweetheart and give him
Tyler's bank account information.
I don't want to see that money disappear into the wrong account.
What I want to know is what you intend to do.
It's still too soon. When it's settled, I'll let you in on it.
But I'm not leaving the kid out to dry.
That I assure you.
This is NB T with a special report. 
Next up, live interviews
on the Tyler funeral. 
What's your opinion about
selling ads at funerals? 
- Who cares? It's his business. 
- Is it disrespectful of the dead? 
Giving a person what he asks for
is the highest form of respect. 
Now you're talking!
Do you support this concept? 
I've got three words: "One man's
glory, another man's shame. "
"One man's glory, another man's shame."
Three words, my ass! That's six!
What do you think
about a comedy funeral? 
A what? 
Shee-sahng.
A sauna? 
Bet he's never even seen a sauna!
Congratulations.
You're a big celebrity now.
Is Tyler...?
The doctor says we can pull the plug anytime.
But I can't do it.
He's still alive. Disappointed?
With all the ads I sold, are you disappointed?
- He's back again.
- I thought he just left.
It's not a bust to be a woman.
What does that mean?
How many times have I told you?
How many times?
Is it really that hard?
First, "Please restrain your grief."
Then the product slogan.
One more time. One, two, three.
Please restrain your grief.
It's not a bust to be a woman.
It's a breast cream ad.
The guests enter under the balloons.
Each balloon is sponsored.
Hey, where are my ads?
We're working on it.
A Korean cosmetics company snatched up the balloon ads.
Up! Okay, good!
All the liquor companies wanted in.
Bad News Beer finally won the bid.
"The Official Drink of Tyler's Funeral."
Watch their sales skyrocket!
Insane!
- This is the funeral platform.
- What's with the furniture?
- Louis!
- Coming.
Good thing you're here.
Our clients requested a few changes on the platform.
This junk is all famous-brand Italian furniture.
They wanted Tyler resting peacefully on this lovely bed.
Like he's taking a long nap, not dead.
That's a big placement.
Did they pay?
I was waiting for your approval.
- It's a nice chunk of change.
- Close the deal.
Later, we can hawk it at Sotheby's as a "Tyler antique."
What's the news from the drill team?
Just called. Awaiting our inspection.
A huge blimp will be flying overhead filming this part.
We sold the space to a French airline.
And they paid through the croissant for it.
We were pretty rushed.
It's still a little rough.
Attention, everyone!
Positions!
First formation!
Add the "TV"!
Why do you keep adding more crap?
Stand by!
I forgot to tell you.
I had a great idea.
You know that VJ, David Wu?
He's got a great style.
A VJ would really spice things up.
David Wu is fine, but just hire him.
Quit trying to turn everything into a scheme.
Continue!
Since we have the idea, let's just make him an offer.
Maybe he'll agree.
- What's the next formation?
- Who's in charge here?
From now on, we both are.
This one's a cigarette ad.
Listen up!
Ready!
Second formation!
You're wasting time with cigarettes.
If you get fined, don't blame me.
We only mention the logo.
They may think it's a slot machine ad.
You think they're stupid?
They'll just pull the whole lot.
Stand by!
We can add a banner:
"No Smoking At The Funeral.
And That Includes 666!"
Your talent's wasted here.
You should run the Olympics.
What did she say?
We're wasting our talent and should run the Olympics.
Is that an insult?
That's a compliment, right?
You've worked hard to make a profit.
How will you spend the money?
Originally, I just wanted to cover the costs.
If there was anything left over,
I'd pay off Tyler's debts.
But the money kept piling up.
Of course, I'll take care of Louis.
And you, for your devotion to Tyler.
You weren't going to take some for yourself?
First, I'll pay off the funeral and donate the rest to charity.
You always said I just wanted money.
I'm giving it away. How about that?
- To who?
- That's my problem.
Perhaps Ethiopian disaster victims, or the pandas.
Would Tyler give it to people or animals?
- People.
- Yeah, that's what I thought.
This is absolutely brilliant.
The kid's feeling pure terror.
He's up in the air with no visible means of support.
To save himself, he has to fly.
But he has self-doubt and is unsure if he can.
But he will. He must stop thinking about it or he'll crash.
He'll fly, do loop-the-Ioops.
It's sensational.
I don't like him being toyed with.
It's time we told him the truth.
You're wrong. I'm not toying with him.
But there's an idea here.
A great idea for me.
You can't tell him.
Promise me you won't.
He could come to the hospital at any time and bust us.
Yeah, you're right.
I should be moved somewhere else.
Yo Yo.
You got room for one more ad?
This hearse was a great idea.
Everyone wants a piece.
No can do. A watch company took the tailgate.
It's full up.
Only thing left is the hood.
- Sold out in one afternoon.
- Stick it here.
The hood! I want it.
For who?
Starmaker Music.
The boss is an old buddy.
We'll get his top singers for free.
They're all huge stars.
Know that TV theme song...
..."Don't Come Back!"?
- The one where he sobs?
- It's perfect for us.
Li Nan can sing from the roof of the truck.
Always working an angle.
You're using the funeral to kiss friends' asses.
Even though I already paid for those singers. And another thing:
This hearse isn't going straight to the venue.
Where's it going? The car wash?
Advertisers want it to circle the city a few times first.
Give them more exposure. So Li Nan can't bitch about too much sun.
Okay, Scrooge.
I'll buy him a big sombrero.
If all you care about is money, get him a brand-name suit.
He looks disgraceful in shorts and a tank top.
I beg to differ.
He looks like an athlete.
A sports lover.
- A picture of health!
- Yeah, healthy for a dead person.
Looks like he's taking a power nap.
The sportswear sold for twice as much as the suits. Why not wear them?
We've come this far.
Might as well squeeze every drop.
We're done with Game Reaper sportswear. What's next?
One Time Thief watch.
One Epiphany & Sons gold necklace.
One PaceMaker running shoe.
- Left or right foot?
- Left.
On the right, one Flying Sole leather dress shoe.
One pair of Traitor sunglasses.
Why are you taking the lens out?
This one belongs to a contact lens company.
- Traditionally, the eyes are closed.
- Contractually, this one stays open.
When he passed on, Tyler still had much to accomplish.
One eye holding out until the end is symbolic.
One bag of Magic Wake tea.
Where does that go?
Such an important spot.
We should up the fee 50% .
Remember to have the TV guys do close-ups on the tea bag...
...and contact lens.
- Five seconds each.
- Okay.
- What's next?
- Snuff Druff shampoo.
Isn't this overkill?
Let's hear the ad copy.
"One side used Snuff. No dandruff.
The other side didn't.
See the difference!"
"One side used Snuff. No dandruff.
The other side didn't.
See the difference!"
We can handle that.
One side used Snuff. No dandruff.
The other side didn't.
See the difference!
I can't see the difference.
- See it now?
- Oh, come on!
You're totally hopeless.
I got Mr. Biao for you!
I just love your movies!
Doing another big holiday picture?
Let's not waste Mr. Biao's time.
- He's got a TV show later.
- Right. Louis probably explained this.
We need you to say one line.
Since you're busy, we'll just walk through it.
If it's just a rehearsal,
I don't actually need to cry.
- Of course not.
- Have him cry.
- I'm Biao, Beijing Film Studio.
- I'm Lucy.
We need you to cry.
If you do it in character...
...we'll know what to expect.
At the real funeral, you can really let her rip.
I'm at the final send-off, right?
You'll walk up with me.
We'll be surrounded by big stars.
You come just after Stallone.
- Shall we start?
- A moment, please.
- Shall we start?
- A moment, please.
Tyler.
Tyler.
We Chinese actors began taking calcium supplements long ago.
But it was too late for you!
There wasn't time to share...
...with our fellow artists in America!
But we were close!
So damn close!
It's the lack of calcium that killed you!
Truly a great actor.
Cries on command.
- Did that work for you?
- Wouldn't cry that much if my dad died.
Wow, he felt more for Tyler than I did.
Bullshit. I paid him.
I can't wait any longer.
What am I going to do?
- Which one's Yo Yo?
- What for?
Shut your goddamn trap!
I asked for Yo Yo!
- What do you want?
- Are you Lucy?
- I'm Yo Yo. It's nothing to do with her.
- Hell, yes, it does!
Our boss wants to talk to her.
Cut the mafia act.
China doesn't have one!
If you have business, speak up.
That's enough.
Let's discuss this like gentlemen.
Show him.
- Have you tried this mineral water?
- Le Ha-Ha? Never heard of it.
- I only know Wah Ha-Ha.
- That's why I'm here.
I want mineral water drinkers everywhere to know Le Ha-Ha.
I heard this funeral is packed with big sponsors.
I want a spot for Le Ha-Ha.
I'll pay you well for it.
Come here.
See for yourself.
He's already fully sponsored.
There's no space.
We had space on the hearse, but now everything's taken.
Not my problem. Besides, I don't want to be mixed up with other ads.
You create an idea to set Le Ha-Ha apart.
Something innovative.
Give me a good concept.
You can name your price.
If not, you can cancel the funeral.
Thank you very much! Truth is,
I hope it does get called off.
If you're serious, go ahead and tear whole place down!
A smart-ass, eh? Tear it down!
Be cool!
Why's this music so gloomy?
It's a funeral dirge.
Gotta be gloomy to make people cry.
I don't like it.
Save it for Lucy's funeral.
Lucy's a nice girl. For her sake, come up with something else.
Attention, everyone!
Let's try the same dirge, only with a happier feel.
At double the tempo!
One, two, three, four.
I don't get it.
If you're copying another product why spend so much on ads?
You don't understand capitalism.
With enough advertising, the fake becomes the real.
- Pay them.
- Lucy, wait a sec!
Let's hear it again.
- Everything's taken care of.
- I don't wanna hear it anymore!
Take your stupid funeral and go to hell!
Talk to Tyler.
He woke up a while ago.
He and Tony wouldn't let me tell you.
But I can't keep up the act.
They're playing with you.
Why, Tyler? Why did you put him in charge of your funeral?
Hey, one of first things that Confucius said was:
"Aren't friends from far away a joyful thing?"
For me, I think what he meant was:
"No, not necessarily.
Not if you are truly Ionely."
- Thanks a lot.
- This isn't about you and Tony.
This is about me.
Right, but look at where it's got you.
This is wonderful.
All the emperors had their funerals here.
Yo Yo was just trying to move me from mortal to immortal.
You don't think my soul would be good in a little baby girl?
It's not a joke, Tyler, it's embarrassing.
Yeah, well, I guess if I had actually died...
...you guys wouldn't be happy with this, would you?
But you would have been remembered by all this... Damn it, Tyler!
After all you've done, your great work, to have this be your memorial?
But I'm still alive, sweetie.
So in the grand scheme of things...
...the Almighty was using Yo Yo and his brilliant creation...
...for a totally different reason.
- Tyler, you used him.
- I don't think so.
When you think about it,
I wanted to stop directing. Why?
I thought everything
I'd ever done was unworthy.
I just wanted to up and die.
I'd lost all faith in myself.
And that morning when I was making that film with Yo Yo...
...all of a sudden...
...everything turned blue.
I was in this pearl-blue tunnel, sweetie.
And way at the bottom of it, there was...
...this white light beckoning to me and I was floating towards it.
But I could hear this voice up above me, calling.
Yelling at me:
"Hey, old man.
Don't go there.
Come back.
You still have work to do."
And I forced myself out of that coma.
And when I opened my eyes...
...there, sitting in front of me, was...
...this magical screenplay and the name of its author.
- Yo Yo?
- Yo Yo, my man.
Messenger from heaven.
That's the real reason
I asked him to arrange my funeral.
To save my life.
To give me this perfect movie to make.
He's my angel.
Your angel's going straight to hell...
...if you don't do something to get him out of this mess.
When will the lousy old fart die?
Will he live until the next century?
If Tyler recovered, have you considered what we would do?
That's impossible! He has to die!
And if he doesn't, he better fake it!
Our clients don't care if the corpse is dead or alive.
They're only concerned about our advertising power!
I hope you're joking.
What if I'm not?
Then...
...I'll kill the goddamn bastard!
He recovered.
Months Later
Months Later
Are you comfortable here?
Can't afford to worry about comfort now.
Not enough time.
Just wish there were
48 hours in a day.
Where'd you disappear to?
Tried calling you everywhere.
Many big decisions waiting on you.
I'm so busy with the new film,
I had no time to visit.
Are you angry?
Don't worry.
We wouldn't abandon you here.
I'm not sick. Just tired.
I'll need a long vacation after the funeral's over.
Right now my mind is full of advertisements.
Since we IPO'd...
...our every move directly affects the NASDAQ.
Yo Yo.
Tyler is fine.
There's no funeral. It's all over.
Why won't you believe me?
You don't have to worry about the advertisers.
Tyler pre-sold his funeral rights.
He loved your concept so much...
...he's making it into a movie.
Really. Everything's settled.
You've got to believe me.
Tyler's death was hard on you.
Must be hard to accept.
I feel the same way.
Which is why we have to give him a really successful funeral.
We can't dishonor his faith in us!
Nor his trust.
I designed a sample invitation.
Internet CEOs and a real estate mogul are staying in this hotel...
...all dying to advertise with us.
But there wasn't any space left.
So I got inspired and added an insert.
Have a look. If it works, we should print it right away.
Not much time left.
You like it?
The reason I came here was to check on your condition.
If you were better,
I could take you home with me.
But the doctor says the treatment has been very conservative.
Pills, mostly.
With no sign of progress.
So he recommended...
...we try electroshock therapy.
Apparently, it's quite painful.
Afterwards, you'll pass out...
...and go into spasms.
Treatment would be once a day...
...for about 1 5 days.
If the results aren't promising, they'll try another round.
So the bastards finally got their dirty hands on me.
I must call Tyler! He's taking me to America! I want him to take me now!
Thank God!
You believe he's still alive?
I was faking.
What?!
I feared the advertisers coming after me.
But Louis isn't faking.
It feels good!
So there's this mental hospital...
...overcrowded with patients, all mentally retarded...
...and not enough nurses or doctors on staff.
The chief physician gets an idea:
Patients will supervise themselves.
Each floor will have a patient monitor.
But the floor monitor has to be minimally intelligent.
So the doctor goes to the first floor...
...holds up an apple, and asks:
"What's this?"
The patients all shake their heads.
Suddenly, one patient raises his hand. "I know!"
The doctor says, "Tell us!"
"An apple!"
"What's it for?" asks the doctor.
"Eating!"
The doctor says,
"You're the first floor monitor."
They're testing you. Don't screw up.
The doctor goes to the second floor.
He holds up a banana and asks:
"Who can tell me what this is?"
The patients all shake their heads.
But one patient raises his hand.
"A banana."
"And what's it for?"
"Eating."
"And how do you eat it?"
"Peel it!"
"Good!
You're the second floor monitor."
So the doctor goes to the third floor.
He takes out a... The thing with a horn-shaped speaker...
...and a handle you crank.
What it's called?
A gramophone!
You're the third floor monitor!
Cut!
This is perfect. The angel gets the last laugh. The movie ends here.
That's a very bad idea.
Movies should have romantic, sweet, lyrical endings.
Lucy's in love with Yo Yo.
We should see them in bed.
The scene starts with a kiss.
Then they disrobe each other.
- They embrace passionately. Yo Yo!
- In slow motion.
This is your movie, your story, your joke, the end. Okay?
- He said...
- I know.
Now. Stop. No good.
I. Lucy. Together.
Go to bed.
Long time kiss.
Music.
Stop.
- Very good.
- Very good!
Lucy, come here. Sit down.
How many times have you promised me you wouldn't argue with Uncle Tony?
Hey, do you like Yo Yo's ending?
Whatever I support, it's just a movie.
It has nothing to do with real life.
Do you love him?
Tell me the truth.
God. Tony was right.
This is the truth of the movie.
Hey, I'll do it Yo Yo's way.
It's just a movie.
It's all I got to give you.
I love him too.
What are you thinking?
Do I have to reveal all my secrets?
Fine, don't tell me.
I'd better tell you.
I was thinking:
Should I help with the necklace first...
...or touch your shoulders, to test your response?
Or, maybe just lift your face, gaze deeply into your eyes...
...and attack you like a wild animal?
Or, if everything has gone smoothly up to now...
...strike while the iron is hot, and do something I'll regret later?
Or, just take my time...
...and wait for a better harvest?
- Then I thought...
- What if I refuse?
- You'd do that?
- Don't know. Try your luck.
Then wish me luck!
Better do it from the front.
What are you doing?
Come on, guys.
I'm not gonna say cut until you kiss.
Cut.
Cut. 
Cut! 
Be cool! 
The Town is Quiet
Eat, eat, Ameline, my sweet
Get your vitamins and wheat
Drink your milk from the teat
To be pretty and neat
Eat, eat, Ameline, my sweet
To be a beauty...
I know where you've been.
When did you go?
What about your daughter's feed?
200? 300 francs?
I don't make that much a night.
Where d'you get the money?
Where?
Go on, get to bed.
We won't give in again.
We say that every time.
No scabs this time!
Dockers united!
Dockers united!
It's not over yet.
We're taking a break. Bosses need to piss too.
We'll make them give in!
All they've offered so far is 100,000 as redundancy pay.
Dockers united!
Well?
Beautiful.
It's a bit posh...
Not with 100 grand redundancy pay plus your loan.
It cost a lot then.
He bought it on credit.
Short term. 3,000 a month.
That's a lot.
What do you know?
How about the taxi permit?
Did old Rene get you one?
I told you so.
They're not easy to come by.
Rene can get you anything you want.
Did you work something out with him?
I got a bank loan at 8.9%.
That's 3,500 a month.
On top of the rest?
- What do you think of it?
- It's a beauty.
Double airbag, air-con, ABS brakes...
- Are those good brakes?
- Shut up, you know nothing.
Power steering too?
You need it on a tank like this.
- Want to drive it?
- No...
Why not?
We can't have lunch at two!
- Take the wheel.
- Really?
The old days...
Like before you left.
Dad driving, you up front, me in the back.
Like going away with the caravan.
Thirty years ago, fifteen or ten even, if you'd done that, dumping the strikers, I mean,
I'd have spat in your face.
But today, listen to what I say, Paul.
You were right.
What are they fighting for now?
Their own little perks.
And what the fuck do they do
- Jean!
- I said fuck and I mean fuck!
They all go and vote for the Far Right now!
Your dad's right.
You can adjust the wing mirrors from the inside.
This?
That locks the doors.
Watch this...
Jean!
- Need a hand?
- No!
You see what he's like now?
Have a rest. Enjoy it.
A rest? I'm bored stupid.
I can't do anything.
Sweep, wash the floor, shop...
Heaven does your laundry!
Tried doing crosswords?
You bet I have.
Crosswords, word-searches, coded words, scrambled words...
Every week,
I get the TV listings magazines.
The programmes are the same but the film reviews change.
I compare them.
It passes the time.
I must be dreaming.
Can I?
A beauty, isn't it?
A real beauty.
I've worked in these.
The seats are so soft.
I'm not screwing in there.
We needn't get all sloppy.
- It's my work tool.
- Who are you kidding?
It's my work tool too.
You've got a nerve, Ursula!
It was her last Sunday.
No, it wasn't me.
Tell her, Paul.
It was Emilie last Sunday.
Isn't she here?
She's over there.
I'm delighted you're here.
Have a good evening.
My dear fellow... Good evening.
It's good to see you.
Enjoy yourselves.
Are you well?
Good evening, Colonel.
Dear friends, good evening.
- How are you?
- Very well. Meet a friend...
How's Andre?
Andre's blooming.
He's always out at sea.
The lucky devil.
I wish I were in his shoes.
Me too...
- Have a good time.
- Thank you.
You must have been asked before...
Where does the path to those lovely breasts lie?
I hope I'm not shocking you, Ms...
Ameline.
I forget...
The girl they screw...
The girl they screw in line.
And I don't wear a bra.
So I suppose
I could lay my hands on...
Perhaps your wife's presence bothers you...
Not at all!
Are you jealous?
Far from it. I'd love to see you screw someone else occasionally.
With whomever you like but do it
Precisely.
Here we are, using catch phrases.
Heavy rain, a high wind, the world turns, crooked politicians, the cards are down...
It's all planned out.
Life is just one long repetition of the same old things.
You're over the hill at forty.
All we can hope for... is to get used to it.
The story's over, my dear.
There are no more stories to write or tell.
I'm leaving you, Yves.
We're here, see.
- You asked for it.
- Yes and no...
Now we're here, the driver will say, "72 francs. "
Is that right?
- Want a receipt?
- No.
Stop that!
Shut it!
C'mon, suck.
- Gimme my dough.
- Fuck you.
I'll waste you. My dough!
- Give it to him.
- He was almost there!
- Give it back.
- Fuck!
- Bitch!
- Out with you!
Bitch!
- Are you the father?
- What?
The father. Is it you?
Don't play the innocent.
It runs in the family.
Who is it then?
A local or a stranger.
I wouldn't grass even if I knew.
No one would fuck her uncovered.
Not with her reputation.
- As a slut?
- You said it.
Can't you love a slut?
No way!
I don't like sluts.
Go on, piss off!
Don't just sit there.
You cow!
You just lost me 150 francs!
What did her dad pay to fuck?
Bothering you, is it?
The double, 300.
Who is he?
Get off my back.
It's 300 for any guy.
Francois, come on.
Let's do Goldman's song.
Elise is playing the piano.
- Here's my hand.
- And here's mine.
This is your seat.
Vanessa's on percussion.
You're right here.
Let's go. You can hold my hand.
Mark the bark until it bleeds
Nail shut the doors
Imprison yourself
Live out dreams
By staying awake
Pray to the shadows
And walk so far
Even though I know
That it'll take time
Even though I write it down
In black and white
Where ever I go
Nothing erases
The thought of you
Sit down now, we have to start again.
Very nice. Sit down.
Start again.
It's not fair
It can't be right
It's like an insult
Whatever I do
I think of you
Why do I bleed?
I don't know why
Why do I bleed?
While you never cry
What are you after?
Abderahmane.
I can't hear. What did you say?
Remember me?
Francois!
Hold on!
Francois, come here.
Look, I'm working...
Abderahmane... prison, '98.
I was in the choir.
Give me 15 minutes.
I'll see you outside.
Okay.
Abderahmane...
You will wait?
Come here, Francois.
Hello.
You remember me now?
Of course I remember.
I got out three months ago.
I work at Grand Littoral.
- That's good.
- Yeah.
But...
I miss you.
I mean, I miss music.
- Did you sing before?
- Yeah.
I liked what we did there.
I learned a lot.
Seen your friends?
Yeah...
Old friends.
But they're fucking stuck in their rut.
Always the same tune, with the same beat.
It's like I haven't been away.
Fuck, I was gone nine months.
One guy slit his wrists.
Another pissed his pants every day.
I saw guys like bloody vegetables in front of the TV.
So...
If I hadn't met you...
How did you find me?
I asked round for Viviane Froment.
You knew my name?
Only natural.
I never knew yours.
There were twenty of us.
Besides, Abderahmane...
Why are you looking at him?
You know him?
You think he's the father?
- If it was him, you could tell.
- It's not that.
He isn't good-looking?
What?
I don't know.
I'm not telling you to sleep with him.
God job too!
Is he good-looking? Yes or no?
Well, he's not bad...
He's not my type.
- You don't like blacks.
- He's just not my type, okay!
What's your type? Pure French?
40% proof like dad?
- Ever slept with an Arab?
- No!
- Or a Chink?
- What is this?
Only ever white guys then?
So? If I was African,
I'd sleep with Africans.
And you wouldn't be hassling me.
Besides, in any case...
In any case,
I've only slept with those I loved.
Anyone else apart from dad?
Yes. Before him.
And since?
Have you cheated on him?
With guys at work?
At six in the morning, after a night spent boxing up all those fish, you don't want to sleep with anyone.
Don't make me cry.
I've never cheated on dad.
You should've dumped the jerk!
I'm sorry, honey.
I'm sorry.
How's your meat?
Nice here, isn't it?
It's convenient. You can do your shopping, see a film...
You can see a film before shopping.
Isn't that nice?
People don't go out now.
Want to go to the pictures?
I haven't been in ages.
Not with your dad.
He only liked action films and I like ones with a bit of romance.
Then you came along.
He wouldn't let his own mum have you.
We stopped going out.
He loved you so much
Sweetheart...
What's up?
You two look cute like that.
Don't you feel like leaving us?
Am I bothering you?
Cut it out. Take a walk, okay!
We're okay here. Look at the sky.
No! Cut it out now and go.
If I'm in the way...
- Hey, don't take it badly.
- It's okay, I'm going.
Have fun at least.
- What's up?
- Hi, Abder.
- Seen my sister?
- What's up?
Keep out of this, okay.
What's wrong? The fact he's French?
Keep out of it, she's my sister.
You fucking racist shit!
What did you call me?
- You'd beat up your own sister?
- It's not done.
You heard what you said?
"It's not done. "
My judge said that too.
You'd treat your sister the way the cops treat you?
Take that back right now!
Like fuck. You make me sick.
Problems?
It's the petrol.
There's no gauge but it must be.
I have what you need.
A while ago, with two pals and a pipe, we'd travel the world.
We were better organized then.
It never helped much.
We'd siphon off 100 gallons in three weeks.
We'd travel all over Europe.
There, a full tank.
Thank you very much.
Give it time to get there.
- Want me to start it up?
- It's okay.
You're drunk! Can't you hear?
- Has she had her feed?
- Shut her up.
Shut your fucking daughter up!
What's wrong?
Do I give a shit? All night like that.
I told you to shut her up!
Do something!
You've already hit the pastis!
This early?
All fucking night...
I almost strangled her.
So why didn't you?
You're as thick as she is.
- Was she here all night?
- She never stopped!
You know what to do.
Call the doctor.
No doctors! Is she sick?
Since when? What's she got?
She's no sicker than I am.
There Are no junkies here.
Asshole.
You don't scare me.
Call a doctor, I'll kill you.
Death would be nice.
Stupid cow...
Don't blame the dole.
You were working when she started.
Know how she pays for her doses?
You don't care.
It's like the baby.
How many times have you held her?
Is that the dole's fault too?
You were hungry.
Little Ameline, time to eat
To be swift and fleet
And a face so sweet...
It hurts, hmm?
It hurts.
We'll call the doctor and get something.
Don't worry...
There are no stories anymore, great or small.
If there's no story, how can there be an end?
It's not logical!
Come on, all of you.
All right.
One week... of Subutex.
It's not enough.
I'll have to see her after.
Is she on a methadone programme?
She tried it, then stopped without telling anyone.
I see...
You need someone between you and her.
That's not possible.
My husband...
I see...
We'll start off with Subutex.
How about to help you sleep?
Do you want tranquilizers?
Temesta...
Valium or something?
- No thanks, I'm all right.
- Really?
No, I'm fine.
You have to slip it under your tongue.
Yes, I know.
I have to get to work.
Dad isn't back but who cares...
The baby had a good feed.
She'll sleep till I get back.
Okay?
I don't believe it!
She shot up with this?!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Move!
Look at me! Wake up, Fiona!
Look at me!
Open your eyes!
Breathe!
Anyone here?
Anyone here?
Anyone here?
Coffee?
Please.
How about that coffee?
No, give me a brandy.
I'm a gran, you know.
You knew I had a daughter?
Yes. I was glad for you.
The baby's three months old, no father.
You're still married?
He's been on the dole three years.
I'm scared, Gerard.
Only natural.
Needles, drugs, Aids...
I can't stay like this.
I work nights at the fish market, look after the baby and my girl.
Won't eat, she's skinny.
I can't leave her like that.
She's too weak to go out.
She's in pain. You must help me.
Seen a doctor?
The tablets don't help.
She needs the drugs, Gerard.
She'll go mad otherwise.
I'm scared she'll do something stupid.
You must know a way of getting drugs.
I can't leave her like that.
I can't bear to see her suffer.
I have money.
Is that enough?
You can count on me.
- How much?
- What?
- The smack.
- What'd you mean?
- How much?
Tell your brother Gerard called.
I'll need seven doses, once a week.
I won't pay 800. I'll give him 500.
How can I put this?
We're the city's plastic surgeons in a way.
We remove any growths.
Old wrinkles are smoothed out to look young and alive.
With us, the city will change nature and even gender.
It's been a workers' city for centuries
All right...
Making this a city for tourism,
High-tech industry, advanced research, etc... that won't bring in work for people
They haven't been trained for new activities.
You can't stop globalization.
The people can't understand that
The Right fuels that misunderstanding.
I was at the site.
Just a few years ago,
I was full of life.
For a second today,
I still believed.
Maybe because of the people who see the Far Right as the answer.
I prefer poor people who vote Far Right to petty fools like you who claim to help them.
You no longer love me?
That's true.
In all your ideas, old and new, you disguise your craving for power as a passion for good causes.
The people are your fantasy.
Before, revolutionaries had every quality.
Nowadays, reactionaries have every vice.
The fantasy has adapted to the same order.
The order where you keep the power you've always had.
I still love you.
Still...
Again...
Fuck it!
How do you do it?
Hold the spoon over the candle and mix it with the syringe.
With the end of the needle.
Okay. Knock the needle against the spoon so as not to waste any.
Okay. Put the ball in the candle.
- In the spoon.
- Yes, in the spoon.
- Now siphon it up.
- From he ball?
Yes, siphon it up.
Now knock the syringe to clear the air bubble.
Okay, now push it up...
Now you put the tourniquet on me.
In the face of globalization, interbreeding, the deterioration of our culture, we wish to defend our regional identity, our national identity and European civilization.
Our Europe does not run to Turkey or to Morocco.
So, what do we mean by national preference?
I'll give you an example
I'll pick a lady, since there are a lot of you today.
One of the ladies here...
How about you there?
You, back there. Yes, you.
Thank you. May I ask you a question?
Are you married?
And you love your husband.
- Of course.
- That's good.
And you like other men too?
Yes, of course.
But you prefer your husband.
Well, we're the same.
It's not that we don't like foreigners.
We like foreigners but we prefer the French.
It's that simple.
My name is Sarkis Alexandrian.
I first learnt the piano in Georgia.
I'm performing here to earn the money to buy a piano.
Thank you for your help.
Have a good day.
What's up? Why are you here?
You won't be disappointed.
Coming right up.
Wanna sleep with me?
- Wanna sleep with me? 300...
- Piss off.
- 300 francs.
- Get lost.
- Come and sleep with me.
- Piss off, I said.
- You can sleep with me!
- Fucking slut! Piss off!
I don't believe it.
Come on, get up.
I'll take you home.
Come on.
I won't hurt you.
Don't you recognize me?
You don't recognize me?
I can't pay the fare.
I've finished. I'll drop you off.
I've finished for the day.
I leave the light on in case anyone's going my way.
It's not legal because my time's up but who cares
No... - Sit down.
Get in the back.
I'm more used to that.
Here, 300 francs, that's what you need, right?
Come on.
Take the bloody money.
It's not for sex.
I'm giving it to you.
I don't need it.
300 francs is a couple of fares.
And I had a good day today.
So 300 francs...
I wasn't always my own boss.
I was on the docks.
You only live once though.
The colleagues called me a scab and all the rest... but I took the redundancy pay.
In the end, one way or another... they got redundancy pay too.
They refused on principle... and to stand with the union and all.
You know... the worker's struggle, solidarity and so on...
That was fine for our parents.
I now the words though, better than a lot of people.
Even verses that not many people know.
We peasants, artisans and others
Enrolled amongst the sons of toil
Let's clam the earth for brothers
Drive the indolent from the soil
On our flesh for too long has fed the raven
We've too long been the vultures' prey
But now farewell to spirit craven
The dawn brings in a brighter day
And in English!
I don't know it in Inuit.
It must exist, Inuits work too.
Feeling better?
Time to eat, little Ameline
In times of famine, have you seen?
Time to eat, little Ameline
Even the wolf looks pale and lean
I'm a survivor.
My mother told me.
No one wanted me, especially my dad.
But she was too far gone so they kept me.
I was born.
But I don't owe my life to much.
I'm not much.
- Your mother told you that?
- She felt she had to.
It wasn't very clever of her.
You can't be against abortion.
Why not?
Women have fought for the right to choose.
One abortion for three births.
Doesn't that sicken you?
I've turned my back on my parent's ideas.
We don't spring from
Jupiter's thigh, Moses' balls,
Jesus' stigmata or even the Prophet's tears.
No God, no master...
We existed before God.
We're thousands of years old.
Our roots are buried far back in the distant past.
If they told the French that...
The blood in their veins, the race they belong too...
The myth of the Aryan race.
We're the people of the forest, of life.
Life, not death. Not abortion.
Seek out the forest in us and rediscover its meaning.
- You're following me?
- What do you think?
Why?
Why do you think?
You fancy me?
That's it.
It wasn't bad.
In any case, it was better than when you cook it.
You don't use enough fat.
The fat's what gives it flavour.
What are you doing?
Go on, get out!
I'll do the coffee and the dishes.
In the foul climes of power
The captains of industry ever cease in their attempts to lower
The wages of the free
- He's in shape.
- The hell he is.
He's a bundle of nerves.
It tires me to watch him.
I don't know...
I thought retirement would let us do things we never did.
Like what?
I don't know. He saps my energy.
If I was alone,
I'd be in a retirement home.
I see them on their buses.
A week in Corsica or Italy...
- What's stopping you two going?
- Your father!
He won't leave the house.
He'll get over it.
At his age, it's right now or it'll be too late.
I'm worried about you, Paul.
Aren't you sick of being alone?
Well, actually...
There may be some changes there.
Really? You've met someone?
- What's her name?
- Michale.
When do we get to met her?
What's she like?
Blonde, brunette?
Can I speak?
I met her... in my cab.
She'd broken down, in her car.
I gave her a lift home.
We've been together three months.
How old is she?
It's okay.
Not older than you?
No, it's okay.
She's 35, 38 or so...
- No spring chicken...
- So what? Am I?
Is she free?
- A widow.
- Very good.
Any children?
Yes but they've left home.
She had them young!
Yes, very young.
So the two of you are together.
Does she love you?
I want to see her.
I already like her!
Jean! Did you hear?
I'm sorry I gave you that money.
Sorry I gave it to you for nothing.
I can't pay you back.
It's not that.
Come in.
Everything looks good from up here.
Furniture, trees, houses, cars, plates, towels...
The world's in a bad way.
Marseilles is great from here.
Parents had a poster of a sunset.
The Caribbean.
But...
You don't need a poster.
Because... from here, the world looks happy.
You're right.
You always think you're smart, with an objective, neutral view.
So you think.
But you forget where you're looking at that view from.
You seem sad.
I am sad.
Why are you so formal?
Because...
Out of respect.
We view the world from different places, but we agree on things.
You're like calm music... soft and gentle... heard from afar... and that you want to hear closer to because it will never be louder.
Marseilles pride
Insulted pride
Before we die, we'll blow it sky high
Society's a hooker
I'm gonna make it beg
Marseilles pride
Insulted pride
No more cops
Pull out the stops
Blow them away
Rambo yipee-ai-ay
No more hassle,
We're gonna do battle
Keep away if you wanna see another day
Marseilles pride
Insulted pride
Deadly, huh?
It sucks.
C'mon, we're rap's Bruce Willis.
- It sucks.
- You wrote it!
How did you pay for the gear?
Car radios? Old ladies' purses?
We don't hurt them.
You used to do the same thing.
Let's say I'm a genie.
What's your wish?
I don't fucking know.
- To change society?
- Yeah.
Into what? A toad?
Come on, I'm waiting!
- Kill all cops.
- Okay they're dead.
Teachers too.
- We want a real studio.
- No sweat.
Big cars, success, chart-toppers!
- We'll blow Michael Jackson away.
- Cool it.
What about society?
You've changed nothing.
You take care of yourselves.
Momo, your mum's in her towerblock?
Your dad's on the dole?
Fuck, I didn't have time!
You could have got them a satellite dish.
Shit...
You're on the night rate at 2 p. m.
I'll have to book you.
Do me a favour.
I got pulled up last week.
Get confused.
I'll lose my taxi permit.
Is the bar open?
Not yet.
Not a bad car...
Fancy one yourself?
If I want to fall any lower... it won't be easy.
- Where are you heading?
- The Mercure.
- I can take you for 50 francs.
- Okay.
I have a cab. I'll carry your bags.
A long journey?
- You've come from Paris?
- Yes.
Michale couldn't come.
Her daughter's got appendicitis.
You came on foot?
Ameline's a funny name.
I found it in a book.
I don't have much time to read now but I used to.
All kinds of rubbish.
Books to make people dream.
Impossible but simple things.
Men and women in love, with happy endings.
I chose her name... Ameline.
As for her mother...
In the book, Ameline married an Arab prince who raised horses.
He had a harem.
But he fell in love with Ameline and threw the other women out.
That wasn't very nice for them.
But when you're happy you always hurt someone.
So Ameline went to live with the horses and her prince.
As for my Ameline...
I'd like her to have a good job in an office.
A warm, clean place... with lots of cool air in summer.
2,100 francs.
Where were you?
Are you hurt?
Who hurt you? Your taxi-driver?
- Get off my back. - What were you up to with him?
You slept with him?
Fiona won't say but you're cheating on me!
What do you care?
I knew it.
You'd let anyone shaft you!
I don't need this.
Hold on!
What are you up to? Let me see.
- Let go of me!
- Open your hand!
What's this? What is it?
- As if you didn't know!
- I don't!
You make me sick.
I make you sick?
You realise what you're doing?
I'm helping my daughter.
How can you do this?
You're poisoning her!
If the neighbours find out...
How can you afford it?
How many cab-drivers screw you?
Answer me! How many?
- He's the only one.
- So how can you afford it?
My money from work.
I'm not fucking stupid!
- This cost five grand!
- Oh come on...
It cost five grand. I'm not stupid.
300 a fix makes 2,100.
- The best.
- Cut the crap.
I read stuff.
A fix costs up to a grand.
This lot cost five grand.
Leave me alone! Piss off!
Have you touched my dole money?
Have you?
Take your three grand!
Take it and go!
We'll be better off without you!
The other day at my counter, there was this big African mama...
Fuck, 240 pounds of fat at least...
And they say they starve there.
Anyhow, I thought,
"I'll make that mama wait. "
She only wanted
200 from her savings.
There were French people behind.
I managed to get ten in before her.
- How?
- Cunning.
First, I asked for her papers and while she was searching her bag with her fat fingers,
She waited till I finished, holding her papers.
Then I made her fill out loads of forms.
- You were born here?
- Yes.
In this bed?
That's brilliant.
That's what counts, heritage...
I thought so.
You can sense the trees in the furniture.
As well as... the life of people who've lied here.
I can sense that too.
I sense the pain of the lumberjack who cut down the tree,
I sense the birds that nested in its leaves.
I sense your mother in pain, her legs spread... bellowing...
I sense her sweat, her fear, her blood...
How much do you want?
20,000 francs.
I can't do that.
I have authorization.
You need to call ahead for more than 10,000.
10,000 if you want.
All right, 10,000 then.
Forget it.
I'm sorry. Can we cancel it?
- You're sure?
- Yes, I made a mistake.
It's you...
What's up? Today isn't Sunday.
You've got problems?
No, I came to bring this back.
Money problems?
No, not with the cash I'm raking in.
Actually, I wanted to pay back what you lent me.
The authorisation means it's for you.
Yes, I know...
How about a coffee?
You owe 30 grand at least.
This month's installment.
So you need at least 50 grand.
Money isn't a problem, Paul.
You couldn't manage before, you won't manage now without your permit.
It's just a temporary loan.
You know why you can't manage?
You have a worker's mentality.
You simply can't help it.
If you don't pay me back...
I'll pay you back...
I helped for your dad.
Because of the Resistance when we were kids...
Times when there were no barriers between people.
Things like that mark a man.
You won't pay the money back.
Ever.
So I'd have to hurt you, Paul, hurt you badly.
Because of your dad, I can't.
I can't do that to him.
No, you were right.
Thanks. I mean it.
You were right, okay.
Was that Rene? What did he want?
What?
You've got worries?
Worries?
What are you talking about?
It's Paul!
Do your bloody crossword.
Listen, Jean...
I know you've retired now.
I know it's tough.
I'm doing my best.
But, right now, I've had enough.
I know Paul's in trouble.
I realise that... if Rene's calling you.
I don't know what kind of trouble.
But money's never far away from trouble.
In the green book, you'll find Paul's account number.
Abder! You coming?
Come to the beach.
- Where?
- Figuiares.
They're fascists there.
They've blocked access to the sea.
- Suits me.
- Get in front.
The little shits.
I'll fucking show you!
Cut it out, okay!
Not running, nigger?
Fuck...
Get up.
Fucking get up, Carl Lewis.
I'll make you run.
- What's wrong?
- Let's get out of here.
- What's up with him?
- Let's fucking go!
Before your eyes, your skin cold and grey
Before your body, this what I say
No more weapons, no more knives, no more gun-play
No more, no way
I'm lost on the road, lost every day
I feel no hate,
I'm too sick to slay
I'll never cry enough tears to bring you back someday
This pain's gonna haunt me till doomsday
But my fight goes on in a different way
No weapons, no knives, no gun-play
My words are what have to weigh
I'm gonna win my fight someday
I'll take every blow in the game and the replay
You're like fire in my veins, okay
And I swear on this day
Your body will never rot away
No, never rot away
Oh, shit!
I overslept.
Mr. Gallet... I didn't wake up.
Yes, it's Michale.
I didn't wake up.
No, listen...
It's never happened before.
It won't happen again.
Thank you, Mr. Gallet.
I can't go on.
Mum!
I can't go on.
Yes, sweetheart.
Mum!
Here I am.
Here I am. What is it?
You want to eat something?
You have to eat, you're too skinny.
Eat to pull through.
Mum...
I'm here...
I need a fix, mum.
It's too soon.
Mum, I need it. Please, mum!
- Later, before I go to work.
- I need it!
Mum, I need it!
Calm down...
Mum! Please!
Mum! Please!
- I can't give you more...
- I need it!
I only have enough for the week...
I can't, hone, I can't...
Later...
- I need it. Mum, don't go.
- Later.
Mum, don't go!
- I can't...
- Mum! Please! Come back!
I can't, sweetheart, I can't...
Mum, come back!
Mum, please!
Thanks...
Thanks, mum...
You're not eating.
Have some chicken.
Mum...
What were they all doing there?
A left-winger like Froment, say.
He was there too.
It's in the paper.
Why does he drink with that fascist bastard?
The national preference guy and all that shit.
And that Ameline Fronville, the right-wing senator's daughter...
She was there too.
I bet she hangs out with the Far Right too.
Imagine De Gaulle drinking with Hitler!
They all drink together these days!
They all agree, you see, on one thing that us lot are no more than a herd of animals.
It makes me sick.
It makes me sick.
I'll never vote again.
It's simple enough.
It's not a happy thought, believe me.
I'd never have believed... that I'd feel like this one day.
Gerard...
It's me.
I won't be coming. I don't need it.
She's dead.
I did...
It's horrible, Gerard...
Tell them the truth.
It happened three days ago but you were too shattered to react.
We won't tell anyone, okay?
Think of the baby.
She needs you.
I killed her mother
No way.
You didn't kill her.
She started killing herself long ago.
She'd have jumped off the roof ages ago without you.
Besides...
I've got some Orangina but it's a bit flat.
I'll get the police.
I'll go.
No, I'll go to the phone.
Don't the neighbours have a phone?
The neighbours?
Excuse me,
I'm looking for building D.
Over there.
Thank you.
What happened?
Drugs.
Michale and you...
Do you know her husband?
Me neither.
Things aren't going too well...
Did you know her daughter?
Me neither.
You're like me, you only know Michale.
Maybe you've known her... for a long time.
I haven't.
I don't have any kids.
I don't know...
Little Ameline...
I think that's her name, Ameline.
In a way, it's better her mother died now.
Later, she would have suffered.
She's still too tiny to realise.
Of course, it's better to have your mother all your life.
Well, all your life...
So to speak...
Are your parents alive?
My father and mother are.
I'm lucky.
I'll leave you now.
You know her better than I do, you're closer.
Stay.
You think so?
I'll stay then.
I'll stay if you think I should.
I'm staying.
She was 14, we'd grown up together.
She got pregnant.
We went to an old woman.
An "angel maker", they called her.
It was hell, blood everywhere.
Two days ago, I saw an anti-abortion demonstration.
That's why we never lived together, because of all that blood.
What's up with you?
C'mon, get out! Get out, motherfucker!
C'mon, what are you waiting for?
C'mon. What's up?
Shit, I'm really scared now.
I'm shaking in my shoes...
I'm sorry.
You can come out now.

THE CHILD I NEVER WAS
Google translation - please improve.
With notes and letters from Paul Moor's book "Jürgen Bartsch: Opfer und Täter".
I can not answer more questions.
A few years ago in 1967 or perhaps 68, could.
But today ...
Do not ask me why.
Perhaps in time
I have erased the details.
But that's okay.
After the first time, there was a respite.
I had a real attack and tried to stop him.
I used to pray.
I would have done anything for God to take me out of this shit.
That means a lot for a blessed boy of 15 years.
Langenberg, March 1962
He was convinced
God could free me ...
... of this obligation.
Then I killed the boy with a gas pistol.
The documents said the boy was missing and where her parents lived.
Last week I was there and waited outside the house.
Did you give yourself?
No idea.
Something drove me there.
You can let go of my guilt?
Only God can set you free and forgive your sins.
But give me absolution.
Only if you repent of your sins and want to compensate.
I do want.
Then must devote the rest of your life to charity.
But even more importantly, must surrender to police.
Asked by many books, but we could not find a solution.
I stopped going to church and to confession.
I said:
God forgive you if you surrender.
But I was very afraid. And could because I was hooked.
So he had to continue.
It took a while but ...
... happened again.
I found the second boy near Essen.
It was 3 years later, and it could lead car.
I followed him without him knowing.
It was a shame.
Took the wrong train and lost in Essen.
Then he found the police station.
I got out and wondered whether he should go.
He put one foot inside the door.
But change my mind and went.
He spoke after is about 100 meters away.
He has not eaten anything all day.
I still remember his happy face when I offered to help.
But I took him where he wanted to go.
I wanted to take him to the cave.
By the way I stopped in a forest.
So I forced myself that were left bare.
I gagged and tied.
And I placed her on the catwalk.
So I took him inside the cave.
Then strangled.
It was Werner Schmitz.
Good luck!
But a week after ... was ready again.
Want to win 20 frames?
You've spent a lot on me.
- It's not free, you'll have to earn it.
What should I do?
- I'm a detective, you see.
I do not like to hide my identity, but sometimes need anonymity.
See?
So I need someone to trust.
I thought you could be my messenger.
It's easy.
But I gotta be home by 7.30.
- I'll make sure not be late.
I promise.
Incredibly how unfortunate were those guys.
Would have run if he knew what the lock.
That was set incorrectly.
I could not know you had to lift the handle. So ...
... I had it.
Help!
Let me go. Help!
Shut up!
I said shut up!
Open your mouth.
Give me your hands.
Stay well and shut the fuck up.
Crap!
Not now.
Come on.
Amazing.
I drove for an hour before I could catch him.
I was so exhausted that could not do anything.
However, no remember doing anything.
If you masturbate, it would once or twice.
Not return until the next evening.
When I saw the body of Werner again ...
... I buried along with the Sams.
The decomposition was distressing.
Worms and insects repellents.
Although ...
... his back, buttocks and legs were unaffected.
This excited me.
Werner had a beautiful body.
I was happy with that appearance.
I always made sure not see your other hand
I figured that was undamaged.
When I had to bury
I thought what he did and there was more to come ...
... that was a good feeling.
I do not think about the poor worms.
It's wrong.
God, why are there such people?
What made before birth?
During these 6 years behind bars things have gone well with my parents.
Maybe because I'm a good boy now.
As it was around 9 or 10 years ...
I can not imagine be apart from them.
Nor do I imagine dead.
It is a totally unbearable.
I really like my parents.
I am happy when they come to visit.
To be honest,
15 minutes is enough, you know.
I do not like jail.
But it's better than them pestering me.
When we were together, we were always alone.
We were not able to say "I love you" to another.
Never did.
Life at home was very cold.
Papa Noel has bought gifts.
Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!
For me!
Do not want to sing carols first?
No, I'm older.
The murderers sing carols.
Enough to drive you crazy.
I thought I could forget everything bad in the afternoon.
But there was always an atmosphere and you knew it was becoming unbearable.
Thank you.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
- Thanks.
Well, coming or not?
Ok.
Now what?
We will not do anything now!
Want to see what we do?
Almost jumped out the window.
Why is there hell?
Why am I better off dead?
A murderer?
That can not be.
Today is a day like any other.
Like the TV show:
"Same procedure as last year, madam?"
"Like every year, James."
I can not imagine having better parents.
But he never showed me affection.
My parents never play with me.
Although I bought many toys.
I bought a game for more than one player.
I do not understand.
I do not understand that.
It's lack of consideration?
Now I get letters from my mother saying I can get what you want.
If I wanted a car would.
It will be his way of showing love ...
Do not know if putting in a home while I was young was the only solution they saw.
In theory, my mother
I could not care at all times.
What a joke.
When she dreamed, I sold or attacked me with a knife.
I do not think so.
You, idiot!
How often have I told you you to take your shoes off?
Nothing but trouble and dirt.
You do it on purpose.
That's it.
I just hope your father gets home.
But 5 minutes later everything was fine.
Come to hug me and kiss me.
Then he wondered why he was afraid.
And if someone insinuates ... could have been anything,
I better hide.
My mother always chose my clothes.
From my shorts to my shoes.
Who also come out.
Many kids were not right for me.
My schedule was very structured.
Afternoons with my teacher, some nights on the floor of my grandmother.
He had no home, no friends or companions.
I could not leave without my grandmother.
During 6 years, until I started school.
Supposedly by the traffic.
And that could mess.
So few people know that really was not his son.
Adoption contract ...
Son is not legitimate ...
Tuberculosis ...
Adoption ...
Legitimate child.
Father unknown.
The adopted child ...
First name ...
Gertrud, your mother
Bartsch Mom, if you prefer.
She could not have children, so we decided to adopt you.
It took a long time with all papers.
But then it was official.
And we were all very happy.
My father has never been that good.
In 20 years I have never spoken.
Not as played, not as a father.
I was all day in the shop so I did not need to care for your family.
... that day showed that had any soul.
And about 20 marks ...
... under the circumstances forget it this time.
I think not repeat it, okay?
With hindsight, the adoption was a great relief.
Because I thought, "Thank God who did not to have me."
What women and men do together was horrible for me.
Your father told me that you locked in the office.
What will become of you?
Were you thinking?
Rot.
You have everything you need.
Can return.
Do not be so brazen to your mother.
I will leave at 21.
- See if it's true.
First of all,
're too dumb to live elsewhere.
If you thought about leaving home ...
... I swear to be back in 2 days.
I knew I would not go at 21.
He had not enough confidence.
It would have been absurd.
I just needed my anger burst.
Hurry up and go to bed.
I do not want to be a man.
I want to be a boy.
Period.
I did not enjoy my work.
The butchers have to cut the bones well.
Accuracy between the head and snout.
I was happy with the cutting board on top.
As calves suck your hand.
Always take a look.
It was so unpleasant. Still, had no sexual tendencies for animals!
Could have prevented everything.
But ultimately, my poor conscience triumphed.
He was everything to me.
I would have inherited in a day.
To be honest,
I felt small and weak to work.
And now this crazy theory butcher.
What's that supposed to mean?
They are murderers of children.
No matter that would work,
If you were outside and not have this impulse.
Then I'm sure it would work with children.
It might have worked as a caregiver.
That was one of my greatest dreams.
Even with the sick, orphans, or kids that nobody wanted.
I mean, nobody should beat children.
Not required.
There is no need for it.
I like the artwork. as you can not be a good magician without being more impressed than the others.
Many are uncomfortable on stage.
Poer once started,
I felt very relaxed.
People are cold.
Not as close as in real life.
I can show something without them requesting an explanation.
Only now, in high school
I feel really safe.
I can not do anything wrong.
I stopped thinking would be a self-confident as others.
I knew ...
... that could not be part of society for my emotional problems.
Would deny that I was really happy.
Once I put sugar on the ledge of the window so that the stork brought us another child.
It did not work, what could I do?
... Now I prefer to be alone. as for any child, separation my parents was a nightmare.
You always think you do not want.
You have to have felt like doing that.
In homes of the boys
I was treated better than at home.
Although my friendship with the other is always fucked.
Always afraid of the new guys.
My knees used to shake it
I saw two guys who did not know.
In the warehouse there were hundreds.
Some seemed they could not expect to beat me.
Are you afraid, coward!
It was a horrible dream that you never want to repeat.
But for another reason, as if to go out.
Marienhausen was hell.
A Catholic hell, but no help.
Up to 6 am and aboluto silence.
Down the stairs in pairs.
Then to church to church.
At school in silence, and paired
There followed a break.
We could not speak until 10.
I'd say your number if you did something wrong.
And that was not difficult.
Who was it?
We have tried this.
Are you stupid?
You are the best.
So behave yourself now.
It is a privilege.
Understood?
Start again.
You could say if someone was late.
Never hit me when we were alone.
They realized.
I would offer this hell again with the same patience ...
... only through the solidarity of boys compared to the sadistic.
At such times, all were one.
Every day Father warned us Seidlitz not to break the Sixth Commandment.
Although this was the age, we were beginning to masturbate.
Many kids did.
I went to bed with another guy.
But it was very risky.
There was always someone awake
Someone might squeal.
I would have done if I had courage.
Hug ...
... feel his skin would have been more important than masturbate.
If you want a way to breed gay ...
... recommend Marienhausen.
It is normal to recognize them.
If your hands are wet, then you must be homosexual.
People who make those nasty things must be criminals.
And those delinquencies are almost as bad as murder.
St. Paul said it was a deadly disease.
In class, parent Seidlitz "admitted" he had to fight.
But, by God's wishes, would stick to Satan.
But the Lord was not willing camp on the Eiffel.
I would not let him shop, father.
His forehead is hot.
You do not look good.
You'll have to stay in bed, boy.
Thank you.
This will distract and speed your recovery.
Thank you.
Time to turn off the radio and sleep.
Give it back, my boy.
Put it there.
Feel better?
Not too bad.
Come and lie beside me.
Come on.
She hugged as you would any parent.
At first, I did not suspect anything.
So far no need names.
It was nothing compared to what he had done.
Then I turned around and grabbed my hand.
He said "up and down" as well ...
And then he did ...
... and he did.
I thought it had to do that while in a fever.
But like I said ...
... compared to what I did ... nothing happened.
Pretty funny.
While I have respect now.
It was not the typical pederast.
He was thin and tried to bring chocolate.
He played football with us. organized films and a parish fair for us.
Your sexual deviation not noticed, you know?
I would like to forget.
That is why I do not like to discuss this.
Talking about what happened to you.
It's harder to talk what you've done.
When it is on your body.
It is hard even for Jürgen Bartsch.
I had my first friend in Marienhausen.
Not because I was looking for but found that two solitary.
The friendship was forbidden.
The friendship was suspect.
Every day have a sexual bond.
With him again?
Do not try it!
Dirk Whit ...
Not a minute of rest!
-... I tried to monopolize.
You will be my death!
- If you looked away, I was angry.
If we argued, I felt awful.
In church, praying always we might get back together again.
Dirk loved ...
... without saying it.
And that was the problem.
What happens?
I am going, you coming?
Where?
I do not know, out of here.
I have money from my parents.
Come on, come on.
- Okay.
You're crazy!
You did it on purpose!
- You're crazy, just sleeping.
Get out.
Leave me alone.
Everything happened very fast.
There was no time to think.
Toss the train and die.
Then you will be able to defend themselves.
Then you can undress.
Then I realized something bad happened to me.
You must believe me!
Nobody was more shocked than me!
Only until they returned my sexual thoughts.
After a few hours
I became calm.
What I tried to do before ...
... I forgot.
He needed to be healed.
Because I'm sick, sick and sick again.
I discovered the cave when voli of Marienhausen.
I really loved it.
It was something I pursued.
And nobody else knew.
It was my kingdom.
It seemed the perfect place.
It was the best place to do it.
I thought, just say to some boy about the hidden gold, and will follow you.
I spend weeks trying.
Try to look around.
For the state and the Mt.
But it was not easy.
"Thank God", must say today.
I prefer male children ...
... that ordinary people.
Delgado, pretty face, dark hair, big eyes ...
No beard.
The beard off his charm.
I wondered if I should have hair.
Be fully developed or not?
I was very confused.
A figure was good enough.
But nothing of red hair.
Only black hair or dark.
Do not know why, but it inhibited the hair.
Had to have at least 8 years but not more than 14.
For me, a man was not a sexual object.
Lately, I've been dreaming to lie on the floor.
A boy going over me with his legs.
With his ass up.
Its parts hanging a bit ...
Then come down ...
 Puting his cock and eggs in my mouth.
It may sound strange, but would be a very emotional event.
I am not against a homosexual ...
I'm just normal ...
... normal is all I seek.
At 17, I became much worse.
So to be normal, I tried with women.
I went to Essen for whores.
But I'm not seduced.
Where are you, Jurgen?
- I'm coming!
Do not misunderstand me.
I have nothing against women.
But I see ...
... why men see it beautiful.
Happy Birthday, my boy!
All the best!
Good health and happiness.
You will always be a satisfaction to your parents!
Thank you, mother.
- I have a surprise for you.
Your father gave me this before going to work.
Congratulations!
And do not dawdle on the way!
Are you happy?
It is the first razor that had.
She used it at your age.
Well, no?
But other things are also good!
Do not forget, you have to go soon ...
When I had my first beard ...
... rejected this sign of masculinity.
Rather than a sign of masculinity but a sign of becoming an adult.
If you loved someone, as a boy to a girl be better to find the perfect victim.
Of course,
I should not hold back.
The momentum would go alone.
Two or three years ...
... I fell in love.
I could not help it either in prison.
Heintje was. boy famous Dutchman.
I heard it a few times on the radio.
I almost went crazy when I saw him in an interview.
Was so unattainable ...
... the desire was so great
I could not go anywhere.
Two days later tried to kill myself.
He was a hero to me.
He was a kid, for what they did
He did nothing.
They did it, see?
A child needs lots of love.
Not just their parents. but also from their peers.
His best friends.
People who saw Heintje by orphanages had to ask ...
... who is worse?
Heintje the 50 orphanages?
What happened to Jürg?
What Jürg?
-Jürg, from next door!
What am I supposed to do?
-Mr. Dell said he hit him in a cave ...
... You put him hand.
Is that true?
- Absolutely a lie!
He said he would go to the police.
Your father is trying to soften.
It is totally a lie!
What you did to that boy?
- He said it was nothing.
He would not complain about anything.
- He's lying.
We were playing.
Do you mean by "play"?
Play.
As stories of tuples.
I'll give the boy 20 marks.
From your wallet!
- Why there?
It's as good as admitting it, leave it ..
This will dissolve, and not I ruined his reputation.
Then improve your education.
It was always the same.
Looking back, it was fun.
They knew it was just adopted.
The police decided it was not child's play.
My parents did not suspect anything.
They even had to have suspected something was wrong with my sexuality.
Dime.
What happened?
Only undressed, that's all.
Not as bad as it seems.
I just wanted to see him naked.
If you want to know something, about girls and that ...
... you can ask me anytime.
Among men, you know.
No, forget it.
Maybe you're sick, Jürgen.
Not normal when it comes to sex.
Maybe you can do something.
Some doctors may be able to help.
Then, at trial, found who went to the Social Services for advice.
I did not think my behavior was normal.
But they assured him it was not unusual.
And that was it.
Before this started, it was pretty good and never need to invent excuses.
During that time
I was always accused of lying.
He said he was at the movies or that the bus broke down.
My parents were angry.
Do not believe me.
But it could prove.
Soon it did not matter how much I cried.
At school it got worse.
He was beaten almost daily.
I started stealing my grandmother.
I paid the school bully for protection.
After stealing some money from the store.
That in two or three years ...
... have been about 25,000 marks.
Most of it was me in taxis for kids.
And at the fair in the parish.
Or in my affairs,
Like George, for example.
I met him in the state.
I was extremely in love with him.
One day I decided
I could not wait any longer.
It was New Year.
Shut up now.
- Do not say anything.
Want money?
I'll give you 50 if you act dead.
It means that neither see nor hear anything.
No, that's nonsense. So what?
We will see from here.
And your mother?
This is what I have.
Ok.
Not yet that is a real kiss.
To learn what a real kiss need to have practiced.
I never had much practice.
In the following weeks and months
I became more aggressive with Georg.
He wanted more money.
But the price stayed at 50.
I have not found his memories.
It was just sexual gratification.
Nothing more, nothing less.
Humans are stupid enough to think a small gratificadion is better than none.
My pants were often wet.
It was always something there.
One member was always hard attractive.
My first orgasms were completely unbearable.
The paradise that must be it.
I masturbated and fantasized every night.
It was more a pain than a pleasure.
But he could not control.
I imagined a naked boy.
He would hit a lot that was nailed by force.
I told George to come to the field.
He said, "No, you'll lose it again."
I took it anyway as and forced him to be naked.
Then I had a bad idea.
I said I hit him 13 times.
Each stronger.
And if not, kill him.
Only was a bargain.
Or so I thought.
So I hit him, louder and louder.
I gave him a beating in the legs.
But not defended.
As I wanted.
But do not stop at 13.
I stopped when my hand started hurting me.
I swore I was sorry.
I, too, because ...
... I had liked it.
Otherwise he would not have returned.
Pretend that you're falling.
No wait, wait a minute.
Scream!
That was good.
At least six times.
We could kill kids, do you think?
I'll come home and find one.
We can take you to the cave and kill him.
I tried to find children but could not get any.
You know how it is.
After we will for a while, lost interest.
In truth, I wanted to involve Georg.
I even thought of killing him.
After admitting what he had done.
I used to think I could not do it alone.
About that time could not control my impulses.
Then I wanted to check with.
None of this was true.
You see, nothing.
Maybe if he found the body then I could have killed him.
Maybe not.
It is a great step before thinking about killing a boy.
At that age you can not imagine what it truly is.
It is like saying,
"I'm busy. I think I will kill someone."
It's not as simple as that.
You feel threatened.
Then try to repress.
But it is not normal.
As an attempt to prevent the inevitable.
Just have to.
You can not stop.
At first weeks tried to talk to boys.
Must have been 50 or 100.
I despaired when not working.
Sounds stupid but I felt my role was to continue looking.
And then it was time.
At first just wanted to strip and touch him.
After the massacre following the amputation.
First cut your stomach and remove the innards.
Nothing more than that!
Then, you would expect.
Instead of minutes, take all night.
I masturbate more than satisfied.
When I masturbate the victim was already dead.
And nearly as torn or whole.
The smell and touch was like a sexual desire for power.
During the event would have a one-hour orgasm.
I had enough.
It was terrible.
It's like ...
... You're physically exhausted ... and when everything is over ...
... thank God.
Langenberg, March 1966
They are scared and cry.
Otherwise I would not have aroused.
You can not defend.
But they must beg for mercy.
The adversary can only move when I say.
That's the downside.
With the small ...
... Wilfried.
I got what I never did before.
He was still alive,
...then strangled him.
The terrible thing happened ...
... but did not come from my soul.
For my soul never grew up like I did.
It went great and small.
I could not understand he wanted to be caught.
Now, subliminally
I thought it would be best.
As a predator to prey have died before taking a step back.
Homosexuality was not a problem.
I could control it at will.
But I could for to commit crimes.
My greatest wish would write a small book.
Maybe call it
"How to protect my child."
As soon as if he saw a boy. React.
I would warm my knees shakes.
Shroud ...
... and my heart speed up.
Sometimes I could not hold my breath.
If I freed would be afraid to fall again.
If a young boy in a swimsuit pass through the door now.
Possibly vomit.
I could not bear it would be very awkward for me.
Often thought that this can not be normal.
I thought everyone would be horrified.
But in the end, they would.
Then they all try to help.
I would like to apologize the boy is still alive.
God, what would seem?
Dieter was 14.
He looked younger.
And it was not my type.
But I could not find anyone else.
Idiot! Defend yourself!
-No.
No one can hear you scream here.
Come on, do not stop.
He really wanted to be kissed.
That was new, had never kissed.
It was only because he hit very hard.
What he preferred?
Kicking or hitting a kiss?
What, you get up?
- No, I can not.
What time is it?
I'm confused.
It's cold.
Can you give me some clothes?
Now I come.
You can leave a lighted candle?
I left because I had to go home.
To eat that disgusting soup we always had.
Before that
I had to deliver meat to the state.
I had to shower from 8.15 to 8.45.
While my mother washed thinking about what to ask the boy.
Now you will bind.
Take care of your hair!
It was a sad feeling.
Expecting a miracle, would return to the cave.
It was a Saturday.
On Monday I was back again.
I was arrested on Tuesday.
Now I'll show you a magic trick.
He agreed.
How do you like?
It was a great trick, no?
Jürgen Bartsch spent another 4 years
Rottland in high school in Eickelborn.
Instead of returning to society he married a nurse from Hanover.
Two years later, he called castration.
He participated in the OR on 28 April 1976 at age 29.
He died during surgery. by error of anesthesia.
{831}{869}Follow me, please.
{1040}{1120}Howard has sold our porcelain|to the American railways.
{1124}{1198}It will be hard|but l want to respect the deadline.
{1203}{1236}l'll see for the whiteware.
{1269}{1317}Stay late this e vening to do it.
{1321}{1335}Of course.
{1340}{1438}The y want a specific design too.|l think l know what the y mean.
{1445}{1486}Come with me, l'll show you.
{1614}{1639}Now then...
{1728}{1758}Give me that one.
{1784}{1821}This service was made
{1826}{1874}in 1875 for the Queen of Portugal.
{1878}{1910}One of our finest.
{1978}{2034}Similar to this but e ven more sober.
{2055}{2099}With this tone. Can it be done?
{2103}{2195}l think so. L'll ask Dubreuil.|He'll probably remember.
{2208}{2264}l especially want|this gre yish green...
{2274}{2322}Mr Vouzelles wishes to see you.
{2327}{2365}l'll see him at 11: 15.
{2369}{2460}Use a gold band like this.|Forget the one we're using now.
{2464}{2509}Your cousin|designed it to save mone y.
{2513}{2555}The customers don't like it.
{3829}{3878}l left you time to settle in.
{3882}{3932}When did you return to Limoges?
{3936}{3989}l live between Paris and here.
{3997}{4040}The new mayor sent for me.
{4044}{4107}You still write|for Socialist journals?
{4110}{4136}Yes, of course.
{4140}{4154}After you.
{4159}{4239}We haven't met in 20 years|but if l remember rightly,
{4243}{4322}the worker won't be forgotten|in this factory now.
{4516}{4571}This plate is made in Germany.
{4575}{4633}It's much cheaper. This is serious.
{4647}{4704}We risk losing the American market.
{4708}{4807}l have to build a new factory|with new methods and machines.
{4849}{4886}The workers come later.
{4890}{4928}It's always "later".
{4933}{4972}Have their lives|improved in 30 years?
{4982}{5058}Not a great deal.|l'm having housing built for them.
{5068}{5124}But if we shut down,|what will the y do?
{5129}{5232}l'd ne ver have called on old Barnery.|But you reason like he did.
{5310}{5355}Nothing can change in this office.
{5358}{5456}With a civil servant in my shoes,|it would be the same.
{5460}{5505}l must keep the factory going.
{5515}{5589}Does the factory's prosperity matter
{5593}{5641}if the workers barely scrape by?
{5679}{5734}l'm sure you deserve your salary,
{5752}{5807}but between Barnery's progress
{5811}{5867}and the conditions the y live in,
{5873}{5905}there's such a gulf.
{5924}{5965}A disastrous contradiction.
{5978}{6027}l'm afraid for you and for them.
{6035}{6089}Think of the riots here in 1905.
{6093}{6155}Everyone remembers|your uncle's contempt.
{6159}{6229}He wouldn't give an inch.|People died on the streets.
{6237}{6326}l won't negotiate|until the new factory is finished.
{6367}{6393}Look.
{6469}{6520}You know the site...
{6530}{6605}The production workshops here,|the kilns here...
{6617}{6686}Each kiln can bake|20,000 pieces at once.
{6690}{6755}The decoration workshops,|the whiteware stores...
{7205}{7256}Gently, Max. How did school go?
{7260}{7281}Fine.
{7428}{7470}- We'll have lunch now.|- Very good.
{7487}{7543}Stop drinking,|you'll ruin your appetite.
{7671}{7717}Why not let him serve us?
{7721}{7756}l prefer it this way.
{7784}{7831}Give me Max's plate.
{7854}{7914}A well-cooked piece|or he won't eat it.
{7943}{7978}The first slice...
{8094}{8133}l have to go to America.
{8160}{8246}l need to see Howard|and sort out the customs problems.
{8272}{8323}We may open a Toronto office too.
{8405}{8446}Will you be away long?
{8459}{8511}Two and a half months,|with the crossing.
{8622}{8649}Sit up straight!
{8974}{9053}You were too sharp with him.|Usually, you spoil him.
{9096}{9130}He takes advantage.
{9382}{9413}What are you doing?
{9552}{9593}l'm watching him go.
{9682}{9734}l think the rose bush may be dead.
{9779}{9826}That first frost was too hard.
{9830}{9868}No, l don't think so.
{9909}{9945}We'll see in the spring.
{10028}{10082}It's stopped raining. L'll go now.
{10494}{10541}This is my husband's library.
{10590}{10620}His papers...
{10662}{10706}Here, we mustn't touch a thing.
{10837}{10879}l knew you were in Limoges.
{10895}{10930}l haven't seen you at church.
{10950}{10984}l don't go often.
{10993}{11027}You haven't changed.
{11034}{11082}We must show the Catholics|we're here.
{11093}{11175}Show what? What we're not?
{11182}{11221}We are what we want to be.
{11310}{11353}l wanted to come sooner.
{11380}{11412}l understand.
{11430}{11462}You had to settle in...
{11479}{11511}No, it's not that.
{11587}{11632}l wanted to find you again.
{11677}{11715}You wrote to me in Switzerland.
{11765}{11828}- That was so long ago.|- But l haven't forgotten.
{11899}{11931}Neither have you.
{12027}{12058}It hurt me.
{12080}{12118}We judge those we love.
{12122}{12148}You understood!
{12191}{12225}Only you could.
{12229}{12322}No, l didn't understand.|l didn't understand what you did.
{12330}{12376}Didn't you need my friendship?
{12629}{12657}One last point...
{12675}{12748}The penalties inflicted on us|by the US Customs
{12753}{12839}following the campaign by|the American Potters' Association...
{12872}{12920}Our ambassador, Mr Jusserand,
{12947}{13016}has seen the Attorne y General|in New York
{13036}{13104}and l know from a reliable source
{13115}{13164}that he received a warm welcome.
{13175}{13253}There.|Thank you for coming, gentlemen.
{13417}{13525}l wasn't here when your wife|passed away. You received my letter?
{13530}{13554}Yes, thank you.
{13639}{13715}Does the political climate|worry you, sir?
{13723}{13774}How could one not worry?
{13796}{13837}Everyone talks of war.
{13841}{13905}- It's only a bluff.|- That's true...
{13933}{13995}l was struck by the words
{14001}{14098}that His Holiness, Pope Pius X,|recently said to his cardinals:
{14103}{14144}"France will be punished,
{14156}{14197}"but she will rise again."
{14712}{14752}That one there? Yes.
{14846}{14895}Lovely... l can see lots there.
{14903}{14989}If you put the ladder here,|l can pick them all.
{15186}{15218}Is it steady?
{15222}{15248}Go ahead.
{15439}{15513}Can you hold the basket?|That way l can...
{16112}{16151}Are you so pleased to see me?
{16166}{16202}You're home so early.
{16221}{16292}l was at the prefecture,|it was sunny...
{16343}{16379}l didn't want to go to work.
{16393}{16418}What was it like?
{16455}{16487}We talked about war.
{16672}{16712}You won't go to fight...
{16765}{16800}l'm a sergeant.
{16805}{16863}An old one|but a sergeant all the same.
{16910}{16943}It's not possible.
{17108}{17185}In Switzerland,|you used to jot down phrases.
{17210}{17251}Some of them were beautiful.
{17330}{17393}You don't write now,|you don't read...
{17397}{17455}- No time.|- It's a shame.
{17514}{17609}Are you afraid l'll lose my soul?|lt wasn't in those phrases.
{17634}{17697}So can you put|your soul in porcelain?
{17703}{17738}A little of it, yes.
{17764}{17829}Men put bits of their soul|into many things.
{17905}{17938}And women?
{17950}{17990}l pity women.
{18088}{18123}The y want love to provide.
{18180}{18219}But love isn't life itself...
{18235}{18334}A woman who has loved, in joy|and sorrow, finds the world empty.
{18397}{18441}She'll know nothing else.
{19506}{19560}It's war.
{19723}{19758}Wait for me.
{20844}{20917}THE IVORY SERVICE
{20994}{21021}Please...
{21068}{21110}Try to keep calm. There...
{21126}{21157}l want to know!
{21251}{21278}- Are you there?|- L'm here...
{21282}{21326}It hurts. Don't leave me.
{21330}{21358}l'm here.
{21363}{21412}Take deep breaths now...
{21537}{21579}Any news of your husband?
{21605}{21644}Not for a long time.
{21699}{21738}There's an offensive on.
{21788}{21870}We've gained ground.|Today's report is interesting.
{22011}{22081}l'm Fayet,|the solicitor in Barbazac.
{22086}{22129}l knew your husband well.
{22136}{22199}How is my son?|Can the y save his e ye?
{22267}{22299}l don't think so.
{22361}{22387}Doctor...
{22580}{22611}What's the matter?
{22704}{22747}This just came for you.
{22945}{22986}It's typewritten...
{23460}{23495}You open it.
{23809}{23873}He's well...|He's writing from an office.
{23881}{23919}He's leaving the Front.
{23956}{24019}He's going to be|an intelligence officer...
{24038}{24095}with an American division.
{25799}{25850}Did you have a good journe y?|Long?
{25869}{25914}The train stopped e verywhere.
{25931}{25973}You know Pierre Vouzelles.
{26053}{26086}Here l go...
{26204}{26244}It'll soon be over now.
{26464}{26482}Is Max well?
{26510}{26549}l've brought a photo.
{26564}{26597}You've put on weight.
{26609}{26657}It's padding, a thick vest.
{26681}{26740}Wait a second|while l see the colonel.
{26918}{26955}What a handsome omelette!
{26959}{27016}- Fresh eggs.|- Thank you, Madame Julien.
{27380}{27422}You haven't written much.
{27439}{27480}Were you on the front line?
{27502}{27579}Losses are heavy.|The regiment's disbanded.
{27636}{27672}Have you moved forward?
{27697}{27731}Yes... l don't know.
{27765}{27802}We've changed places.
{27857}{27911}l don't read the papers like you do.
{27988}{28065}Remember Paul Giri, Edouard's son?
{28090}{28145}His wife works with me. He's dead.
{29483}{29511}You're leaving?
{29542}{29579}l'll be back at four.
{29689}{29716}Here's the ke y.
{29754}{29803}Take a walk along the river.
{30797}{30827}Come and see.
{30853}{30907}Why are all these frames ready
{30911}{30977}when this side is running behind?
{31005}{31079}Yes, l know|but you must work something out.
{31082}{31126}Don't forget your meeting.
{31129}{31152}Yes, all right.
{31159}{31234}Sautard, l read your report|on oil-fired kilns.
{31238}{31316}We'll demolish these.|You have a free hand.
{31320}{31374}Those kilns are hard to control.
{31378}{31429}- A mere detail.|- We ought to wait.
{31439}{31525}There are new electric kilns.|Let's not be too hasty.
{31545}{31605}Oil kilns will reduce the workforce.
{31609}{31672}We must catch up|with our competitors.
{31681}{31748}Do it before l go to America|for three months.
{32098}{32125}Hello, Solange.
{32136}{32213}It's an honour to see you.|Did you have a nice walk?
{32247}{32280}She's avoiding us.
{32296}{32351}You'll see, we're not that boring.
{32380}{32415}l'm absolutely parched.
{32451}{32488}What have you been doing?
{32503}{32552}Nothing. It's been a lovely day.
{32574}{32630}Louise is expecting a visit.|Patience!
{32679}{32732}Have you heard|from your husband?
{33006}{33032}Well, have you?
{33056}{33161}l won't wait for his letters,|to see if the y're loving enough.
{33191}{33237}He came back altered from the war.
{33246}{33283}And left again quickly.
{33288}{33348}Mr René Fayet is waiting outside.
{33559}{33600}Do you know René Fayet?
{33628}{33674}l looked after him during the war.
{33688}{33763}l hardly see him here.|He's in the woods all day.
{33769}{33806}Not all day...
{33827}{33888}How can a one-e yed boy|aim a rifle?
{34031}{34076}No hunting today?
{34080}{34149}No, nothing.|Just tennis with Louise later.
{34173}{34231}- May l walk with you?|- Of course.
{34244}{34296}l remember you in Barbazac,|madame.
{34348}{34373}Madame...
{34434}{34474}You were a child.
{34483}{34535}There's no difference|between us now.
{34541}{34570}Oh, there is...
{34634}{34679}Have you left Barbazac?
{34686}{34767}l live in Paris.|Louise invites me here in summer.
{34895}{34946}Will you succeed your father?
{34949}{35015}No, l'm at business school.
{35034}{35087}- What do you want to sell?|- Porcelain.
{35091}{35152}Really? Whose porcelain?
{35156}{35222}Yours.|l've visited your Limoges factory.
{35231}{35287}There are some horrible items...
{35302}{35379}But the best ones|deserve to be better known.
{35387}{35430}l'd like to open an outlet.
{35499}{35574}l'll speak to my husband|when he gets back.
{36009}{36052}The y're from Saintonge.
{36087}{36125}Good, aren't the y?
{36228}{36257}l was thinking...
{36273}{36331}Girls of today must scandalise you.
{36412}{36437}Why?
{36441}{36501}You were raised differently|in Barbazac.
{36522}{36557}In such a limited way.
{36593}{36658}But love may be impossible|without that.
{36681}{36720}You were raised for love?
{36759}{36812}It was forbidden,|which means the same.
{36862}{36944}l feel that love...|must be imagined first.
{36980}{37042}Like a religion settling|in a young heart.
{37067}{37155}Amorous women are rare.|The times don't change that.
{37209}{37265}- Where are you going now?|- To Joncherolles.
{37276}{37330}- L'll cut through the woods.|- The woods?
{37336}{37382}- Do you know the paths?|- No.
{37393}{37426}You'll lose your way.
{37430}{37486}- L'll soon see.|- Be reasonable...
{37515}{37563}Show me a path then.
{37586}{37677}Oh, no, l forgot,|you have to play tennis with Louise.
{37681}{37701}Aren't you tired?
{37708}{37752}No. Are you?
{37755}{37798}- No.|- Are you in a hurry?
{37804}{37826}No...
{37943}{37983}The y're expecting me.
{37987}{38055}No, the y aren't...|You went out for the day.
{38067}{38110}It's lucky that l saved you.
{38802}{38876}l was going to a talk|but l think l'll stay in.
{38880}{38915}It doesn't matter.
{38919}{38999}l can't take it.|l'm having palpitations, l panic...
{39008}{39061}- It must be my heart.|- Of course not.
{39142}{39166}Is it about Jean?
{39175}{39195}Not at all.
{39215}{39249}You had me worried...
{39262}{39289}It's about Aline.
{39296}{39333}Why? She isn't ill.
{39337}{39402}You should keep|a closer e ye on her.
{39494}{39538}l don't know what you mean.
{39544}{39577}l set a good example.
{39583}{39621}She goes out a lot.
{39642}{39699}People see her e verywhere, at night.
{39703}{39733}What people?
{39750}{39797}My children saw her|at Montparnasse.
{39802}{39819}Your children...
{39832}{39924}The y work, you know,|the y have a right to a little fun.
{39935}{39986}l can't force her to stay at home...
{40016}{40064}subjecting her to my suffering.
{40068}{40127}Why does it always have to be you?
{40167}{40219}- Are you responsible?|- Responsible?
{40229}{40285}Is it my fault she had no family?
{40295}{40351}She's young, l can't lock her away.
{40394}{40477}She used to come to dinner.|l know she's a good child.
{40482}{40561}You don't know her.|l can't do a thing with her!
{40571}{40652}She's a heartless, lying idler|who just wants to have fun.
{40666}{40720}If her home was more pleasant...
{40728}{40799}Pleasant...|You have no idea, you poor thing.
{40811}{40849}l'd better go.
{40865}{40941}l have to get|my granddaughters' tea for them.
{40945}{40973}You do that too?
{40977}{41015}Yes, l don't have a maid.
{41171}{41235}l could have raised|a daughter normally,
{41244}{41286}helped by a father,
{41291}{41347}like any woman|with a decent husband...
{41417}{41440}Jean!
{41486}{41534}l had such an idea of him...
{41662}{41689}l'm still here.
{41794}{41833}Let's go to the bar.
{41880}{41933}l'll call you|when your table's ready.
{42054}{42097}Two glasses of champagne.
{42248}{42299}- Aline Barnery?|- In person.
{42348}{42375}Recognise me?
{42417}{42502}l recognise you...|You're Dominique Chambon.
{42541}{42594}We were at the Protestant school|together.
{42605}{42625}This way, please.
{42717}{42749}Let's meet.
{42808}{42849}Come for tea on Tuesday.
{42859}{42897}6, Rond-Point de Longchamp.
{43660}{43697}Good e vening, mother.
{43701}{43730}Where were you?
{43739}{43760}Still up?
{43774}{43830}l spend my life tidying this place.
{43878}{43914}l want you home earlier.
{43918}{43959}l'll come home when l like!
{44161}{44202}- Was it fun at least?|- No.
{44249}{44303}What have l done wrong?|Tell me!
{44307}{44319}Nothing!
{44425}{44445}Listen to me.
{44469}{44509}l understand. L'm like you.
{44516}{44585}It's not because your father|abandoned us that...
{44652}{44703}Don't think all men are like him.
{44886}{44932}l wondered whom l'd find here.
{44942}{45002}The schoolgirl|or the Montparnasse woman.
{45013}{45045}l don't know.
{45104}{45140}Neither one nor the other.
{45325}{45402}- You haven't changed.|- Yes, l have, completely.
{45410}{45459}Things used to be so different.
{45465}{45516}We all used to laugh so much.
{45555}{45574}You remember?
{45599}{45687}Do l remember?|lt was my last easy year.
{45708}{45743}l had friends.
{45761}{45778}Yes.
{45807}{45835}l didn't like them.
{45863}{45884}Why?
{45891}{45927}l was all alone.
{45953}{45996}No one bothered about me.
{46029}{46071}But l enjoyed admiring you.
{46103}{46134}And now we meet again.
{46208}{46245}Would you like a cigarette?
{46263}{46300}The y're my only luxury.
{46520}{46581}My father died|that last year at school.
{46599}{46634}l didn't know.
{46656}{46740}My brother was killed in the war.|l ended up alone.
{46793}{46817}And now?
{46848}{46901}Too much is missing in my life.
{46947}{47001}l can't complain. L love my work.
{47066}{47095}In that case, no...
{47129}{47164}You can't complain.
{47761}{47839}You first mentioned this factory|ten years ago.
{47857}{47893}It's taken you a while.
{47924}{47989}The war came along...|and then l hesitated.
{48004}{48036}You hesitated?
{48048}{48125}Either my mind wasn't on work|or l'd rush into things.
{48139}{48220}You have to keep track|of new inventions all the time.
{48297}{48358}- This factory's costly.|- Very costly.
{48362}{48409}And you're still using the old one.
{48444}{48483}When the y're not on strike.
{48509}{48572}You should give them|the raise the y want.
{48576}{48607}l have, twice.
{48610}{48665}The y earn less than before the war.
{48669}{48746}l can't give in,|l need to build up whiteware stocks.
{48750}{48787}Stocks? What for?
{48810}{48837}At a time like this?
{48841}{48900}A German worker makes|1,800 cups a day.
{48904}{48963}Now the Japanese|with their ridiculous wages...
{48967}{49019}And you think the union is wrong
{49032}{49074}to resist this absurd contest?
{49081}{49121}The union can't rule the world.
{49125}{49171}What is it you want?
{49186}{49249}Local workers making|1,800 cups a day?
{49254}{49274}Why not 3,000?
{49403}{49477}Do you remember that castle|in the war that had...
{49495}{49529}only its cellars left?
{49587}{49616}It stank of rats.
{49629}{49716}Pontet told me that|e ven the cellars went in the end.
{49725}{49749}Pontet?
{49787}{49861}That's impossible.|He died at Soupir.
{49868}{49892}Oh, yes...
{49957}{49999}It must have been Latie.
{50011}{50073}He's the only one left|apart from us.
{50130}{50187}Yes, it was Latie.|Have you seen him?
{50372}{50434}The y weren't supposed|to be picketing!
{50448}{50462}Surprised?
{50820}{50867}Why don't the y open the gates?
{50981}{50995}Drive!
{51347}{51376}l wanted you to see this.
{51415}{51469}Our brand-new celadon service.
{51485}{51580}The Song Chinese made it but|ne ver used a mass-coloured paste.
{51602}{51657}That's what gives it...
{51686}{51719}this full moon glow.
{51939}{51987}It isn't drab, is it?
{51994}{52043}It's very beautiful.
{52048}{52107}Because it's made|in complex conditions.
{52111}{52175}Just a few degrees more|can kill the hue.
{52232}{52283}Do people still care these days?
{52296}{52343}l'm determined to think the y do.
{52350}{52408}It took a year and a half|to perfect.
{52453}{52537}In any case, the y've ne ver made|finer porcelain here.
{52830}{52850}This must end.
{52855}{52884}The y'll ne ver give in.
{52900}{52922}l'll negotiate.
{52930}{52985}l can see the union secretary.
{52998}{53076}You can't build a factory and stock|and raise pay.
{53080}{53121}No, we need stock.
{53124}{53185}The coming crisis|could last two years.
{53192}{53230}Give up the new factory.
{53234}{53283}You know l can't! We need it.
{53574}{53629}Look... What do you think?
{53805}{53843}Is this Max's book?
{53850}{53897}- Has he gone out?|- Yes.
{53916}{53960}With his friend Audousset.
{53997}{54042}l'm not too keen on that boy.
{54062}{54112}He can choose his own friends.
{54199}{54234}It's pretty, isn't it?
{54330}{54364}Where have you been?
{54425}{54466}l was out visiting.
{54634}{54686}You were interested|in porcelain once.
{54768}{54792}Once?
{54799}{54834}You'd ask questions.
{54898}{54980}You didn't understand|but noted my answers anyway.
{54996}{55043}- You learnt them by heart.|- L did?
{55074}{55126}l thought it was for a friend.
{55135}{55163}l have no friends.
{55167}{55243}You had friends at Joncherolles.|It's only natural.
{55259}{55276}Children.
{55291}{55341}Children and young people.
{55372}{55399}Listen, Jean.
{55467}{55507}You were hardly around.
{55546}{55600}l felt that you couldn't see me.
{55676}{55709}You were so inattentive.
{55746}{55825}Because of the war perhaps,|from being with men...
{55973}{56036}l don't remember|the man l was then...
{56209}{56279}It's odd having been a man|you don't remember.
{56296}{56347}It happens|once or twice in a lifetime.
{56479}{56536}You're right, l was inattentive.
{56624}{56666}l had become inhuman.
{56713}{56758}You had abandoned me, Jean.
{56824}{56894}You were cold... Unrecognisable...
{56924}{56963}And you were on holiday.
{56981}{57030}l'd like a holiday with you.
{57072}{57144}l'd like to travel,|l'd like to leave Limoges.
{57157}{57183}With the factory...
{57187}{57242}It's always the factory! Always!
{57251}{57309}Everyone is furious.|Guy won't see me.
{57313}{57362}l dare not e ven visit Louise.
{57366}{57407}Do you know what the y say?
{57411}{57465}That you're lowering dividends
{57468}{57515}to fund your crazy schemes!
{57755}{57806}l went to see that striker's wife.
{57878}{57966}l felt such terrible hatred.
{58061}{58091}Know how the y live?
{58168}{58207}And what's it all for?
{58224}{58272}Is it really that heroic?
{58313}{58367}l don't know|what you're doing anymore.
{58374}{58415}It's true, l feel worn out.
{58441}{58479}Let's go away then.
{58586}{58637}You're not made for this.
{58693}{58735}True industrialists feel nothing.
{58759}{58803}l'll ne ver leave the factory.
{58812}{58832}Even old?
{58842}{58866}Ne ver.
{58897}{58929}That's a pity.
{58973}{59043}Old people must have so much|to tell each other.
{59136}{59181}Or perhaps it's too late.
{59197}{59278}We walked here four years ago.|You told me,
{59282}{59340}"l hate taking walks"|and we went back.
{59436}{59478}You were in love with a young man.
{59602}{59682}l accepted it.|Your happiness was what counted.
{59738}{59778}What happiness without you?
{59878}{59918}l felt no sorrow.
{59968}{60047}You were drawn to youth,|it seemed innocent to me.
{60115}{60196}The man you love|is too close to you.
{60224}{60271}He smothers you, he tires you.
{60276}{60324}Could l e ver love another man?
{60328}{60380}No, it wasn't him you loved.
{60384}{60437}It was your own youth,|your independence.
{60588}{60637}Nothing happened with René.
{60666}{60684}Almost nothing.
{60695}{60744}"Almost nothing".|Yes, l thought so.
{60794}{60823}What is it?
{60834}{60867}l'm looking at you.
{60952}{61010}You're right,|we'll almost be old soon.
{61078}{61144}Even you have wrinkles|around your e yes.
{61187}{61239}l have to look closely to spot them.
{61249}{61294}The y don't seem to be part of you.
{61404}{61458}We don't often have days like this.
{62216}{62261}This way, Mr Pommerel.
{62678}{62710}Thank you, Emmanuel.
{62789}{62872}You promised not to be late.|Re verend Sabatier's here.
{62876}{62891}Who?
{62894}{62963}Re verend Sabatier, from Paris...
{63085}{63116}My dear fellow...
{63251}{63279}Re verend...
{63321}{63371}- L'm sorry l'm late.|- L understand.
{63561}{63635}The y have cups like these|at Joncherolles.
{63646}{63682}Remember, Fé lix?
{63754}{63851}It's the latest Barnery service,|celadon.
{63892}{63965}Look, Mr Sabatier,|see how fine it is...
{63989}{64035}The sea-water hue...
{64191}{64247}l must admit|Jean Barnery has taste.
{64256}{64295}In our different fields,
{64299}{64381}we both strive to maintain quality|at all costs.
{64413}{64465}l'm very fond of Mrs Jean Barnery.
{64470}{64511}l see her in Limoges.
{64532}{64636}l know Mrs Jean Barnery but...|not the woman you're referring to.
{64777}{64839}The y say the daughter|leads a dissipated life.
{64850}{64950}That's all in the past now.|l often see Aline.
{65042}{65091}Please excuse me, l must be going.
{65326}{65399}Why did you say that?|You know he knows Nathalie.
{65403}{65478}l didn't start.|Besides, l like Pauline.
{65482}{65557}Men ne ver notice anything.|We shocked him.
{65572}{65656}l don't want the unpleasant business|mentioned again.
{65748}{65772}My dear,
{65777}{65856}if Jean Barnery left Nathalie,|he had his reasons.
{65874}{65895}Yes.
{65947}{65999}Apparently, she was unbearable.
{66011}{66082}Before Barnery, in our world,|were there
{66085}{66142}unbearable people?|Did the y divorce?
{66151}{66217}You can't fake|a romantic comedy all your life.
{66222}{66284}Other people's happiness|is my re venge.
{66288}{66322}What happiness?
{66325}{66414}You must side with your husband|or your wife for good.
{66443}{66511}Do you think life with Arthur|has always been easy?
{66622}{66702}It's not right|to keep changing one's mind,
{66706}{66755}causing trouble all around...
{66769}{66876}Jean Barnery takes a wife,|sends her away, takes her back...
{66883}{66942}He acts the pauper,|gives her his mone y...
{66946}{67046}Now he's an industrialist and|still sure of his moral superiority.
{67086}{67143}He's a show-off,|like all the Barnerys.
{67196}{67223}Pass...
{67237}{67272}- One diamond.|- Pass.
{67276}{67312}- One heart.|- One no trumps.
{67317}{67336}Pass.
{67436}{67500}l heard enough as a girl|about Robert Barnery,
{67504}{67577}his genius and taste...|Any rich man can buy tanagras.
{67629}{67683}But not necessarily|choose them well.
{67694}{67802}Limoges porcelain may not be that|beautiful. Some say it's hideous.
{67939}{67999}Limoges, November 4, 1929...
{68024}{68131}Dear Vouzelles, thank you|for your letter and your loyalty.
{68154}{68213}l had seen this world crisis coming,
{68234}{68321}but now its here, l don't recognise|the danger l feared.
{68372}{68421}The American market has collapsed.
{68465}{68541}l shut the new factory|before it was used
{68555}{68601}and withdrew to the old one.
{68662}{68759}l've had to lay off more workers.|You know l did it reluctantly.
{68990}{69022}l'm here about Aline.
{69046}{69071}Sit down.
{69196}{69231}She's taking her vows?
{69250}{69309}Yes, she's going to be a deaconess.
{69320}{69343}But...
{69389}{69444}Did she decide of her own free will?
{69448}{69483}Yes, entirely.
{69494}{69527}She wasn't forced?
{69551}{69597}There's been no intervention?
{69622}{69649}Or sorrow?
{69659}{69707}She's known great sorrow.
{69729}{69783}She had a friend called Dominique.
{69821}{69867}The y saw each other e very day.
{69874}{69954}And then the young woman died|last year.
{69989}{70061}A painful death.|Aline was with her to the end.
{70065}{70131}Then she decided|to work for God and the sick.
{70143}{70209}There's no other reason?|You're sure?
{70271}{70308}How can l put it...
{70366}{70408}Something to do with me?
{70435}{70498}She doesn't bear a grudge|against you.
{70532}{70554}l want to see her.
{70574}{70609}Leave her in peace.
{70666}{70701}It's for the best.
{70822}{70875}Is business improving in Limoges?
{70886}{70923}No, not at all.
{70946}{70993}l use three kilns out of twenty.
{71019}{71095}But l hope to go on giving Nathalie|the same amount.
{71112}{71184}l came to Paris|to close down our outlet here.
{71266}{71333}l'm cutting back.|And l'll bide my time.
{73258}{73286}Aline Barnery...
{73483}{73579}Do you feel yourself imbued|with such gratitude to your God
{73594}{73681}that you wish to join|the deaconesses and de vote to Him
{73700}{73784}your body and your mind|that belong to Him?
{73823}{73880}Yes, by the grace of God.
{73905}{73943}Aline Barnery,
{73970}{74031}do you feel ready to accept
{74035}{74128}the title of deaconess|and the obligations that it entails,
{74138}{74237}to serve God and the poor|according to the rules of the order,
{74253}{74308}under the Council's instructions
{74319}{74383}where ver and howe ver
{74387}{74452}it sees fit to employ you?
{74476}{74535}Yes, by the grace of God.
{74939}{75022}Merciful Father, Christ our Saviour,
{75030}{75079}fill her with Your grace
{75098}{75162}through which past sins are erased
{75176}{75236}and all things are made new again.
{76028}{76074}She's happy this way, you know.
{76174}{76208}Where will she go?
{76298}{76335}l don't know.
{76418}{76472}Deaconesses go where the y're sent.
{77130}{77176}Shall l tell her you were here?
{77554}{77584}Good-bye, Jean.
{78202}{78241}l'm burning our old letters.
{78261}{78286}All of them?
{78293}{78353}Yes. Does it upset you?
{78429}{78462}We're not like that now.
{78678}{78785}The factory can last two more years|on our stocks. Three maybe.
{78859}{78895}See what we risk after.
{78906}{78925}Yes.
{78968}{79061}If we stopped now, we'd save|something before being ruined.
{79073}{79119}While there's still a chance?
{79141}{79168}A chance...
{79245}{79291}It's not up to us to decide.
{79370}{79415}Or we change our methods.
{79439}{79492}Make corner shop china like others.
{79496}{79579}The others make that stuff|perfectly well.
{79643}{79708}If Barnery no longer makes Barnery,
{79720}{79760}it's not worth going on.
{79765}{79808}The market isn't there now.
{79829}{79855}There's France.
{79909}{79951}What about the ivory porcelain?
{79972}{79988}What about it?
{79992}{80046}It's more beautiful|than the celadon.
{80151}{80197}Make it for the French market.
{80238}{80272}Forget about America.
{80286}{80328}It's not perfect yet.
{80341}{80423}We managed to make a few pieces|but l gave up on it.
{80433}{80534}Is it reasonable to keep on making|such costly tests?
{80545}{80603}Just to obtain|a slightly rarer hue...
{80607}{80661}Not only a rarer hue...
{80690}{80721}It's something unique.
{80734}{80828}l had designed a shape...|It's ne ver been done before.
{80862}{80926}A plate like a bowl without sides.
{80955}{81055}The first one was as flat|as a pancake so l raised the rim.
{81079}{81156}Then we made a groove|in the centre, see...
{81172}{81201}with a slight indent.
{81223}{81278}The plate immediately came to life.
{81337}{81389}But then other problems took over.
{81535}{81582}This is what you must work on.
{82346}{82393}Dyeing the paste won't work.
{82481}{82516}Let's try something else.
{82599}{82659}The glaze must be coloured|before dipping.
{82852}{82880}Let's colour the glaze.
{82961}{82991}Hello, father.
{83064}{83121}You look well.|How was your holiday?
{83125}{83174}Excellent. L skied a lot.
{83200}{83256}- Are you staying?|- A week.
{83268}{83299}Mother will be sad.
{83327}{83369}She wishes you'd join the firm.
{83393}{83427}Have you lowered costs?
{83440}{83484}No, l've laid many people off.
{83499}{83541}The small factories are lucky.
{83559}{83635}In prosperous times,|large firms crush small ones.
{83646}{83676}Not in a recession.
{83718}{83743}But perhaps...
{83747}{83809}competition isn't|a universal solution.
{83835}{83885}Competition built Barnery.
{83897}{83935}And now it can destroy us.
{83983}{84044}If we replace|the principles you oppose,
{84049}{84104}no one will need luxury goods.
{84116}{84189}A few connoisseurs|justified such fantasies.
{84196}{84271}Vouzelles says world economic|relations have changed.
{84281}{84354}Human relations too.|He says your ideas aren't...
{84361}{84429}Economic relations change.|Some virtues remain.
{84444}{84508}Agreement could replace|social conflict.
{84512}{84598}Solidarity could defeat profit.|Vouzelles says that...
{84602}{84661}His is a world|of abstract generosity.
{84670}{84742}We'd work for the good of all,|not one factory.
{84765}{84819}l know that tune. L know it...
{84851}{84924}You know, during the war,|on the Front,
{84947}{85052}there was no profit. We were equal,|we stood together. It was touching
{85069}{85131}but l remember|the sheer mediocrity.
{85233}{85294}You know, Max,|a man's hardest ordeal
{85319}{85362}is being brought down to size.
{85376}{85439}His greatness|is to accept his limits.
{85465}{85534}This is the placing|and drawing room
{85538}{85589}to prepare the pieces for firing.
{85593}{85662}The y are placed on saggers|to go into the kiln.
{85687}{85783}After drawing,|we send the pieces to the wipers
{85787}{85862}who clean them,|the last step before glazing.
{85868}{85905}What a perfect gesture!
{85960}{86001}- Mrs Howard...|- Mr Barnery!
{86005}{86020}Forgive me.
{86024}{86109}Don't mention it. This young man|has been "piloting" me.
{86123}{86175}- How is your husband?|- He's well.
{86183}{86272}l have no need to go to New York|and l'm afraid we no longer write.
{86277}{86327}He has closed the Toronto store.
{86331}{86391}Luckily,|he retired before the crash.
{86442}{86494}You live in a world of beauty.
{86596}{86628}This way, please.
{87145}{87170}It's all right.
{87272}{87291}Théodore...
{87353}{87402}Call Pauline but don't alarm her.
{87424}{87459}l'm sorry...
{87464}{87541}l think l've put my knee out.|l didn't see the hole.
{89045}{89084}This year's first...
{89135}{89206}Fardissou picked them for you...
{89575}{89618}Remember the cherry tree...
{89690}{89762}that day you came home early|from the factory?
{89881}{89922}l wasn't expecting you.
{90124}{90168}It was just before the war.
{90292}{90330}l've swallowed a stone.
{90858}{90892}Got rid of the stone?
{90907}{90943}l thought l was choking.
{91157}{91226}Yes, l remember...|l remember that day.
{91321}{91365}l had bought a novel...
{91401}{91468}l was watching you|without you seeing me.
{91526}{91576}l've forgotten too many things.
{91621}{91686}l'd like to remember you,|in Switzerland.
{91727}{91813}You can rest now,|l'll go to the factory.
{91823}{91861}Yes, l'll rest.
{91996}{92058}The Transatlantique|has ordered a service
{92063}{92109}for the first-class cabins.
{92142}{92186}People still appreciate quality.
{92226}{92288}Yesterday...|Yes, it was yesterday...
{92362}{92437}l dreamt about the factory.|When l think about it...
{92473}{92516}what l've done or nothing...
{92597}{92655}"Our dwelling is removed...
{92678}{92730}"and carried away from us...
{92743}{92787}"as a shepherd's tent..."
{92872}{92941}That's from the Bible.|l often said it...
{93009}{93108}very often at a graveside,|without really understanding.
{93170}{93215}The factory is still there.
{93270}{93331}Not for much longer|and neither am I.
{93389}{93460}Everything l've done is worthless,|l was always wrong.
{93573}{93602}But you know...
{93637}{93693}l don't feel l've had a wasted life.
{93748}{93789}No life is wasted...
{93852}{93942}when you've known love.|If only for your work-tools.
{94106}{94154}l'd really like to know
{94177}{94268}the meaning of this hope|at the heart of all things.
{94615}{94685}We can't meet|the Transatlantique order.
{94702}{94768}l promise you, it's too expensive.
{94794}{94849}We have to do it. We have to.
{94861}{94901}We'll be working at a loss.
{94906}{94958}With the cost of the ivory service...
{94971}{94996}It doesn't matter.
{95002}{95059}Mr Jean will notice|when he sees the accounts.
{95067}{95105}Jean mustn't know.
{95117}{95144}What?
{95171}{95211}Draw up fresh accounts.
{95220}{95258}l can't be responsible.
{95308}{95335}l can.
{96597}{96622}Gently...
{98085}{98141}Shall l put the light on|so you can see?
{98614}{98650}You can switch it off.
{98883}{98907}It's good.
{98964}{98996}l'm pleased.
{99191}{99213}Mr Paul Desca...
{99311}{99356}l'll be happy to see him.
{99811}{99871}You'll find the maker|among his works.
{100039}{100071}Hello, Jean.
{100126}{100146}You look better.
{100678}{100758}Fine porcelain.|As inventive as e ver, Jean.
{100772}{100798}As e ver...
{100887}{100930}You'll return to the factory.
{100952}{101033}l'm not sure.|But l don't complain.
{101074}{101148}l was afraid of dying|without looking at life.
{101205}{101260}So, you like this ivory porcelain?
{101302}{101328}It's magnificent.
{101360}{101402}When l was a boy...
{101486}{101551}my cousins made plates|for their dolls...
{101570}{101623}with magnolia petals.
{101783}{101815}Julie collected them.
{102013}{102071}It was this same, smooth tone.
{102168}{102225}l think we've re vived it.
{102335}{102384}You've been to the Charente?
{102592}{102649}l don't have much good news.
{102706}{102748}Tell me about Barbazac.
{102785}{102839}The latest local elections
{102861}{102939}threw out the old cognac merchants.
{102965}{103020}The people want new men.
{103031}{103082}The winegrower must sell his wine.
{103092}{103161}If Hennessy can't buy,|let the State do it.
{103261}{103356}Bourgaud-Duperron|has gone bankrupt.
{103391}{103453}Hear that, Pauline?|Bourgaud-Duperron...
{103489}{103572}Pommerel is getting by.|He's ne ver done much business.
{103612}{103653}He keeps chugging along.
{103718}{103779}Poor old Pommerel,|if only he knew...
{103807}{103862}He who was always half-ruined...
{103941}{103980}All the same, in life...
{104048}{104089}there are some pleasant things.
{104155}{104214}It takes patience to see them.
{104242}{104278}You have to look for them.
{104339}{104394}What today's world is losing...
{104423}{104447}is love.
{104458}{104498}Don't tire yourself, Jean.
{104510}{104596}Let me tell Paul this|because l'm sure of it...
{104793}{104866}But once you're sure,|your voice has almost gone.
{104998}{105029}Love...
{105050}{105100}There's nothing else in life...
{105148}{105174}Nothing.
{105416}{105459}Is he in much pain?
{105470}{105499}At times.
{105523}{105561}It eases occasionally.
{105586}{105654}What's wrong exactly?|Did he have a fall?
{105658}{105715}He fell and put his knee out.
{105761}{105829}The trauma awoke something older.
{105854}{105908}He has already had tuberculosis.
{106025}{106090}You know,|resurrections can happen.
{106123}{106167}l belie ve in resurrection.
{106216}{106246}l'm keeping you...
{106249}{106318}He mustn't think|we're talking about him.
{107035}{107077}A letter from Max...

THE GLEANERS AND I
G as in gleaning -
To glean is to gather after the harvest.
A gleaner is one who gleans.
In times past only women gleaned.
Millet's Glaneuses were in all dictionaries.
The original painting is at the Orsay.
Gleaning, that's the old way.
My mother'd say, '' Pick everything up so nothing gets wasted''.
But sadly we no longer do because machines are so efficient nowadays.
But before, I used to glean together with my neighbors, for wheat, and rice too.
I would put my big apron on and we'd go gleaning ears of wheat, lovely ears we would find.
A whole day in the sun, with gnats and mosquitoes biting, it wasn't too nice, but we liked it.
Evenings, we were exhausted. Once home with our bags and our aprons we'd have a good time laughing and drinking coffee together.
I was born in that farmhouse, and I'll die there too.
- But not quite yet!
- OK, thank you very much.
Thanks very much, all of you.
I'm mixed up, you've confused me now.
Yes, I've always gleaned.
I remember, with my grandmother and my brothers and sisters.
Before, during the war, they had to glean, they were starving.
They pounded the grain to make flour, for bread.
We no longer pick these days, we no longer glean to eat.
There are still a few gleaners of corn around.
Gleaning might be extinct but stooping has not vanished from our sated society
Urban and rural gleaners all stoop to pick up
There's no shame,just worries
Yeah, food, grub
It's bad, sad, man
To bend down is not to beg
But when I see them sway
My heart hurts!
Eating that scrap-crap
They've got to live on shit-bits
They've got to frisk for tidbits
Left on the street, leftovers
Rough stuff with no owners
Picking up trash like the streetsweeper
Zero for us, for them much better
They got to roam around to kill the hunger
It's always been the same pain will always be the same game.
In the towns today as in the fields yesterday gleaners still humbly stoop to glean.
But men have now joined with women in gleaning.
What strikes me is that each gleans on his own.
Whereas in paintings they were always in clusters, rarely alone.
But there's a famous one painted byJules Breton at the museum in Arras.
We took the road north.
Lots of big trucks, but I'll come back to that, and we arrived in the town of Arras, we saw its square, we saw its museum, and Breton's Woman Gleaning.
There is another woman gleaning in this film, that's me.
I'm happy to drop the ears of wheat and pick up my camera.
These new small cameras, they are digital, fantastic.
Their effects are stroboscopic narcissistic, and even hyper-realistic.
No, it's not O rage, no, it's not O despair, it's not Old age, my enemy, it might even be Old age, my friend but still, my hair and my hands keep telling me that the end is near.
OK, right now, we are driving towards Beauce, renowned for its wheat.
The harvest being over we'll focus on potato gleaning instead.
Destalking the fields makes furrows and ridges ready for the grubbing machine.
Once the grubbing is over, we can glean the whole field.
- Hello.
- Hello Mrs. Buard.
Since this morning,
I've collected a full 250 lbs alone.
And these are good ones you eat with herring.
Lots of restaurants buy them.
Some people are quite pleased when the machine malfunctions.
There are lots left here.
The tractor ploughs too deep and gets stuck.
They free it by lifting the machine and they miss potatoes there.
So gleaners have a field day?
Oh yes definitely.
The owners don't give a damn so long as there's nothing left.
They won't have to treat.
You still must sort them.
In supermarkets, the firm ones are sold in containers of 5 1 /2 to 1 1 pounds, and these have to be of a specific caliber, of a specific size.
So we dump anything bigger.
The potato harvest averages 4,500 tons per season.
But 25 tons are rejected and dumped.
We reject all the outsized, green ones, and stones, the cut or damaged ones.
Because they're unsellable.
To the trade, we sell potatoes within a range of 2 to 4 inches and anything bigger is automatically thrown away.
Potatoes remain a staple foodstuff for many and because large quantities of potatoes are dumped, the practice of gleaning has reappeared.
In general people wait nearby and follow the trailers.
We followed the trailers but didn't see anyone except a man who might have known, not through a newspaper though for they never announce dumping here tomorrow, there next week.
Potatoes left in the open like that soon become green and dangerous to eat.
Sometimes the children give the signal.
Hey, we found a big one here!
C'mon, catch it!
Monday, potatoes
Tuesday, potatoes
Wednesday, potatoes again
Thursday, potatoes
Friday, potatoes
Saturday, potatoes again
Sunday, potatoes au gratin
Look, I've picked up more or less
200 or 300 pounds.
You find very large ones in the leftovers.
The damaged ones we leave.
Some are too small, we take the large ones rather.
See, misshapen ones, heart-shaped ones.
The heart, I want the heart!
I was glad.
I immediately filmed them up close, and set about filming perilously with one hand my other hand gleaning heart-shaped potatoes.
Then I took a few home with me.
I looked at them again, filmed them again.
Then it dawned upon me: the Good Heart Charity Meals.
Why not organize an expedition on the day the potatoes are to be dumped?
When I think of all the food gone bad that's enough to make me mad
If you've been kicked out and you're down and out
Then you need food for nought
I take a few for me and my kids, and we collect together.
I've joined the Charity Meals because I was unemployed.
I still am but I expect to start on a trial job soon and meanwhile, I'd rather help people than do nothing, help people in dire straits.
I'm a single mother.
I get food from the Red Cross and the Charity Meals.
When I see all this go to waste and that some people have nothing to eat, it's really disgraceful.
On that day they collected almost 7 00 lbs.
At least that's something.
A little later, almost on the same spot, we saw a man approaching.
I went over to him and asked him how much he thought there was.
Almost a ton if you add all the mounds together, a ton of potatoes wasted.
Same thing with cauliflowers, fruit and vegetables in other regions, but here it's potato country, and we take what we find.
We're better off working in the fields than shoplifting.
It's the same for all of us,
I'm not alone.
We get by as best we can.
We do potatoes, we look in trash cans, that keeps me going for now.
It's a hard life, that's all.
The year 2K is upon us, great, heh?
OK, I'm on my way with my 7 0 lbs, and there are several tons left, which could be picked, but people don't know where to come to. There you are.
They are hoboes in caravans.
We are gypsies, we travel around.
They're different from us.
It needs to be cut up for the scrap merchant to come.
We don't have the necessary tools.
No electricity,just candles.
What do you do for water?
What?
Water?
That's all we have. It's over there.
That's our tap.
- What if it freezes?
- If it freezes... we pad around the pipe, or we let it drip to stop it freezing when it gets really cold, like last year, when it got to -7 0F on the ground.
You get used to it.
You seem to like beer?
I'd drink anything.
How many beers is that?
I drink a pack a day.
- What?
- Yeah, a pack of 2 4 a day.
2 4 or even 3 2.
Tell me what happened to you.
Did you have a house before?
Yeah, I had a job.
I worked impossible hours,
21 or 22 hours a day.
- Truck driving?
- Yeah.
- A trucker?
- Yes.
I drove long vehicles.
Then one day the police breathalyzed me and then... that's how I lost my job.
Then my wife left me, she took my three kids with her, and I was in free-fall after that.
Divorce, everything?
Yes, and I haven't seen my kids for almost 2 years.
They're 500 miles away from me.
I can't go and see them.
I don't have a car or a license.
- It's terrible.
- Yes it is.
I think of them every single day.
- Here's Guilene.
- She'll tell you everything.
Did you know that once they're through picking potatoes, you're allowed to take leftovers?
- No.
You didn't know?
- It's not allowed.
- Yes it is!
I have something very important to say:
Why has the Mayor put us here,
I've been here four years, and now he wants us to go.
He says he was fed up with us gypsies, but I want to stay here.
I had an apartment but it cost too much.
Her first trailer cost her $3 50 and the latest one, where I am housed at the moment,
We met when I was working in a cafe as a cleaning woman, that's how we met.
So long as there's welfare money left, OK, but after... we have to get by somehow.
Then we have to beg and forage through the trash.
We find food in the garbage.
Good food?
We're badly off. We do find good food. Which could still be sold in shops. But they have to change their shelves.
We take advantage of that, it's a lucky draw.
But we have to comb all the garbage cans everywhere to recover stuff.
See for yourself.
For the soup!
My bunch of flowers!
- Another cucumber.
- Sure, there's plenty.
That comes from the trash.
The expiry date is 1 1 -29, two days ago.
- One day ago.
- Right.
That's still valid for seven or eight days, a week or so.
I've got fish which I found there.
It's good until 1 2-2 4.
We found it in the trash.
We're not afraid to get our hands dirty. You can wash hands.
Hey, guys, the new appetizer is lamb kidney in a chicory root sauce with a potato fritter and an aniseed and nut soup and mushroom mousse with truffle oil.
As I watched all this cooking,
I asked the chef if there were lots of leftovers, and what he did with them.
Nothing should be wasted.
With the leftover lentils, we make a lentil soup, we mince the greenery into a gratin, the meat bones we use for stock the fish bones for sauce.
We don't throw anything away.
You have to be economical.
If I had to buy all the herbs
I pick daily on the hills...
A small bunch of savory like this is $1 .50 and we use about 20 of them every day.
We'd be spending a fortune on herbs.
Anyway, I love picking them.
That nice inventive and thrifty chef offers a gourmet menu for $1 00.
Edouard Loubet is the youngest French chef to have earned 2 stars in the Michelin guide, now called the Red Guide.
Surprisingly enough,
Edouard is also a born gleaner, or rather a born picker.
With his hat on, in his shirt sleeves, he looks like a Provencal figurine.
Don't tread on the apples!
We take what the farmers leave behind or we pick the ripe fruit on the trees.
This is the best thing you can use to make good spirits or good fruit jelly.
I never miss the chance.
How come you, a chef, also pick?
Firstly because my grandparents taught me to along fields and roads, and also because
I then know what produce I get and where I get it from.
I don't want refrigerated produce from Italy which is sold only when someone feels like saying it is ripe.
As we're talking grapes and wine...
Let's go, Isa!
...we might as well go to a wine area.
We're off to Burgundy.
On the road, there are trucks, lots of trucks, of the kind we loved when we were kids.
We pass them and gaze at them.
Here's a very big one passing us, transporting cars, and here's another one.
And now we are passing him, we struggle a little to pass this one.
It's like a child's game.
We're arriving in Burgundy.
Beaune to me is above all the Hospices and the painting by Van der Weyden,
The LastJudgment.
The Archangel Michael weighs and judges the deeds of the dead.
The ones who are light are to be resurrected, and the heavy ones are to suffer in hell.
The grape harvest is over, and yet nobody is in sight.
Why is that?
If you want your wine to be ranked as vintage, the yearly production is limited.
That means you can only produce a certain quota per plot.
Growing up, I didn't hear much about pickers.
Wine growers have always protected themselves against them, for if you let people pick in your vines, how can you be sure they are not going to pick on a large scale?
These vintage vines have been entirely harvested and the surplus has been deliberately left on the ground.
They're drying out, lost for everybody.
It's a measure to protect our profession and capital.
What you see here, is called second generation grapes, verjuice, or conscripts, depending on the area.
Conscripts.
Like soldiers?
Exactly, like conscripts.
Some people pick them.
It's a second harvest and yields a cheaper wine called wine of the pickings.
- Will it taste of Pommard?
- No, not at all.
It makes a table wine, a really cheap table wine.
The vintage wine region is not a good one for picking.
Gleaning, or picking, is forbidden in Burgundy.
It ended 3 or 4 years ago.
It's sad, but that's the way it is.
Gleaning was lovely.
We would see the gleaner, tramping along,
Gathering the relics
Of that which is falling
Behind the reaper...
- Do you know?
- Du Bellay?
- Right?
- It is.
Impressive, you know it by heart!
I took over my father's estate.
From the grape to the bottle,
I am the only master on board.
I have no cellarman, no head cellarman.
With Nadine, we choose the best blends for our Chateau bottles.
- Do you both choose?
- We both do.
Jean Laplanche, a keen wine grower, has another calling, psychotherapy.
I am a practicing therapist, but above all a theoretician, or rather a philosopher of therapy.
What's your theory?
What distinguishes me, is that I have tried to integrate into man's psyche, the Other above the Ego, i.e.
I developed an anti-ego philosophy, a philosophy which shows how man first originates in the Other.
He copes with his double life?
- Rather well.
- He's good, isn't he?
- Rather well.
- He's intelligent, I think. And modest.
It keeps me going.
- Isn't it daunting for you?
- What is?
That he is a therapist and makes wine too.
I was analyzed so as to learn a little more.
- By him?
- No, by Lacan.
- Ages ago.
- I was very young.
A long time ago.
We'll be married 50 years in the year 2000.
Tell me how you met.
At a village dance, where most people meet.
- The kiss!
- Right...
No one's interested in that!
I must tell you something, something the whole world should know about.
I met him, it was like a lightning bolt.
You see?
The way he was dressed,
I couldn't possibly miss him.
He had a red cap on, honest, he was back from the Riviera.
He looked so...
He had a red cotton cap, a green shirt, mustard yellow pants, rope espadrilles and...
- Yellow ones!
- Right.
And a multicolored belt.
I couldn't miss him,just couldn't.
How was she dressed?
That I can't remember.
Yeah, it's the old story.
But I didn't fall for her right away.
It all came later with me.
How mean of me!
Is it true, Huguette?
- I'm not in his heart.
- It's true.
This is Laurent, my son.
A gleaner or a picker,
I'm not sure.
But I heard Glanum, not gleaning, that's why I talked about Saint-Remy, where Glanum is.
Gleaning, no.
Because gleaning is very different from picking, you see.
But picking, yes.
What's the difference?
The difference is that you pick fruit that hangs, that is hanging, but you glean things that sprout.
Like grain. It's different.
Olives and grain.
Almonds...
Figs too, people make jams out of figs.
The fig, you pick.
Look, nature's wonders!
Overripe and beautiful!
That's fruit from heaven!
I half-feel like interfering, but it is none of my business, it's their fruit.
This one's almost pure alcohol, I'll be tipsy.
Anyway, half the people are stingy.
They won't allow gleaning because they don't feel like being nice.
There's a lot left.
The harvest is over now.
Are these not edible?
Edible, yes, but not good for making candied fruits.
Do you allow people to collect them?
No. I'm not the owner, but up to now, it's never been allowed.
The harvest of the cabbages is over, only a few are left here and there.
These cabbages can be gleaned with absolute impunity by gleaners from Avignon or around.
Here are lovely tomatoes.
The machine couldn't take what's too low.
All these tomatoes, which are just as red as my bible, the penal code, all can be gleaned.
And it's not me, it's the penal code that says so, in article R-26.1 0. Here: gleaning is allowed from sunup until sundown.
First requirement.
The second requirement is that gleaning occurs after the harvest.
And here, we can clearly see the harvest is over.
Paging through an old law commentary
I happened upon a decree, or rather an edict, dated Nov. 2, 1 5 54 which says just the same as the law today.
It allows the poor, the wretched, the deprived, to enter the fields once harvesting is over.
Old documents talk of the poor, the destitute, but how are we to consider those who want for nothing and glean just for fun?
It's as if they needed something too.
If they glean for fun, it's because they have a need for fun.
So if the requirements and the times are adhered to, they can glean as the poor used to.
Thank you.
Sure.
I'll take a walk in the cabbages.
I'll walk my small camera among the colored cabbages and film other vegetables which catch my eye.
On this type of gleaning, of images, impressions, there is no legislation, and gleaning is defined figuratively as a mental activity.
To glean facts, acts and deeds, to glean information.
And for forgetful me, it's what I have gleaned that tells where I've been.
From Japan, I brought back in my case souvenirs I had gleaned.
I am back home, the cats are here, there's mail, one plant's died, the others haven't.
Then I look at the leak in the ceiling and the mold,
I got used to it.
I like it in the end.
It's like a landscape, an abstract painting, a Tapies, a Guo Qiang, a Borderie.
There's water dripping,
I open my suitcase.
Amazing, in a department store in Tokyo, on the top floor, there were Rembrandt paintings, original Rembrandts.
Saskia, up close.
And then my hand up close,
I mean, this is my project: to film with one hand my other hand.
To enter into the horror of it.
I find it extraordinary.
I feel as if I am an animal, worse, I am an animal I don't know.
And here's Rembrandt's self-portrait, but it's just the same in fact, always a self-portrait.
Maurice Utrillo's we saw in a very small museum in the former City Hall of Sannois.
We were going to film nearby, at Herve's, alias VR99.
In the year 2000, his alias will be VR2000.
'Loading up' means retrieving heavy objects people get rid of.
To do so, town councils and city halls provide small maps such as this one.
It shows all the streets, the districts and the days on which one can go and pick them up.
I think the maps show where to dump things rather.
Yes, right, well,
I read the map my own way because that's where I find my raw material.
I am, among other things, a painter and a retriever.
I prefer night time, and because I go by bike,
I can only carry small things home.
It'll be easier if I show you.
I make images from salvaged material, frames from wood,
I use food packages, slates, and then I also recycle my own packets of cigarette paper, and what's good about these objects is that they have a past, they've already had a life, and they're still very much alive.
All you have to do is give them a second chance.
All you need to do is wander around, locate sites, and then simply help yourself, like in a real department store.
On site, you find heaps of heavy objects, it is best to get there quickly, because the competition is fierce.
Objects go quickly.
They're like presents left on the street, it's like Christmas.
When I was a kid, my grandfather used to salvage things as well.
He made piles.
I've always liked the world of dumps and salvage, anything that's been sort of discarded by society.
It's like a cavern here.
My own little cavern, that's right.
A place where I combine objects differently.
I need to accumulate.
It's a shelter as well?
From what?
From emptiness.
Because it's full here.
I'm moving towards emptiness now, or rather, towards lessness.
As much lessness as possible.
- You're still a long way away!
- I am.
Right now, I store up things because I know
I will need to recycle some.
The encounter happens on the street.
The object beckons me, because it belongs here in a way.
The encounter also happens on the road, and it happened to us.
On our left, an abandoned factory.
On the other side, a sign '' Finds''.
''Curios'' is common, but '' Finds'' is more inviting.
Hello, how are you?
Hello.
Turn and face me!
He won't.
I spotted some wheat behind that chap, and behind the robot,
I discovered a painting on gleaning.
It contained both the humble stooping of Millet's Glaneuses and the proud posture of Breton's Gleaner.
The painter had an old dictionary at hand.
Honest, this is no movie trick, we really did find these Glaneuses purely by chance.
The painting had beckoned us because it belonged here in this film.
On the road again, off to the
Ideal Palace of Bodan Litnanski, a much visited, much publicized place.
This retired brickmason came from Russia and started building totem towers made of scraps he found in dumps and brought back in his trailer hooked up to his moped.
It's solid stuff, you know, very solid.
I am a brickmason.
I like dolls, they're my system.
Dolls are characters.
What do you think of all this?
- He's an amateur.
- Sorry?
He's an amateur.
We can't stop him, we let him.
But your husband is an artist.
An artist, well, maybe...
Why not?
There's better than that.
- What?
- Better, much better than that.
Like Louis Pons, for instance, who uses junk as an inspiration.
He draws through objects, he accommodates chance.
All these objects around here are my dictionary, useless things.
People think it's a cluster of junk.
I see it as a cluster of possibilities.
Each object gives a direction, each is a line, picked up here and there, indeed gleaned, and which become my paintings.
The aim of art is to tidy up one's inner and exterior worlds.
These are just crayons, children's crayons.
Here we have tins and spools...
This is the tongue of a small bell.
I make sentences from things.
A cricket on a heap of trash.
Cages are interesting too, a bit like boats, like violins and things whose... shapes at first are very simple and the same, but the possible variations are infinite.
These are skirting boards and frames.
There is a... from cars... a windshield wiper.
But for me they are streaks.
I have to balance the streaks.
That's a statement.
Horizontal statements, nothing else.
Again one hand filming the other hand, and more trucks.
I'd like to capture them.
To retain things passing?
No,just to play.
Noirmoutier is an island renowned for its causeway and its oysters.
People glean there after rough storms and very low tides.
Storms dislodge oysters from their beds and wash them ashore.
But they all know that around Christmas time, we are so busy that we leave it to the gleaners.
They go as soon as the storm has abated.
A high sea over the beds is a pretty sight but to profit from the low tide gleaners need a copy of the Tide Tables.
We come every year for the lowest tide.
They're going to follow the receding sea and anything they find they pick up.
People collect the oysters that have come loose.
In theory, they keep out of the poles around the beds.
They must keep out.
They are too close.
Here the oyster farmers let them carry on, but... it degenerates sometimes.
We don't trespass!
The limit must be here, but... we encroach a little sometimes.
We're not stupid.
We see others and do the same.
If they tell us anything, we scram.
It's tolerated but not really allowed.
It's not downright illegal.
There still exists a right to glean, provided people glean
1 5 yards from the beds.
- 25 yards away.
- Is it 25 yards now?
What are people allowed to do?
To collect up to 7 pounds each, nothing more.
- 1 0 yards away minimum.
- Right.
1 1 pounds per person.
7 pounds of clams and 1 1 pounds of oysters, something like that.
1 1 pounds per person, I think.
Three dozen per person but surely they take more than that.
They pick up small inedible oysters that were churned by the waves and are full of sand.
People from the mainland eat them, and then say they get sick.
TheJura region was flooded.
The river Dard barred our route.
I liked it when animals barred my way, or I just stopped for them.
The Nenon family, in the hills near Apt, present a special case of picking.
The vineyard they found was wholly abandoned.
That's a fully fledged harvest here!
Yes, the entire vineyard was left unpruned last year.
An entire harvest going to waste.
I spotted this place and I was very intrigued by it.
Could anybody say anything?
- Don't the owners care?
- No. After Nov. 1 , we are allowed to pick grapes in the vineyards.
If not, they're eaten by wild boars or birds.
- Do wild boars like grapes?
- They love grapes.
On that day,
I filmed dancing pruning shears.
I forgot to turn my camera off, which is why we get the dance of the lens cap.
The cap has stopped its crazy jig.
We're off to see the only owner who cares for his gleaners.
I warn children about the terrible effects if they eat too much, but I take for granted that the adults know and I leave them alone.
Jerome Noel-Bouton shows us an old photo of his vines which used to be Marey's.
There is a mini-museum in the cellar.
An engineer and erudite physiologist,
Marey invented chronophotography.
He was a visionary.
He analyzed movement before Muybridge and the Lumieres.
He is the ancestor of all movie makers, and we're proud to be family.
Marey was my father's grandfather, which makes him my great-grandfather, and to be more specific, my grandfather was Marey's son-in-law, since... his wife, my grandmother, was Marey's daughter.
She married a man named Bouton and this estate, which used to be in the Bouton family, was bought by Marey, and returned to the Bouton family when his daughter married a Bouton.
Congratulations!
The tower you can see over there, he built with his own two hands to house his still camera equipment.
He set up wires and waited.
Animals or birds went past, triggering the camera.
That's the hut from which, with his chronophotographic rifle, he broke down the flight of birds.
That's Demeny, Marey's assistant, holding the rifle and the film reel.
I wonder who the boy with a bowler hat is.
Marey's experimental pictures and film bits, technical prowess aside, are pure visual delight.
Our train leaves Paris and happens to slows down as we pass
Ivry waste collection center.
The heart of our topic, since we're going to Prades, home of our musician Joanna.
She met youngsters who had had a brush with the law for damaging the trash bins of a supermarket because the contents had been doused in bleach.
I thought I could film them explaining the case if I met all the protagonists - the youngsters gathered on the square, the manager of the shop, and the magistrate from the court, who seemed concerned and polite.
I wanted to know how these homeless coped with the law.
Should squatting be legalized?
I could work on it, if not for this robe.
But your robe is lovely!
It was a simple case of youngsters vandalizing things.
I found them guilty of violence.
Before bleach was sprayed on?
They'd knock over the trash and my staff had to clean up after them.
That led me to apply the law and bleach the trash, which they didn't appreciate.
- We got angry.
- But nothing serious.
We knocked over trash cans, and damaged the wall with graffiti and tomatoes.
They broke the camera.
It was locked, we had to climb a little.
They went over the fence.
They were trespassing on private property.
Appearing in court was itself a penalty for these youths who want to be free of all rules.
We only stole trash.
The aim isn't to fine them but to remind them of the law.
They all played their part, applying their own logic.
The kids said what they were supposed to.
We filmed them with their dogs.
It was picturesque.
I'm not that antisocial.
- May I ask you how old you are?
Their beauty is poignant when you realize that, for whatever reason, they get most of their food from trash cans.
In court, I was told it was a dialogue of the deaf, but not of the dumb.
They seized the chance to have fun.
I said she was mad, she cited me for contempt of court.
We said she was out of her mind, and she would go: Write it down!
Recorder, write down:
Out of her mind!
We felt it was a foregone conclusion. It was sickening.
She opted for trial in closed court.
I shouted and slammed the door.
They're not through talking about this episode, and I'm not through thinking about it in my hotel room.
We filmed and continue to film people who hang around trash cans.
They have various reasons for doing so.
Each experiences it differently.
- Hi!
- Here he is!
How are you?
Sit down, there's coffee for you.
We had been told: '' He wears rubber boots.
He salvages everything''.
Yes, I live almost 1 00% on things from the trash.
Everybody, rich or poor, throws food away. Why?
Because we are so stupid with food!
If we're past the sell-by date of a yogurt, people go:
''Oh my God, I can't eat this!
It'll kill me!''
So stupid.
It's easy to tell from the smell of it if it's OK or not.
It's quite simple, I've eaten
1 00% trash for 1 0 years now... for 1 0 or 1 5 years,
I've never been ill.
- You don't have a job?
- I do.
I have a job, a salary, a social security number.
So you are not forced to do that?
Absolutely not.
Salvaging is a matter of ethics for me, because I find it utterly unacceptable to see all this waste on the streets.
That proves we're heading for disasters, like the Erika oil spill.
Oil Slick
Put the head on the right.
Looser...
Sea birds, guillemots, razorbill penguins, all those who were smashed up real good by Total Fina Oil, those who will get smashed up real good by this over-consuming society...
If they are cleaned, the birds might still get caught in nets, it's for them that I'm an activist.
All the rest can die in their apartments, on their trash,
I don't care. Birds first.
Do you always wear boots?
Yes, rubber boots have 2 advantages, on this hostile ground, they're really good stuff.
There's a psychological aspect too, with my boots,
I'm like the lord of this town.
All these idiots dump away,
I come after them and rake in the chips.
Trash is Beautiful!
An exhibition featuring demonstration trash cans was organized to teach children how to sort out the trash.
At Trash is Beautiful, they like colors, and children play with bits of junk.
This is just plastic from the street.
Gino Rizzi is in charge of the kids' workshop.
He himself transforms pots of yogurt into flowers and plastic bottles into mobiles.
Where does play end and art start?
Cartier Foundation for Contemporary Art
The American artist Sze exhibits mobiles made with lots of bits and pieces.
The kitchen trash has made it to the art world, where junk is highly-prized and priced.
In any case, museum trash is small, cute, clean and colorful.
Have those kids ever seen brooms in action, or shaken hands with a garbage collector?
- How are you?
- Fine.
That's neighborhood life.
I live here at Mr. Charlie Plusquellec's, because he's a friend.
More than a friend, a protector, a godfather, he's everything to me.
I am so very very happy, very glad, I am here surrounded by nature.
You see, it's worse than paradise.
Salomon is a little bit like a migrating bird.
He arrives, he moves in, and then one day, he disappears.
And then he comes back again, and then leaves.
So far he's been back 3 times.
Every day, I come out of here,
I wander around, looking here and there for throw-aways.
Don't touch anything!
- You hear me?
- Yes, Ma'am.
Don't you understand what I said?
Every morning, early, you come across a little something.
It's like a lottery.
It's good.
There's lots.
Do you need it?
Wait, he might want some.
Want some bread?
I always come here and help myself.
Sometimes you get good cold meats, sometimes fowl, a bit of everything.
Salomon found chicken legs.
So I'll cook the meat before it goes off.
You're going to eat chicken and rabbit for a month!
No, don't worry.
We always find someone to share with.
We give it to the neighbors, the woman next door especially.
That's good.
Right now, we have 1 , 2, 3,
4 fridges and 2 freezers that we picked up and fixed.
I patch them up, I fix them, and when the machine works
I sell it or...
I give it away to our neighbors.
Fridges are everywhere on the streets.
Sometimes they work, sometimes not.
The Waste Ground artists of Villeneuve sur Lot collects fridges and recycle them as fully furnished, fitted spaces.
Fridge Demo
Free our comrades!
My neighbor the Lion of Denfert is made of bronze.
My friend the Lion in Arles is made of stone.
We got there in the early hours.
The people from the fair were still asleep, and I saw a man looking at the river flow by.
I half-felt like talking to him.
Further on, along the Rhone, in a blissful orchard
I saw gleaners arrive.
You can tell them from their boxes, sacks and plastic bags which don't look anything like the standard containers of the workers.
My name's David,
I'm a foreman at the Cape farm.
We often allow gleaners to come in after our pickers provided they remain
1 0 yards behind.
Look, there's still a lot left in the trees.
We just take advantage of this.
I collect them so that they don't go to waste, and I share them out, we stew them or whatever.
I want to pick them because there're lots left as you can see.
I don't take damaged ones, because my children are very particular.
They're used to getting the best.
This one is damaged so I chuck it away.
We gleaners also discard some fruit.
Here's an apple which has got nothing going for it, it's like an ugly and stupid woman.
It's small and sunburnt.
Commercial value: zero.
We can't prevent people from providing themselves with apples once we have finished harvesting.
So we proclaim an official gleaning period, we take car registrations down, if it's a moped, we ask for a Xerox of the owner's I D and we tell them from when to when they can come and collect.
Isn't it a bit over-regulated?
Well, it's either that or nothing at all.
Once people are registered, they can take 400 pounds, I don't mind, even if it's a whole lot.
Good for them.
In this field of 3 hectares, at least 1 0 tons will be left unpicked.
That gives the gleaners quite a lot of exercise.
You have to find them behind the trees, under the leaves.
It takes a while to fill up a basket.
Picking is not a piece of cake, it's hard work.
Quite a few have fallen here.
You just have to pick them up.
Robert, a gleaner of many crops, let us follow him.
I'm looking for pine nuts.
You're really thorough!
Right, I really don't let anything go by.
In this greenhouse, the tomato harvest is over.
We pick the remains before they clean the place.
Here, see the tomatoes...
That's nature, it shouldn't be wasted.
It's abandoned.
Once the harvest is over, it's not worth hiring people just for those.
They'd rather let us do it.
Can anybody go in the greenhouses?
No, not the greenhouses.
I don't know what the law is.
Greenhouses are a facility to grow vegetables.
Once the harvest is collected, there's some left, a few tomatoes, grapes, carrots or celery.
If gleaners remain within the law farmers can't say anything, can't sue them for anything.
Even on their property?
Even then, precisely, gleaning is always on private property.
Mr. Dessaud, our lawyer in the fields, explained gleaning rights.
Mrs. Espie, our lawyer in the streets, tells us about salvaging rights.
The law on gleaning doesn't apply to these objects.
'' Res derelictae'' are ownerless things, since the owner's intention has been clearly expressed: they have deliberately abandoned them.
Only the penal code deals with their status and says this property can't be stolen since it has no owner.
Those who take the object become its legal owners.
This acquisition is unusual, since it comes from no one.
Once taken, the object belongs to them irrevocably.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
Yeah. Sidelined beds on the sidewalk
Washed-out machines, tired-out fridges just bend down and grab your furniture
Yeah. Cookers, cushions, club armchairs
Weary wood chairs and TVsets,
Worn-out couches just bend over,you're made over
Street rehab and TVrap,yeah,yeah!
Broken TVs
I've seen lots ofTVs abandoned, and within a few minutes somebody was taking out the copper.
It's the copper from the deflector coils.
I looked at the magic screen thinking I began this film right after the eclipse shown on TV, continued while the countdown to Y2Kwas shown on TV, and ended the film on the 1 st of May...
Other people take TVs home, hoping to repair them.
I found 2 small chairs on the street and took them home.
One night when the bulky refuse is thrown out,
I drove around with Francois who had done one of my film scores and who also sang.
He has dressed in white for 25 years.
Francois is curious, he likes rummaging, but he didn't find anything that night.
He looked at an empty clock and he turned it down.
I picked it up and took it home.
A clock without hands is my kind of thing.
You don't see time passing.
I like filming rot, leftovers, waste, mold and trash.
But I never forget those who shop in the leftovers and trash when the market is over.
It's past 2 o'clock.
I've done my shopping and I linger on until the market is over.
I notice a man with a large bag eating on the spot.
I would see him now and then, always with his bag, always eating.
The day he was eating parsley
I went over to him.
Do you often eat parsley?
Sometimes yes. Parsley's full of vitamin C and E, beta carotene, zinc, magnesium, it's excellent.
His answer amazed me.
Over the following weeks,
I filmed him repeatedly, with or without sound, and he talked in snatches.
I pick up food at the markets and I save money that way.
I'm mostly a vegetarian, so I find what I need.
I don't make much, but I still have to eat.
You should see what they get rid of...
From the markets, I get fruit, vegetables mostly, sometimes cheese too, but that's rare.
I eat a lot of apples.
And here I can get as many apples as I want.
- How many apples a day do you eat?
- 6 or 7.
Is it your staple diet?
I also eat bread.
I get up at 4, I take the train and I arrive in Paris at 5:45.
Between 6 and 7, they throw away all of the bread from the day before.
If you spot a trash can near a bakery it's likely to contain sandwiches, bread, and all that.
I eat a lot of bread. It's a staple food full of proteins and glucids.
It's strange to be concerned...
- About balanced diets?
- Yes.
Since I studied biology, it's quite normal
I should be concerned.
I used to be a teaching assistant.
When people find out
I have a Master's degree, they don't understand why
I sell papers to make money.
I sell street papers or magazines.
Most times in front of the train station.
I live in a shelter where 50% of the people are illiterate.
Immigrants from Mali and Senegal mostly.
I arrived in that shelter
8 years ago, and I've been teaching them to read and write for 6 years.
I am not part of the school system,
I don't get paid for it.
I teach every evening from 6:30 / 7:00 until 8:30 / 9:00.
He arranged and decorated the classroom himself for the students who may attend whenever they please.
Ac, ec, ic, oc...
And see, for example, a noc-turnal ac-tivity.
Right, a nocturnal activity.
What does ''nocturnal'' mean?
Success? Success is...
Isn't success like a behavior?
It's to succeed in life.
Somebody who has succeeded.
- Like Celine Dion has?
- Right.
Famous?
But it's more like the will to...
Succeed.
Yes, when you've succeeded, that's success.
A use-ful... in-sect.
What's that?
A cockroach.
I don't know if it is useful but... but it is an insect.
Meeting that man is what impressed me the most.
And the time it took to find out about his nocturnal and voluntary activity in a suburban basement.
The other high point is quite different in kind.
I talked the Museum of Villefranche into bringing out from its reserves a painting by Hedouin which I had seen reproduced in black and white.
Brigitte, the curator, and her assistant,Julie had to disturb several sleepy paintings before finding the one
I wanted to reveal:
Gleaners Fleeing Before the Storm.
To see them in broad daylight, with stormy gusts lashing against the canvas, was true delight.
Time to put the trash out.
That girl's moving out and she's throwing all this away.
Look at this. l'm going to keep it.
Off we go.
FRlDAY NlGHT
Shall l keep it?
SKl CLOTHES - SCARF - GLOVES
SUMMER CLOTHES l'll keep you.
There... Then this...
That's that done.
''OUR PLACE'' - TOMORROW
FRANCOlS
This is François, leave a message after the tone.
François, it's me.
Everything's ready now. lt took a bit longer than l thought. l'm having dinner at Bernard and Marie's. l can't wait to be at your place...
Our place, l mean. l have to get used to that.
Take care. See you tomorrow. l'm tired, l don't know why.
Our place...
Our place.
FOR SALE - URGENT - MOVlNG
How much?
How much do you want for it?
- 15,000 francs.
- Are you crazy?
Poor little car...
The latest traffic news, or rather, traffic-jam news.
Paris is at a standstill due to the public-transport strike.
You all know that now.
The city is choking, everyone is exhausted. l'll never get there.
At times like this, we need to be... charitable towards others.
Try carpooling.
If you see cold and weary people hitching a ride... take them part of the way with you in your car.
Try it. I did it once, it was fun.
Excuse me... l can give you a lift, if you want.
No thanks, l'd rather walk, it's quicker.
CHARlTY SHOP CLOTHES l'll keep this.
Okay!
- Yes?
- Good evening. Can l get in?
Yes, of course.
I didn't hear where you want to go.
Leave me where you want. lt's warm in here.
- Shall l turn it down?
- No, it's okay.
Are you all right?
Are you sure you're all right? l think l dozed off for a second.
Never mind.
Fancy a cigarette to wake you up? l've given up but l don't mind if you smoke.
Black is black. No hope in sight.
Paris is at a standstill and you're stuck... for the evening, tonight and tomorrow.
If you've been invited to dinner, it's going to get cold. l can leave you here.
You'll go more quickly on foot. l'm in no hurry.
You can leave me wherever it suits you.
My name's Laure. l'm Jean.
Sorry.
The traffic situation is worse than usual.
It's as hard as ever getting anywhere... ln theory, l turn here. ln theory, but it won't be easy.
Try it.
Thank you.
We're almost there.
Well done. l'm eating with some friends.
Do you want to come?
All right.
No smoking, please, because of the baby.
Sorry.
You've changed your mind?
Yes, a shortcut.
Shall we have dinner together?
Yes
Why didn't you let me through?
Stop yelling. You're the maniac here.
- There was no room!
- A maniac, period.
- There was room but you moved!
- You saw l was moving! l had the right-of-way anyhow.
What the hell's this right-of-way shit?
Let's fill out the insurance form.
Fuck you and your shit form!
- Fucking pain in the ass!
- What?
- Did you hear that?
- Shut it.
- Fuck your crate to hell!
- My car!
Fucking hell!
My car's a wreck! Don't make it worse! l'll make a quick phone call.
Stop it!
Fuck his crate!
The guy's hysterical!
Do something!
You asshole!
Fuck you!
Get off him!
- Do something!
- l'll kill you! l'll kill you, you hear me?
Take your insurance papers, you goddamn lunatic!
Do something. They'll kill each other.
Laure, get yourself a bloody cell phone!
No one can come because of the strike. lt's all off.
Come over anyway.
Come over. You've nothing left at home.
We'll fix something.
That way, you'll get to see the baby.
No thanks. l've been packing boxes all day. l'm worn out. The removal men come at 8:00. l can't take the car anywhere tonight.
It's hell. Know what happened to Bernard when he left the office? l have to go. Other people want the phone. l'll call you tomorrow.
Take care. Give François my love.
Just a second, Lulu.
Stop crying now, okay?
Shit, my car!
My car!
Shit!
Excuse me...
Have you seen my car? lt was just here. ln front of me?
And you can't find it. lt must've flown off. l shouldn't have left the keys.
Why did l leave him my car?
Here you write Mr... l can't, there's not enough room. lt doesn't matter. l'm not cold. lt doesn't matter. Never mind. l'm not cold.
Where are you going?
Come on. l thought you'd seen me but you vanished.
You don't leave a car like that.
Get in. We'll try something.
Stop. l want to get out.
- What's wrong?
- Let me go.
- What's wrong?
- Let go of me.
- l want to go. l want to go home.
-Calm down. lt's your car, so l'll get out and go.
Good night.
- Careful, you'll get into tilt.
- Shit.
- What's tilt?
- Sorry?
- What's tilt?
- When you shake it too much.
Try a little...
Then catch the ball.
Good evening.
Coffee.
Two coffees, please.
Okay?
- You scalded yourself?
- Yes.
Because it's hot.
We're in no hurry. We have time.
Plenty of time. Want a glass of water?
Could we have a glass of water, please?
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Uh-huh... l'll be right back.
Do you have any 10-franc coins? l was going to phone, too.
THE MACHlNE ONLY TAKES CARDS
4 SUPER MANlX CONDOMS = 10 F
PUSH ALL THE WAY lN
Come on, let's walk.
Good evening.
Anyone here?
- Do you have any rooms?
- All you want. We're empty.
We put the sign up for people stuck in the strike.
But it hasn't worked.
SPEClAL STRlKE RATES
Could you pay me now, please?
No, let me.
- l'm all alone so...
- How much?
200 francs.
Second floor.
You'll see a sign for the showers and toilet.
Good night.
Your hand smells of rubber.
You've got a blister here. ls that why you got into my car?
Maybe. l'm hungry. Want to eat?
Let's have dinner.
This is the door code. l forgot to give it to you.
Lucky l heard you or you'd have been locked out.
You're right. lf we find nothing, we can go back.
We'll find something.
Could you choose quickly?
The chef leaves soon.
Usually we close late on Fridays but with the strike... l'm cold. Can we switch tables?
- Can we switch tables?
- Yes, of course.
Does this suit you?
What do you want? l don't know yet. What about you? l'll have the antipasto and then a Neapolitan pizza.
Me too.
White wine, okay?
A carafe of white, thank you.
You're welcome.
My feet are killing me. l've had enough.
Your coat.
- l'm sick of walking.
- lt does you good.
No thanks, l'm not hungry.
Maybe something's happened to her.
Nothing can happen. Her husband's here.
Someone should check.
Excuse me... could l have another carafe of wine?
What are you thinking of? Me?
Careful, the plate's hot. l'll have the same spaghetti, please.
Are you coming?
How will you get home, Pierre?
My car's parked nearby.
That's good.
Etienne, put your hood up.
- lt's cold outside.
- lt's a very cold night.
FRl
SAT
Shall l turn the heater off?
Yes, it's stifling.
- What?
- lt's stifling in here. l need a drink of water.
Jean!
Jean.
Subtitles by lan Burley
Hey people!
We are THE robbers.
Get your hands up!
- Don't try anything!
You know us from the news!
With this, we stimulate the economy!
This is an expropriation proceeding!
Bag everything!
Ownership is theft!
Here you go!
Hands up again!
Down with capitalism!
Stop them!
Come in, Granny!
There's a robbery in progress.
- Ah?
Spare a buck?
Have a long life!
Good luck!
(Rita:)
Those were the happy years.
We thought we were the best,
Tatjana.
We tried to abolish injustice as well as the government.
Both were connected.
Politics were war, throughout the world.
She has a .32 Walther.
- How do you know all that?
Get down!
Please open the bag!
I'm passing through in transit.
Open the bag!
Take a seat, please.
Your name is Marianne Berg.
- Yes.
But you are Rita Vogt.
No, Marianne Berg.
I know you are Rita Vogt.
You aren't allowed to enter the country carrying a weapon.
I'm on my way to West Berlin.
You can't pass through either as long as you're armed.
My friends in Beirut recommended Schönefeld.
Sometimes, different people have the same friends.
In case you ever come back here, take this phone number.
I can pass through then?
- As soon as I know.
Friends, too?
I'd just like to know.
My name's Erwin.
Great that you want to help us.
Riding horses, playing tennis or guzzling down salmon doesn't interest me.
Here's your passport.
One has to hate the world's crudeness in order to be able to appreciate it's delicateness.
I only had a crush.
- On Andi?
Can you handle it?
She can hit trees, but only wide ones.
Gruber defends him.
Isn't that the better solution?
No way.
He'd be in prison for 10 more years.
Gruber won't be involved in anything.
I'm here to visit my client, Mr. Klein.
My trainee,
Frau Adebach.
A police officer shoots at someone who's fleeing.
Does he want to kill him, or just thwart the getaway?
A fleeing guy shoots at the police officer.
Does he want to kill him, or just continue his getaway?
What do you think about that?
I'm glad you're trying.
Hello.
- Hello.
I'd like to ask something.
- Please, go ahead.
Last Christmas, general amnesty was granted.
My brother got out then.
Now he's in again.
Will there be another amnesty this Christmas?
I don't want to be rude, but I don't think so.
But it's Christmas.
Andreas Klein.
My name is Gruber.
This is Miss Adebach.
We've got one hour.
Are you insane?
Open up please!
Venceremos!
Where's Friederike?
She didn't make it out.
- Step on it!
This coat is so fucking bright.
Why did you shoot?
- What happened?
Give me your jacket!
Why did you shoot?
Stop your yelling!
Nothing went wrong!
Where are we going?
- Across the border.
Are you crazy?
Berlin, capital of the GDR.
Station Friedrichstraße.
Passengers from West Germany
Counters 1 through 5.
Red cops are cops, too.
A comrade who's name is just Erwin?!
That's probably not even his real name.
In Germany, aggression has always come from the right wing.
But we are also against terrorism from the left.
Terrorism doesn't lead anywhere.
Terrorism scares the public and causes the deployment of defense mechanisms.
Even Lenin knew that already.
His brother was executed a terrorist.
Sit down!
Thanks.
But I sympathize with romantic young people.
We too are romantics.
I am seventy and still dreaming.
Nothing's ever completed.
How can they break a guy out of prison, in broad daylight.
Up to now, we've never known their plans.
But we are supposed to know everything!
You have to look at it that way.
- Yes, Comrade General.
What are you up to?
Trust has to be established through common experiences.
I thought we were barbecuing sausages.
I believe the plane is gone.
Maybe it's a trap?
- He's a fair guy.
(Someone tries to open the door.)
Hello!
So we meet again this soon.
- I didn't see that coming, either.
Your weapons, please.
But we're just passing through!
- That's what I thought, too.
You still need to see a doctor.
I don't have a weapon.
He looked at me.
Everything was clear to him.
- Maybe he isn't hurt that bad.
Can I help?
- But you are our guests!
Does anyone want a "jester"? - I do.
This sausage tastes good.
- Thüringer rib steak sausage.
The beer is Radeberger.
- It's good as well.
A toast to my release from the capitalist pigs' prison.
As a free man, on free ground!
Cheers!
I like this place.
But what are we doing here?
Exchange of thoughts.
Which thought would you like to exchange?
That the revolution marches on diverging paths!
Here, she sits in the office from 8 to 5.
You guys have such a sense for violence.
Here, the government is the organized form of violence.
You can only break laws, we make them!
From the outside, you only see the wall.
You see the wall from the inside, too.
Does the GDR have to extradite criminals who are wanted in West Germany?
Questions of law aren't my expertise.
But East and West Germany aren't exactly pals.
But nothing bad is allowed to happen here!
No actions on GDR territory!
- Noone wants that.
In return, you can pass through.
We independently fight against imperialism.
But we have a common enemy.
- These are difficult subjects.
We frighten the right people.
The counselor died on the scene.
Dr. Gruber hadn't worked on cases concerning terrorism before.
He leaves a wife and two young kids.
The fugitive, Andreas Klein, got a gun through
Gruber's trainee,
Friederike Adebach.
A large-scale manhunt has been initiated.
Apart from Andreas Klein, the following persons are wanted:
Detlev Bergmann.
Joachim Klatte.
Hans Jürgen Dost.
Martina Lubitz.
Rita Vogt.
Rita Vogt can be recognised through a scar on her elbow.
Caution:
These persons are armed.
The perpetrators are likely to still be in West Berlin.
However, the search has been expanded to cover the entire federal territory.
Did you HAVE to shoot?
The counselor grabbed me.
Why does he do something like that?
I can't hit a human being.
Then the cop came and shot.
So I shot.
The counsellor was in the way.
Shouldn't we bail for a while, Andi?
Does imperialism go down by itself?
Does injustice vanish by itself?
I don't want to argue with you,
I want to be with you!
(Heavy breathing sounds from the headphones.)
Well...
Excuse me, comrades.
I'm cracking up, they are screwing.
Here, in the East.
And what are WE doing?
We aren't screwing.
Nice girls.
Plus, they have steady employment.
You won't find something like that over here.
I think all vigour is gone, over here.
(Rita:) We tried to accomplish the impossible, at least once in our lives.
We felt like we were part of the international fight.
And then we experienced how in Beirut a just cause lead to a murderous civil war.
We wanted to bring the war into the metropoles of the world.
There were never ending discussions, successful and failed operations.
Victims on both sides.
A couple of years later, we were in Paris.
And we were stuck.
I know how it's going to end.
We'll go to prison, for ever.
We sit around in these fat rich countries and waste our lives.
And what for? For the poor, somewhere on this world?
Why don't we go to the starving?
The guilty are here.
The state is carried by individuals.
We just say those people should be liable to prosecution.
These are Andi's words.
Everything started with him.
It started with you. You didn't want to ride horses, play tennis and guzzle down salmon.
- And so forth.
Come here!
If they get me, I fear
I could betray you.
Do you see those guys?
They shoot without warning.
You're going insane.
We shoot first.
(Anna:) Under the rule of imperialism, an armed fight out of illegality is the only chance for active critical agitation.
Yea, man or pig.
We need money for our operations.
- A gun will take care of that.
You can block the grate with two beer crates.
We've already done that a couple of time.
That way, you cannot get trapped inside.
Rita had a look around inside.
It's idiotic to rob a bank here.
- Why?
We used to say: Don't worry, this is an anti-capitalistic operation.
How do you say it here?
- Friederike speaks French.
She shall say: We don't steal.
This is the German Revolution.
You can't assault people with a gun all the time.
We do this together, like in the past.
- Count me out.
You have a personal problem.
You degenerate to a private individual and buy a Honda with OUR money.
You defect to the pigs!
You betray me.
You think so?
- Yes.
You're looking for an enemy.
But why me?!
Let Rita be.
You fuck around and wear designer suits.
Dumb pig from the ruling class!
Hey, that's unnecessarily personal!
What are the two of you? Problem or solution? Man or pig?
One thing is obvious:
Fight the pigs to liberate man!
Every armed operation subdues the force of the circumstances to the force of the events.
That better be clear!
Vous roulez sans casques.
- We drive without a helmet.
Excusez-nous! - Vous n'êtes pas d'ici?
Montrez-moi vos papiers!
Run!
Early in the morning, the East is cold.
We've got everything.
Radeberger too.
Gladly. That's what we used to have back then.
What's already good, does not have to be changed.
Some comrades don't want to continue.
We dismounted riders, but not the emperor.
We're in deep shit.
Those comrades cost us money and are unreliable.
I am reliable!
I don't want to sit around and wait.
We were to fight on the world front.
That's what you said.
And, where is the world front?
Somewhere on this world, people like us have to be needed!
Vase.
Angola would be a destination.
Or Mozambique, if that's possible.
You do have connections to there, don't you?
Like this, it already looks a lot brighter.
We have to get out of
France, too.
I know.
To whom did that thing happen, with the cop?
To me.
It happened to me.
You want to quit, too?
- No!
(The men scare up some deer.)
Ten people.
They want to go anywhere, no matter where.
Preferably Angola or Mozambique.
What do they want from us?
We are supposed to get them in and have them accommodated.
People are black there.
As whites, how do they plan on disappearing?
I'll leave that to you.
Let's get back to the issue at hand.
We can't make any mistakes.
That's how I see it, comrade General.
That's how one has to see it.
We talk without any witnesses?
- And off the record.
Were can we sit down and talk?
- Inside.
Let's sit under the tree.
Good idea.
You are wanted world-wide, even the ones who quit.
We wont send any one of you to Africa, not Angola, not Mozambique.
The political situation there is fragile.
Secret agents all over the place.
And the people are black.
You are white.
You can be traced back to us.
We propose a different offer.
Your people can stay here.
In the GDR.
Separated, not in a group.
No contact between each other, or to their former life.
Every single one has to sign on this.
They will get new names and have new identities.
For a long time.
Maybe for ever.
Given that you lead an utterly normal, common life.
The life of the working class, so to speak.
And another thing.
We should have more serious talks than we've had in the past, in regular intervals.
I doubt you tell us all about all of your plans.
You're merely supposed to listen to us, before you scheme anything.
Do we get any military support?
You can go in for sports here.
Is shooting considered sport?
You can see it like that.
The RPG-7 is an anti-armor weapon. Who shoots?
Me.
20 metres safety clearance!
They know the ropes.
They have to have practiced already.
They couldn't make this dog into a fighter.
- What's it doing here?
It's a request of the department for personal security.
We have to do it.
We're driving important people, too.
Is the dog supposed to be in the car?
Every round has to be accounted for.
The department for personal security pays for it.
Fire!
"... the partisans of the Amur."
"That's how we blasted the scum to hell,
General and Ataman."
"Our campaign found it's end only in the Pacific."
These songs were with us.
That's how we started over after the war.
They were always with us.
And rock 'n' roll?
Not so much.
Vodka is the soldier's friend.
Hey, Andi ...
You used to be my ardent love once.
So?
Is this here the life of the working class?
I'd rather drink my beer somewhere else.
Good morning!
Four to Beirut.
For you, for you ... and for you two.
You don't have to pay!
We want to.
One ticket is left over.
Rita!
I find it brave of you to have stayed here.
You are going to see socialism for what it is.
You are going to see that sometimes we have to force people into their luck.
But maybe, you will understand.
We are for the people, therefore we are against them.
And my mother didn't get along with herself.
She didn't have a lot of money.
At age 42, she suddenly died.
I don't understand it.
We now start with your story.
- What's my story?
Your made-up life, which now becomes your real one.
When do you want to have your birthday?
Summer time, when it's warm.
Which name do you want?
Suggestion: Schmidt [Smith, very common name]
Schmidt is retarded.
Different proposal then?
No, Schmidt's fine.
Given name?
You choose.
We are going to make some suggestions for your parents' data soon.
I don't need parents.
- We let them be dead then.
Otherwise, you'll be asked about your parents all the time.
You don't have any anymore.
The truth makes for the best lies.
You know you need to carry your ID at all times.
But you know me.
That's not my job.
Which department?
- Fashion print.
Name? - Susanne Schmidt.
There's an error in the print.
- Yes, exactly.
(Woman:) The fabric print is defective!
- Coming.
Aw, shit!
Shit, man!
Something like this never happened before you started here.
Everyone makes mistakes from time to time.
- Just like we did with hiring you.
No wonder that your hands are shaking!
We'll teach you! - Teach
Elfriede, so she bathes herself.
I don't use soap. Soap destroys the natural protective layer of the skin.
One can smell that.
I don't care what an alcoholic has to say about me, anyway.
It's always an argument with you guys!
Why are you so bitchy with Tatjana?
She's the bitch!
- And you are cows, stupid cows!
Done?
I love you all.
Have you never been married?
- Alas, no.
There was someone, when my parents had the accident.
As you know, they had a fatal accident in the Netherlands.
- I didn't know that.
Don't you regret coming here?
I've always been left [politically].
I didn't have a lot of options.
I used to be a waitress.
Funny. You come here voluntarily, and I want nothing more than to get away.
It is how it is.
Here and there.
I'd like to see that with my own eyes.
Maybe I'd even come back.
Then I'd be here on my own will.
Here's the list for Nicaragua.
Again already?
Do you have a pen?
Are you messing with us?
If you please...
If you please...
- Thanks.
What's going on today?
You don't dance?
- Neither do you.
Red wine, please.
Why did you donate
10 Marks?
I thought that wasn't too much.
Do you really think they get the money?
Don't you?
Dear colleagues!
Do you still have access to West Marks?
- Alas, no.
I spent the last on a
Trabant [cheap car].
You can get everything with West Marks.
- I didn't have much.
Why didn't you rob a bank?
Oh, I did.
Cheers!
I drink to that.
Günnel, Sigrid.
Janzen, Andrea.
And Blechschmidt, Klaus.
(Dance music.
People cheer.)
''Live is Live ... ''
Tatjana?
Tatjana!
Tatjana!!
Where were you today?
- I overslept.
We were worried.
- I doubt that.
What's the time?
- Half past three.
Shit.
Do you want some coffee?
If you have some, too.
I can do that.
I feel sick.
Why's it boiling already?
The current goes directly into the water.
You can't stick a spoon in there.
Or you're dead.
You are insane, using that!
My ex-husband built it for me.
- He wanted to kill you!
Thanks.
Don't use that thing anymore!
I'm invincible!
Hello!
- Hello.
My place?
I live around the corner.
Admit it, you didn't notice!
- Did you steal these?
I wanted to get ourselves a little treat.
What else have you done?
- Danced in a bar.
Really?
First, I wound myself around a pole.
Then I bent over, and everyone could see into my ass.
And what do you expect here?
(TV:) In the past, when a sailing ship got into a dead calm, when no one brought up wind, it were bad times.
Then you spent Easter off the Christmas islands ...
Strange, out of big glasses one can drink more without getting drunk.
(He sings:) What shall we do with the drunken sailor early in the morning?
You can stay.
I'll sleep soon.
There was still some left in there.
It's empty.
You poured out the booze!
Don't lie about it!
Let me go!
Give me the key!
You think
I can't climb?
Tatjana!
Do you know how much one bottle of this is, stupid western cow?
Step on the gas!
And now, shift into second gear!
Careful!
Stay on the road!
Clutch, take out the gear, and now, break!
How am I?
- First class!
Turn around!
Drive down that path in reverse!
How do I do that?
Push down on it, move it downwards.
Accelerate, and steer.
Oh!
Fuck!
This is a new car!
Doesn't matter.
It's Sunday.
Lieutenant Knorz.
Who was driving?
Me. - Licence and registration, please!
What have we done wrong?
We drove against a tree in reverse.
Exactly.
And that's what you've done wrong.
Have you had any alcohol?
- No. - Me neither.
Follow me to the garage.
Please! - Thanks.
This is a friend from school.
They should've taken him.
You had bad luck with your marriage.
Do you know that?
She was too young.
And the husband wasn't mature either.
After the divorce, she dyed her hair.
Your name is Susanne?
- Susanne Schmidt.
Pleased to meet you. Margarethe.
Cheers!
- Cheers!
Cheers people, all the best!
(TV:) From Hamburg, the news of the day.
Bloody incident at the
German-French border.
Two men died when they tried to skip border controls.
One of them is alleged terrorist Andreas Klein.
His companion is yet to be identified.
The following persons are wanted:
Bernd Ruppel, Rita Vogt.
She has a scar on the left elbow.
Caution: Those people don't hesitate to use their weapons.
Let's go dancing!
(Father:) I used to work in China, as a mechanic. Not everyone gets that far.
Susanne has been to Paris!
She moved back here nonetheless, since she likes it better.
You don't hear that often.
The concept is better:
Less poverty, less richness.
Many people died for it, all throughout the world.
I've seen the Great Wall.
They drove us there.
But, especially the people!
It's a misperception that they all look the same.
My father always talks about China.
Do you want some wine?
Home made.
My mother warned me about men.
Women never came up.
I'll leave.
They have Bulgarian tomatoes!
- Look, the colour!
I'll get some for us.
- I'll make Ratatouille then.
What? - Ratatouille.
Do you have a scar on your arm?
- Why?
Later!
Ask her if she has a scar on her arm!
- It doesn't bother me.
How is it to live with such a past?
A call to Berlin.
Step into the phone booth!
Someone recognised me.
Can I go back to my house anyhow?
She saw you on TV?
- I think so.
Did you see it, too? - Yes.
Where? - At a birthday party.
Who's birthday?
- My colleague's Father's.
So all saw it?
I was alone in the room.
I want to be entirely truthful.
- You should be.
Tatjana stood in the door.
But not from the start.
I don't know since when.
But she hasn't said anything yet.
You stay here for the time being.
I have to be at work for the first shift tomorrow.
- We'll take care of that.
I'll be missed elsewhere, too.
You are good friends.
We know that.
She bought tomatoes for supper.
She loses it, doesn't get it.
Rumors are spread.
Write a letter!
You'll be back in a couple of days.
We'll deliver it immediately.
When will I be back?
- Soon.
Dear Tatjana,
I'm in a big hurry.
I have to help a friend.
I'll be back soon!
Don't think anything by it.
It is how it is.
Sad story, the thing with Andi.
He didn't stand a chance.
You can't go back.
What do you mean?
- What I said.
Why did I have to write the letter then?
Because we needed to buy some time.
But I want to go back to Tatjana.
And how's that supposed to work?
- That's my only condition.
You are making conditions?
Do you know what would happen if your cover was blown?
The GDR signed international anti-terrorism treaties.
Your credibility is at stake.
One can easily be crushed through something like that, not only you.
Are you interested in the welfare of human beings?
That's our job.
We usually deal with male comrades.
My husband was a lieutenant, until he retired.
We always lived in the suburbs.
Twenty - twelve.
Twenty-one - twelve.
Hold on. Rematch!
How did you carry these things?
- I'll show you.
You walk differently.
Your body has a centre.
Doesn't the skin get cold?
- The gun gets warm.
Are you insane?
Why isn't the safety engaged?
- It was! - No!
You've already shot someone before!
I helped him with accounting.
He died age 32.
I didn't want to be a widow.
Please, come in.
You aren't asleep yet.
- I'm practising my third life.
Sabine Walter.
Too young to live a widow's life.
This time, you're from the East.
That'll provoke less nosy questions.
Maybe you should ... wear glasses.
You're pretty anyway.
A cat has seven lives.
Are you married?
Yes.
It's important to be married.
Visit your colleague one last time.
It won't hurt.
The story needs an ending.
Who's there?
- Susanne.
You look different.
- You too.
I knew you'd get in touch as soon as possible.
I often checked to see if your Trabbi [the car] was here.
I didn't want to abandon you.
I think it's great that I know you.
You are important, compared to me.
I want to say goodbye.
I'm going back to West Germany.
Because of my family.
- But your parents are deceased.
I have siblings.
Don't use that hellish device anymore!
What?
- That thing you use to make coffee.
People say you are a wanted terrorist.
If that was true,
I couldn't go back to West Germany.
When they mentioned the scar,
I knew.
I'm your friend.
Talk to me!
You are mistaken, Tatjana.
I beg you, believe me!
Are you going to write?
Of course!
Yes, of course.
Stop bullshitting!
Beat it!
I'll come with you.
Maybe I'll come back sometime.
I'll be gone then.
Can I sit in the back?
- Go ahead.
That was fast. What did she say?
- That she's my girlfriend.
This is the bathroom.
The kitchen.
A couple of lamps are missing.
We've unpacked everything.
Except for the books.
Call if there's any problem at all.
I want to join the [political] party.
You always need to be truthful with the party.
Can you do that?
Good morning!
This is where you're going to be working.
Mrs. Walter is going to prepare the children's summer vacation.
She used to work in her late husband's handicraft shop. - Yes.
Coffee? - No, thank you.
Your new colleagues will show you around.
Are those old ones?
- Yes.
I'm Christa. These are Beate and Monika. We address each other informally.
I'm Sabine.
I'm sorry, I can't help.
Good morning!
I've written down who we need:
FDGB [trade union], BGL [company trade union committee],
FDJ [official youth organisation], the mayor, the Hygiene, the youth's welfare, railroad, DRK [German Red Cross],
ÖV [public administration], company canteen, construction management -
- and the children's commission.
To come off best, all at one table!
Can you swim?
Don't go out that far!
Silke, not so far out!
Are you keeping an eye on the children?
Yes.
Then I am going to keep an eye on you from now on.
My name is
Jochen Pettka.
Sleep, child, sleep, mother shepherds the sheep, father shakes the tree, falls down a dream, sleep, child, sleep!
Good night!
- Good night, Sabine!
What are you reading? - "The Physics of the Next Millennium".
Here's a nice sentence:
Innovation is what you cannot see.
Seeing something new from time to time is what's beautiful in life.
Does that mean things never play out as you would expect them to? - Yes.
Thank God not always.
This is my third summer here, as a lifeguard.
You've already been here a couple of times?
- Yes, one gets to know a lot of people.
You have beautiful eyes behind your glasses.
You went straight in there!
You think so?
Ouch! - Am I hurting you?
No, it's just my sunburn.
Noon rest till 3pm!
What's that ship?
- Ferry to Sweden.
Why do so many people want to leave here?
I've never been on vacation at the Baltic Sea!
So lie, you Brothers, down in God's name, cool is the evening breeze.
Spare us, God, from punishment and allow us to sleep calmly and our sick neighbour too.
We are going to depart soon.
This is my husband ...
- Sabine Walter.
We met through our travels.
See you in a minute, on the bus!
Excuse me.
Lets just sit down!
Shitty that we don't have time.
- Yes.
This is my son, Eric.
Glad to hear you're well.
- Why do you think that?
I'm coming.
That's how you're thanked for your commitment to the summer vacation.
As they say: Children are our most valuable good.
The documents are in the file.
My personal thanks!
- Thank you.
A reward for our screwing around!
You shouldn't say things like that!
I think you have to be into things with all your heart.
Come in!
Hang up your coat!
Are you from Berlin?
Thank you.
Why haven't you got in touch sooner?
I want to marry you.
I want you to marry me.
It's a big opportunity for me.
Five years at that institute!
It's situated in the woods, in a restricted area.
But they have everything:
Swimming pool, riding arena, cinema, theatre.
And Moscow isn't far.
And one can bring one's wife.
And so I though
I'd ask you.
And what am I supposed to do there?
You'll be my wife.
- What'll I do as your wife?
You'll be the mother of my children.
It sounds a little cheesy,
I know.
I'll be the mother of your children?
You don't believe me?
I do.
Get rid of that!
Why are you wearing glasses?
For fun.
Why didn't you tell me?
- What for?
Glasses made of plain glass!
Give it to me!
Glasses without a purpose?
Let's not talk about that anymore!
Please, you don't need the be angry!
Maybe someone once thought you were more beautiful with glasses.
Are you on the pill?
- Do I have to be?
Hello.
Here I am.
I'm glad you are.
We thought about it.
It's out of the question.
We can't keep your identity a secret from the Russians.
We don't want to tell them.
But it'd be too messy.
You think you can control everything!
Right.
But I want to go there, with him!
We love each other and are going to have a child!
You don't have to have a child.
And if I have one anyway?
Are you watching West German TV?
Why?
They show GDR women holding up their children when they climb into the West German embassy in Prague.
Do you see anything of that on GDR television?
Do you see?
Some people in this country are asleep.
Those are my worries at the moment.
So I ask you of all people for your understanding.
If I couldn't go to Moscow, would you stay here?
Why?
If I can't go.
But that's why we are going to get married!
- Even if I won't come with you?
What do you mean?
I don't understand.
I'll tell you who the mother of your children really is.
I live here under a false name with the consent of the concerned agencies, because in the West, I'm wanted as a terrorist.
Are you a terrorist?
Yes.
I used to be.
But terrorists are idiots who kill innocent people.
Yes, that's what I used to do.
But you can't tell me this!
I can't know this!
I have to go there now, though.
No. 15, please step forward!
Take a seat!
Cigarette?
I came from Berlin.
Whatever. So?
This concerns an ex-colleague of yours.
Maybe some sort of girlfriend.
She's not here anymore.
We know that.
I'll gladly tell you what I know.
She immigrated into the GDR a long time ago, from the West.
I didn't believe it at first.
- Why not?
I had never heard of anything like that before.
But she was left, politically.
Her parents were killed in an accident in Amsterdam.
So she was left over alone.
Some time ago, she got word that she still has some siblings in the West, so she moved back.
Unfortunately. She was different from all the others in the shop.
She was a strong supporter of the GDR, something not everyone is.
I can't say anything bad about her in this context.
Have others talked about her?
I can't think of anything like that at the moment.
Why have I been arrested?
I'm offering you a deal.
You sign, informally, that we stay in contact.
After that, you can go home.
It's, at the same time, a sign that you're loyal to the republic.
Tatjana, the wall is gone now, and the border is open.
It's just like you always wanted it to be.
But you are in prison, because you have been in contact with a known terrorist.
And this didn't happen to you in the West, but in the East.
It's so crazy!
It is certain that nothing in the other part of Germany is ever going to be the same as it used to be.
I'm writing down what I'd say if you were here.
I imagined a life without lies and deception, as you have, even if different.
It was clear to me, we are trapped in an unjust, wrong system.
But the guerilla couldn't achieve liberation, because no one understood us.
I didn't just want to hide in the GDR,
I was looking for another world.
I wanted to move forward, not backward.
I hope you'll manage to get out soon.
The BRD [Federal Republic of Germany] demands the extradition of those persons.
How do they want to know they are here?
They've always known.
Through whom?
- Maybe through us.
Why did we hide them then?
Twice, even!
We worked our asses off to hide them.
Excuse me, comrade General.
I've had people arrested, just because they might have known about it.
Has everything been a double-cross?
Like in a secret agent flick?
If you don't explain the world to me,
I won't explain it to you either.
You have the addresses?
- I'd rather not touch this affair.
You have to touch a lot of things before you die.
We did something for them, not the other way around.
They didn't tell us much about their secrets.
Maybe they were criminals.
You can look at it like that.
But I'm disappointed that we abandon them like this.
Do you want to go home and cry?
Your weapons, please!
That's how accidents happen, girly!
- I'm sorry!
Look!
Unbelievable!
"Terrorist hidden by StaSi." [GDR's secret service]
We've lived with criminals!
Anything for peace!
Read it!
She was part of a choir.
They had money for things like that!
But we couldn't get decent Jeans.
She didn't do anything to or against YOU,
I mean, US.
One cannot live next to a murderer, though!
This isn't my government anymore.
Maybe you'll never be better off than now and here!
Here, you cannot lose your job or be kicked out of your apartment.
You don't know what you're going to miss out on.
Maybe you'll be able to afford decent trousers, but not the arse in those trousers.
You're crazy!
This here was a great attempt, a revolution.
Despite all the crap, you were part of it.
It's supposed to be a world that isn't ruled by money.
Why don't you believe in that anymore?
In yourselves anymore?
We can't do anything for you anymore.
What happened to Friederike?
- You don't know?
I do.
But what happened?
They are going to get you, too.
- This is still the GDR, though!
And in the GDR, you are going to be arrested, through the people's police.
What a screwed up ending.
East is over there, west over there.
You're wanted everywhere.
If they cannot find you today, they are going to hunt you.
Avoid airports and big train stations.
If you can, forget we've ever known each other.
I will forget that.
I can give you a ride for a little way.
Why did you arrest Tatjana?
Susanne!
Open up, it's me!
Hands up!
Against the wall!
Are you Rita Vogt?
I need to pee.
Actually, I cannot take you with me without a helmet.
You don't know that as an Eastern broad.
You were pretty much cut off.
But I don't have any prejudices.
Thanks.
It not any individual's fault.
Excuse me, I need to pee.
This is the East.
I hope she doesn't drive around here.
She's supposed to have killed several people.
- Here or in the west?
Doesn't matter, order and security have to exist everywhere.
I won't shoot.
Papers, please!

All we can do is try to publicize the facts.
Not what the government is saying, but the facts.
And not simply parrot or regurgitate... what the government's saying, because that's largely bullshit. lt was the dead of winter. l don't remember it ever being so cold.
And we were on a mission.
A bunch of us had volunteered to drive our good friend to his new home... the Schuylkill Federal Prison in the middle of Pennsylvania.
He called himself Phiber Optik.
You'd have to look hard to find someone who didn't think he was brilliant.
Before we left, we had a night of fun... in the streets of Philadelphia, in the middle of an ice storm.
Phiber learned by exploring.
He was never too busy to explain... howthings worked to anyone interested. l think that's what pissed of the authorities the most.
They never tried to prove that
Phiber Optik hacked into any computers.
They got him for conspiracy... for talking on a tapped phone line... about howto hack certain sites.
There were people who broke into systems... and fucked things up, and they never even got arrested.
The feds didn't care.
They wanted to shut down the teachers, the people who didn't knowto keep secrets.
There's Bernie S.
He's another guy who loves to explain... howtechnology works to anyone who's interested.
He didn't know it, but hell was just around the corner waiting for him.
We made one last stop before we dropped Phiber off. lt was a town called Frackville.
We thought it was funny because of a hacker newsletter called Phrack.
We thought it'd make a good picture for the hacker community.
But Bernie had the balls to get a Frackville cop... to pose with Phiber.
These guys had no clue what was going on... but they quickly got into the spirit. lt was the last time we laughed that night.
We drove to the prison. lt felt like it was 20 degrees below zero.
We didn't know they'd throw him in the hole... for the entire weekend.
Some kind of prison welcoming ceremony.
And like the gullible idiots we were... we figured we'd have a chance to say goodbye.
We didn't.
They grabbed him.
And we had to run out of there to keep them from taking our camera.
Phiber came home 10 months later, a hero.
Everyone knew sending someone like that to prison... was a big mistake.
After it was over, we were pretty sure it wouldn't happen again.
Were we ever wrong.
Bad boys gone to jail
Bad boys gone to jail
Look at you, boy, you've come of age and now you're going around saying you're a bad boy
You say that you'll never go to jail
'Cause you're so bad and you cannot fail
Oh bad boy
Oh rude boy
Oh bad boy
Gots to believe me
Oh bad boy
Here is how you fail
Gots to believe me one time
You went to town just to fool around
You met a girl who was wearing a frown
You going around, boasting, feeling bad
Now you're sitting in jail don't you feel so sad
This is like the crudest form of communication l've ever had to do. l just saw something.
Was that you? Well, we can see your hand. l doubt you can stick your whole head through the window
Splotch your face up against the window
We'll know it's the right one, we can at least zoom in on it.
We'll know it's the right one, we can at least zoom in on it.
Kevin Mitnick, the world's most dangerous computer hacker.
My regret about Cyberpunk is talking about Kevin... and how he was always eating and how he was overweight.
People have really gotten on my case about that.
Some guy came up to me at anAustin book thing and said:
''Why did you go on and on about Kevin's weight?''
And he was right. l did that to the point where it just wasn't tasteful.
Where it was sort of... just beating an issue that didn't need to be beaten.
For a period after he was arrested, incarcerated... and released into a halfway house... l couldn't find a single article... that talked about him without mentioning his weight.
And the real fascination with Kevin's body... and its relationship to technology.. is one of the things that absolutely hooked me. l found a number of articles in Time,
Newsweek, and the New York Times... written by people like Markoff and Joshua Quittner and so on.
And they would say
Kevin was in a halfway house... where he no longer touched a computer, and lost 100 pounds.
As if those two things were connected.
1988, USA Today... put his picture on the front page... morphed or superimposed with the image of Darth Vader.
And l thought this is a remarkable combination of two things... and it's really picking up on the idea of the Dark Side hacker. lf ever there was someone who fit that description, it was Kevin.
The mention of his name was enough to incur the wrath of the authorities.
Over the years, his reputation grew and so did the falsehoods. ln numerous articles, Kevin was said to have broken into NORAD... harassed actress Kristy McNichol... and turned his friends' home phones into payphones.
His beginning was on ham radio.
And on ham radio, it's a close-knit community.
A couple of dozen people at the most on a particular repeater or channel.
And, you know, they would get into challenges.
And, of course,
Mitnick would be the underdog.
''Let's challenge him, let's do this and that.''
When he met their challenges, they'd start crying and screaming... as if they were innocentvictims of Kevin's.
This has been the case throughout.
And then people would start unfairly using... other contacts that they had. ln one case there was a lieutenant or commander in the LAPD....
One ham radio operator who was a friend of his... got him to write a letter saying Kevin was interfering with LAPD communications.
And all sorts of crazy things in his past.
Cyberpunk was published in 1991...
Cyberpunk was published in 1991... by Katie Hafner and then-husband John Markof... and relied almost entirely on the words of people... who Kevin had had a falling out with... as well as those who didn't know him at all.
Hafner and Markoff never talked to Kevin, because he wanted to be paid for his time.
But it didn't take much to dispel the rumors.
NORAD denied any break-ins...
Kristy McNichol had no idea she was being harassed... and no evidence ever surfaced of any payphone conversions.
But none of this ever got printed.
Kevin's name was enough to convict him, regardless of the actual evidence.
And then there was Security Pacific.
After being hired,
Kevin had once again been terminated... because of the stories that followed him.
And this resulted in yet another Mitnick myth being born.
There was a Newswire article coming out that stated... that Security Pacific had lost billions of dollars or something... in bad loans... which would have affected their stock price.
That was actually tracked down to some error... that someone made in entering the information. lt had nothing to do with it not being true... but it was an error that someone made in entering the information. lmmediately, because there were employees at Security Pacific... that knew Kevin Mitnick, including one ham radio operator... immediately that was attributed to,
''Kevin Mitnick did this.''
And that's howthat rumor spread. l'd seen this all before.
Hackers were always getting blamed for things they didn't do. ln many cases for things that weren't even possible. lt was obvious somebody had to set the record straight... somebody who would command respect.
Hackers break into government and business computers... stealing and destroying information... raiding bank accounts, running up credit card charges... extorting money by threats to unleash computer viruses.
Whoa, hold on a second.
What was this guy reading?
The Weekly World News?
Hackers don't steal and extort, they play with all kinds of things.
Like those Simplex locks on the FedEx boxes. ln typical corporate brainpower...
FedEx uses the same combination on every drop box in the country. lt's fun to stick something really big in there... that couldn't possibly fit in the chute just to fuck with the guy
And he got some cheap beer out of it too. lf you go somewhere you're not supposed to be... and bring something back to show people... that always struck me as being a whole lot like a panty raid.
And you know, panty raids are really... in the grandest tradition of this country
Try to make your way in there... get the stuff, and get back out with it without getting your head cut of.
What we're doing here is we're talking... on McDonald's external speaker for their drive-thru.
And what we're doing to do that... is we have a modified ham radio... meaning it transmits on frequencies other than the ones it was intended to. ln this case, it's standard business band frequencies.
154.6 megahertz seems to be the standard McDonald's frequency l'll take your order.
The blonde, would you please kneel down for a second?
Could one of you take off your tops?
We'll give you the food for free.
You bastards, you better stop being smart.
-Here comes the manager.
-Really?
While corporateAmerica would always be the playground of hackers... it was mostly about fun and exploration, not damage or profit.
But try telling that to corporateAmerica.
Kevin Mitnick had already paid a heavy price for his curiosity.
He had served a year-and-a-half in 1988... for logging into DEC computers without authorization.
By simply looking at the VMS operating system...
DEC claimed he caused millions of dollars in damage... and was sentenced as if he had caused that amount of physical damage.
He was held without bail and was put in solitary confinement for eight months...
He was held without bail and was put in solitary confinement for eight months... because they thought he could do more damage from the prison payphone.
After his sentence, Kevin served three years of supervised release... reporting to authorities every month... and being restricted in where he could go and what he could do.
He only had days to go when federal authorities decided... he had violated the terms of his supervised release... by associating with Lewis DePayne... and accessing someone's voice mail without permission. lt was nothing.
But it was enough.
Knowing howthe media and the court system... would crucify him over any offense... because he could start World War lll from a payphone...
Kevin decided to just walk away. l was devastated.
We were never far away from each other.
And how was he living on his own... without his family to share things with? lt was horrible.
What kind of a life is this?
He is not streetwise.
He's a home person.
Kevin managed to avoid attention.
Then, on July 4, 1994, everything changed.
A front page story in the NewYork Times... turned Kevin Mitnick into a household word all over again.
The evil-looking picture... the mythical stories about breaking into NORAD computers... and controlling all the telephones in California... even the Security Pacific news release tale was retold as fact.
Nobody could figure out howthe story made it onto the front page ofThe Times... since there was nothing new in the story
But the author was no stranger.
John Markoff... who was quickly becoming a Mitnick expert without ever having met him.
We looked at the story as an amusement back then.
We were planning the first Hackers On
Planet Earth conference thatAugust.
The story had gotten so big that we all walked around with Mitnick masks.
They came here to the Hotel Pennsylvania by the hundreds.
These usually anonymous creatures of the cyberworld... better known as hackers, were holding a convention.
Throughout that weekend,
Kevin called in several times to say hi.
We all wished he could be there.
But we knew why he was running.
One of the things Markoff hadn't mentioned in his article... was the eight months of solitary confinement.
The guy was in solitary confinement for eight months.
Think about it. l mean, that would definitely change a man.
You would run.You wouldn't want that. lt was eight months, not for anything he did, but because the judge was scared.
And if you get someone who is that unaware... of actually what he can do and thinks he can destroy the world. lf you have someone who has enough power... to put you in solitary confinement you will run. lt makes perfect sense to me. l think it's part hype... part hysteria, part lack of understanding... and part fear.
Solitary confinement means no books... no pencil, no paper, no company.
Nothing to do... but stare at these small four walls.
He would get out one hour a day.. and that's it.
You know, he might whistle up some missile launch codes.
That's a big problem with hackers nowadays.
They get a little pissed off and they launch some nukes by whistling.
The fear factor is just insane.
Once or twice or maybe more, l can't even remember... they didn't even bring him down to the visitors' room.
They took my daughter and l... upstairs to a floor... that wasn't occupied at that time.
We were the only ones there and the guard.
They were hovering over him... as though he was an absolute monster
What could he possibly do, you know?
Could he make... a computer out of the telephone? l don't know what they were afraid of!
First of all, he had no desire to.
Secondly, it wouldn't have accomplished anything.
Thirdly, he couldn't do it.
Kevin managed to elude the authorities into the next year.
Then, on February 15, 1995... they found him in Raleigh, North Carolina.
The FBl's most-wanted computer hacker is behind bars.
Kevin Mitnick was jailed without bond in Raleigh, North Carolina... where he was arrested this week.
He's accused of breaking into corporate computers nationwide.
Private computer experts say so many other hackers are at work... that privacy is virtually impossible.
The FBl had managed to track Kevin... with the help of a mysterious computer expert, Tsutomu Shimomura... who, along with some friends had managed to track...
Kevin's cellular phone signal to the apartment he was staying in.
One of Shimomura's friends who was there while the signal was being traced... was none other than John Markoff... who wrote an even bigger front page story this time.
Sure enough, l opened the door, the next day... to the hotel room, and there was The Times outside the door.
And l picked it up and l just thought,
''Oh, my God.''
This article had a new list of things that Kevin had supposedly done... including breaking into
Shimomura's ultra-secure computer... leaving nasty voice mail messages... and stealing 20,000 credit card numbers... something that was mentioned in the first paragraph on the front page.
But 13 paragraphs later, on Page D17... it was revealed that he had never used any of them.
They were credit card numbers that had been left lying around... by lnternet Service Provider Netcom for almost a year.
Netcom credit card file, everybody had that file. lf you didn't have that file, you were a loser.
Hundreds of people had that, they swapped it around like bubble gum.
And then they claim that he's the one who did it, he's the one that had it... when that was floating around for months before he theoretically had it.
Everybody and his sister's got a million credit card numbers.
What's the big deal? lt's a meaningless thing to have.
What l want to know... is did he threaten anybody in any way?
Did he claim he was going to do some particular set of harm?
Are there any notebooks that showed he had plans... to conspire to commit any particular thing... other than humiliating
Tsutomu Shimomura... which any idiot who's ever met Shimomura could have told him... this was not the guy to mess with. l met Shimomura once.
The first time l met Shimomura was in front of Congress.
And l was testifying to a congressional subcommittee... and there's this guy... in sandals and, like, ragged-ass cutofs.
And the rest of us are done up in ties... it's me and theAttorney General from New Jersey.
And we're sitting there, giving our best
''Yes, we're in front of Congress'' thing.
And Shimomura is there in this surfer gear.
And he pulls thisAT&T cell phone... pulls it out of the shrink-wrap, finger-hacks it... and starts monitoring phone calls... going up and down Capitol Hill... while an FBl agent is standing at his shoulder listening to him. l'm like, ''This fucker's got balls the size of durian fruit.''
You know, this is unbelievable.
This is the heaviest guy l've ever seen. l mean, he's hacking, right?
He was finger-hacking this phone in front of Congress... with two FBl agents and John Gage from Sun Microsystems... in the room with him.And l was like,
''Wow,'' you know. l mean, l was impressed. lnside of a week, Shimomura and Markoff had signed a book deal... estimated to be worth $750,000. lt would be another 19 months before Kevin would even be indicted.
The book, entitledTakedown, was finished by the end of the year.
When l read it, l was aghast. lt was Tsutomu's eating and skateboarding habits. l'd been to a lot of the restaurants he'd been to... but l didn't need a hacker book to tell me about them.
Takedown. Well.... l don't what l want to say aboutTakedown.
Takedown was not well received.
1996 came and went as did 1997.
Kevin remained in prison without even a bail hearing... and no prospect of a trial anytime soon.
A25-count indictment accused him of nothing more serious... than lying on the telephone about who he was... and copying software which he never tried to sell or even distribute.
Nothing about hacking into Shimomura's machine... or having 20,000 credit card numbers... nothing that would have appeared in a John Markoff story.
North Carolina had also charged him with making free cellular phone calls.
Kevin was given a two-year sentence... more than he would have gotten for manslaughter.
But the federal charges still remained.
They even put him in solitary confinement again... because the authorities were convinced he'd build a transmitter out of a Walkman... sneak into the warden's office and monitor his conversations.
The mainstream media made light of it... claiming Mitnick was put in solitary for having too many cans of tuna.
What everyone seemed to forget was years were going by... and this guy had yet to be tried.
And then, things got a whole lot worse.
June 1998.
June 1998.
A movie version of Takedown was announced.
Skeet Ulrich, who played a killer in Scream... was set to play Kevin Mitnick.
And Russell Wong from The Joy Luck Club... would be Tsutomu Shimomura. lt didn't seem to matter to anyone... that the real-life Kevin was still rotting in prison without a trial.
According to the script we got our hands on... he had been found guilty and sentenced already.
The magic of Hollywood.
They even brought
Kevin and Tsutomu closer. ln real life, they'd only met for a few seconds in a courtroom. ln the Hollywood version they met in a dark alleyway... where Kevin would proceed to bash Tsutomu on the head... with a garbage can lid.
We had to tell the world that this was a big mistake.
The truth needed to be told.
And we could either do it ourselves, or use the media.
That's right, the media, democracy's biggest allies... committed to informing the public no matter the cost.
The true conscience of America.
-Stop pushing!
-Get out of the way, Brad.
Watch yourselves!
Come on, guys.
Don't yell at me, everyone's in front of me.
Tell them to come back.
He's coming to the mike!
Would you guys get down?
Watch the mikes!
Let's get out of the way.
Come on.
We decided to do it ourselves.
We found Skeet Ulrich's apartment in New York in a phone book... and paid a visit to try and get him the real story
But he had moved. l know, because the doorman let me look at every single name in the book.
So the next stop was Miramax Films on the West Side.
We figured they'd appreciate a chance to correct the mistakes in the screenplay.
And we knew we'd be warmly received because this was Miramax.
The company had distributed
Michael Moore's latest film... you know, the guy who films in everybody's lobby.
Hi, we're looking for Miramax?
-What's your name?
-Emmanuel Goldstein.
Who you here to see?
Sorry, you can't film in here.
-You can't film here?
-No, it's a landmark.
Sorry, you can't....
So there's no way you can call upstairs....
You have to call them, they will call me.
This wasn't going well.
How could a movie company tell us to stop filming?
All we wanted to do was talk to somebody.
What a letdown.
His light is on, so he's capturing everything.
So please go outside before he has to call the police.
All right, we don't want that, so we'll go outside....
We called the office and waited to hear from them, but we never did. lt was like they were scared of us.
Maybe they agreed with Bill Clinton... that hackers were as one-dimensional as they were in the script.
How could we get them to see the other side?
That night, NewYork City introduced unlimited ride MetroCards.
We decided to find out how long it would take for our cards to reset... so we could let people in for free.
This is what the hacker world was really all about.
Why didn't they see this?
Why did it always have to be something evil to the people who didn't get it?
We had only one option.
''For Off The Hook, l recently heard the show...
''where you got the copy of a script for Takedown.
''l found it really amusing howthe scriptwriters can take the truth...
''and not twist it or fabricate it, but just plain lie about what happened.'' l've heard about Kevin's story, and thanks to Off The Hook... l heard about this meeting, and l decided to come... and see how l can help. lt wasn't from me, it's from somebody else, l knew who that is.
-ls there a good catchiness?
-Yeah. ''From Supermax to Miramax:
''Three-and-a-halfYears With No Trial.''
And then you can make another one,
''From Miramax to Supermax:
''And No Trial.''
When they see two ''Free Kevin'' stickers... when they see 10, 20, 100, they're gonna say, ''Who the hell is Kevin?''
They'll keep saying it until somebody answers them.
One or two people that know more about it are one or two people more on our side.
Those two people get two people who get two people.That's how it is.
We're gonna be in their face every step of the way. lf it comes to showing this thing on the screen, in theaters... we're going to be there, too. l mean, what we're doing now isn't going to be finished... until Kevin has his trial, until Kevin is out.
''Guilty by Hollywood'' or something like that.
-That's a good one.
-l like that.
Yeah, l did look at the script, and.... l don't know. lt's a shame and it definitely shouldn't be something out there... for someone who knows very little about Kevin... to then see this movie and have ideas in their head that are untrue.
We had tried talking to them and they wouldn't listen.
Now, by having a demonstration outside their offices, they would have to listen.
But we were hackers.
What did we know about demonstrations?
Just that they can turn into riots... especially when the Mayor bans demonstrations outside City Hall... and the cops shoot people a lot more.
We needed guidance, someone with experience.
We looked all over town for an activist.
Maybe one of those gray-haired hippies from the '60s.
We found one. Sort of.
What's it like demonstrating here?
Do you get harassed?
They hate our guts because they don't want the truth to come out.
Why do you think there isn't more activism?
Because people don't care, they're scared... they're afraid they'll get into trouble. l can understand it.
But we still have to take a stand, afraid or not.
We have to at least give it a try, we have to give it a shot.
-Has this cop been giving you any trouble?
-No, he hasn't bothered me.
And we have a President that wants to suck their brains out.
That bothers a lot of people, but....
Anybody that's decent gets bothered when a little child is tortured to death.
Or when a President is sucking their brains out.
Yeah.
He wasn't exactly what we had in mind. l got a real earful about the evils of homosexuals and communists.
But in the end, he told us the one thing we needed to hear
When you demonstrate, make sure you're in the right.
And that's the one thing we were sure of:
We were right.
The day arrived.
We had no idea what to expect.
We just stood there for a while, not knowing what to do.
Our converted phone company van got more attention than us.
My name is Noah Kenickstein, l'm an attorney.
-For Miramax?
-No. For you all! l didn't even know.
-l'm a lawyer. l'm representing you all.
-Okay. Great.
So, no one's getting arrested, right?
-l didn't plan on it.
-Good.
The National Lawyers Guild sent someone to protect us... and that was the turning point.
Things began to come together.
Even members of the media showed up. lt seemed like everyone except Miramax was taking this seriously.
We learned that when you stand outside a film studio's offices with picket signs... people notice.
These folks are gonna put on a little demonstration here.
They're gonna be marching around. l thought l would tell you.
-You could tell the....
-l'll tell the precinct.
Tell the precinct, and tell them l'm a lawyer lt's nice and calm.
No problems at all.
But they're having a little....
They'll be marching around.
-l've got it.
-l wanted to tell you that. l appreciate thatvery much.
Could you tell me approximately how many? l would say there's gonna be....
50 people, Patty?
50 to 60, maximum 50.
-What area are you doing it in?
-ln front of Miramax Films.
They're demonstrating about a movie that they're making.
Thanks a lot, l appreciate you stopping me.
Everybody's nice and calm.
-l'll tell them that.Thanks for the advice.
-Okay, no problem.
No, they're not gonna come on purpose.
People are, you know....
You're talking about suits.
They don't give a fuck.
You got to go hand it to them.
Don't harass the people who walk by
Some people have crises going on in their lives.
They can't be bothered with our problems.
Do you have a permit?
Who's in charge out here?
Do you all have a permit?
As long as you don't block the front of the entrance.
You stay to the side, please.Thank you.
They can walk in front.
The cops have been--
As long as you don't block the entrance, l don't have no problem.
They have a FirstAmendment right.
Don't block the entrance.
That's all l'm saying. lt's ringing. l got put in voice mail, guess they got too many calls.
This one's reaching voice mail. l'll leave a message.
Hi, this is the protest outside.
Are you guys there? lf you get this, come outside.
We're right down here. l see someone.
All right. Maybe you'll pick up the phone or come downstairs later.
You calling the Publicity Department?
No, the main number. l got a hold of them yesterday... and l asked for directions to the protest... and they told me they couldn't get me from where l was at to here. l said, ''Okay, l'll call you back tomorrow when l'm out front.''
-l see them, they've got their heads out.
-There's one.
They're not answering the phones.
Waving banners that said ''Free Kevin''... and holding ''Stop Miramax'' posters... the small butvocal crowd of protesters... stood outside Miramax Pictures'
New York offices yesterday.
At issue: this script, entitledTakedown... the story of the nation's most notorious computer hacker, Kevin Mitnick.
Mitnick is currently being held in prison without bail... awaiting trial on computer crimes. lt's a script these Kevin Mitnick supporters say is libelous... and would hurt Mitnick's chances of getting a fair trial. lt might influence the jury lt might change a lot of things in a negative way.
He's trying so hard to at least get a trial and then this comes up... where he's constantly being defamed.
You never know who you might see when you're standing outside a film studio.
Kevin Bacon had no interest whatsoever.
But radio personality Lazlow did.
With the proliferation of the news...
TV news journalism like Primetime Live... and these shows that completely distort the facts... and shows like 60 Minutes being forced to go in the same direction... people don't knowthe facts about the case.
They don't knowthe facts about hackers. l'd say that hackers... are the communists of the 1990s... where, basically, if anybody says ''hacker''... all of a sudden you've got this demon 666 across your head.
Nobody actually understands any of it.
What l do in my part, on the radio... with my syndicated show, is try to get people to open their brains... because l talk to a lot of old people, because l'm on a lot of news talk stations.
When l can, l put Emmanuel or Bernie S., or anybody else on there... to talk about the state of what's going on, because nobody else will cover it.
The people who cover it in the mainstream media... do so for profit, like the guy that wrote the book.
The demonstrators say they have sent a copy of this illicitly obtained script... to Kevin Mitnick in jail, and that he absolutely hates it.
Miramax's parent, Disney, may not like it either.
The controversy comes on the heels... of the dumping of $43 million in Disney stock... by the Texas Board of Education.
The board's complaint: Miramax films have too much sex and violence.
Miramax distorts the facts!
Was that Harvey Weinstein,
President of Miramax?
He walked right by us.
He didn't even get a ''Stop Miramax'' brochure?
Of course we had a brochure for Harvey.
Okay, l'll talk to you later. Bye.
-What did they say?
-l don't know.
There she is.
That's the one who answered the phone.
She hung up on me yesterday l got through.
They waved. Did you see them wave?
Miramax distorts the facts!
They said if you use a bullhorn... or obstruct people's walkways, you have to have a permit.
Miramax distorts the facts! lf you continue to use that, l'm gonna have to call the cops. l think that three years is a long time to be held without actually having a trial.
And l think that what Miramax is doing... is going to jeopardize his right to have a free and honest trial.
So that's why l'm out here protesting.
Thank you.
They all were aware of the thing in front of the building in NewYork City.
They talked about it on the set, asked me about it.
They said ''Did you talk to Emmanuel?
That's great.''
They were waving. They think it's fantastic.
And they all want Free Kevin stickers.
The whole crew. lf you give me some, l will send it to them.
They will put them on their cars.
Hello, sir.
Do you know who Kevin Mitnick is?
Hello, sir.
Do you know who Kevin Mitnick is?
No, l do not.
Computer hacker who's been in jail for three-and-a-half years without a trial.
Miramax has decided to make a movie about him.
The script is false. lt makes him out to be a violent racist... which he is not. l want to know what you think about it.
When are they doing the film?
-They start shooting in a few weeks.
-Kevin Mitnick is great.
-How do l find out the truth?
-They should take him out of prison.
-Hold on, l want to talk to you.
-What's that?
My main thing is the only reason he ended up running afoul of the law... is because people don't have access to communications.
All you got is big corporations like Miramax with access to communications.
FirstAmendment! Yeah!
This is inAmerica.
-He was in jail three years without a trial?
-He's still in jail. l saw something about this on CNBC on Friday.
This happens a lot, though.
You always have unauthorized biographies and stuff like that.
Where it's like, you have an autobiography... you have an authorized biography.
-This is sort of like an unauthorized--
-This is going to be big.
-He hasn't had a trial yet?
-Hasn't had a trial yet.
Not only that, in the movie, they already wrote that he had a trial.
-You ever hear of Kevin Mitnick?
-No. Who's that?
Well, if you're walking away, l really can't....
How did you guys get a hold of the script?
Okay. All right.
You're a lawyer. lsn't it illegal if they're gonna slander him?
Can't they try and stop them on legal grounds?
That's not right.They have to put a waiver-- l think they should hold the film until after he's had a fair trial. l mean, it happens. lt happened, unfortunately
You know, l don't think it should be....
Obviously, it's probably not legal to have a lawsuit against Miramax. l think they should have to wait until he's had a fair trial.
And also they shouldn't use his real name. lf they want to change the facts, they should change the name.
-Make it a fictional story.
-Three-and-a-half years is a long time.
Think about what you've done for the last three-and-a-half years.
And imagine being in jail while all that stuf was happening.
For just that. Just for copying software. l've copied software.
-What did he do? He hacked.
-He hacked. l would like to know your opinion... on the slandering in this film.
Miramax sucks. So, like, Free Kevin! l can't talk shit about a movie l haven't seen or read the script of.
But the one relevant thing that l could say.. is it seems to me there is a witch-hunt sort of hysterical mentality.. vis-a-vis hacking, you know.
People are very quick to fly off the handle and condemn as terrorists... people who are, you know, exploring a newtechnology landscape... in a way that they don't understand.
-Definitely.
-That's as far as l can go not having seen it.
Not only did we find a receptive bunch at local theaters... they even started to do our work for us.
New York was great.
But it was only the start.
New York was great.
But it was only the start.
We had to travel to get to the right people.
So we put together a camera crew... and made sure none of us had anything planned for the next several weeks.
We charted out a course, and headed to the airport.
That's where we got our economy-sized rental car with unlimited mileage.
The plan was to go to Wilmington, North Carolina... where filming for Takedown was about to begin.
On the way, we figured we'd make a detour and stop at Defcon... the annual hacker convention in Las Vegas. lf we were going to do that, we should stop in San Diego... to say hi to Tsutomu Shimomura... and maybe convince him to stop using Kevin Mitnick as a cash cow.
And if we did that, it would be rude not to visit John Markof... to ask him to inject some accuracy into his stories about Kevin.
Since we were suddenly adding
10,000 miles to this rental car... we might as well visit some of the corporations... who were claiming Kevin Mitnick cost them millions of dollars in damages... just to see what the hell they were talking about.
There's something about Pennsylvania. l call it the Prison State.
That's because they seem to have prisons everywhere you look.
And almost everyone l know who's gone to prison seems to wind up in Pennsylvania.
Weird.
Besides, every time l get pulled over by a cop... l seem to find myself in the Prison State. l knew l'd better be careful.
Let's not get off on the wrong foot,
Pennsylvania's great.
Home of such landmarks as the Liberty Bell, lndependence Hall... that little surveillance camera above lndependence Hall... and the house where Thomas Jefferson signed the Declaration of lndependence... just down the block from theAfro-American
Museum and its new neighbor.
A maximum-security federal prison right in the middle of Philadelphia.
Howtimes change.
They say it's illegal to take pictures of any prison... even those under construction, even those right in the middle of a city
We couldn't find a law anywhere that backed this up... but try taking a picture of a prison... without getting threatened by some prison guard or cop.
Here, look at this part.
Maybe there are subtle details that will lead to a prison uprising some day l think fully half of the people in federal prison, if not more... shouldn't be there. lt's notviolent criminals.
Drug crimes. Somebody gets a mandatory 10 years... for selling $800 worth of LSD.
That's not right either.
That's the way the federal system works. lt's just not right. l knowthe state of California has more prisoners than SouthAfrica. lncarceration is a big business. l think that's part of the reason.
There is less and less tolerance on the part of the public... for people who have transgressed the rules.
We have a huge prison population.
This gets into other questions.
Putting a computer hacker in with sex offenders and murderers... is probably the worst thing you can possibly do... to somebody who has... not murdered, is not a violent criminal!
Somebody who's a technological....
Who's gone over the edge.
Then, again, we have to define what we mean.
We need a new classification system for technological law. ln one of my books l talked about setting up a court system... especially for technology where the people that were prosecuting... and the judges and the people involved in the cases... would have some technological basis... to evaluate and try the case in a reasonable manner... and to come up with an alternative sentencing system... that reflected more the nature of the crime. lf you're exposed to people like that for too long, you change with them.
You become one of them.
Next thing you know you'll be locked away again for doing what they do.
One night...
...l was in my cell in a minimum-security facility, Bucks County Prison.
Two guards stormed in... and flipped my bed upside down... and locked me in handcufs and started rummaging through my storage locker.. demanding to know where my computer was. l'm like, ''l don't have a computer here.
What are you talking about?''
They were squeezing the toothpaste out of my tube... ostensibly looking for a computer or whatever they were looking for. lt was bizarre!
But Pennsylvania was more than prisons, it was a place of learning.
And theAge Expo was where thousands of senior citizens learned... that corporateAmerica really cared about them.
The guy representing BellAtlantic was the most sincere of all.
How could you not trust a fox?
Freddie the Phone-Fraud Fox was passing corporate numbers to the seniors:
Over $4 billion in phone fraud every year.
Freddie said most of that was because of evil computer hackers.
And l met him.
Freddie knew words like ''digit'' would only confuse older people. lt made more sense to say things like
''ten-number number.'' lt means they will have to dial the area code... along with their seven-digit number each time they place a call... within and between 215, 610... and the new 267 for 215... and the 484 for 610 area code.
You give them out in blocks of 10,000 and people that get these blocks of 10,000... end up using 300 numbers and all the others are tied up wasted.

The media feeds you every day what to think and say
We went back...
...to a familiar place.
Everything was just as we left it... only it was about 90 degrees warmer.
But you could still feel the chill after four-and-a-half years. lt was surprising how nobody tried to stop us from filming.
So we filmed everything.
The medium-security facility... the minimum-security prison camp... the sign that lets minimum-security prisoners know when they've escaped... and Unicor, the slave-labor office... where prisoners make furniture for the government for pennies a day.
We almost made it out. lt was the first time we had ever gotten pulled over by prison cops.
How could we not drop in on our friends at CERT... the Computer Emergency Response Team?
They tell the world when there's a threat to computer networks.
They'd back us up and tell the world... that Kevin Mitnick posed no threat at all to NORAD...
Kristy McNichol, or theAmerican way of life.
We thought computer people worked odd hours... but these guys apparently took Saturdays off.
We asked the security guard to come down and let us leave a pamphlet or two.
Something must get triggered whenever you say Mitnick's name.
We were meeting far too many cops in so brief a period of time.
But at least Pennsylvania was living up to its name.
We explained why we were there but got the message we expected.
You're not welcome.
We're used to that. ln the event that you should maybe happen to come again... if you are not welcome... and l find out that you are not welcome... you will be exactly where Kevin is... and then you'd be defeating your purpose. l'm here to do the job and my job right now is...
-to get you out of here.
-l understand that. l know a lot of people who are in prison who probably shouldn't be there.
But that's our judicial system.
You know what l mean?
Sometimes it works and sometimes it don't.
Believe me, l've seen it not work in the favor of my people many times. l'm gonna parlay the rest of this... my tedious job is to run you for wants and warrants and all that kind of stuff... if you would expedite your leaving.
We'll get out of here, we'll head for the border right away
19 radio.
The gentleman has been given a standard warning. l'll give you his name and stuf.
Before we left, we decided to check the mood of the street.
He told me not to mess with her.
She did everybody she could in the weeds... and then she moved to the projects. lt's not Kevin's fault.
Free Kevin. Kevin has nothing to do with it.
The broad quit me
'cause l was an alcoholic... and l wasn't making no money. l was broke, that's why she quit me.
The reason l don't have a girlfriend is l don't have no money.
Oh, wow.
He seems like a nice guy.
Why would you want to do anything to him?
You think his girlfriend's gonna quit him or something? lt was time to go.
We was peeling potatoes
Back in World War Two
And we was playing that rock and roll
After school for you know who
Hidden from the public lt was behind the scenes
There was a relic
They called the purple hair
With Kevin Mitnick locked away... the phone companies of the world felt safe from intruders.
But the fact remained, many people were exploring all the time... online and off.
Allied SignalAerospace...
Sprint PCS up there... lnformix,
Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems....
You're scaring me. lt's like this flat area where there's no trees or anything, just industry
Oklahoma, the state that created Hanson.
People kept telling us our sound guy looked like one of the Hanson brothers.
Since we were going through their hometown, Tulsa... we figured we'd go to one of Tulsa's bustling malls... and turn the Free Kevin campaign into a Hanson campaign.
We could use the publicity.. and if we could confuse some Tulsans in the process... all the better.
And it sure wasn't hard to do that.
Once we'd confused people at the mall, we headed over to Oral Roberts University... in the hopes that the Religious Right would climb on board.
When the vice president of the university, a former federal agent... came down the stairs with a golf club, we took the hint.
There wasn't a golf course for miles.
Hellflower, Satan's power
You grow more beautiful by the hour
You feed our hearts
And you free our minds
With the essence of the souls that you devour
Shrinking violet makes the scene ln the formal garden of the queen
Bloody Mary, so contrary
They had a hard time getting into my place. l had the bedroom door closed, so l didn't hear the pounding on the door
They were pounding on the door out there for a good 10 minutes.
They actually started calling on the cellular phone... and leaving messages on my answering machine.
''This is the FBl.
We're at your door. Open up.'' l wasn't there when they searched my home.
My mom had to get me from school.
My dad was the only one home.
They thought... that he was me.
They were looking for somebody that was an adult.
When they found out that l was like, 13... they didn't know what to do. l think when they walk in and want to take things... they should be told to go to hell... take what they want, we'll see you in court, don't even talk to me.
The problem, of course, is that hackers don't have the resources to do this.
They want to try to get off cheap... so they cooperate and they plea bargain... and they end up pleading guilty to something they didn't do.
And that sets the record bad for them going forward. l think if people had the resources, or if there were an organization... dedicated to helping people, to providing the resources....
You know, something that's much more than just a dummy front... such as the EFF.
An organization that's actually truly willing to help in those matters... that we'd see a lot more progress along those lines.
The government, for once... would have to start conforming to the same laws... that they're supposedly enforcing.
We were detained for two hours in the parking lot.
There were 13 police officers and l think five or six police cars. l told them what was going on... but they seemed to think there was more going on than there was.
Without my consent they took my box of crystals... even though they admitted they didn't know what they were.
They took anything and everything that had magnetic media on it... or had an electrical plug on it.
They took other unrelated items such as a woman's purse. l'm not quite sure howthat fits into the scope of their investigation.
Every business card l had.
They took everything just to make life difficult on me.
They told me they're not trying to chastise me... and then one of them said... he used to play with baseball cards when he was a kid.
They would be searching my wardrobe. l'd be standing there with the guy he's asking questions... and he's going through every pocket in my wardrobe.
Then it suddenly dawned on me... l don't have to stand there.
So l walked out of the room.
He stopped searching the wardrobe and walked out with me. lt was very obvious.
Their tactics weren't meant to actually accomplish something.
Searching every pocket of every shirt in my closet... that tactic wasn't meant to do anything except intimidate me.
They showed up at my friend's house... where a 3-year-old and a 5-year-old had just been put to bed.
They came storming into the house with guns drawn... ran up the steps... and said,
''Freeze! Secret Service! Don't move!'' l was sitting at the keyboard of a computer, so l looked extremely dangerous. l was thrown to the floor, handcuffed, and hogtied, and all that... and dragged out. l told my.. friend Ellen Fisher, who was there, to call my lawyer, which she did.
They kept telling me to shut up. l was taken back to the police station in Havertown, Pennsylvania... and locked in a cell for about three hours while my car was searched.
Then a Secret Service agent interviewed me... or interrogated me, wanted to know what l was doing with the crystals.
And l said l was making them available to people.
He tried to get me to say l was committing fraud with them which l was not.
He gotvery irate that l wasn't telling him what he wanted to hear.
Eventually they locked me back in the cell again.
They refused to let me call my lawyer. ln fact, my rights weren't read to me.
There were many instances in which l told them... l wanted to consult with my attorney... and they said, ''That's not a good idea.''
They wouldn't let me get an attorney
So finally, when... they all shifted from my apartment to searching my office, actually at work... l got to drive down in my own car. l called an attorney... and by the time they were at my work, so was an attorney.
The agent in charge, Ken McGuire, in particular... gave me a very nasty and disappointed look... at the fact that l was willing to protect my rights. lt's really amazing.
He really gave me one of these:
''You shouldn't have done that'' looks.
''Now you're really in for it.''
NASA people told my parents l was cocky... because l told them to choose harder passwords. l had cops tell me pretty well straight out:
''We really didn't want to harm Junior..
''so we took his computer and gave it to the boys...
''over in traffic management, and it was just really groovy.''
Wait a minute. You're like,
''You took this kid's equipment?''
They were like,
''lt was his dad's, but he was using it.
''Dad should have known better.''
So this is $4,000 worth of equipment full of heaven only knows what content... and you just pocketed it, basically?
Now you're going to charge him?
They said, ''lf we charge him...
''we've got to bring him up under 14 different interstate laws...
''he's gonna be a felon and be ruined.''
''We explained this to them and they said,
'Take the machine, please.'''
But that's not legal.
That's nothing like legality lt's blackmail, basically. lt's like with anyone else.
Simply because you have a badge... doesn't give you the right to be an asshole.
Unless you'd like me to be an asshole back to you. l don't care who you are.
You will obtain the respect from me that you earn. Period. l may have hacked NASA, but who doesn't?
They say they clocked us at just under 100 miles per hour... on the lnterstate in New Mexico.
And the cop wouldn't let us go until l gave him my Social Security number.
To make matters worse, he told us we were still 11 hours away from Vegas.
Things seemed pretty bleak.
But, then, a miracle happened.
All right!
He said 11 hours and we made it in two and a half.
These highway patrol people don't know what they're talking about.
All right, Las Vegas, let's do it!
Twilight City gonna set my soul lt's gonna set my soul on fire
Got a whole lot of money that's ready to burn
So get those stakes up high
There's a thousand pretty women waiting out there
They're all waiting, they're devil-may-care
And l'm just the devil with love to spare, so
Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
How l wish that there were more
Than the 24 hours in the day
Even if l ran out of speed, boy
We're looking for the Defcon conference.
We're supposed to be filming here.
Defcon conference? lt's like computer hackers....
Not that l know of.
Were they gonna start inside the computer and work their way out? lt's about a thousand computer hackers coming here. l've never heard of it.
They must've done a good job keeping this quiet.
They even got me going.
Plaza Hotel, Las Vegas?
New Mexico. lt was a mistake anybody could have made... except nobody else seems to have made it.
At least if we were in New Mexico... we could stop by LosAlamos National Labs, home of well-guarded nuclear secrets... and one of the many places
Shimomura had mysterious connections to. lf we could get the word to the people here, we just might turn some heads. ln those few places where we actually did get in... we always seemed to stay a bit too long looking at the things... we weren't supposed to be looking at.
This guy was mean, and told us to get the hell out.
As we left, we noticed more of these weird guys in fatigues... all around the building.
That's when we got lost on a dark road with no name in New Mexico... with a bunch of military zealots surrounding us.
We got the message.
Twilight City gonna set my soul lt's gonna set my soul on fire
Got a whole lotta money that's ready to burn
So get those stakes up high
There's a thousand pretty women waiting out there
They're all waiting, they're devil-may-care
And l'm just the devil with love to spare, so
Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
How l wish that there were more
Than the 24 hours in the day
Even if l ran out of speed, boy
When l started, l never intended it to last this long. l thought it was going to be a party and that's it.A one-time deal.
When we left, everybody said,
''Are you going to do it again?''
And l said, ''l guess l could do this again.''
Since then, more people get involved, more people say:
''We could probably have some music.''
Next thing you know, we've got a live laser light system... with LCD wall projectors and DJs coming in from the United Kingdom to spin. lt has taken on this life of its own.
We are the Ghetto Hackers.
Low-class, low-budget, high-octane.
-Dead!
-Cow!
When l say rock, you say ass!
-Rock!
-Ass!
Thank you very much. Good night. l have in my hand proof positive... that NTis not the solution to your computing problems. l have captured earlier today on film... the blue screen of death... at Las Vegas' own
MGM Grand Hotel and Casino!
Thousands showed up.
Even though the Free Kevin stickers turned into toys... at least everybody here knew his name.
You have to go to www.kevinmitnick.com.
Look it up for yourself.
''And it doesn't matter what he says about us.''
''What matters is us.
''What matters is....''
We were hot on the trail.
We were hot on the trail. l don't want to get into Shimomura. l think he has a very large ego.
He's a very bright person and very smart... but l think his social skills are lacking.
For years, Shimomura had been eluding me. l couldn't even get on the same TV shows.
He'd pop up over on CNN... while l was stuck over on a broadcast network.
While he was getting all cozy with Tom Brokaw... l was being interrogated by Mike Wallace.
2600: The Hacker Quarterly?
Tsutomu wasn't even answering my e-mail.
But nowthere would be no escape.
The San Diego Supercomputer Center, the place where he worked.
We were closing in.
You notice how quiet it is?
Like when a deer is about to be killed by a lion?
-You're here to see him?
-Yes.
-You're looking for Tsutomu?
-Yes.
-l haven't seen him in three months.
-Really?
Do you know where he is?
He's not here.
Let me check with....
Did you make arrangements to meet him here?
They weren'tvery firm but he knew we were coming.
-You can try his office.
-Did you have an appointment with him?
-lt was very informal.
-l'm sorry.
You can try the extension, but l haven't seen him.
Do l know him?
Just from interacting on....
But l'm not.... l can't....
Definitely should have called first, l guess. lt's just he likes surprises so much.
This sheet of paper that we wanted him to have.
He'll know what it's about. He wanted a couple of these stickers as well.
He wanted these? l just wanted to make sure he got them.
Great. Thanks so much for your help. lt wasn't much better than the reception we got at Miramax.
But we left our calling card in a place where we knew he'd see it. l think it's absurd when l find out that Shimomura, in addition... is giving instructions to Skeet Ulrich... on howto act more like Kevin.
Here's someone instructing him howto act more like Kevin... and it's a person that met Kevin only once... in court, under circumstances of duress.
From there how he can ascertain how Kevin acts, l don't know.
When l step on this curb we're officially on his property.
Sorry to bother you.
We're looking for somebody next door.
We're not sure if we have the right neighborhood.
-Tsutomu Shimomura.
-He moved. He's long gone.
How long ago did he move?
-Seven, eight months?
-Really?
Do you have any idea where he went?
No, he was renting, and the people who own it moved back in.
He's in the national news.
Are you aware of that?
-He's what?
-There's a movie that they're making.
-You can see, l'm on the phone.
-l'm sorry.
-They're making a movie about him.
-They're making a movie?
-lt's all about--
-l read his book.
They're making a big
Hollywood blockbuster about it.
They may film around here because this is one of the places he lived.
-So l could be a star?
-You could be a star. l've been waiting to be discovered for a long time.
He could be anywhere.
Man, that's scary.
We had one last address to try inside a gated community.
But this was getting frustrating.
We have another lead here.
We're certainly seeing a lot of the nicer places of this neighborhood.
''Out of order, please use other door.''
You know, if that was a computer, we'd be facing 50 years in jail.
They think we're the Publisher's Clearinghouse. lt was like he was a step ahead of us.
Japanese? Long hair?
For some reason, people think it's a good idea... to have a full directory of every tenant in an apartment complex... available to anyone in the world.
But it gave us the definitive proof we needed:
Shimomura wasn't here either. lt's a pretty cool system, though.
Let's try a couple of other things.
We're going to enter the room number this time.
Now it's dialing.
That's their whole phone number being broadcast!
See if we get an answering machine.
You've reached Amy. l'm sorry l'm unavailable to take your call.
Please leave a message. l'll get back to you as soon....
We've gotten everything we can out of this place... and made ourselves look suspicious at the same time so we'd better get out of here.
On the way out of San Diego, our rental car broke.
On the way out of San Diego, our rental car broke.
The trunk wouldn't close.
We should get this tape of the trunk, too.
Holy fuck! Oh, my God! Shit!
We're right underneath the flight path!
We had to clean everything out so we could exchange it... including the disgusting piece of gum that somehow got stuck to the door.
You know what, l'll use their own key to scrape it off.
Okay, l'm down.
This is the most disgusting thing l've ever had to do in my life.
You know it's still soft. Oh, God!
Want some gum?
This is a scary neighborhood.
We made it to LosAngeles in a brand-new rental car.
Our first stop, the University of Southern California... where Kevin had been accused of storing software from cellular phone companies.
USC claimed that somehow caused over $1,000 in damage. l wanted to know what computer system gets damaged... by having files stored on it! l'm Brian Johnson. l'm theAssociate Director of Customer Support.
Yeah, we're not allowed to comment on any of the security.
At least we finally managed to find someone... who'd say they weren't allowed to say anything.
That was progress, right?
The Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles...
The Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles... where Kevin had been held for three-and-a-half years. lt was his 35th birthday and we wanted to say hi.
The closest we could come was the Mobil station across the street. lt was a popular place for all the people who couldn'tvisit their friends. l know he's looking at me, so l can wave hi.
And he gives me a call and he says, ''lt's cool, you went to see me.''
-He's comfortable with that.
-How often do you come by?
Like, almost once a week.
When l drop off my sister that goes to see him.
-How come you can't go in there and visit?
-lt's too strict. l wouldn't know why the reason they don't let us go in.
-You're his brother?
-He's my brother-in-law.
Married to my sister.
-So it's only immediate family?
-Yeah, immediate family. So l can't see him.
He talks to me through the phone and letters.
-l just come and say hi.
-What's he in for? l don't know what the reason why he's in, but he's just in.
And you bring your friends with you?
Are they part of the family, too?
Yeah, they know my brother-in-law
We grew up together so....
Have you heard of Kevin Mitnick, the person we're here for?
-l never heard of him.
-He's a computer hacker.
-You know what computer hackers are?
-Yeah.
He's been in there for three-and-a-half years...
-and he hasn't had a trial yet.
-He should get a trial, you know?
He's working on it, he's trying, but the wheels of justice move very slowly.
That's something true.
They're not the ones that--
Sure.
There's so many people, l think. lt's overcrowded. l wouldn't even know what to tell you, l've never been in that system.
He must've went in somebody's government--
He must've pissed somebody off.
Pissed somebody off in the government pretty good.
They probably laughed and said,
''You have to stay there a while.''
That's not fair but that's the way it is.
When the windows are only a couple of inches wide... it's hard to find the person you're looking for... even if you know exactly what time to look.
And then we heard it.
Yeah, what was that? l heard a pounding on the window
He's shining a light or something. l can see him now.
Was that you?That was you.
You were pounding on the glass, right?
We heard that across the street.
We were looking at the wrong window.
Then we heard this pounding noise.
Come back to the window and wave some more.
Can you do that?
We'll put a sticker up, we just don't want the sticker to come back to haunt you.
He wants us to put a sticker.
-He wants a sticker?
-A sticker would be cool.
We can see your hand. l doubt you can stick your whole head through the window
Splotch your face up against the window
Nowthat we know it's the right one, we can zoom in on it.
All right, cool.
We'll see you in two minutes?
Okay, great. See you then. Bye.
He's going to be up there in two minutes.
That was definitely him. l wish we could go in there and see him without having to do this.
But, hell, l'll take it.
We found out that our filming the prison had caused such a stir.. that every single prisoner was locked down... confined to their cell for the rest of the day
And Kevin told us it was the best time he had had in years.
Like this.
That's cool.
Even the manager of the station said it was all right.
This guy in the blue car just gave me $6 for the defense fund.
No kidding.Thanks!That's great.
That's amazing.
Look where l put the sticker. l got permission from the owner. lt'll be gone tomorrow.
-That's great.
-lt'll be there for a while.
-He let you do that?
-Yeah, l asked him.
Randolph's gonna get gas and he's gonna fucking shit a brick.
He was never served... with a warrant for his arrest... for the supervised release violations during the period of his supervised release.
So by the time that he was done and went on his way... there's no indication that he was aware that such a warrant existed.
Damn! You know, Sprint really sucks.
We wanted the entire city of Los Angeles to know about Kevin.
And what better way than to put the message... on the most famous billboard in town? lt took us hours to climb that thing.
We honestly didn't knowthere was a road that went straight up the back.
But we made it.
Funny thing, though.
We couldn't find anybody who saw our Free Kevin banner.
Later, we went to the most famous movie theater in town... to try and spread the word from up close.
Here, Free Kevin! Free Kevin Mitnick. lt won't bite you. Speak English?
We're trying to get the message across to Miramax... that it's wrong to release a movie that's supposed to be factual... that's based on real events....
People will see this movie and think this is a true story... when so much of it has been completely fabricated.
-l've heard about this guy.
-Really?
Here, help stop a movie about a computer hacker?
-You got a problem?
-l got a problem.
Come back and tell me about it.
Pussy! lt's hard to believe someone in this country... could be in jail for three-and-a-half years, held in a maximum-security facility... no bail, no trial. l don't find thatvery hard to believe.
-l read a book, Takedown.
-Takedown, that's right. l read like half of it.
He gets out of jail, he'll probably take over everything.
That's the problem.
People think that, but it's not true.
You don't think he could hack anything if he just gets online?
He can't hack anything just by getting online. l mean, you gotta have a program and whatever....
Why are you recording this?
Hey, read about Kevin Mitnick?
They're making a movie about this guy.
He's the best guy ever! l know him since l was, like day one.
Yeah, me too, yo!
He's never done anything wrong, he's never hurt anyone... and he's being treated like that in this country.
That is theAmerican way. Wake up.
Kevin was denied bail. Even a bail hearing. lf you recall, even Ted Kaczynski got a bail hearing.
His bail was turned down.
You're entitled to a bail hearing.
On the other hand, Kevin... is getting treatment that is outside the law
And that's what makes itvery difficult for him to mount a legal defense.
He's not being treated in a legal manner l've never heard of anything even approaching this level of...
...confinement prior to a trial.
Murderers get bail.
Armed robbers get bail.
The fear of what he's going to do... from a push-button telephone in the general population of a cell... shows again a lack of technical understanding on the part of the prison... and judicial system.And l think that's sad.
And he is right nowthe victim of that.
On our way up the coast, we dropped in on Sun.
On our way up the coast, we dropped in on Sun.
According to a letter we got our hands on... they said Kevin's acquisition of their source code... represented hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.
Nowthey give the source code away for free.
Something wasn't right.
So we're right here.
On the other side of the freeway there's the other Sun.
And then further up is their big campus.
Basically, all of this blank area... is actually Sun buildings and Sun streets.
We knew where we were, now we just needed someone to talk to.
What number do we call and who do we speak to?
1-800-USA4SUN.
They can direct you to whoever you need.
USA4SUN?
Can you remember or do you want me to write it down?
The receptionist wouldn't let us talk to anyone unless we called.
But we slipped a few leaflets onto their coffee table. l thought she was being kind of patronizing.
''Do you want me to write that down or can you remember it?'' l can remember it.
USA4SUN, right?
-Was that it? Or was it SUN4USA? Fuck!
-Yeah.
You sure?
Should l run in and ask her again?
''Thank you for calling Sun.'' l have a rotary phone. l'm not going to press any buttons. l'm pressing zero. l'm probably going to get her,too.
My call ''may be monitored.''
Another machine.
They want my eight-digit lD number!
This is bullshit, man.
They've got me waiting for a customer service representative. lt's not exactly what l had in mind.
But let's see what happens.
My call is ''very important to them.''
He hung up!
He hung up on me!
Maybe he didn't hang up on me but he hung up all the same.
Fuck!All right. l think on their web page there's a direct public relations number
But we're not on their web page, we're in their parking lot.
Wait a minute.
You don't have your Ricochet modem?
-Not today.
-You're not prepared!
Shit. We can't access the web from here... we're outside Sun and we can't get on the net... to find out what their phone number is! l'm gonna try this number one more time. l'm gonna be a little patient here.
Assume maybe they made a little mistake.
Okay, now l am waiting for the corporate switchboard.
Hi, Pete, my name is Emmanuel. l'm trying to reach somebody in Public Relations. l'm hoping somebody can contact me concerning the Kevin Mitnick case... and how it involved Sun.
We're doing a documentary.
We came to the corporate headquarters hoping to get an appointment... and they gave us a phone number and we're trying to do just that... so if you could get back to me....
They have a fortress here.
They have that mighty guard there at the front that won't let anybody by
And then the voice mail guard here... that won't let anybody actually call and speak to a person.
Maybe they'll call back, maybe they won't.
This is the red hotline. lf that rings, we'll know
We have GPS, good.
GPS but no modem. Man, that sucks. l was using it last night and it was gone in the morning which means....
Sorry, no cameras in front of the building.
How about if we film in that direction?
We can't have the cameras filming.
Okay, 'cause we were just filming us.
No, l can understand that, but unfortunately...
Wow, this was a new one.
We couldn't even film ourselves in Sun's parking lot.
Corporate paranoia was at an all-time high.
And, needless to say,
Pete never called us back.
Meanwhile, John Markoff had agreed to talk to us.
Meanwhile, John Markoff had agreed to talk to us.
Maybe now we'd finally get some answers.
We made it to San Francisco on the exact same day... that psychologists from around the world gathered for a convention.
Maybe because so many people in that area were depressed.
They have counseling phones on the bridges... because so many people are jumping off them.
But San Francisco was a friendly town... where people felt safe leaving their trash unattended.
But more importantly... the psychologists wound up taking almost every hotel room in the entire city... even the old-fashioned ones.
We were beginning to get desperate.
Then we found a hotel that was almost completely deserted.
We never did find out why.
Markoff mentions certain stories.
He'll say, ''lt's been said that....'' or ''Other people have said that....''
And he'll come up with these stories like he shut down judges'TRW ratings... shut off power.... lt's bullshit. l don't think John Markoff did it because he wanted to destroy Kevin.
But l think he did it to keep Kevin's evil image.
Maybe he believed some of the things himself.
Okay, isn't a newspaperman... supposed to investigate something before they publish it... before they put it in the newspaper as fact? l know Spencer Tracy and Clark Gable always did.
We didn't know what we were walking into.
Would Markoff tell us things about Mitnick... that would shock and horrify us?
Or would he realize... how much his front-page stories and books had demonized Kevin... helping to put him in the lousy place he was still in?
This was our one chance to make a difference.
And, more than anything, we wanted to be fair.
So we came up with the Markoff Meter.
We set a bar on his left and right side... and resolved not to judge him badly until he said six bad or inaccurate things.
And if he said six good things... well, then, the hacker world would just have to deal with it.
Maybe this wouldn't be so bad.
Nowthere's an easy point for common courtesy. l wanted to get to the heart of the matter
Like howthey knew it was Kevin they were chasing in the first place?
When l called the Qualcomm guys, they had been talking to the FBl.
And the FBl believed that it was Kevin who had social engineered them.
Why? l don't know enough about what was going on... inside the FBl investigation.
That's a good question. l don't know why
But the FBl told the Qualcomm people that it was Kevin.
And, to my mind, as a reporter, it fit Kevin's M.O.
-Which is what?
-Social engineering.
Really good social engineering.
But there are thousands of hackers out there--
That's true. l'm not saying it's proof. l'm simply saying the FBl believed it was Kevin.
Did they hear a voice or did they have a voice recording?
Did they have a voice recording?
That's a good question. What did they have?
This we couldn't forgive.
Before you print front-page stories about people eluding the authorities... shouldn't you have some real conclusive evidence?
What did Kevin do that was diferent?
He had a reputation as being a very good social engineer. l've heard some tapes, l've heard some people assert this. lf he in fact was the person who was at Qualcomm... then he was a good social engineer.
Nowthat's better. No need to be stingy with the compliments, after all.
One thing that's been following
Kevin Mitnick... since the first story Markoff wrote about him is this myth about breaking into NORAD.
When you say something like that enough times, people start to believe it.
And in Kevin's case, it really made him into a villain.
So where did the NORAD stuff come from?
The NORAD stuff... is stuff that l got from someone... who was in legal trouble with Kevin early on.
So l have not been able to interview Kevin face to face. l've heard he said that it's inaccurate but l haven't been able to ask him.
The story did come from a friend of his. l knowthere are lots of stories and you gotta sort through them.
But what stories have stuck? l remember the Kristy McNichol thing.
That didn't stick. NORAD didn't stick.
Security Pacific l think is probably one that stuck, that probably should stick.
-You know about that?
-The bank that he got a job at--
That's right.
And then there was a press release... that suggested that the bank was in financial trouble... though they managed to keep it of the wire, it almost went on.
But what links that to Kevin?
The police investigators that we interviewed believed it was Kevin.
Based on what?
Based on what....
Just coincidence of things.
Who else would do something like that?
You've got to be kidding!
You used ''who else'' to pin a crime on the guy... on the front page of the NewYork Times... without even using the word ''allegedly'' anywhere?
This was reported as fact but it was never backed up.
Just like NORAD, just like Kristy McNichol... just like everything that made them want to catch Kevin so badly.
Let's look at the issue of solitary confinement. lt wasn't mentioned in the front-page article... that Kevin was in solitary for 8 months and was desperate not to go back... and that this above all was what made him run. l mean, he didn't want to go back to jail.
Not just jail, solitary confinement.
Eight months.
Was he in solitary before?
This was his first time.
He spent 8 months in solitary in 1989? l didn't realize.
Wait. He didn't spend 8 months in prison.
He was only in prison for six months in '89.
You've written two books on the guy as well as countless articles.
You're somewhat of an expert on Kevin Mitnick... and you didn't know he was in solitary confinement?
Or even how long his sentence was?
For the record, Mitnick spent a year in prison in 1988... eight months of which was in solitary confinement... plus another six months in a halfway house.
With the psychologists in town we could confirm... locking Kevin in solitary was a fucked-up thing to do. l think it's inhumane, and l think there are better ways to handle our problems.
Obviously if this person has been able to do some of the things... that they think he was doing with a computer, he's very bright.
That's a real talent that's being wasted.
And, to lock him up, especially in solitary confinement for 8 months....
We wouldn't treat an animal that way
And yet, this is a talented individual?
Excuse me.
-lt's not right.Thank you.
-Thanks very much.
Wait, he was in solitary the entire time he was at Lompoc?
A large amount of the time. Eight months.
Yeah, that's pretty hard.
Okay. Markoff gains a point for that show of humanity.
Now, here's something interesting.
When Kevin was on the run... he communicated with an lsraeli hacker known as jsz... who's believed to be the mastermind behind the hacking that Kevin was blamed for.
Yet Markoff never wrote a story about him... and didn't even followthrough when jsz moved to New York. ln fact, none of the authorities seemed to care either... almost as if these crimes were really trivial.
Nowthat would be a great story, wouldn't it, John? l thought a lot about that. l just haven't had time to do the reporting. l've got a day-to-day beat out here.
You're right. lt's probably a great story l would love to talk to jsz.
-l should come to New York--
-That story was going on back then.
Jsz was supposedly the mastermind behind everything. l never knew what the relations were.
The only thing l could say that l knew.. was that jsz and Kevin... were actively trading information and software.
That's what l knew. l knew nothing about masterminding. lf you asked me to reconstruct just from what l knew.. it was jsz provided the tools and Kevin made the attack.
But l have no idea if that's true.
No idea? lsn't this what the book, series of articles, and nowthe film are supposedly based on... what Kevin actually did? l was amazed by what he didn't know
But there was more that he did know and had never talked about before.
But one interesting thing that hasn't been made public.
You know, so much was made of the fact that the credit cards were never used.
They were used.
An American Express card, part of the Netcom collection... was used in Raleigh within two days after Kevin was arrested.
So who used it?
-How did you find this out?
-l've just known it for a long time.
You're saying the credit card was used in Raleigh... and it was used after he was arrested?
There are indications that there was someone Kevin was in contact with... who knewthis and may have been active in the Raleigh area.
All l'm saying is there's some evidence.
How come this wasn't in the book?
How come it wasn't in the book.
Good question. l don't know why we didn't put it in the book.
This was really getting annoying.
He didn't follow up on the most interesting part of the story.. and he didn't mention the fact about the credit cards until now?
One more remark like that and it's all over for Markoff.
Look how many people are standing here and not one person took my brochure.
Look at all these people.
Not one of them took this.
Valuable coupons!
What are they doing now?
Oh, Kevin Mitnick!
He's the computer wizard.
The way that the Japanese wizard found him was very interesting.
Mitnick respected the Japanese wizard for tracking him.
On the other hand... since the whole computer business is stupid and ridiculous to begin with... why should Mitnick suffer for a ridiculous assault on the culture... namely the computer. So that's it.
-What do you think of computers?
-l hate them.
Why?
Because they're not like feeling skin, and they're not like walking in the forest.
And one can get lost deeply in them.
My son, of course, is in that world.
These people are computerphiles and he's a computerphobe.
Hackers are all right because they're anarchists, that's fine.
But the rest of it....
-This is bullshit.
-lt's pornography!
This is such bullshit! l like Chaos Computer Club, l like anarchy.
-You know Chaos Computer Club? -No, but l like the whole idea.
He's never heard of it.
He's saying this because--
No, it's great. But Mitnick, it's ridiculous.
Look, an activist.
Look, a bag of artificial intelligence.
They're from the '80s but l still bought them.
Just to get back to my roots. lt's like the government's making him look like.... lt's to create a hacker mythology so they can deprive other people of privacy... and other stuff like that.
He hasn't done anything wrong. He hasn't done any financial damage to anybody
He's basically just like a scapegoat. l think most of the kids that l hang out with are cool, geeky, hacker types.
They understand.
Then there's my mom and everybody else.
Why would they have any reason to believe anything... other than he's a total scumbag who....
You know, like WarGames, the hacking.
That guy! Didn't he break into massive computer systems?
He's not accused of selling information, of destroying computers... he's just accused of copying files.
Three-and-a-half years in prison for that.
How does that sound?
Yeah, cool, wow, all right, great. Register to vote?
You're an activist, too? lmagine if somebody made a film about you... and they get this totally evil kind of guy to play you... and take everything that you ever did and make you look like you're really terrible?
Look, there he is cheating on a crossword puzzle, too!That guy!
Many interesting items relating to Telegraph Street.
Street scene, one of the best places for street scene material!
Here on the street scene... we've got newspapers, we got novels... we got documentary calendars, nine calendars for nine years, man.
What sysadmin is gonna have dot slash in their path before usr/local/bin? lt was cool. lt's about using SUlD and making a script called ls... and keeping it in your home directory and creating a file with escape characters... pretending to be a lamer,
''l need help deleting this.''
And then they go and do an ls....
But what sysadmin is gonna have dot slash in their path before usr/local/bin? l don't know man, some of those hackers... when l'm on my computer send me all this shit all at once.
-Like what?
-l don't know.
All these messages. Makes my computer--
-Are you onAOL by any chance?
-No. Prodigy.
We've been bending over backwards to help this guy.. and he's only one point away from disqualification.
Let's do an easy one, the film.
Everyone hates the film, right?
When l read the screenplay... l was mostly just disappointed because it seemed like a crummy screenplay.
There we go. He's back in the running.
With one clip to go, the best Markoff could hope for was a tie.
So l gave him a chance to show some humanity. l asked him to help us help Kevin and sign a petition... to get him released from prison and end the nightmare.
He didn't want to sign the petition but he had a better idea. lf you could pass a message to Kevin... and say if he'd be willing to sit down and talk to me before his trial... l would love to do a piece.
And l think that's perfectly fair. lf nothing else, you gotta give the guy credit for trying.
More than a decade of writing about Kevin and he still had yet to talk to him. lt was time for our last corporate visit. lt was time for our last corporate visit.
Novell, who claimed Kevin cost them more than $75 million.
We went to their corporate headquarters in Provo, Utah.
Okay, nowthe road says ''180 East.''
All right, we want 122 East, 1700 South. lt's like some locker combination.
Okay, here we are. ls there somebody in charge of security maybe?
The person in charge of security is....
He's just brand-new
Check that out.This guy is so worried about us seeing his nametag... that he went through this acrobatic act to turn it over nice and casual-like.
But in the end, it was just like everywhere else.
Nobody was allowed to say anything.
But, at least, we tried.
Hey, pal, look down. Whoops!
So the last corporate door had been closed on us.
And now we had one last task...
And now we had one last task... to head across the country and stop the film.
We knew it wouldn't work.
We always knew it wouldn't work.
That's what hacking's been about from the beginning.
Doing things that you knew wouldn't work, just because you had to.
And trying to ignore the shit happening to your friends... and trying not to feel bad when you couldn't change a thing.
As we drove from state to state... l thought of how bad it could get, how bad it had already gotten. l remembered what they do to people who piss them off. l remembered what they did to Bernie.
The Bernie S. case, as far as l'm concerned... got blown out of proportion by a lot of things. lt got blown out of proportion by the prosecution... who knew what exactly he had done and their representation of it... was almost to make him look like the guy who blew up the Murrah Federal Building.
To do that was an incredible leap.
But they managed to pass that of.
They made Bernie S. look like an absolute terrorist.
The new statute that my attorney had never heard of and neither had l... that, in fact, wasn't even in the law books yet... makes it a federal felony to possess... hardware or software... for the modification of telecommunications instruments... for the unauthorized access to telecommunications services. l wasn't accused or alleged to have done anything with software... or ever cloned a cellular phone or anything of that nature.
Just the mere possession of these things... now constituted a federal felony according to this new statute.
The judge ordered me held without bail... based on the fact that books... in fact, l think l had two books in my home... on howfireworks, explosives are made.
That stuff has fascinated me. l had about 2,000 books in my personal library.
What little media attention the case got made Bernie look like a dangerous maniac.
He had never stolen anything, not even a phone call.
Everything used to make him look like a terrorist, he had legitimately obtained.
When the Secret Service wants you in prison, nobody asks them why
Not even a judge.
''Your Honor, when we initially searched
Mr. Cummings' house...
''federal agents discovered a substance...
''they believed to be C4 plastic explosives.
''While upon later analysis...
''it turned out not to be C4...
''the fact that it might have been concerned us greatly.
''And, based on that, we'd recommend for a stronger sentence.''
The judge didn't even blink at that sort of a thing.
Then the prosecutor made a startling revelation to Bernie's lawyer.
She told him she was under a lot of pressure... to prosecute this case by the Secret Service... and that, in fact, the real reason, and that's a quote:
''the real reason'' Ed is in jail... was not because of crystals or software or anything like that. lt was because of other things that they found in my house.
Namely: surveillance photographs of undercover Secret Service agents.
So l made these photos available at the 2600 meeting... and it apparently was a coincidence because l didn't call them... but the local Fox television affiliate...
Fox 29 in Philadelphia, their news division, showed up at the meeting.
Most are between their mid-teens to late 20s.
They gather every Friday night at 30th Street Station for all to see. lt's called the 2600 meeting, named after a telephone frequency... and meetings like these are advertised... in a hi-tech magazine you can buy at a bookstore.
Some hackers call themselves ''fighters for the freedom of information.''
The US Secret Service monitors some hackers.
But hackers say it should be the other way around. ln this photograph the Secret Service agent is picking his nose.
The Secret Service didn't find it humorous.
Not only did they have some of their agents' covers blown... but they were picking their noses on a major market television news station.
We all thought that was amusing... until l was in federal prison... and l found out that the real reason l was locked up was because of that.
For a year-and-a-half...
Bernie was bounced around maximum security prisons throughout Pennsylvania. l think they got tired of me filing these appeals... because l found myself in handcufs and shackles and taken up to...
Lehigh County Prison which had a reputation... amongst prisoners l had talked to over the past year... as probably one of the roughest prisons in Pennsylvania.
Within a day, Bernie was attacked.
He punched me in the mouth and l went down.
He was a big guy, probably weighed like 220 pounds... and l think it turned out later he was on drugs... coming down off crack or something. l went down and he started to kick me in the head... and l put my arm up to block his kick and it broke my arm also.
After bleeding for hours,
Bernie was finally taken to the hospital... but the authorities refused to let him contact his relatives.
The hospital wanted me to sign this waiver.
Whenever you go into surgery you have to sign this thing saying... that you understand all the risks involved. l refused to sign the paper. l said, not until l get a hold of my uncle... or at least let somebody in my family know what's going on.
The prison officials went bananas that l wouldn't sign this waiver. lt was a liability for them that l wasn't getting medical treatment. l was severely injured and they needed to operate on me right away. lt got all the way up to the warden at this place.
My uncle was a known person in the community.
He'd been the president of the city council.
They knew who he was.
He wasn't someone who'd run down there and try to spring me out of the hospital.
Meanwhile, l was handcuffed and shackled... to the hospital bed, which was ridiculous. l didn't feel like going anywhere. l was in bad shape.
With a guard sitting there with a gun... making sure that l didn't break the handcuffs and run away. l was denied antibiotics for two days. l was denied any painkillers at all... not even aspirin which l couldn't take because my teeth were wired shut... and l was probably in the most excruciating pain... that l've ever had, which was more than l could ever imagine... having multiple fractures. lt was like being in an altered state of consciousness, this much pain.
They weren't bringing me food l could eat.
They brought solid food which l couldn't eat because my jaw was wired shut! l was getting to the point where.... l was starting to feel like,
''l don't care anymore.'' l was really feeling like, ''l give up.'' l was losing my will to go ahead. l was able to get a phone call out the next day... tell people where l was, what was going on.
And that was when a major telephone campaign... and lnternet crusade started... gaining momentum.
We had state representatives getting called. l mean, like major politicians got calls... and they called saying, ''What's with this?
What's this generating all the publicity for?''
Finally, the prison and the judge realized they didn't need this publicity
They wanted to get this thing over with and wash their hands of it. So the judge... signed an order to have me released on a medical furlough... which the guards had never even heard of before.
They said, ''What is that? People die here.
We don't even let them out!''
So this was an unusual thing. l'm convinced... that all the publicity generated by 2600 Magazine... the lnternet, their website... radio interviews, l even forgot to mention that. l'd been repeatedly interviewed on WBAl's Off The Hook show... with Emmanuel Goldstein... and people were following this case from the beginning... and it was generating a lot of attention that way as well. l got letters, l got hundreds of letters.
We had gotten him out but it sure didn't feel like a victory
And the scars were permanent.
They had to put a....
The surgeons mounted... a titanium bar in my arm. l don't know if you can see it or not.
A nice scar from here to here where they put this titanium bar in... and seven stainless-steel screws.
This is how much my arm opens now.
That's it. That's my full range of motion in my left arm.
Unlike my good arm which straightens out.
Anyway, that's what l got.
My jaw doesn't open as much as it used to. lf l'm trying to bite an apple, l can't get it in like l used to.
But l live with it.
We crossed the entire country and were finally closing in on the Takedown set.
We crossed the entire country and were finally closing in on the Takedown set.
But there was a problem. lt seems that the hurricane... is making a beeline for the set at this point in time. ln fact, it's estimated that it will reach and destroy the set by sometime tomorrow.
And, that's something that causes me concern... because it's not like that's something we wanted to have happen. l fear that one of the listeners or one of the subscribers or somebody... may have called upon almightyAllah... or Christ or whatever... to rain forth upon these people with all kinds of venom. l'd like to stress at this point that that's not what we meant to do.
That's not exactly how l want things to turn out. l fear that the Takedown people aren't taking this seriously. lf you look at the map, if you look at the news reports... you will see the eye of the hurricane, you will see the direction it's heading for... you will see a little dot that indicates
Takedown being produced there.
That is where it's heading.
This is like the scene in Twister... where the rival gangs of twister watchers are trying to warn each other:
''This is the big one!''
Well, this is the big one.
They were looking at this thing... and they saw another hurricane contained within this hurricane.
And they say they've never seen that before.
And, if that's not enough for you,
Hurricane Bonnie.
Bonnie is the name of Kevin Mitnick's ex-wife.
Nowthe metaphor just could not be more perfect for me.
Of course, we didn't take our own advice and drove straight into the storm.
We thought we might be able to get a lot closer to the set if nobody was around.
We were right.
They seemed to have a real fixation on gun safety in this place.
You had to wonder what had happened.
We took a little tour of the restricted area past the unguarded guardhouse.
The storm passed.
And while we were exploring the next day... we made a discovery.
And they all want Free Kevin stickers.
The whole crew. lf you give me some, l will send it to them.
They will put them on their cars.
Was it really this easy?
Had we discovered where the Takedown people were... through our own bumper sticker?
-l have Mr. Wong in Number 9.
-Russell Wong.
Yeah. He's in Number 9.
-ls he still here?
-l think he is.
The receptionist went out of her way to tell us where everyone was staying.
And while the guy playing
Shimomura wasn't in... we found the producer who promised us an interviewthat coming Sunday.
The place was swarming with celebrities... like cast members from Dawson's Creek engaging in decadent behavior.
We wandered around town, taking in the carnage from Bonnie... seeing the desperate people.
We witnessed civilization brought to a standstill.
Roads were closed... power was out... trees were knocked down.
But it didn't matter.
We were going to finally talk to the Takedown people!
There was nothing to do, the computer store was closed.
We had four days to kill so we drove all the way to Raleigh... to see the town where Kevin Mitnick was captured.
The cellular towers where Markoff and Shimomura tracked Kevin's signal.
And this was the apartment complex it led them to.
And this was Kevin's actual apartment.
-You have a computer yourself?
-Yeah.
Be careful. l'll keep that in mind.
We foundTakedown crew members in
Wilmington where the power was restored.
You have to remember that film is usually for fourth-grade mentalities.
Skeet is definitely.... He's a great actor.
He's the most natural actor, so Kevin's lucky.
He's very charismatic.
There's nothing you can do to Skeet Ulrich that makes him uncharismatic.
So that's kind of, l mean, from your side, it's kind of... he's lucky, you know? l promised to tell Kevin how lucky he was next time l talked to him.
But now it was time for our interview.
We had been in North Carolina for five days.
But something was wrong.
Miramax had changed their mind and nowthey didn't want to talk to us.
So we staged an impromptu protest outside the studio.
And as we were leaving, destiny hit us again.
This time we wouldn't let them escape.
This time we wouldn't let them escape.
We drove next door and waited for them to leave.
There he goes. Yeah.
And off he goes into the wild blue yonder
This is the realTakedown!
We had two cars on our side... we would outflank them, chase them, ambush them, whatever it took.
-l wish l didn't have these running lights.
-Close enough. Go.
For six weeks we'd been trying to talk to these people... and we hadn't even gotten a phone call back.
So this is what it came down to:
A cat-and-mouse game in the streets of Wilmington.
They didn't know who they were dealing with.
He's making a U-turn.
He's making a U-turn, that motherfucker
-Oh, God.
-No, he's getting gas.
-Man, there's a boat in the way.
-And only eight minutes left on this tape.
What do we do now?This is just great.
This is just so typical North Carolina-ish.
Fucking boat blocking us on the street.
-He's not there.
-Oh, man!
This guy's good.This guy's real good.
They took off that way. l think they know we're behind them.
They made a U-turn and went into the gas station.
Really? That's why.
-Did they then go that way?
-They did go that way.
After they made the U-turn?
They left the gas station and went that way?
-They went that way.
-When? After the gas station?
A few minutes ago. l waited. l thought maybe you'd come by
So they're headed that way and l don't know where.
So let's go.
-Where are we gonna go?
-Forward.
Even if we go forward at maximum warp... we can't catch them because they're doing the same thing.
Let's face it guys, we lost.They beat us.
-Shakes?
-Yeah.
Shakes.
There's always the outside chance they'll get a shake too.
We had failed.
We never found Shimomura... we never got to talk to the Takedown people... and we never got past the lobby in any of the corporations we visited.
Worst of all, Kevin was still in prison.
1999 sawthe Free Kevin Movement reach a fever pitch.
1999 sawthe Free Kevin Movement reach a fever pitch.
The media wouldn't cover it, so the message went on hacked web pages.
And for the first time... hackers marched in the streets in 15 cities all over the world... even overseas in England and Russia. lt was an amazing spectacle... and more people learned about Kevin's plight than ever before.
Even though Kevin Mitnick saw his fourth year behind bars come and go... we felt like we were getting somewhere.
Excuse me? What are you doing?
And in the end,
Kevin did what he had to do... to avoid spending the next 10 years behind bars.
You're watching Southern California's
CBS 2 News at 6:30.
Good evening. l'm Gretchen Carr.
Ann Martin is off tonight.
And l'm Michael Tuck. Up front at 6:30... a guilty plea by notorious computer hacker
Kevin David Mitnick.
Juan Fernandez joins us live... from the Federal Courthouse in downtown LosAngeles.
He was the first computer hacker... to make it to the FBl's Most Wanted List.
And after a long battle with the federal government... the 35-year-old man from the San Fernando Valley comes clean.
His computer crimes apparently cost companies millions of dollars... although Kevin Mitnick never admitted to them until today.. ending a four-year battle with the federal government.
This is a very serious crime.
The federal government takes this crime seriously.
We will prosecute hackers... particularly when they cause significant amounts of damage.
Mitnick nowfaces 46 months in jail.
He's already served eight months, and according to his attorney... with good behavior, Mitnick might only have to serve one more year.
Mitnick will pay for his crimes for the rest of his life.
Although his attorneys say he has no money... to pay restitution to the companies that he hacked... that doesn't mean that they won't go after him later. lt was as if we hadn't said a word. l pray that they never wind up in the legal system. l pray that nobody does.
But the thing is that if they do... right nowthe way it stands, the cards are stacked against them. lt's not about fairness. lt's just about the way the legal game is played. lt's crazy to bring up the O.J. Simpson case... because there's no comparison here... but here's a case where a defendant had basically an unlimited budget... and look what that legal team accomplished. l'm not saying you need a lot of money to get off for something you did. l'm saying it doesn't matter whether you did it or not.
The case, the legal system... the justice system isn't about what you did or what you didn't do. lt's about either the government is going to win the case... or you'll win the case.
That's all that matters in the case. lt isn't all that matters morally l'm just saying in the court system, that's all that matters.
The prosecution will do whatever they can do... spend whatever money they can to win a case... and you have to do the same thing or you will lose.
You know, this is no longer about what the law allows or doesn't allow
This is about how do you make it as difficult as possible for the defendants... to get them to roll over or cop a plea. lt has nothing to do with justice anymore.
God help you if you get stuck in that system... because it's very easy to get in... and it's almost impossible to get out unscathed... because you're up against an adversary... that has everything going for it except maybe the truth.
And, unfortunately, that doesn't count for much.
So, that's the way it is. lf the legal community doesn't wake up shortly... we're gonna have more people locked up... than we know what to do with.
A lot of them are going to be kids.
Unfortunately. l don't think it ended. lt turned into this huge controversy that went on until now
But there weren't any more stories in the New York Times about it.
What would you think that we should have reported? l mean.... l appreciate everybody taking the time to viewthis film... l appreciate everybody taking the time to viewthis film... which was a tremendous effort on the part of Emmanuel Goldstein... and everyone on the 2600 staff.
And l want to offer... my sincere appreciation and gratitude... for the tremendous moral support that everyone has given me... throughout this five year ordeal.

Only seven months later
Taben Schweti King of Hongsawadi
Ied an invading army out against
Ayothaya.
King Maha Chakkraphat rode into battle against
Hongsawadi.
His queen and daughter rode beside him.
When battle was joined the vanguard was routed -confusion reigned everywhere.
The queen and the Kings daughter fought bravely from behind on their elephant until both of them had perished.
The name of the queen who sacrifice her life so gallantly has passed into legend as Queen Suriyothai.
This is her story.
In 1 528 the year of the Rat,
Siam had two kings.
Rama Thibodi who reigned in Ayothaya.
And his cousin
King Athitaya who ruled the northern city of Pitsanuloke.
It was a time of peace.
No wars troubled the reign of either king.

In the twelfth month,
King Athithya journeyed to the Elephant Palace on
Soi Dao Mountain
In his entourage was Princess
Suriyothai of the house of Praruang savouring the spectacle of the elephant round-up.
Your Highness!
Don't lean out like that.
People might see you.
It goes against royal conventions.
We're on holiday, Nanny.
Can't I even look at the scenery?
You're a grown woman now.
Try and behave like one
-The court rules are quite clear
-Oh, rules, rules, rules.
I'm worn out with rules I'm sick to death of rules.
Will I meet Lord Piren?
Of course not, Your Highness
You're not a child any more.
You can't just go out and meet men.
It's absolutely forbidden.
Even when the man is my own brother?
Even then?
Lord Piren isn't really your brother, Your Highnesses.
Just a relative
A distant cousin
Oh, I am so, so, so, so bored!!
Nanny?
Your Highness
I'm dying of thirst.
Have pity. Fetch me a little water.
Your Highness
Kayoon.
Quickly. Take my place
Your Highness.
This is not a good idea
Where are you going,
Your Highness.
Please let's get back to the palanquin.
It won't do for you to be seen in public.
It's a serious violation against the rules.
Stop fussing Pudkrong.
Lord Piren is not a stranger.
He's my cousin.
Why shouldn't I see him?
I've never set foot outside the palace before.
Please indulge me
Show me all there is to be seen.
For myself nothing would give me greater pleasure.
But that you should go back to the lnner Palace.
For your own sake before you get caught and punished.
Don't expect me to go back to the palace.
If you don't like being with me just say so and leave me.
We need never see each others faces again
No, no, it's not like that at all.
You..you are like my life
There's nothing in the world I could
I could want more, desire more
Iove more than you
Do you mean that? Honestly?
Or are you lying to me?
Listen to me Suriyothai.
On my honour as a warrior, what
I say now is the absolute truth.
If at any time in the future.
My body or my brain can be of service to you in any way.
All you have to do is send me word.
I will be beside you before you can even turn your head
You don't have to promise quite that much
All I really want is an elephant
That would make me so very, very happy
That little elephant-he's perfect
Would you catch him for me?
If you want him, you shall have him
Be careful! It's dangerous
Don't go too close
That's Prince Tien
That's my elephant!!
He's a wild elephant, he belongs to whoever can catch him
The Crown Prince is here
Is Princess Suriyothai in residence?
Lord Srisurin
Go and fetch the princess immediately.
The Princess does not wish to see the Crown Prince.
She refuses?
Come and pay your respects to the Crown Prince. At once!!
I have no desire to see him
This elephant I have named
Plai Song Tawan.
I caught him with the sole purpose of presenting him to
Your Highness as a gift.
Lord Srisurin
Thank you for accepting my invitation
My greatest joy is to honour
Your Highness's wishes
They tell me you have an extremly beautiful daughter
Do you mean Suriyothai?
Presumably
How old is she?
Nearly fifteen
Ah. My son... begs me to ask... your permission for her hand in marriage.
If it is Your Highness's wish.
I have no objections whatsoever.
Who are you?
From the look of your garments and demeanour.
She is Suriyothai.
One of the daughters of Lord
Srisurin Governor of Pitsanuloke
She is my cousin
Suriyothai?
Aren't you about to marry
Prince Tien
-l....
-Don't be afraid to tell me, child.
Think of me as one of the family.
Speak your mind.
With regards to the wedding between myself and the Prince
You would rather not marry my nephew
Suriyothai
Although I may be the King but I have no desire to force anyone into something against thein will.
I could change my mind today and the whole idea could be forgotten
It would be the easiest thing in the world
But..this is what you must consider it would cause a rift between
Pitsanuloke and Ayothaya which in the long run might have serious consequences.
Can you live with that responsibility
You won't run away again?
Is that understood?
1 529 The Year of the Ox
A white omen appears in the sky.
Indra's arrow crossing relentlessly from the South to the Northwest
Sunday. Eighth day of the waxing moon of the twelfth lunar month.
King RamaThibodi I goes into the chapel
That same night he passes away.
Pitsanuloke
His Majesty King Rama Thibodi is no more.
Long live His majesty!
May he live ten thousand years.
Long live His majesty!
May he live ten thousand years.
Today is an auspicious day.
The ninth month of the year of the cow.
Thursday.
An auspicious day on which His Majesty the great King
Nor Puthangkul has appointed by royal decree the Lady Oon daughter of Lord Yomaraj to be the High Consort from this day forward.
Wang Chai Palace
1 532. The year of the Dragon.
I have come down from Pitsanuloke.
To warn his Majesty that the Northern provinces are no longer loyal to Ayothaya
The reason? His Majesty appears to have lost interest in the affairs of his Kingdom
He seems not even to care that the new King of Tongu went and thumbed his nose at the Mon in Hongsawadi with a mere 500 soldiers
Do you know why he went there?
To stage an ear splitting ceremony at Swemawdaw Temple
Hundreds upon hundreds of Mon soldiers quaking with fear of a single child
Surely, as the Second King
His Majesty trusted you to handle these matters on his behal
That's not the reason
It's because he can think of nothing but his new consort. He's infatuated
Why must you treat me with so much deference?
Are we no longer brother and sister?
Your Highness is now the wife of the Crown Prince
She should even be talking to me
I will, with your permission, take my leave.
I have returned from China with a special gift for you
What is it?
And what favor are you asking from my husband in exchange?
I would like you to speak to your daughter
My daughter is the High Consort
The High Consort. Exactly so
Ask her to talk to her husband
You mean His Majesty?
His Majesty, yes, His Majesty.
I want her to tell him that
I have some Chinese cannons to sell
If your daughter, the High Consort, speaks to His Majesty on my behalf how can he refuse
And I will give you a commission of ten per cent
I, Captain Rajasaneha, soldier, retired pledge my allegiance to Prince Tien on behalf of myself and all my men
Why did you leave the army?
Because I wouldn't bend the knee to Lord Yommaraj
All those who refused to grovel to him were dismissed from service
And now you wish to serve the Prince?
To Prince Tien
I can submit willingly without a moment's hesitation
An heir to the throne is born!
Your Highness now has a brother
How can I be the brother of a Prince?
I am merely the son of the King's concubine
You are still his older brother
I am not worthy to be the brother the future King
Each of us has his allotted share of merit which has been ordained from the beginning
No one can change his destiny
In 1 533. The year of the Snake.
The smallpox sweeps across the Kingdom. Thousands perish
Promise me..
No, not merely promise.
Swear... that you will permit
Prince Ratthati-raya kuman... to become King by right of accession
Swear... that neither one of you will take away the throne from my son
I swear, Your Majesty
Swear!
I swear, Your Majesty
May the King reign in health and happiness
Long live the King!
Tabeng Shweti's camp outside Bassein.
His Majesty, Nor Puthangkul has passed away
This is the opportune moment for
Tongoo to attack Ayothaya
Once we've taken Bassein we'll move on Ayothaya
We'll get more troops from Bassein.
Ayothaya will crumble in no time.
They'll be hopelessly outnumbered.
One moment, Your Majesty.
I think this is not the moment for
Tongoo to march on Ayothaya.
How can you say that?
Even though Nor Puthangul has gone..
Yet, the moment Tongoo's troops enter Arothaya.
Chairaja, the Second King, who reigns in Pitsanulok. will seize the throne from
Ratthati-raga kuman so that he can defend the city against our attack.
He is a fierce and able warrior.
One not to be lightly underestimated.
Yes. What you say has a convincing ring to it.
In any even, first we must take Bassein.
By tomorrow. I want it by tomorrow.
Fire!
From this moment on you are no longer Hong
Chinese merchant of Nai Kai
Who am I then?
You are Sir Choduk Raja-sethi.
Commander of the left bank with sole authority to set prices..all prices.. for all forms of merchandise
A penny buys only three bowls of rice?
Yes, Your Highness.
A wagon load costs one pound, two shillings and a penny farthing.
Where will we find the money to feed those who depend on us?
And what about other goods?
All the prices are going up.
Especially if it imported from China or Portugal.
Then it costs as much as twice the cost.
At all goes according to whatever Sir Choduk decides.
I thought so.
Hong is behind this.
Sir Pinit? How much money do we have in the treasury?
Just enough to see us through to harvest time.
But we need money for weapons,
Portuguese armor, uniforms for the Prince's soldiers.
We shall have to make do with what we have.
But that's impossible.
The old weapons are beyond repair
And anyway. a Prince is judged by the condition of his army and his forces.
If our equipment is shabby and ineffectual we will lose face.
Take this. Pawn it with
Seng at Nai Kai canal.
It should fetch you a good price.
Enough to purchase what we need.
Your Highness.
That was your mother's ring!
It's nothing compared to the Prince's honour.
I must see His Highness.
His Highness is still sleeping.
I must se him. It's absolutely vital.
What is it?
Prince Chai Raja has staged a coup d'etat.
He led his army down from Pitsanulok and seized the throne!
Your Highness!
Sanpet Prasat throne hall.
In 1 534, the Year of the Horse.
Your Highness!
Help us. Please!
Help me!
Put away your weapons. At once!
Why have you done this?
You swore an oath.
You swore to accept Prince Ratha as your Sovereign.
In the presence of all things sacred, you gave your word!
What do you suggest I do?
Let the people go on suffering as they are suffering now?
Spare me your hypocrisy.
You want the throne!
It's as simple as that
It was mine from the beginning.
But I took pity on a dying man.
For five long months,
I kept careful watch to see how the Regent and his cronies would rule the Kingdom
Since Rathathiraj came to power the city has been in turmoil
Even worse, many provinces have switched their allegiance from Ayothaya to Tongoo.
Sooner or later
Ayothaya will be overrun and succumb to the power and might of King Tabeng Shweti.
For this reason.
I had to break my oath to a dead King.
What will happen to the boy?
Where are you, Mummy?
Mummy!
Where are you?
I'm frightened!
Help me!
Take me back to bed.
-I want to go back to sleep.
-Wait.
Let the Lady Worachan attend His Majesty.
I'm frightened.
Hush, there's no need to be afraid.
I'm here. I'm right beside you.
Mummy!
Where are you?
Mummy!
This will never happen again!
Whatever the circumstances.
There will be no more of this kind of killing.
I think Prince Chai Raja did the right thing.
The right thing?
Killing an innocent child?
Yes.
Sacrificing one life, however innocent to end bloodshed across the Kingdom.
It's Prince Chai Raja who is shedding the blood..
That's not true.
The second King knew that if he did nothing it would mean the end of Ayothaya.
If you were in his place.
You would have done the same.
Never. I would never do that.
No matter what the innocent should never suffer.
It was in the year 1 534,
The year of the Horse that the young King was executed and
King Chai Raja ascended the throne.
In 1 535 The Year of the Goat
It seems that I can no longer carry out my duties.
I am the Lord of Life.
Highest in the Kingdom.
I will not let you die.
Even the Lord of Life cannot defy the Lord of the Underworld.
I.. humbly..take my leave.
Jitravadee!
Jitravadee!!
The Queen Jitravadee gave birth to the Prince Yodfah then bled to death.
So doing. She opened the way for Princess Srisudachan of the House of U-Thong.
She was appointed Royal Consort to the King Chai Raja.
What is your name?
Boonsri, Your Majesty.
I hold the rank of Royal Steward.
Custodian of the Outer Hall housing the Buddha images.
So. Are you descended from the U-Thong dynasty?
I am, your Majesty.
They tell me that you are an exceptional singer.
They flatter me, Your Majesty.
Sing a verse for me.
I will decide if that is flatterey.
That fellow Boonsri, who sang for His Majesty.
Custodian of the Outer Hall.
He holds the rank of steward.
The Outer Hall.
That's the residence of
Pra Matamatayikka, Her Royal
Great Grand Mother, isn't it?
Yes. Her Highness resides at
Piman Rattaya Hall.
Perhaps it's time we presented ourselves to Her Highness.
Pimam Rattaya Hall, Front Palace.
Sroy, take this betel nut and give it to that steward.
Tell him it is a reward for his singing, which has touched me deeply.
Yes, My Lady.
The High Consort instructs me to bring you this gift.
A reward for pleasing her with your melodious renditions.
Your visit here today... was no accident.
You are fulfilling the desires of those ancestors from whose shades nothing is hidden.
The usurping dynasy of Suphanabhumi has taken over the throne of the U-Thongs for far too long.
Very soon you will understand what I am saying if the Uthing blood runs strong in your veins.
I came to inform Your Highness.
That a few days from now.
I take my vows as a nun
If that is what you truly desire.
I wish you every happiness.
No matter what happens the House of
Sri Dhamma-sokka-raj will always honour the House of
Suphanabhumi and offer obeisance for generations to come.
But one thing more.
Never trust Sri Sudachan.
Watch her closely.
Be on your guard against this High Consort.
She is not what she seems to be.
In 1 538. The year of the Dog.
King Chai Raja led his armies against the cities of Chiang Krai and Chiang Kran.
When King Ta-beng Schweti fought against the Mon, he had been unaware these cities belonged to Ayothaya.
Now King Chai Raja was determined to reclaim them.
Ching Krai, on the border of Siam.
His Majesty once told me that you have great understanding of astnology. and can interpret dreams with wonderful accuracy.
I humbly thank you, Your Highness.
For many nights,
I have had strange dreams.
Tell me what they mean.
I dreamed of you seated resplendently on a throne of gold. beneath the Royal tiered umbrella of Aytothaya.
And the one who seated beside you was me.
I can behold the truth buried deep in your eyes when you throw me a glance as you render music to the King.
I know only too clearly.
What lies in your heart... because your thoughts and mine are one and the same.
Utterly, totally, one and the same.
I still believe that bows and arrows are more accurate than your guns.
Give me the bow.
Your Higness's skill remains without equal
Then why does the Captain insist that my children and l
Iearn to use the weapons of westerners?
Because guns can shoot much further than bows and arrows.
They have five, ten times the power.
Modern warfare now requires this new kind of weapon.
The ancient textbooks on warfare will have to be rewritten if our enemies are to be defeated.
The King sent for me.
No, not the King.
It was l.
I seek your advice,
Lord Rajapakdee.
My advice, such as it is, is at Her Higness's disposal.
The keeper of the Outer Chapel is the son of Lord Sithrep
The liege-lord of Sithrep province.
Is it not so?
It is so, Your Highness.
Then pray tell me
Why is he only a lowly Captain.
Is it because Captain Butra-Sithrep for all of his noble birth belongs to the House of U-Thang and therefore cannot expect to rise from his lowly station.
No, Your Highness, not in the least.
In my opinion, this Captain Panbut-Sithrep should be elevated to the rank of Sir Chinaraj and made Keeper of the lnner Chapel.
Your Highness. It is impossible.
And why is that, Lord Rajapakdee?
You are Lord of the Palace.
You have all the power you need to promote or demote whoever you choose
That is true.
-But...
-But what?
While the present Sir Chinaraj
Keeper of the lnner Chapel.
Still lives.
That is..unless and until he dies..
Regretfully, I cannot assume the power.
In compliance with
Your Highness's wishes.
But what if the present Sir Chinaraj were to meet with an accident?
Halt!
The High Consort Srisudachan requires your presnce! Immediately!
What is your business here, woman?
The High Consort wishes that I should bring My Lord this gift.
Is that all, woman?
To repay you for your kindness.
For the advice you gave her yesterday.
I did nothing.
I merely told her the truth.
Captain Panbut-Sithrep can only advance his status if and when Sir Chinaraj passes away
And for that reason the High Consort is presenting My Lord with this valuable gift.
The High Consort is confident
Your Lordship will not deny the raising of Captain Panbut-Sithrep to the rank of Sir Chinaraj
Custodian of the lnner Hall housing the Budha images.
His Highness was served the finest Portuges liquor.
I trust it was to your liking.
Your Higness truely understands the art of pampering an old man.
If I hadn't known that this was the paace of the King's brother before I saw the soldiers on manoeuveres.
I might have thought it to be a rebel stronghold.
Why should Prince Tien betray his brother?
Of course.
He is His Majesty's loyal subject.
More loyal than anyone except myself.
Then tell me. Why do you think we are on constant alert?
Since you ask
I would imagine you fear the High Consort and her malicious schemes.
You put it far too strongly.
I'm sure I have no cause to think ill or be fearful of the High Consort
Or do you have reason to think otherwise?
Capptain Panbut-Sithrep the Custodian of the Outer Chapel has been promoted to Sir Chinatraj.
Custodian of the lnner Chapel.
And why should that because for alarm?
There's no reason.
Except that the previous Sir Chinatraj has disappeared suddenly, mysteriously and without a trace.
And you see the hand of the High Consort in this?
Be honest. You yourself don't trust the woman
I'm right, am I not?
In 1 545, the year of the Dragon.
The fourth waxing moon of the seventh month. Wednesday.
King Chai Raja marched to Chiang Mai with Lord Pitsanuloke as his vanguard.
Sankrao, a Chiang Mai mandarin plotted with others to seize
King Khet Muan Klao and assassinate him
King Chai Raja marched to Chiang Mai to retake the city from the rebel grasp.
I don't want to leave you
I want to stay like this for all eternity.
My life means nothing.
I would happily trade all the rest of my days for a mere one more day with you.
Before King Chai Raja's forces reached Chiang Mai.
The mandarins captured and executed the treacherous Lord Sankrai and invited Queen Jiraprapa to take the throne
The Queen brought gifts to King Chai Raja and offered peace and goodwill.
The third waxing moon of the tenth month. Saturday
King Chai Raja built a mausoleum for King Khet Muanka at Moree monastery.
Aren't you going to give me any medicine?
I must be dying.
I'm nauseous all the time.
Vomiting and throwing up everything every morning
There's no need..no need.
Your Higness is...
How shall I put it.
You know..with child...
Take this medicine with a cup of wine.
Take it three times every day.
Soon the nausea will stop.
No one must know of this.
Rest easy. No one will.
The doctor.. has the look of a man with not long to live.
Doctor!
Last night the water in the
Chakrai Canal was extremely low.
The doctor's body floated upstream and blocked the watergate.
Everyone could see it.
I ran to confirm it with my own eyes.
Then I reported it to Lady Srisatcha.
Why did you report it to her?
Because the doctor was seen entering the lnner Court.
Lady Srisatcha is the head of the Palace Guards.
Thus it was imperative she be informed at once.
And is there anyone who knows what business this Chinese doctor had in the lnner Palace?
It seems there isn't anyone who knows anything at all.
It's time Your Highness was at his studies.
Can't I stay just a little longer?
You are the heir to the throne.
One day you will be King.
You above all must obey the rules of the Court which say it is high time for your
Pal. Ianguage lesson.
Let me guess.
You are having difficulties with the High Consort.
She knows she's the Kings favourite.
That's why she's so arrogant.
The prince was so happy playing with his pony.
But nevertheless, she had to force him to his lessons.
She was quite right.
It's the High Consorts responsibilty to teach the Prince his duty.
Oh, now you're on her side.
She can do no wrong.
Of course not.
But the woman does have many good qualities.
That's why she's the Kings favorite.
I find it hard to appreciate her good qualities as long as she intends harm to both of us.
At the gate hangs a bell.
Any citizen in the Kingdom who has a just complaint may ring the bell.
King Ramkamhaeng will come and listen to his peoples grievances.
Does Your Highness know from which section that derives?
The section about complaints is that right, Brahmin?
Quite right, Your Highness.
All right.
Enough law for one day.
Tommorrow I'll teach Your Highness the Rules of War.
Your Highness will enjoy that.
Srisin, come with me.
Out! All of you.
I burn with frustration seeing you, being near you, pretending indifference. unable to hold you, unable to kiss you to satisfy my hunger for you.
You must be careful.
If someone sees us..
If anything should happen to you.
How could I go on living?
Don't forget.
I'm a humble chapel custodian.
One day you will be more than that.
You are a member of the dynasty of U-Thong.
As great or greater than the Suphanabhumi or the Praruang.
Soon the U-Thong shall rule again in Arothaya.
What do you mean?
What I mean is the U-Thong dynasty. will rule again in Arothaya according to its rightful destiny.
But there is something you must do first.
So that we can be together without having to skulk in the shadows.
Isn't that what we want?
Out. Everybody out.
What can I do for you, brother?
Kill Prince Thien and Suriyothai and every single one of their breed.
I'll lose my home and my head.
No. You'll become second King.
You'll take Prince Tien's position.
What are you saying?
I'm saying you'll become the Second King.
Second King Chan!
In 1 545, the year of the Snake.
The fire is at the Grand Palace, is it not?
No. it looks to be at Yot Market.
Sir Pinit. How did it happen?
It started at Kalahom pier then moved to the rear of the Palace and the market.
That's virtually the whole city!
Who's in charge?
Lord Mahesena has taken the entire army to fight the fire.
Captain Raj Saneha. Take all our men and give him all the help you can.
-Yes, Your Highness.
-Captain, wait.
I don't think our men should leave the palace.
Whyever not?
I can't explain.
But if an enemy wishes you harm then a crisis like this gives them the perfect opportunity
Please come this way,
Your Highness
It's safer than the bedroom.
Your Highnes. Don't.
Don't. That's... the Ming vase.
This one is still alive.
Who hired you for this work?
The Khmer assassins,
Your Highness. From Lavoa.
And who hired them?
Someone who can afford to pay them,
Your Highness
To believe that, you must have proof.
Am I not right,
Captain Raja Seneha?
In 1 545, the year of the Dragon, the eleventh lunar month.
The Shan army is attacking
Chiang Mai.
Queen Jeraprapa is asking the Lao army for help.
She does not inform King Chai Raja.
Lord Klang and Lord Soon crossing the Mae Khong River
On Wednesday 9th.
On the second lunar month.
Chiang Mai will sorely pay for this.
I will not let the pride of Ayothaya... be insulted like this.
Furthermore, Queen Jeraprapa must have sided with Lan Chang more so than Ayothaya.
For she is the aunt of Pra Chai Chettha the King of Lan Chang.
So she had me fooled like a baby
I have only just left Lanna. and she immediately sided with
Lan Chang.
Ayothaya shall take revenge to equal this horrendous betrayal.
Lompoon,a frontier town of Chiang Mai.
Tuesday, the third day of the waxing moon of the fourth lunar month.
Extinguish a fire.
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Hold him tightly, he will be in great pain.
The King has been injured.
He has been hit by the Yuan's guns.
If he is to die the kingdom will be without a ruler.
It is time for you to make a decision, Your Majesty.
What decision?
To prepare your troops.
If the King should die, the sole person who can protect the Kingdom is you.
But he is not yet dead.
It may be too late by then because the High Consort
Srisudachan, would surely not let this opportunity pass.
This poison, will solve all your problems.
You meanfor me to poison him?
Or would you prefer to be punished?
But that's not important.
It is the unborn child you are carrying, the one who should rule
Ayothaya one day, who will be doomed along with you.
Then, the U - Thong dynasty will be no more.
When I was wounded do you know whose face was constantly on my mind?
It was your face no one else's.
I am a fool.
This war with Yuan... made me perceive clearly who is the one who truly loves me.
I will elevate you,
My Lady.
"to be my Queen, as you deserve," for all your devotion.
But still this is not enough to equal your virtues.
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Get the doctor, immediately.
Your Majesty!
I have been poisoned.
If it is poison why isn't it affecting you?
Your Highness
All of you are in on the plot.
Traitors!
Who brought in the wine?
Soy, Your Highness.
She poisoned the king.
She must die.
Take them away.
Torture them and make them tell us who is behind this deed.
Then, remove their heads and impale them on spikes in the town square.
What did you say?
His Majesty was poisoned?
Yes, Lord Chakri asked me to fetch you.
You are to go to the Grand Palace immediately.
I feel much better.
Almost back to normal, father.
These are the usual symptoms, unbearable temperature and fever, then, almost total recovery as if nothing had ever happened.
Then, the poison will spread once more.
This time it will be almost like a burning fire within.
Blood will flow out from the nine orifices.
You'll even sweat blood.
You'll suffer for days uh.before.... your final death.
Are there any medicines to cure this?
There is no such cure once the poison is inside your veins.
-How much longer do I have?
-No more than seven nights.
Hail great and glorious king
In the year 1 546, the year of the horse.
On the fifteenth day of the waxing moon of the sixth month,
King Chai Raja, who ruled in accordance with the ten righteous commandments of kingship, whose royal decree resounds like the roar of a lion, is pleased to elevate,
Nor Praputchao, Prince Yotfa, to kingship, and the High Consort Srisudachan, to be queen, and to serve as regent until such a time as Prince Yotfa, comes of age, and is ready to assume the mantle of kingship.
It is hereby decreed that the second king, Pra Tien Raja, is to assume guardianship of King Yotfa. from this moment until King Yotfa comes of age.
Samlee, tell me who is behind the master plan.
Your sentence will be reduced.
I regret to see such beauty vanish by a deadly whip.
Name Prince Tien as a plotter, as a conspirator to poison the King.
Prince Tien is the one who poisoned His Majesty.
Confess the truth to keep your head on your shoulders.
Prince Tien, Prince Tien.
What is it, whore?
Prince Tien forced me to poison
His Majesty.
Prince Tien poisoned His Majesty.
The handmaid confessed before the sword descended, that Prince Tien Raja was behind the assassination plot.
I don't believe that is so.
Prince Tien Raja is not the one who poisoned me.
Then, who did it? I'll take him into custody right now."
It was you, Srisudachan.
You planned it with Lord Chinaraj and poisoned me.
Ayothaya must be under the U- Thong Dynasty forever and ever
Now, the end of the Supanna-bhumi
Dynasty is at hand.
The next king must be the child in my womb, the one who is of the U-Thong Dynasty, and whose father is also of the U - Thong Dynasty.
E-Meon has stated
That you are the one who poisoned and assassinated the King
Do you think what she has stated is the truth?
If I believe that whore, who will say anything to save her from punishment.
I would have come with a full battallion of soldiers.
Not only accompanied by a mere handful of soldiers.
So as not to be laughed at by Captain Raj Saneha.
Then why have you come to this palace?
This whore is blaming you publicly,
Your Highness.
In the presence of the noblemen and other citizens.
The regent won't allow Your Highness to escape the punishment, sire.
What ever you plan to do,
Please consider carefully
Captain Raj Saneha and His Royal
Highness soldiers would not let your lordship get close to His Royal Highness.
It seems to be that way.
But I came to Your Highness now to tell Your Highness
That at one o'clock.
I will return to this palace again with the royal troops
But between now and then, I trust
Your Highness will find a way to Escape from this perilous situation.
What's happened? Fire?
Wait, My robes.
I have to don my robes first.
Search the whole place.
Don't let any one get away.
Go on.
Search the whole area.
Those are Captain Raj
Saneha's soldiers.
Where?
I said stop!
Don't you all have any sense of right and wrong?
How dare you fight on sacred grounds?
-Get Prince Tien!
-Stop.
Prince Tien has been ordained and is now in the monkhood.
He will be under protection until this crisis is over.
He has the immunity.
But Prince Tien had been plotting against the late king.
I received a royal decree from the late king. if there is no evidence implicating Prince Tien as a conspirator, then no one is to harm him.
Especially while he is wearing the yellow robes of the Lord Buddha.
No one can not harm him.
In 1546, the year of the Horse.
Sixth lunar month.
In 1 548, the year of the Monkey.
Sunday, the fifth night of the waxing moon of the eighth lunar month.
The messengers from the Northern provinces report
Those Lords and magistrates are plotting to rebel
They are secretly meeting aiming to break away to offer obeisance to
Hongsawadi's king, Ta-beng Shweti.
It's all because the king is so young.
Always playing and having fun
He can not rule the country.
Under these dire circumstances, why don't you take the matters into your own hands?
I am only a woman why should the northern provinces hold me in awe?
Now that they have rebelled,
I see Lord Worawongsa as the one to take over until
His Majesty is of age.
Is there anyone who dares to disagree with me?
The year 1 548, the year of the Monkey.
Sunday, the fifth night of the waxing moon of the eighth lunar month.
I am at my wit's end to name exactly what is the cause of
His Majesty's illness.
The symptoms appear to be a gastric problem which makes it difficult for him to breathe.
I'll get some medicine.
How long before he recovers?
Not more than three nights.
What did you say?
King Yotfa has died?
Yes, Your Highness, at dawn.
How did the king meet his demise?
Laung Tip O-sot pondered deeply on this and it is still not understood.
The first symptoms were not at all serious, but then, His Majesty suddenly passed away at dawn.
His Majesty's death is no different from that of King Chai Raja.
Sir, Raj Seneha.
From now on we must guard His Highness will great heed.
Yes, Your Highness,
I cannot tolerate it any longer.
Never before has the regime been so disreputable.
Even during
King Rama-thibodi's reign people wrote anonymous messages against him.
At the time the king commanded the execution of many mandarins.
But now,
Lord Chinaraj has been in power for only a short time and there are riots everywhere.
The northern provinces and defiantly vying for independence.
The southern provinces are all under the sway of the treacherous.
Chan of Mahalok Village
Your Excellency should be careful what you say.
There are many who favor
Lord Chinaraj and Chan, the Second King.
My heart aches for I am a military commander, not only unable to protect the young king, but worse, I cannot even arrest the assassins and punish them for their heinous crimes, even though I know who they are.
Lord Mahasena dared utter those words?
How arrogant!
Yes, Your Majesty.
Lord Rajapakdi urged me to inform you that.
Lord Mahasena is planning to rebel against the king.
I think, we should not continue...
...to let him be a thorn in our side.
Your Excellency must not bear arms into the lnner Royal residence!
Bah! I am the military commander, my first obligation is to protect
His Majesty.
Not this time. not even a minister like yourself.
It is a royal decree.
What do you think you're doing?
How dare you, women?
Open the gates now
You dare to plan a rebellion.
Don't be slow
Clear the way, now!
I have business with the
High Consort.
She does not wish to see a traitor like you.
Your drunken lout, kill him!
I have just received a message that
Lord Mahasena is dead.
What's the cause?
He was assassinated at the rear palace gate.
-But it is not known who planned it.
-Who else?
It seems that we cannot avoid calamity.
Lord Mahasena was the only noble mandarin who had the courage to defend
Prince Tien, and the rest of the royal family.
There is one person who might be able to protect us.
I volunteer to call upon this person
Who is this courageous person?
Lord Pitsanulok,
Commander in chief of the Late King
Chai Raja,
Lord Pitsanulok's army
The border at Cha Gang Rao.
Have you see Lord Pitsanulok's army come this way?
That way, Sir.
Princess Suriyothai asked me to inform you that Ayothaya is in grave danger.
There is chaos everywhere, people are suffering immensely.
That's what I have heard.
What does Princess Suriyothai want me to do?
She feels that you alone. can put an end to all the suffering and restore peace eternally though out the kingdom.
She would like you to return to Ayothaya to save the country.
I must fight against the minority rebels in Kampangpet province.
How can I get away from here and be there at the same time?
She asked me to personally remind you of an oath you had given in front of her.
A warrior's words once said should there ever be a day when she needs to avail of your strength and wisdom then as soon as you learn about it you'll come immediately, without delay no matter how far away. you will be there.
Lord Pitsanulok.
Has Captain Raj Saneha told you why I summoned you here?
Even if there were no compelling reasons, if it is your wish
I will come.
You must have known already. that the Kingdom is in danger.
I knew from the very beginning of this reign with my lack of wisdom and strength that I would be unable to do anything.
The cause of all this is Lord Worawongsa and Srisudachan.
Were it not for them the whole Kingdom would be at peace.
But then, we would be without a king.
Prince Tien Raja has all the might and the right and the legitimacy to rule Ayothaya.
Once the Kingdom is devoid of a ruler
Prince Tien should rule with no opposition,
Or do you disagree with me?
Mother ordered me to bring this to you
My business is complete,
I beg you farewell.
Won't you stay a while?
It's a long journey back
The gate keepers could use a rest.
I'm afraid not, Sir.
My mission is finished.
Then, let me brew you some tea.
It would be an honour for me.
I can't perceive what is in your mind, Your Highness.
What is it that's not clear to you?
It isn't clear why is that you sacrificed your life and your family.
And yet you are giving the throne to Pra Tien Raja.
It likes killing a snake and throwing it to the bird.
Don't ever say a thing like that again.
Pra Tien Raja has the legitimate right to reign as king.
Your enjoy the same right and legitimacy, You Highness.
You Father is from the lineage.. of the House of Sukho thai which rules that region, and your mother is from the lineage of the House of Suphanna-bhumi the same as King Chai Raja.
But I am not wish to inherit the throne.
Is it not because of
Princess Sawasdiraj, Your Highness.
I wonder
Why Lord Piren is coming down to Ayuthaya for what purpose.
-Dum.
-Yes, Your Highness.
From now on, you must keep an eye on Lord Pitsanulok.
Iike a tiger eyeing his prey.
If there is anything suspicious,
-to inform me or Sir Han.
-Yes, Your Highness.
This plan will succeed only if we can assassinate
Lord Worawongsa and Srisudachan right away.
You must not underestimate that regent Chan.
The knight of the unholy throne.
If you cut the roots, the tree will die.
When they are gone, where will Second King Chan be able to hide?
I'm not an enemy.
I'm here to join your fight against injustice.
But you are a royal guard.
Are you thinking of spying on us?
If I had meant you any harm would I have come alone?
I am ready to fight and sacrifice my life for the realm.
But, I have only one doubt.
What do you doubt?
If we eliminate Lord Worawongsa to whom would you offer the throne?
Sir Sriyod, Captain Raj Sasaneha
Wait for me in front of the chapel.
-Do not let anyone inside.
-Yes, Sir.
I am a monk.
I should not deal with worldly matters.
If our plan is successful
...the kingdom will be without a king.
You are the only one who is entitled to rule the kingdom.
It we succeed and the kingdom still is without a king. the people will suffer anyway.
This is similar to the Lord Buddha having to defeat mara.
If I refuse, it will be as if I have no feelings for the people and I would let them suffer.
Therefore, I will accept your request to rule the realm.
May the secured beings of Ayothaya give you blessings to succeed and subdue the enemies restore glory to religion. and peace throughout the kingdom.
In 1 548, Saturday, the sixth day of the waxing moon of the ninth lunar month.
Your Majesty.
I have brought the political bureau of Lopburi to inform you about an auspicious elephant that has been spotted in the forests of Lopburi.
It should be caught as a royal elephant for His Majesty.
I'm going to be promoted.
This great elephant, is it that powerful?
Ten knotted ropes cannot hold him
We are not bestowed with enough merit to capture it, Your Majesty.
There is no one but you in the whole kingdom. who possesses enough merit to catch that elephant Your Majesty.
Enough.
I 'll go get it myself.
In 1 548, Sunday, the second night of the waxing moon of the fourth lunar month.
Tell us exactly
What you intend to do.
Tomorrow at dawn
King Worawongsa will set out and capture the great elephant that is being lured toward
Pleum Temple.
The King will go up to Sa Bua Canal.
We will block the way and assassinate him at Rang Temple, near Pla Maw canal.
Lord lndrathep's barge are our men.
They all will have their weapons hidden.
At the right moment, they will attack the Portuguese mercenaries.
If Second King Chan
Should find out. he will bring his troops to aid
King Worawongsa, his brother.
Then what will we do?
I plan to get Captain Raj Saneha. to disguise himself as a boxer bodyguard.
In that disguise, he will wait for
Second King Chan at Seua Temple.
If he crosses through the palace gates, he will immediately get shot by Captain Raj Saneha.
Lord Pichai and his troops will hide on the eastern side of Sa Bua Canal.
North of Pla Maw Canal.
And Lord Sawankalok, you will hide on the western side, in case those on the royal barge try to escape in that direction.
Sir Sriyod, take your boat and wait in the middle of Sa Bua Canal. and I will wait on Pla Maw Canal.
That will prevent the royal barge from escaping in that direction.
I think, that Lord Piren is up to something.
A little while after sunset
I saw his men armed and on the way to Sa Bua Cannel by boat.
Tomorrow morning the King and the High Consort Srisudachan will go to catch the great elephant and will travel past Sa Bua Canal.
That doesn't sound right
Puek go ready and arm the elephant for me,
I must go and warn the king at the Grand Palace.
Sua Temple
In front of Regent Chan's palace.
Help me and I will reward you handsomely
The only thing
I want is
Whose boat is that?
Mine, Lord Piren-thora-thep here to chop off your head.
Kill them all!
Kill them Kill them
Head the boat to shore, now.
Get off
There might be a way to survive this
What about the king?
We must save you and the prince first.
Get off the boat, quickly.
I will hold them back.
Kham kaew, take the High Consort to shore.
Fire!
You have sinned terribly.
You can even kill an innocent child.
Someone like you will only bring down the country and the religion.
-You should die for you crimes.
-But not by you hand.
Hurry, try to escape before they kill the prince.
-No!
-Wait, Lord Pitsanulok.
Prince Srisin is descended from the late King Chai Raja he should not be executed.
Prince Srisin is the son of the
High Consort Srisudachan.
Not to kill him would go against custom, and he will remain a thorn in our sides.
Is there not enough bloodshed?
If you only cut down the tree and leave the roots the next king and the rest of the dynasty will be under continuous threat.
If not for the sake of the late king, then for me.
I plead with you not to kill the child.
What are you waiting for,
Pudkrong?
Hurry and take Prince Srisin to our boat.
Let Lady Pudkrong take the prince to the boat
As Princess Suriyothai wishes.
Lord lndrathep help my child.
Lord Pirenthorathep has taken the initiative come forward.
I bestow upon you the title of Somdej Pra Maha
Dhammaracha-thiraj.. governor of Pitsanulok.
Princess Sawat-diraj come sit by his side.
I bestow upon you
...the title of Wisut-krasat-tri, the principal queen of Pitsanulok.
I wish to let it be known.. to all sacred beings that from now on should any harm befall the families of
Somdej Pra Maha
Dhamma-racha-thiraj
Lord Sri Dhamma-sokka-raj
Lord Mahasena and Lord Pakdi-nuchit and should there be any bloodshed, that rule will be treated as a traitor against my word.
May he be condemned and perish under the royal tiered umbrella
May all sacred beings bring death upon such a person within three days or three months but no later than three years.
Let him be forever deprived of happiness.
In 1 548, the year of the Monkey, the eleventh month.
The news of the trouble in Ayothaya reaches Hongsawadi
The king of Hongsa decides if they should attack Ayothaya now the Hongsa army should win easily.
The Hongsa king then conscripts a troop of 30,000 men"
700 elephants, 3000 horses.
Assign Bayinnaung as vanguard.
Lord of Prome as supply.
Lord Bassein as rear guard and march toward Ayothaya.
It looks like the black-tongued king of Hongsawadi has ill intentions toward Ayothaya.
The Burmese have prepared their boats so they could cross the Kong River from Martaban shore to Moulmein shore
For the cavalrymen and soldiers to cross easily.
There is going to be trouble.
Bay, Bai.
-Yes, lord.
-You two and Jormia go scout and find out when the Honsa troops are going to cross the river
We have watched for seven days and seven nights.
King Hongsa's troops have successfully crossed the Kong river...
...from Martaban shore to Moulmein shore.
It took them seven nights?
Are there such tremendous numbers of Burmese?
It's just cavalry and soldiers
...not including the elephant troops that crossed the river some eight hundred kilometers above.
King Hongsa assembled his troops at Martaban.
From there, crossed the Kong river which way would King Hongsa's troops enter Ayothaya?
Will it be Tongpapoom, the Three Pagodas Pass or Rahang in Tak province?
I expect King Hongsa would maneuver his troops in the direction of the Three Pagodas area.
Why do you think that?
Capt. Kla mentioned great numbers of Burmese soldiers and King Hongsa has brought many cannons along.
He would need to travel by water to convey the food supplies, cannons and gun powder.
All of you evacuate to Ayothaya immediately.
-Lord Jakri
-Yes, Your Majesty.
Gather some soldiers and set up camp at Lumplee field to intercept King Hongsa's troops from Ayothaya.
Phukao Thong Monastery,
Lumplee Field.
Work faster.
You want the Burmese to be here before you going to work.
Lazy asses!
I think they are doing their best.
Be we have to dig a lot more the distance from Praya Ram fortress to Kue na canal is a long way.
I heard that King Hongsa's troops have passed the Three Pagodas.
Yes.
My spy told me that King Hongsa had assembled his troops at Sam Sob a while ago intending to build rafts to carry soldiers and food supplies down the Noi river?
It is just as well that we have these spies and are able to follow his plans.
But still, we are not beyond the enemy, their spies are familiar with Ayothaya.
Hold on! now that you've mentioned this, it reminds me a monk once told me there's an old man who lives in a hut by Lumplee field always welcoming strangers.
He has homing pigeons in his hut.
The Lumplee Villagers call him the
Birdman " Tao nok "
Does anyone know his background?
No one.
He lives near the temple where I stay yet I have never seen him pay a visit to the temple.
How strange.
That's it.
-Bay!
-Yes, sir.
Gather some men
...to capture this Birdman at Lumplee field,
Yes, sir.
He spotted us.
Let's go!
From Mou Lmein to the Three Pagodas in less than a month?
How did King Hongsa manouvre his troops so fast?
King Hongsa must first assemble his troops at Sam Sob.. before moving further down to Kanchanaburi that should delay him further more.
That could take about two months?
Or less
King Hongsa may reach Ayothaya very soon.
I volunteer. to intercept the troops of the black tongued king at Kanchanaburi.
A handful of soldiers?
How can we repel hundreds of thousands of King Hongsa's troops?
Kanchanaburi's fortress is in an ideal location it stands on the cliff about where the Kwae Yai river that joins Tapern river.
The two rivers form a natural wall..
King Hongsa will find it impossible to cross.
I will be able to resist the Burmese troops until your troops are ready.
You speak as though you will never return to Ayothaya.
Kanchanaburi Fortress,
Town of Kao Chon Kai.
Move it!
Move!
Even though Kanchanaburi is a small town it has cost me many soldiers and three wasted days to reach here.
I must punish these prisoners of war, to set an example to others!
Executioner!
Take these prisoners young, old and behead them.
Burn down their city and all the temples. and make it known throughout the land that any governors of Ayothaya who rebel against me, will be doomed, with their clans, to die like the people of Kanchanaburi.
The Burmese troops have filled
Phukao Thong field, sir!
They have detected us now.
You must be cautious.
We have a huge number of soldiers more than ten to one
It is the recklessness that will cause our downfall.
Might you be too old for this battle, Minye Sihatu?
Give the signal and charge!
Give the signal to fire!
Lord Chakri's camp at Phukao Thong is about to be taken over.
Phra Maha Dhamma-raja has brought his troops from the north to join up with Lord Jakri's
King Prome's troops outnumber us greatly far more than those of Lord Chakri and Pitsanulok combined.
We need to render support for the royal troops.
Go forward!
Go forward!
Command a withdrawal now,
Tado Dhammaraja!
Or we'll lose all our people!
Give the signal to withdraw!
Retreat!
Let's head back to our camp,
Sormeng.
The Burmese troops outnumber the Ayothaya troops ten to one. why can you not overthrow
Lord Chakri's camp?
Instead of withdrawing in haste
Iike a panicky dog running from a lion degenerating the King's honour
You probably think it is because of the cannons
On the fortresses bombarding us?
Absolutely, Your Majesty.
The cannons on the fortress are able to fire across many miles.
Just like Nandasu said.
Those cannons are three way long.
Foot long mortars, Your Majesty.
It would be easier just to destroy the cannons the only way to succeed would be to bombard them with our cannons.
While we are on the elephant's back
This will side track them and we'll have the time to fill up the gulley on the other side.
Then, we can take over
Lord Jakri's camp.
Let it be to take Lord Chakri's camp in the next battle.
I will make up for
Tado Dhamma-raja's failure.
If anyone gets to the camp and opens the gates for our troops.
I will reward that person with 1 000 gold changes.
All cannons fire!
Fire!
Seize this camp!
No one would dare to stand on the rampart.
Their cannon fire is too heavy.
We can resist them a moment longer.
Pra Maha Dhamma-raja is crossing the gully right now.
I am not waiting for his troops!
But I will deal with the Burmese up on the rampart so they know that people of Ayothaya have no fear!
King Hongsa had said a reward of 1 000 gold chang to be given to any person who can open this camp's gate. make haste and do just so.
Kill them all!
Kill them all!
Kill them all!
Burn in hell!
Kill them, do not withdraw!
You are here just in time.
The Burmese are full of vigor and vim. competing to open the gates expecting the reward from King Hongsa.
If that is so.
I volunteer to open the gates for
His Majesty King Ta-Beng Shweti.
I need you to carry a message to him.
But you will carry this message on you!
Your Majesty Hongsawadi the great.
For you have declared in public an offer of one thousand changes worth of gold to any brave person who is able to open the gate.
Now, I Maha Dharma-raja
The ruler of the Northern province, has done so.
Your Majesty should make haste and pay such reward.
I and my troops shall await you in front of the camp at Makamyong field.
If you are as mighty as they say then make haste and bring my gold instantly.
Spare me Spare me
Maha Dhama-raja now awaits us in front of the camp.
I will take this perfect opportunity to erase his insult.
You should think this over
Maha Dhama-raja is mockingly provoking us to lure you forward.
Mahathama-raja awaits not far from the camp.
If he blunders, he can retreat conveniently.
My tactic is
Iet Prajao Prae go into this battle with Maha Dhama-raja whom if we are rid of.
Ayothaya will be mine.
Our children and l have thought it over the battle is a most difficult one.
The courtiers, soldiers male and female all need to devote their lives to defend the Ayothaya kingdom.
I thank you dearly but it is a man's job to defend the country.
Leave it to me and my brave men.
This Burmese war may look dangerous. with all of Ta-beng Shweti's men, horses and elephants storming over us like a flood.
Should anything happen to you,
Ayothaya
...will lose its crown and be no more.
Our children and l are ready to fight beside you in every battlefield.
Give a signal to attack
Archers!
Prepare!
Fire!
Prepare!
Fire!
Keep fighting!
Don't let them near the camp!
The royal guards have come to aid us.
Yes, Your Majesty the King.
Yes.
The Royal troop has moved it's force!
He is not as cowardly as they say must be expecting to fight with me
How well suited!
The great spirits of Burma have inspired the King of Ayothaya to emerge and hasten our victory
Great!
We shall trap this King
Signal the King of Prome to withdraw. and bring the Royal troops to our trap.
Look! The Burmese are withdrawing.
Their troops are scattered and dispersing everywhere.
May l?
Give the withdrawal signal!
We have been tricked!
Maha Dhama-raja has fallen for King Hongsa's plan.
Sir Kojasit!
Prepare the royal elephant
Plai Kao Chakarpat now!
But this is walking straight into
King Hongsa's trap!
To take your life!
If I don't go to this battle
Ayothaya's soldiers will be dispirited.
No matter how enormous the enemy's troops are
I still must go into this battle!
Pudkrong! Order Srichaithip to prepare
Plai Song Suriya Krasat...
I will join His Majesty.
Are you sure, Your Majesty?
It is very dangerous!
You will surely be harmed.
But if anything should happen to our King do you think I will survive?
But our lives are not important
I and my husband have no care for our lives our main concern are the people of Ayothaya and Ayothaya itself.
If the King should die we will also die at the hands of the Burmese.
The royal army is here!
Urge the elephant to hasten on!
Kill them, kill them all!
In 1 549, the year of the Cock.
Queen Suriyothai, the
Queen of King Chakkaphat... the ruler of Ayothaya sacrificed her life in the war against Hongsa in order to save her husband from death at the hand of their enemy.
It seems too graphic and unemotional.
I would prefer those grieving people.
- For this double page here?
Yes, for the big page.
- Okay.
There's already a great deal of misery in it!
I like this sad figure walking through the streets full of destruction...
Fits perfect!
And Goma! One million refugees!
Thousands died and couldn't be buried in the volcanic soil. There were piles of corpses!
Right! The piles of corpses...
It'd be great!
There are the piles!
Okay.
That looks fantastic!
You think we should use this one? - I'd enlarge it.
This is also a terrific picture.
The corpses being dumped.
- Maybe we should put it here.
Have it enlarged.
- Okay, fine.
Can you tell that the corpses being dumped aren't in Africa?
You don't have to see the corpses...
You can substitute them with this.
Here you feel like you're being shown some scene in Africa.
It starts with Africa, and you think it's an African horror trip.
But his idea is worldwide horror.
It zooms in again...
- Then there's the head...
Then there's that poor guy.
- Looks terrific. - Okay.
Exactly.
Then we'll have a look at it.
Comma... now it's shorter.
After the Berlin Wall fell, wars changed.
It was no longer nation against nation, but people against people.
Instead of high-tech weapons... rifles and machetes.
- James Nachtwey, the world's most famous war photographer, has portrayed these new conflicts and victims in a way nobody else ever could.
My son has arrived!
Oh, my son! Oh, my son!
Oh, you!
"Please, don't," I said.
"My brother is deaf and speechless."
But they threw him down from the truck, took his money and killed him.
They cut off my other brother's arm with a bread knife.
They tore my uncle's son from his arms, but he wouldn't let go.
So they shot him in the head, and the child fell on the ground.
They gave me 2 minutes time, and they held an automatic weapon at my neck.
They wanted money.
Goodbye.
There are war photographers who are only able to endure the horror of what they've seen, experienced and escaped... like in Vietnam... by going with the soldiers to the same brothels and bars and drinking the same whisky.
Others have become cyncical.
Jim is a remarkably uncynical person, which is all the more remarkable, because most people have seen a lot less misery and suffering.
Lonely because... his experience sets him apart from his colleagues and others.
He has become a different person as a result of those 25 years.
While we talked about that horror in order to comprehend what we saw, the absolute inferno of people who were dead, dying and vomiting, never-ending lines of people waiting outside the first-aid tents,
Jim said almost nothing.
Jim said hello. He talked about some organizational details, then he said, "I'm going to bed."
And while we needed beer to recover from what we'd seen that day,
Jim had one or two glasses of water before going to bed.
Then he got up early the next day to head out alone.
Good morning, Mister.
- Good morning.
For me, the early 80s were characterized by my move to New York.
I was a photo editor for GEO.
I'd worked for SPIEGEL before that, and I had an opportunity to take over the photography department at the New York office of STERN.
That was in 1982.
It was the first time that Nachtwey came to STERN's office with a portfolio, and that led to a friendship, a love affair.
Both of us had an idea what that New York situation was supposed to lead to.
Nachtwey wanted to make a name for himself.
He was very bright... and determined.
His mind was focused
Like flight routes.
No winding roads.
There was one distinct, straight, narrow, stony path he had decided to take.
Of course, at times I wished it was a warmer, closer, more intense relationship.
But his work was of great importance.
I'll do it.
I'll do it with my pictures.
I'll convince people with my pictures.
Nachtwey came back from Nicaragua.
He was relaxed and happy.
He brought me a necklace made of shells.
He put it around my neck, and I thought that was great.
I remember the first time I met him.
His hair was parted, his jeans were creased, his shirt was immaculate.
And amidst all that dust and chaos, stood this man
I'd never seen before taking his pictures. He was in no hurry like the others.
He was somehow calm, as suddenly
South African photographer
Ken Oosterbroek was killed next to him.
Normally, two sorts of journalists are hit:
The ones on their first assignment, and the ones who have been at it too long and think they're bulletproof.
Jim is in danger of seeing himself as bulletproof, in danger of pushing his luck once too often.
As someone who is quite reserved, he needs that kick, that adventure, that flow of adrenalin and the fear of dying, in order to feel alive.
Jim is at his best in the most extreme situation.
That's it. He keeps on pushing those limits.
Tough...
Tough, tough, tough.
It's also very difficult to talk to Nachtwey about the insane situations he has narrowly escaped.
It's excruciating the way some photographers and journalists never stop talking about what they've experienced.
With Nachtwey, however, you have to drag everything out of him.
You really have to beg him, and, even then, he tries to avoid making the impression that he's bragging, showing off.
When he returned from an assignment, and I wanted to grab him and say,
"Tell me about it. How was it?"
No, first he had to develop the pictures and then look at them.
I don't know where he kept everything, or where he keeps it, because the photo material alone, the pictures, are only a fraction of what he has seen, felt, smelled and heard.
He has his own library of suffering in his head.
What were you thinking of?
Don't you want to talk about it?
Allah is great!
I feel that
James Nachtwey's pictures possess the precision of a war surgeon.
He hates to hear that.
He doesn't want to be compared to a war surgeon, because everyone will then say,
"Aha, a cold-hearted war surgeon."
He is unrelentless when dealing with people and situations.
This very old-fashioned, very unmodern characteristic makes him, at the same time, so untypical, so fascinating.
Do I make a living from other people's suffering?
Has their suffering and misery been... my ladder to success?
Do I exploit people?
