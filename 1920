I deliver perfection... and don't brag about it! :D
In the great Gold Rush, Alaska was the hope and dream of men, the ruthless siren of the Far North, beckoning thousands to her icy bosom.
Beckoning thousands to her unknown regions.
Chilkoot Pass was the great barrier to the gold fields.
Over this Pass men faced untold misery and hardship.
Many lost their lives.
Some fell by the wayside, others lost courage and turned back.
But the brave went on.
Far into the icy north, deep into the silent nowhere, came an undaunted lone prospector.
And somewhere in that nowhere was another lone prospector.
With cheerful optimism our little Columbus descended, then stopped, stepped, slipped and slid.
"Now let me see", thought the little fellow.
"Before I know where I am,
I must get there."
There in that frozen wilderness a dream came true, and a lone voice shrieked into the solemn sky,
"Eureka! I've found it, a mountain of gold!"
But the elements laughed, roared and thundered.
In that raging nowhere was a lone cabin, and another lone man,
Black Larson, an unmitigated, predatory scoundrel.
Out of the lashing storm came the Little Fellow to find shelter and perhaps a little hospitality.
There he sat, resting his weary bones as the icy wind howled through the knothole.
"Come here", said Larson.
"What are you doing?"
"Eating, obviously."
"Get out."
"Go on!"
"Get out!"
The wind also was giving
Big Jim his troubles.
Big Jim was the noble type.
He had suffered.
Oh, how he loved to suffer.
He suffered about everything.
"Get out", said Black Larson.
"Or I'll fill you both full of lead."
"Now then, the pair of you, get out!"
"Out!"
That kind of noise
Jim don't tolerate.
"I'll stay right here, understand?"
"Right here", said Big Jim.
"Yes, sir, he'll stay right here", said the Little Fellow.
"Understand? We stay right here."
And stay they did, for days and nights.
The cabin moaned and groaned.
Two men walked and never talked, hunger gnawed their bones.
"I must have food!" yelled Big Jim.
"I must have food!"
"What are you eating?"
Said Black Larson.
"Nothing."
"Open your mouth!"
"Liar! It's that candle."
"That?" said the Little Fellow.
"How revolting."
"If I thought you were holding out on me, I'd slit your gizzard!"
"One of us must brave that storm, if we're to get food."
"Come here, the pair of you."
"We'll cut the cards and the low man goes."
"You're the man", said Jim.
"Goodbye, good luck."
"Don't forget to bring home the bacon."
Somewhere in that nowhere, the law was looking for Black Larson.
Desperate with hunger and here it was Thanksgiving Day.
Nevertheless there was something to be thankful for.
"Not quite done yet, give it two more minutes."
"Come on, come on", said Big Jim.
After scouring the country for food, the Little Fellow had to admit he had seen nothing, not even a field mouse.
From the pangs of hunger,
Big Jim was becoming delirious, hysterical.
In fact he was a pain in the neck.
"Food, food!" he thundered.
"I can put another shoe in the pot."
"No, no, anything but that!"
Poor Jim, he couldn't take it.
"What's the matter?"
Said the Little Fellow.
"I thought you were a chicken."
"Well, build up the fire", said Big Jim.
"What's the matter with you?"
Said the Little Fellow.
"Come, my pretty bird", said Big Jim.
"Don't be childish."
"Hey, quit it.
Don't be foolish, it's me!"
"You!" said Jim.
"I'm sorry. I must be crazy."
"You're telling me", said the Little Fellow.
"You go inside. I'll take the gun in case you lose it."
Chicken or no chicken, the Little Fellow looks appetizing to Big Jim.
Meanwhile Black Larson stumbled onto Big Jim's mountain of gold.
Then came the parting of the ways,
Big Jim to his mine, our hero to his fate.
"Goodbye", said the Little Fellow.
"It's been a great pleasure knowing you."
Treachery awaited Big Jim at his mountain of gold.
Big Jim looked deep into the eyes of Black Larson and saw there the soul of a skunk.
Caught in a maelstrom of desperate deeds,
Black Larson swept on to impending doom.
And out of a dream in that frozen waste, a city grew.
And humanity warmed it with living, loving and desiring.
Georgia.
Jack was a ladies' man.
Georgia was quick and impulsive, proud and independent.
In the evening Georgia worked as a dancehall girl.
Jack had lots of appeal for Georgia.
Perhaps that's why she resented him.
Out of the night came the Little Fellow, towards the dancehall, that beacon light of pleasure, that retreat of lost dreams.
"Georgia, why aren't you nice to Jack?"
"I believe he really likes you", said the girl.
"He likes everybody", said Georgia quite audibly.
"I'm bored with this place", she continued.
"I'd give it all up if I could find someone honest and worthwhile."
"Don't worry,
I'll find him someday."
Then she turned and looked and looked and looked.
"Kinda fresh, ain't ya?"
Thought Jack.
"Get down off that high horse."
"Me and you are gonna dance."
"Hey there, pan out a tune."
"Just a moment,
I said we're gonna dance."
"I beg your pardon", said Georgia.
To show her utter contempt for Jack, she picked out the most deplorable looking tramp in the dancehall.
"Hey you, come here."
"Yes, you. Do you want to dance?"
"You see, I'm very particular about whom I dance with."
And there he stood, the dauntless cavalier, guarding... her sanctuary.
"If you wanna make a hit with your lady friend",
"you should put your hat on straight, like this!"
"Take that you... Ouch!"
"Huh! Very good."
"Didn't know me own strength", said the Little Fellow.
Hank Curtis' cabin was a stone's throw from the dancehall.
Hank was a mining engineer who lived alone and occasionally went on long expeditions into the Far North.
Hank was kind and human, and our hero cold and hungry, and the beans smelled good and the coffee was steaming hot.
So the Little Fellow devised a way of getting breakfast.
Big Jim recovered from the blow he received from Black Larson but lost his memory.
Hank's partner arrives.
Both are ready to leave on a long expedition.
Hank informs his partner that the Little Fellow is to look after the cabin while he's away.
"Goodbye", said Hank.
"And don't forget to feed the mule."
Since that night in the dancehall the Little Fellow hadn't seen Georgia, but an incident was to bring them together again.
There she stood, her loveliness lighting the room, filling his soul with the music of romance for which he was so ill-fitted.
As she introduced her friends, his heart began to sing.
As they warmed up by the stove, he excused himself to get firewood.
And in that cabin his secret was revealed, his love for Georgia.
And the girls giggled and laughed, perhaps in order to hide their pity.
For in the world of the dancehall it wasn't wise for the girls to reveal their hearts.
And so they thought they'd have a little fun with him.
There in the gloaming they sat, their faces alight with mischief, but all the while his heart was singing.
And so she fooled and flirted and stroked his hair.
He knew she was fooling, but he was happy.
For she was near him, holding his hand, smiling at him.
"Nice place you have here", said Georgia.
"I hope you will invite us again."
What if she were fooling?
He was enjoying the warmth of her attention.
And the lady was enjoying the warmth of his chair.
And now she was leaving.
The light of her loveliness would be gone.
And he would be left with an emptiness, to return to his bleak, lonely existence.
"Pardon me", said the Little Fellow,
"But, uh..."
He was lost for words.
"Would you really like to come again?"
"Of course", said Georgia.
"What do you say, girls?"
"We'll come for dinner
New Year's Eve", said the ladies.
"Very well", said Georgia.
"We'll come to dinner
New Year's Eve."
Of course at that moment
Georgia would forget her gloves!
For the next few days the Little
Fellow hustled and shoveled in order to buy that New Year's dinner.
The eve of a new year.
New hopes and new dreams.
And there was Georgia, caressing him with her smiles and tender glances.
And the girls called for a speech.
But he was too happy to speak.
All that mattered was Georgia was there. Georgia!
So he muttered and stuttered and finally said,
"I can't make a speech but I'll do a dance."
And a dance he did, with the rolls.
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And days of auld lang syne
For auld lang syne
My dear
For auld lang...
In the midst of all their revelry the vague memory of a promise crept into Georgia's mind.
"Let's go up and visit the Little Fellow", she said.
"We'll have some fun with him", said Jack.
"We'll send Georgia in first, then give him a scare."
"Oh, forget it", said Jack.
"How about giving me a little attention?"
A day or so later in the Recorder's office,
Big Jim tried to convince the assayers that he had a mountain of gold.
"Where is this place?" they said.
But Big Jim's memory had failed him.
All he knew was that it was near the cabin.
"The cabin, that's it!"
"F I could find my way to the cabin
I could find the mine."
"But I can't remember."
"Hey!" said Jack,
"Georgia's been looking for you."
The Little Fellow knew otherwise.
How dare that cad mention her name so lightly?
For two pins he'd give him another thrashing.
However being a little underweight he would ignore the insult.
But it was true.
Georgia had been looking for him.
Georgia had written him a letter.
And as he went looking for Georgia, so Big Jim went looking for him.
"You, you!" said Big Jim.
"You! The very man
I've been looking for!"
"The cabin, the cabin! Where is it?"
"Answer me, I say!"
"Can't you speak, man? Tell me!"
"Where's the cabin? Where is it?"
"At last I shall find my mountain of gold."
"To your feet man, quick!"
"You're coming with me!"
"Take me to the cabin and I'll make you a millionaire!"
"Georgia! Just a moment", said the Little Fellow.
"Georgia, you don't have to explain.
I understand."
"I love you.
I'll take you away from this life."
"I'm going away, and when I return",
"I shall come back."
Exhausted and footweary, they arrived at the cabin.
"Ah!" said Big Jim,
"it won't be long now."
"Bring in the eats and tomorrow we'll start for the mine.
"Here, take a swig of this.
It'll put hair on your topcoat."
"My, this is a heavy lamb chop", said the Little fellow.
Then fate - it's always fate - played its little joke, and again the elements laughed, roared and thundered, but through it all our heroes soundly slumbered.
Then came the dawn.
The Little Fellow awoke, blissfully ignorant of what happened the night before, but feeling definitely conscious of "the morning after".
"Oh well, may as well tidy up and get breakfast."
"This is the worst liver attack
I've ever had."
"Feel that rocking?"
"It's the stomach."
"It's not the stomach."
"Let's go to the other side."
"We'll see how far it will go over."
"Something must be missing underneath."
"I'll go outside and see what it is."
"Now", said Big Jim,
"don't get excited."
"Take it easy, don't move, don't breathe!"
"I said don't breathe, stupid."
"You can be most annoying at times."
"If you'll only be cool, be calm", said Big Jim,
"We have nothing to worry about."
"Now show a little character!
Where's your willpower?"
"Now listen,
I've got a very good idea."
"Hold your hands like this, then I can get out first."
"You see what I mean?"
Said Big Jim.
"Your mind is chaotic.
You have no psychology."
"You have no control."
And Big Jim discovered his claim!
"Now we shall be rich", said Jim.
"We shall be millionaires!"
And so they were.
Now they were homeward bound and they were leaving the hardship and toil of Alaska to live in the land of milk and honey.
To live, laugh and indulge themselves in the lap of luxury.
They were famous, and sought after by the press.
In their cabin deluxe they were welcomed and waited upon.
The reporter wanted to write the Little Fellow's life story,
"From Rags to Riches", and he graciously consented.
And Big Jim was manicured.
"Not the nails", said he,
"the corns".
The reporter thought of a good idea, to have the Little Fellow pose in his mining clothes.
It would make a human story.
Georgia...
There she was in the steerage.
Neither knew of the other's presence.
Georgia overheard the officer say there was a stowaway aboard.
"You!" said Georgia.
"I thought I'd never see you again."
And then she mistook him for the stowaway.
The officer was going to put him in irons.
But Georgia pleaded for him and said she would pay his fare.
"Heck!" said the Captain.
"That's no stowaway."
"That's Big Jim's partner, the multimillionaire."
Then of course there were apologies.
The Little Fellow gathered himself together.
James, the valet, was told to prepare for an extra guest.
"Pardon me", said the reporter,
"but who's the lady?"
"Buzz buzz buzz!"
"Oh, you don't say!
Well, congratulations."
"This will make a great story, and with a happy ending."
And so it was.
A happy ending.

There it is, Herb.
One verse and two choruses.
- Is this a good song, Eddie?
- It's a good song, Herb.
- It's as good as the doll-dance number.
- All right.
Skip the verse, do the chorus, tempo.
Hot, eh?
- Good morning.
- Hello, Jimmy.
I've got the hottest song you ever heard in your life.
- Is that so?
- Yes, that's so.
Got it? Have you got it?
Jimmy, if you can get this crowd to keep quiet, I'll sing it for you.
- How about a little harmony?
- All right.
Listen, let's go through it.
One and two.
The second chorus, a little jazz, a little pep.
Come on, I'll vamp until ready.
Let's go.
Go on, Herb.
- That's it.
- The chorus in F-sharp.
Hot dog!
Listen, kid, if we can get that number, we're a cinch for the Palace.
- Hello, girls.
- Hello, Eddie.
Listen, Eddie, we'll take that song and smack it over for you.
Sure!
Oh, no. Not this song, babies.
Zanfield's bought it for his new revue.
And the Mahoney Sisters are coming from the West to put it over for me.
Listen, Eddie, you're not gonna waste a swell number like that...
...on a smalltime sister act, are you?
Nix cracking, Rosie.
Half of that sister team is going to be the future Mrs. Eddie Kearns.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Eddie.
If you wanna be made overnight, just give us a crack at that number.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
No, no. Positively not.
I've gotta get back to the hotel.
The girls are waiting for me.
Oh, but listen, if you want a song...
...see Georgie Cohan.
He writes good music too.
How about it, Jimmy?
Oh, I'll take that, thank you.
Gee, this is elegant, ain't it?
Tell you better when
I get a peek at the beds.
Quiet. I told you to pack that cooking outfit in the trunk.
Yeah? Well, I'm taking no chances.
If we can't pay our bill and the hotel holds the trunks, we still eat.
And, baby, when you don't eat, you lose a lot of calories.
Calories? What are they?
Oh, acrobats, you big sap.
- Well, I never got fat on your cooking.
- No?
You never got that complexion from the Greeks.
- Don't talk to me like...
- Ixnay, ixnay.
- Leave us plenty of towels too.
- I did.
And I counted them.
How high can you count?
Well, everything's okay.
Will there be anything else?
Yeah, food.
I think he may stall for a tip. Get to the window and give me the high sign.
Hank, I don't wanna do that.
Don't be such a cheapskate.
Screw.
Say, did they run out of everything but dollar signs on this thing?
One coffee, one order of fried eggs.
There's two in an order, ain't they?
- Yep.
- And one order of rolls.
- Hank.
- Yes?
Come look at the elegant view.
Oh, that will be all, thank you.
Cup of coffee, order of rolls, a couple of eggs.
It worked.
Oh, Queenie, New York.
The place we've dreamed and talked about.
- Ain't it swell?
- Yeah.
But there's something about it that scares me, Hank.
Scares you?
Well, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Well, it seems like we're taking an awful chance.
We were getting along so well out west.
Plenty of work, small jumps, a chance to save money.
And the act always went over big.
But here, nobody knows us.
Oh, I'm afraid.
Now don't lose your nerve, honey.
But we haven't got much money.
Oh, Hank, couldn't we go back, just for one more year?
Back to those opera houses and town halls?
Those cheap hotels and their lobby comics?
Cooking our own food...
...washing our own clothes and ironing them on mirrors.
Riding in those smelly day-coaches.
Going ragged all summer and then darn near freezing in the winter. And why?
Just to save money enough to get to New York and show our act.
Oh, honey.
With your looks and my ability...
I wouldn't steer you wrong.
Now don't worry.
You see that electric sign of the fellow in BVDs?
- Yeah.
- Well, right there...
...they're gonna have the Mahoney Sisters.
- In BVDs?
- Yes, in BVD...
Baby, they were plenty smart when they made you beautiful.
Come on, let's get cleaned up before Eddie gets here.
I'll run a tub for you.
The Mahoney Sisters in BVDs.
Hey, what are you singing?
The bubble song from Lux.
Will you join me?
No use of us both getting wet.
Will you wash mine?
I might as well. You never wash anything but your neck.
I not only wash them.
I gotta pick them up.
Oh, Hank, I didn't think.
Oh, you never do.
Oh, don't strain yourself.
I'll get them.
Oh, boy, this is going to be good.
Oh, I'll go.
Can you imagine my embarrassment?
Uncle Jed!
Hello, honey. How are you?
- Fine, and you?
- Great.
- Gee, I'm glad to see you, Hank.
- Oh, Queenie, hurry up. It's Uncle Jed!
Uncle Jed?
I'll be right out.
What a break for you.
- I'll be with you in just a minute.
- All right, honey, but hurry.
What do you know, Uncle Jed?
I've got you booked for 30 weeks over at the Manley Time.
Nothing doing.
We're in New York to stay.
Say, listen, girls...
...you know, I know this town better than you do. And there are more sisters...
...doing their acts over the lunch counters in New York than over the...
Than in the theaters.
You're just a crapehanger.
Maybe, but let me tell you...
...tell you, tell you, tell you...
What's the name of that record you're playing?
Say, listen, girls...
Yeah?
Well, what is it?
I love both you girls, and I want to see you get along.
Sure, Uncle Jed, we know that.
But we aren't leaving this town till we get a flash at Babe Ruth and Grant's Tomb.
- Oh, will you get that, Uncle Jed?
- You bet.
Oh, girls, your break... Your break...
Your coffee's here.
Bring the toothbrush glass when you come.
- All right.
- Will you have some coffee, Uncle Jed?
No, thanks. I just had my breakf...
I just ate.
- Yeah?
- Uncle Jed!
Queenie!
Gosh, what a big girl you are.
- And so beautiful.
- Ain't she, though?
Well, I suppose you've decided to stay in New York.
Yeah, we're all set.
But thanks for the offer, Uncle Jed.
That's all right.
I'll keep it open for a few days.
- All right.
- Goodbye.
- Oh, goodbye, Uncle Jed.
- If you wanna see me, just call me up.
Yeah, all right.
You're in the phone book?
You bet.
I think we're making an awful mistake not to take that work.
I know what I'm doing.
We stand as big a chance as anybody else.
What did the Duncans have when they hit Times Square?
"My Patio."
Say, we've got more than the Duncans ever had.
Well, the Duncans are pretty good too.
Say, what'd we do to them on the Gus Sun Time?
We knocked them off their seats.
Come in.
- Eddie!
- Hank!
Oh, baby.
Let me have a good look at you.
- Gee, but it's good to see you.
- Oh, boy, is it good to see you! Oh, gee!
That's my Queenie!
- Queenie? You don't mean to tell me it's...
- Sure.
Queenie, all grown up and everything.
Ain't she? That sisterly kiss won't be so hard to take now.
I'll say it won't.
- Take it big.
- I did.
You were a funny-looking thing the first time I saw you...
...with those gangly legs and freckles.
But you certainly turned out to be a beautiful girl.
Well, I'll go get some clothes on.
I'm just crazy about her, Eddie.
She's so young and beautiful.
Of course she is.
Well, Hank, now that you're here, when are we going to get married?
Oh, not till we've put this act over.
I'm gonna give Queenie a break.
Always doing something for somebody else.
No wonder I love you.
- I kind of got a weakness for you too.
- Yeah?
Mrs. Eddie Kearns?
Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?
Swell, Eddie.
Yeah, and you can feature that anytime in the electric lights.
- Gee, still the same sweet kid, ain't you?
- Why, certainly.
Hank, did you pack my new dress in the trunk?
I'll get it for you in a minute.
Come here, Queenie.
- Gee, I can't get over how she's changed.
- Well, you sure look elegant, Eddie.
- Doesn't he, Hank?
- He's an eyeful.
Three carats.
Platinum.
And here's the payoff.
Look, but don't laugh.
Gold garters!
Oh, Eddie, I always knew you'd make good.
Yeah, and I ain't forgetting that you're the little girl that made me come to New York.
Remember when I wanted to quit and give the whole thing up...
...and you made me stick it out?
Well, now I'm gonna do something for you.
Zanfield's bought my new song,
"The Broadway Melody."
And he's naming his revue after it.
- But I've already spoken to him about you.
- You think we've got a chance?
Chance? Don't be silly.
One word from me, and you're in.
- Queenie, ain't that great?
- Sure, if it's true.
True? You don't know how I stand with Zanfield.
- If we're in, what do we do?
- When do we start?
And how much do we get?
You're gonna sing my "Broadway Melody" with me.
The Mahoney Sisters and Eddie Kearns.
Yeah, Eddie Kearns and the Mahoney Sisters.
Well, how does it go?
How's it go? Now, listen, I sing a verse, and you come in on the chorus.
Then we do another chorus, and then go into a little dance.
- Give us an idea of the dance.
- I'll give you an idea.
- Good?
- Swell, Eddie, do it again.
Let's move back this table, kids.
We'll do our dance.
All ready, girls?
Come on, now, let's go.
There you are.
Queenie, why don't you look at my feet?
Look at her.
Attagirl!
You like that?
Don't do that.
Don't do that!
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute!
- What's the matter with the left leg?
- I've got a headache.
Go on, sit down, take a load off your mind.
- Don't talk to me like that. I don't feel well.
- Listen, don't answer me back, understand?
Come here.
There's Eddie. Hello, hey!
Your rhythm is all wrong.
Nothing like I showed you.
All right, now watch.
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, how are you?
We had a tough time getting in!
When do we show the act?
In a few minutes.
I haven't had a chance to talk to Zanfield yet.
- It's okay, ain't it?
- We're in?
Sure, it's in the bank.
- Whatever I say goes.
- Hey, Kearns!
Yes, sir?
We don't wanna take all afternoon to set one dance.
Yes, sir.
Maybe we'd better get undressed.
Come on.
All right, Sam, let it go.
- Oh, George.
- Wait a minute, hold it there. Hold it, Sam.
The sets are all ready for your okay, Mr. Zanfield.
That's just an idea of what it's gonna be.
I can see that. It's just an idea.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
But don't worry, I'll fix it.
- Okay on those sets.
- Yes, sir.
Remind me to see that rehearsal in the morning. Make a note of that.
I'm having lunch at the Knickerbocker.
Oh, Mr. Zanfield, this material, I couldn't get it in the gold design, only in the silver.
- Isn't it lovely?
- It's fine. Get it in the gold.
- Remember, I want that in the gold.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, Mr. Zanfield, pardon me, will you take a look at the Mahoney Sisters right now?
- The Maloney Sisters?
- No, the Mahoney Sisters.
- Who are they? I never heard of them.
- It's the sister act I told you about.
- Where are they?
- Right over there, across stage.
All right, wheel them in.
- Tell George I'll take a look at the act.
- Thanks, Mr. Zanfield.
Well, kids, you all set?
Got your music?
Well, go over there and tell him what you want.
The Baloney Sisters.
Give us the introduction pickup and some choruses. And swell to the finish.
- But you follow us.
- Yes, ma'am.
Sam, looks like some carnival lost a good act.
I'm gonna lay that dame like a roll of linoleum.
- Hank, you can't pull that around here.
- Hank, don't start anything now.
- Get her in the dressing room.
- Sure. Now, come on. Get together.
- All set now?
- Oh, wait a minute.
- Don't mind if I put this down?
- No, ma'am.
I'll vamp till ready, and don't forget:
We do things intimately.
- All set.
- All set, fine. Babies, smack it over big.
You ain't got nothing to worry about.
You're as good as in now.
- I'll go and see how the boss likes it.
- All right.
Well, all right, shoot.
- Play it, will you?
- Something wrong with the piano.
- Do I have to come over and play it for you?
- Okay, go ahead.
What's the matter with them?
There's something wrong with the piano.
- Say, are you trying to crab our act?
- No, I'm not.
- Well, will you play it then, hot or cold?
- Well, go ahead then.
All right. All right, girls.
Mr. Zanfield's seen enough.
He'll let you know. Come in next Friday.
- But he ain't seen the finish yet.
- Yes. I know, all right. Line up, girls.
Oh, Mr. Zanfield, please give them a break.
You haven't seen their act.
I saw enough.
I can use the blond, but that little cluck is out.
But don't you know it's tough to put comedy over on a bare stage?
They'll be all right at the performance.
Give them another chance.
I know, Eddie.
Gee, kid, that's a tough break. Even if the act is a louse, he should've seen the finish.
It ain't a louse. It's a good act.
We stopped the show every performance we did for Jake Wells.
Yeah, the one I saw would stop a tank.
Say, you've been asking for trouble, and now you're gonna get it.
You great big peroxide-headed dizzy blond, you! What do you think of this act?
Hey, come here! Come here, girls!
Come here!
Let me at her, will you?
Let me at her!
Next time I'll give you a facial instead of a scalp treatment.
- Yeah, and I'll fix you, you little peanut.
- Let go of me!
- Oh, boy, I'll sock her...
- Stop it, Hank, you're crabbing everything.
Go get your clothes on.
I'll fix everything.
The big blond baboon! Why'd she pick on me? I didn't start any fight with her.
- Where's my music?
- Here's your music.
- Well, where's my bag?
- Now, be quiet. Be quiet, Hank!
Get in there. Straighten it out.
Let's get smart, Sam. Where are you?
Don't let them throw you up in the air.
I'm not gonna waste all day at it.
Give me a pickup and two choruses.
And let me tell you dames something:
If I get ahold of her, I'll rip her wide open.
Flo, what was the trouble about?
- I was beside the piano, not doing a thing...
- Wait a minute.
- I can't stand for quarreling.
- I didn't start it.
Never mind who started it. Now run along and be a good little girl.
- Oh, all right.
- And remember, no more quarreling.
- Excuse me, Mr. Zanfield.
- Well?
I heard what you said about me.
Please, couldn't you use the both of us at the same salary?
I might.
I think I can slip her in somewhere.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Zanfield!
- All right.
My sister is the business manager of the act.
You won't let on that it ain't the both of us you want, will you?
Of course not.
- You send her over, and I'll talk to her.
- Oh, thank you!
All right.
Oh, Hank!
He can take his old show and put it where it'll do him the most good!
Don't act like that, Hank.
He didn't see your act, that's all.
- He's a very busy man.
- Oh, he's busy?
Well, so am I busy, with 30 weeks waiting for me.
- Now, don't get so excited over nothing.
- Hank, quick!
Mr. Zanfield wants to see you.
- Oh, yeah?
- On the level?
- Maybe we're in after all.
- Sure!
Let me handle this. I can always take care of these things better with nobody around.
I'll talk to him.
All right, girls, we'll take this right from the beginning. Okay, Sam, let it go.
I heard what you said to Zanny.
- You won't let on to Hank, will you, Eddie?
- Of course not.
Gee, that was wonderful of you,
Queenie.
I could kiss you for that.
You mustn't do that, Eddie.
I guess I shouldn't.
I never realized you were...
Gee, you're the sweetest little girl
I ever knew.
You mean next to Hank.
Yeah, sure.
You know, Hank's been everything in the world to me.
She's looked after me and worked for me, and fought for me, protected me.
I could never repay her for all her love and care.
Of course you love her, Queenie.
And you're gonna be everything that she wants you to be.
And I don't blame her for loving you.
Gee, but you're a cute kid.
And she loves you, Eddie.
I guess you and me are about all she ever thinks of.
Oh, I never wanna hurt her, Eddie.
And I want her to be happy with you.
Why, Queenie, I'd rather lose my pipes so I couldn't sing...
...and go lame so I couldn't dance than to hurt Hank.
- Sure you would. So would I.
- Can you imagine?
- We're in! Rehearsal in the morning!
- That's great!
- I knew you'd put it over, Hank!
- Oh, just leave it to me!
I ain't booked acts for 10 years and not know how to handle them!
- You bet you haven't!
- You're both swell kids!
- And plenty smart!
- And how!
- Gee, rehearsal in the morning! Ain't it great?
- Yeah!
Come on.
I got a lot of washing and ironing to do.
- You have?
- I want you to look your best, honey.
But tell me, how did you put it over?
What did you say to him?
I said to him, "Now, you listen here,
Mr. Zanfield, this is a sister team.
And we splits up for nobody!"
And with that, he smiled as nice as you please...
...and said, "That's all right, Miss Maloney."
Can you imagine calling me Maloney?
And everybody knows our name's Mahoney.
- Yeah, can you imagine that?
- Imagine that.
"Maloney"!
Hey, come on and get those clothes on, will you?
- Hurry up!
- Well, are we all set?
Yes, sir, everything ready to go when you say the word.
All right.
- Are you safe up there, Audrey?
- Okay.
Yes, that's perfectly safe.
- You get the orchestra in the pit.
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, Hagerty.
- Yes?
- That looks very good.
- I think it'll be very effective.
- So do I.
- Yes, sir.
Can you imagine? Putting on all this makeup for just one show a day?
Oh, dear! I'm just shaky all over.
Queenie, will you stop?
You're getting me nervous now.
It ain't a bit different than it was in Reading, PA.
And we're going over just as big.
- Oh, Hank, do you think so?
- Why, it's cream in the can, baby.
- Are you decent, girls?
- Yeah, come in.
Oh, Hank, get a load of this.
"Big mammoth appearance of the Mahoney Sisters on Broadway.
Zanfield saw them once, and they were in.
With appreciation and regards to our agent, Uncle Jed."
- Is that a pippin or not?
- You care for that?
- Do I?
- Hank, will you get Eddie out of here?
I'm nervous!
What's eating her?
Eddie, you gotta run along now.
We're nervous.
I get you.
Now, Queenie, don't be nervous.
- Remember, this is your big opportunity.
- Will you get out of here?
- Beat it, Eddie, will you?
- Now, don't forget, a lot depends on this.
- Oh, get out!
- Get out!
Stop, stop! Girls, girls!
- Be careful of my hats!
- We gotta get down on the stage!
I don't care!
I won't allow you to ruin them.
I told you they were too high and too wide.
Well, big woman, I design the costumes for the show...
...not the doors for the theater.
I know that. If you had, they'd have been done in lavender.
Pardon me, Mr. Zanfield, but the orchestra's killing my "Broadway Melody" number.
- Too much brass. They can't hear me.
- Kearns, tell them to keep it down.
Thanks, Mr. Zanfield.
- All right, boys, I think we can go.
- Yes, sir!
Hey, you!
When you get through with that noise, try and play my number.
Cut out the brass, and keep it very piano.
Are you back again?
Yes, and I'm telling you how I want my music played.
I've conducted opera.
What do you know about music?
- Nothing. I only wrote it, that's all.
- Then you have the best of me.
You don't have to listen.
I'll tell Zanny what a sap he was for buying it.
Maybe he'll get you to write the music for the show.
If I couldn't do better than this...
If you could, you wouldn't be waving a stick!
Electrician!
A little more this way with that spotlight.
What are you trying to do, ruin my profile?
Your profile was ruined the day you were born.
That's a smart crack.
Hit me with it and keep it here.
Hey, put that spotlight over here on this girl!
- He wants it over there.
- But it goes over here.
That spotlight goes here.
I can't sing without a spotlight.
Say, you couldn't sing if you had a searchlight.
- Did you get everything you wanted?
- Pardon me, Mr. Zanfield.
Would you okay this bill for Miss William's second act?
What's the idea? Two grand for a coat worn for less than three minutes? I won't pay it!
But you said ermine.
You'll giggle yourself right out of here one day.
Yes, sir.
- It's a gorgeous garment, isn't it?
- Isn't it gorgeous?
In fact, it's the gorgeous-est thing
I have ever seen. You sweet little cutie!
- There you are.
- Thank you, Mr. Zanfield.
- Come here, Unconscious.
- Hello, boys.
Say, Joe LeBlanc saw the rehearsal, and he says there's a fortune in the show.
- Yes, sir!
- We ought to know. We put it in.
- You think it's a good show then, Zanny?
- It's just an oil well.
- Let's see your gusher.
- Looks like a mine to me.
From all the gold-diggers you got in the troupe.
Any old time one of them can pry a nugget off of his ledge, they're going some!
Come on, Unconscious, put the load down.
Overture, girls.
This is the "Broadway Melody" number.
Get out of here and hurry up.
Come on. Come on. Get out of here.
Come on. Go on, get out.
Oh, there's the overture.
Oh, where's my hat?
Where's my hat?
Where's my hat?
Oh, where's my hat?!
- Over there!
- Over where?
- On the floor, under the clothes.
- Oh, yes. The clothes carton.
Why didn't you say so in the first place?
And make it snappy.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
Now, honey, remember:
The dress rehearsal is tougher...
...than a first-night performance.
So don't be nervous.
- I'm not nervous.
- Neither am I.
No, it's over that shoulder.
That's the idea.
More. With those beads.
That's it. That's better.
That's the idea. In this...
All right! Out of the way.
Clear the way.
Elgin, call a doctor.
Elgin! Call a doctor! Elgin!
What are we gonna do?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Hold it!
That number's too slow.
Cut out the Maloney Sisters.
- Cut out the whole first chorus?
- Yes.
Why, has he cut us out altogether?
Ain't it awful, the way they cut out these big stars?
I'll get to you in a minute.
Listen here, Mr. Zanfield, you can't cut us out like that.
We've got equity contract.
Kearns, go into the dance on the first chorus and end it there.
One more cut for you, dearie, and you'll be holding a spear.
And one more crack from you, bimbo, and you'll be holding a lily.
Listen to me, Mr. Zanfield, we...
Keep quiet. Will you cut it out and give me a chance to do my number?
But he cut us out of the whole show.
He can't do that.
Did you hear that, Mr. Zanfield?
They're trying to drown me out.
- Are you trying to drown him out?
- We're doing our best.
Mr. Zanfield, would you come backstage a moment? It's very important.
- All right.
- Yes, sir.
What's the trouble now?
The other dame flopped.
How about this one?
No, sir.
- Terrible.
- What are we gonna do about her?
There he is now.
I'm gonna give that guy an earful.
Where's that blond McGinty sister?
Use her.
Mahoney's the name, and let me tell you something...
Excuse me, Mr. Zanfield.
I'll get her up there.
You may not know it, but we've played some of the very best...
Listen, we want you on the prow of that boat.
Come on now.
Let's get your clothes off.
But I don't want to take my clothes off.
No, that'll be all right.
But listen to me. I've never taken my clothes off in my life.
I know all about that. Come on.
- How've you got this thing hooked?
- I don't know.
Over here.
Say, do I get that spot, or don't I?
That's tough. I missed him.
- How's everything going, Zanny?
- Very smoothly. Very, very smoothly.
- That's fine.
- Great.
Sit down with us.
Oh, Jules. Jules.
I like that number.
That's a very good arrangement.
How do you do it?
Where do you pick them?
I guess it's just a gift.
By the way, what's the name of that little beauty on the boat?
Ask her.
It'll give you something to do.
- That's a great idea.
- Come on, Unconscious.
Yes, sir.
- You were great, Mahoney.
- I'll say you were.
- You'll be in a Rolls-Royce by Thursday.
- Go on.
What a flock of Johns will be waiting at that stage door!
- Go on. You can't kid me.
- I'm not kidding you.
I may be there myself.
- Oh, Queenie.
- Go in and change.
Hank, did you see Queenie?
What's the matter, Hank?
Aren't you happy?
Wasn't Queenie great?
Aren't you proud of her?
Of course, Eddie.
I'm glad to see her make good.
Oh, but gee, we ain't never had to get by on our legs before.
Oh, that don't mean nothing, Hank.
Those guys are not gonna pay 10 bucks to look at your face.
This is Broadway.
Yeah. Broad's way.
Now, run along and change.
I'll get Queenie.
Attagirl.
Queenie, everybody is raving about you.
- Gee, but you're a beautiful kid.
- I'm glad you like me, Eddie.
Like you? Oh, boy. When I got a peek at you up there on that boat...
- Isn't this the beautiful lady of the boat?
- Yes.
- Kearns. They're waiting for you.
- Yes, sir.
- I'm Jock Warriner.
- How do you do?
- And this is Stew and Bay.
- How do you do?
I bet them that the most beautiful girl in New York will have supper with us.
- You've got to help me win that bet.
- What have I got to do with that?
- Well, you see, you're the girl.
- Oh, no, I'm not.
- I guess we win that bet, Jock.
- Now, wait a minute. Not yet.
- Hey, Unconscious, where you going?
- I'm gonna get on that boat.
Come here, sap. You can't get on that.
That's not a real boat.
Please.
Please, won't you change your mind?
- I'm sorry, but really, I can't.
- Oh, come on. Please do.
- No. Not tonight.
- No?
- Come on. Slip us the 50.
- Wait a minute. I haven't lost yet.
Oh, yeah...?
Come here, Unconscious, come here.
You can't go up there, you'll get kicked out.
It's a ladies' dressing room.
- Let's go on the boat.
- On the boat. Get out of here.
Don't worry, Hank.
They only cut one number.
We got a couple of others.
"Zanny saw them once, and they were in."
Zanny saw me once, and I was out.
Not altogether. And what of it?
Yeah, I know.
Do you think that's all I'll get to do, go on without any clothes on?
Not if I can help it.
But you don't need to worry.
You got a lot more on when you ain't got anything...
...than most of the dames
I've seen around here.
Well, I guess I'll go get undressed again.
Come in.
- Hello, kids. Are you all ready?
- Yep. All ready.
Well, listen. Zanny is giving a big party at his apartment tonight.
- Let's go over.
- Gee, that's great. Did he invite us?
Not exactly, but what's the difference?
Ain't I the star of this troupe?
That guy threw me out of your song tonight.
I ain't gonna give him a chance to throw me out of a window.
Let's get a bowl of chop suey, and we'll rewrite the show.
If it'll write me back in the show,
I'd go for a bowl of anything.
Well, you can get most anything out of a bowl of chop suey.
Oh, cutie!
Come on, Queenie.
You two run along.
I've got some things to do, and I'll join you later.
Why, what's the matter?
Well, I've...
I've got an awful headache.
I'm sorry, honey.
We'll go straight home if you'd rather.
Oh, no, Hank. You two run along.
You'll have a lot of fun, anyway.
Come on, Queenie.
We don't wanna go without you.
Get your hat. You'll feel better when you get out of here.
Oh, sure, honey, come on.
I can't go.
- You got a date with somebody, huh?
- Of course not.
- Who, Queenie? You're crazy.
- Crazy, am I?
You've got a date with that Jock Warriner, I'll bet.
- Well, and what if I have?
- Well, I don't like it.
Oh, you can't go out with that bird.
I'll have to show you whether I can or not.
Come in.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.
Well, here I am again.
You can't get rid of me.
- I'll be right with you, Mr. Warriner.
- All right.
Maybe you had better wait for me just a few minutes down on the stage.
- Shall I wait at the stage door?
- Please.
- Now, don't be long.
- No, I won't.
- Hurry.
- I will.
Now, Queenie, don't act this way.
He ain't the right kind of a guy for you to go out with.
What difference does it make what kind of a guy he is?
I'm going out with him because I...
Well, because I want to.
- Oh, no, you're not.
- Oh, yes, I am.
You're not! You're gonna listen to me.
I can take care of myself. And you can both mind your own business.
Why don't you mind your sister?
She knows best.
You keep out of this.
I've got my own life to live, and I'm gonna live it.
I'm not gonna be the third wheel to anybody's bicycle!
Oh, Queenie!
Oh, Eddie, what'll we do?
Why, she's never gone against my advice before.
Don't worry, Hank. She's only a kid.
She'll snap out of it.
I guess the bright lights got under her skin.
Come on, let's go and get a bowl of chili.
Queenie!
- Oh, you didn't go. You didn't go!
- I couldn't, Hank.
Oh, dear! I'm so glad.
Oh, they're elegant.
- Yeah. Where do I park them?
- Wait a minute. Put them over there.
Good morning, beautiful lady.
Oh, you frightened me.
Good morning.
- Oh, they're elegant. Thanks.
- Just a little birthday card.
Yes, well, they're lovely.
You'll excuse me now?
You have some place to go, haven't you?
Are you putting me out?
What's the matter?
Don't you like the flowers?
- Oh, they're beautiful.
- They're not half so beautiful as you.
Any girl that can look beautiful so early in the morning...
That sounds like you know a lot about girls.
I do. I'm an expert.
- Much obliged for the compliment.
- You're welcome.
Well, so long.
- Must I go?
- Please do.
- And thank you for being so nice to me.
- Not half so nice as I'd like to be.
I'm arranging a little party tonight for your birthday.
- A party for me?
- Yes.
Come in.
But you mustn't do that.
- But why not?
- Because I don't want you to.
That's silly. Everything's arranged.
You must come.
Please don't.
Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, Queenie.
- Oh, hello.
- How are you? Where's Hank?
- She's out.
Then I'm gonna wait right here till she gets back.
Well, it looks as if I'd better take the air.
I'll give you a ring a little later, shall I?
Fine.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
And thank you again for the flowers.
Well, I've got my suspicions about any guy that kisses a girl's hand.
- What do you mean?
- He'll give you a ring later.
He'll give you a ring.
On the telephone, but not here.
What are you burned up about?
- He hasn't done anything to you.
- No.
- And what's more, he ain't going to.
- Sit down and cool off.
Hank'll be here in a minute, and you can start raving to her.
Oh, Eddie, don't be such a crab.
Why do you let a guy like that hang around you?
Say, will you lay off him? I'm sick of hearing you crab all the time.
- I'll give him a sock in the nose.
- You and how many others?
I don't need any others.
I can do it all by myself.
What do you think of that?
I know. But you haven't anything to do in the show.
I can team you up with this blond and still book you as the Mahoney Sisters.
Nope. I've gotta stick around and keep an eye on Queenie.
Queenie? What has she been doing?
She's changed, Uncle Jed.
She don't tell me things anymore.
Night after night, she's out with Jock Warriner.
If it wasn't for Queenie,
I'd be the happiest girl in the world.
With Eddie?
Now, now listen, Hank.
Why don't you give Eddie a break and marry him?
- Maybe I will.
- Maybe.
Maybe that's just what Queenie needs:
- To see you and Eddie happy.
- Do you think so?
It's exactly what
I've been trying to... Sure!
- You see, it's very simple.
- Rolling his own.
That's it.
Now, watch this one.
Boy, if you could do that with my wife.
Say, give us something good, something new.
Say, can you pull a rabbit from that?
Hello, everybody.
- I brought the radio with me.
- Joe, what have you got there?
- Gee, I can get Chicago with that.
- Chicago? Why, that's nothing.
- I got Scotland last night.
- How do you know you got Scotland?
Why, I heard the guy singing
"The Best Things in Life Are Free."
Take this cake in the other room, and when you hear us yell "surprise"...
...bring it back lighted.
Now, don't forget.
Hey, give me a few of those things.
Give me a few of them.
Someone's coming. Are you all set?
Quiet, quiet.
Surprise!
Surprise! Surprise!
- Well, where's Queenie?
- Yeah, where's Queenie?
Why, there was another party, and I forgot to tell her about this one.
I thought she'd have more fun there.
I'm sorry.
Jock Warriner, huh.
Say, listen, I've got an idea.
Let's give the party...
Let's give the party...
- For Hank.
- Great!
Wait a minute, folks.
Just a second.
Take all the things down to my room.
We'll hold our party there.
Hank doesn't feel very well.
Well, all right, we'll go down to your room.
Good night. I hope you feel better.
Look, Hank, I'm awfully sorry.
- I'm sorry, Hank.
- I left a present for you.
- I hope you're feeling better, Hank.
- We'll see you tomorrow.
You see what you're missing?
Why don't you have a little drink?
It might buck you up.
- Good night, Hankie.
- Good night, Uncle Jed.
Good night, dear.
Hey, Eddie.
Ain't you coming down?
You run along, Jed.
I've got to tell Hank something.
- I'll see you in a little while.
- Sure.
But don't make it too long. You know that bottle won't last very long.
Queenie and me have always been on the level.
And now I'm fronting for her.
Won't you please give her all the best of the breaks?
What's the matter, Hank?
I lost something.
Oh, Eddie.
At least I've still got you.
That's one break.
Goodbye, baby.
Happy birthday.
Queenie, aren't you having a good time?
I'm having a marvelous time,
Mr. Warriner.
Now don't call me Mr. Warriner.
Call me Jock, won't you?
All right.
Mr. Warriner.
- Wait a minute, everybody. Queenie.
- Oh, I can't.
I want you to stand up here where everyone can see you.
- A toast!
- A toast to Queenie!
A happy birthday to Queenie, the queen of New York's beautiful girls.
- Many happy returns!
- Happy birthday!
I can't say anything but thanks, everybody. A lot.
Oh, it's a lovely surprise... Jock.
Oh, it's nothing at all.
Will you dance now?
That cake is just elegant...
...but I can't eat it all.
Well, you eat as much as you can, and we'll save the rest.
Please, Mr. Warriner, ask them to play something else.
- I hate sentimental music.
- All right.
"Broadway Melody."
Don't wear a frown on old Broadway.
Tell me...
...why don't you like that song?
I don't know.
Well, what do you like?
I like cake.
Won't you tell me that you like me a little?
Maybe.
You mean it?
Maybe.
Will you tell me why you're so nice to me?
Maybe.
Please, I wanna dance.
Oh, no, come on.
Let's sit this one out.
But look, everybody's dancing, and the music is playing and everything.
Mr. Warriner.
You don't mean this for me?
Why, of course.
Diamonds should only be worn by beautiful girls.
Oh, it's just adorable.
I'd like to do a lot of things for you, Queenie.
How would you like an apartment all your own?
Say, on Park Avenue.
And a car all your own.
Perhaps a Rolls-Royce.
Oh, and a lot of nice things.
Well, I'd have to think about that.
Say, where have you been?
I've been looking all over the place for you.
You would come in at a time like this.
Certainly. Come on, little love boat.
Let's have this dance.
- Were you asleep, Hank?
- No, honey.
Well, that's swell, because I wanna to tell you...
...about the grandest party that ever happened to me.
Look at that. Look at that. Did you ever see anything more beautiful in all your life?
No, sirree. Because that's class, that is.
And Eddie said he wouldn't even give me a ring.
What would I want with his ring?
There's more diamonds in a bracelet, ain't they? Ain't they?
Honey, I don't know what you're saying this for...
...but I know you don't mean it.
You can't mean it.
- It ain't in you to mean it.
- Sure I mean it.
Why shouldn't I mean it?
And that ain't all I'm gonna have, either.
I'm gonna have a Rolls-Royce.
And an apartment on Park Avenue.
And everything that goes with it.
That's what I'm gonna have.
Now, honey, listen to me.
I know we ain't had the greatest break in the world since we hit New York.
But that's gonna change.
That's got to.
And you're gonna meet somebody that's right.
Somebody you can be proud of, who'll just be crazy about you.
Somebody who's really worthy of you.
Somebody like Eddie.
Yeah? Well, that's all right for you...
...but I ain't craving any hall-rooms...
...with some song-and-dance guy...
...who expects me to cook his meals over a gas-jet...
...listen to a lot of smart wisecracks and bum songs.
- No, sir.
- Oh, Queenie.
Move over.
No more of these kind of dumps for mine.
I'm gonna have everything in the world I want.
That's me.
And you're gonna have Eddie.
Queenie, I don't want you to answer me like that again.
- Then keep your nose out of my business.
- Well, your business is my business.
That package is from Warriner, ain't it?
- What if it is?
- I won't let you keep it, that's all.
How are you gonna stop me?
Oh, Queenie, don't you see what
I'm doing is for your own good?
And don't you see what I'm doing is for your...
Oh, what are you talking about?
Now you listen to me.
You're not gonna go out with that guy, hear me?
I'll stop you if I have to tie you up to do it. You hear me?
Cut it out. Be quiet.
They can hear you out front.
Well, you hear me. I'm going out with whoever I want...
...and I won't hear orders from anyone about it.
- Now get that and get it straight.
- Queenie!
You ain't my boss. So mind your own business and shut up.
Oh, Queenie.
I won't shut up.
And you're gonna listen to me.
I won't listen to you any more than
I will to her. So you needn't get started.
- Getting near you, Kearns.
- All right.
Hank, you run along. I'll talk to her.
Now, listen, Queenie. You're young yet, and you don't know things.
What Hank has been saying to you is for your own good.
Yeah, and I suppose what you're saying is for my own good too.
As far as that goes, yes, it is.
Whether you believe me or not,
I'm saying this because I...
- Hank finished that. Got nowhere with it.
- Well, I'm gonna get somewhere.
And whether you like me or hate me, you're gonna pay attention to me...
...because I'm...
Well...
Me and Hank won't let you go out with that guy. He's no good.
- He wants girls who...
- You never went out with girls...
...like he does.
- Plenty, but none since I met you.
You and Hank...
Get me right, sweetie.
I'm being on the level with you.
Here's your pants, sir.
- Hurry up, Kearns.
- All right.
Oh, can't I say nothing that will make you see what I mean?
You're wasting time talking against
Mr. Warriner, if that's what you mean.
Mr. Warriner. Do you know what they say about that guy?
I don't care what they say.
They're jealous, that's all.
- You and the rest.
- Me, jealous?
What are you so interested for?
What business is it of yours where I go and who I go with?
It's my business because...
Well, because it is.
Oh, you ought to know why I'm doing this.
- It's because I...
- No, no, Eddie. Don't say it.
Oh, I gotta say it, Queenie.
I can't stop from saying it now.
And you gotta hear it.
I love you, Queenie.
I love you, and you know it.
I can't help it. I tried, but I can't.
But it's easy to say now.
I love you, dear.
And I love you, Eddie. Never forget it.
- No matter what happens.
- Do you, Queenie?
Yes, Eddie.
And that's why we can't...
Oh, don't you see now why...
Why what?
- I'm going out with Jock Warriner...
- No, you're not.
Don't try to stop me, Eddie.
It's the best way.
Here's your coat, sir.
- If you go out with that guy, I'll...
- There's a stage wait, Kearns.
Let it wait.
Queenie, I gotta go on now.
- Promise me you won't go out with him.
- Are you trying to ruin the show?
- Promise me, Queenie.
- Oh, I can't promise.
- Then you won't?
- Well, then I won't.
I'll murder that guy. I'll tear him apart.
Go on out with him. Go ahead.
Get on there, Kearns.
Queenie, you better be here when I get off.
- Get up to your dressing room.
- All right.
Oh, Queenie. You ain't got no idea what you're doing.
Oh, yes, I have. Can't I have a little fun without you trying to stop me?
Oh, I ain't trying to stop you having fun...
...but this thing will turn out bad.
That guy don't mean to marry you.
His kind don't never marry.
He ain't the type to take a girl out and buy her drinks...
...and let it go at that. You know that.
And you know what the finish will be.
Now listen to me, Hank.
Get this straight, once and for all.
I'm old enough to know what I'm gonna do.
And I don't want no more cracks from you and Mr. Wise-Guy Kearns about it either.
You can go your way, and I'll go mine.
What I'm saying's for your own good.
- Tell it to somebody you don't know.
- I ain't gonna let you get away with it.
- Give me that. That's mine.
- It's not yours...
- Well, it is mine, and you will give it...
- No, I won't.
You will give it to me.
Queenie.
Queenie, you mustn't go.
Queenie, you can't go.
Eddie, stop her.
Do something, will you?
- Queenie, just a moment, Queenie.
- Get your hands off me.
You're not gonna leave except with me and Hank.
- You get out of my way.
- You heard what I said.
You can't get away with it.
I'll kill that guy just as sure as anything.
I'll make him suffer the way he's making me suffer.
Shut up!
- I'm going.
- You can't go, Queenie.
Gonna stay right here. No.
Let go of me.
I've heard all I'm gonna hear from either of you. You've said enough.
- I'd like to see you kill anybody.
- Queenie.
You dirty, cheap little songwriter, you.
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!
Queenie, Queenie!
- Say, what kind of a sap are you, anyway?
- What do you mean?
You gonna let a john like that steal her from you because he's got a little more jack?
Well, if you do, all I can say is you're a rotten quitter.
You love her, don't you?
Oh, don't lie to me. I know you do.
Say, if I loved a girl like you do Queenie...
...l'd fight for her. What's the matter with you? Where's your nerve?
- But, Hank, you don't...
- Oh, don't pass the buck to me.
What do you think I've been meaning all along? I was on the level with this thing?
That I was in love with you?
That's a hot one.
I just been playing you for all
I could get out of you for the act.
- You been kidding me all the time?
- Sure, I been kidding you.
Say, I wouldn't marry you if you was the last man on earth.
And at that, I ain't so sure you're the right guy for her.
You're a coward.
You're afraid of Jock Warriner, or you'd go out and fight for her.
- But you're just yellow.
- You think I'm yellow?
- Sure, you're yellow.
- I'll show you how much I'm yellow.
You're yellow. You hear me?
You're yellow.
- I'm yellow?
- Yes, you are. You're yellow!
You're yellow. Do you hear me?
Oh, Eddie, you're not yellow.
You're white.
Murray Hill-8400. Yes, please.
Hello.
Hello, Uncle Jed?
It's Hank.
Say, I've decided to take those 30 weeks.
You can team me up with that blond.
I'm breathless.
Oh, I don't know what to say.
It's wonderful.
Oh, I can't thank you enough.
It's not half good enough for you.
I want you to have everything in the world.
Thank you.
- Hello, Eddie.
- Where's Queenie?
I want you to meet my girlfriend.
- Come on, let's go back to the party.
- Oh, Queenie, not yet.
Why, I haven't had you to myself for a moment tonight.
Oh, but I'd rather go back, please.
Wait, Queenie.
I have so many things
I want to tell you alone.
Oh, well, you can tell me out there.
Wait a minute, Queenie.
I've done all these things for you.
Aren't you going to be nice to me?
- Oh, Jock, let me go.
- Why should I let you go?
- Please let me go, please.
- No, I won't let you go.
You're going to stay right here with me.
- No, I'm not gonna stay here with you.
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.
- I will keep you here.
You won't keep me here, do you hear me? You won't.
- Let me go.
- I won't let you go.
I won't stay with you another minute.
- Let me go.
- I told you not to come here.
- Why did you come?
- Oh, Eddie, take me away.
What do you mean coming in here? Get out.
- I won't before I'm finished with you.
- Oh, Eddie, let's go.
- I've been looking for you.
- Now that you've found me...
...what do you want?
- I'll show you what I want.
Oh, Eddie.
What's the matter?
Oh, darling, let me see you.
Oh, Eddie. Have they hurt you, sweetheart?
Have they?
You just hit him again if you dare.
Just try it, that's all.
- Eddie, let me see you.
- Queenie, Queenie.
You don't realize what you're doing.
You let me go. And you can take your jewelry and your presents...
...and everything. I don't want anything to do with you.
Let me get a sock at that guy.
- No, Eddie don't...
- Let me get at him, just let me get at him.
- I wanna get at that guy.
- Throw him out.
- Out he goes.
- No, don't.
Don't let them. They're going to kill him.
Oh, Eddie. Don't you do that to him.
And stay out.
What do you know about that guy?
Got rid of that guy anyhow.
Oh, Eddie. Eddie, dear.
You dirty bums, you.
- Oh, Eddie, have they hurt you?
- What do you think?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I'll bet you are.
I am.
I don't know why you feel sorry for anybody like me.
I'm no good.
I can't even scrap a little.
I let a heel like that take a sock at me and get away with it.
Well, Eddie, he's bigger than you are.
- Yeah, a little bigger.
- And he's awfully strong.
I suppose you found that out from his hugs.
Well, if you couldn't stop them from throwing you out...
...how could I stop him from hugging me?
Well, there's something in that.
I guess you'd better go home.
Oh, Eddie, aren't you gonna take me home?
- I'll take you home.
- Don't you like me anymore?
Like you? Why, Queenie, I...
Oh, what is it? They've hurt you, I know they have.
Oh, I'm all right, Queenie.
Come on, let's go.
Now understand, it took six of them to throw me out.
Yes, Eddie.
Oh, what is it?
Oh, they'll be here any minute.
What does it...? What does it...?
Read it.
"Arriving 2:30, wonderful honeymoon.
See you the minute we get in.
Love to our Hank, Queenie and Eddie."
Oh, I'm so excited. What time is it?
- 12:00 last night.
- It's what?
Well, what's the matter with this thing?
See who that is.
- Hello, Jed.
- Hank!
Oh, gee.
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, Hank.
Oh, come here.
Well, well, Queenie. Congratu...
- How are you?
- Oh, fine, Uncle Jed. How are you?
Oh, I'm great. What's it going to be in the electric lights this time?
Queenie Kearns and Company?
No, sirree.
I'm only gonna be connected with the stage by marriage.
Oh, Hank, we found the cutest little home down on Long Island.
- Yeah?
- Where Eddie can work.
And say, when you're finished with this tour, you're coming to live with us.
Oh, nothing doing. Hotels for mine, where I can get service.
- I'd be all out of step in a real home.
- What do you mean?
- You're coming to live with us, all right.
- I should say she is.
Just like a trouper.
Troupers are all tramps.
Here today and gone tomorrow.
No home, no nothing.
Hank, you're just a born trouper.
Doggone this weather. It certainly is tough on colds, isn't it?
Well, say, I want Queenie and Eddie to see the act.
Say, where is that blond, anyway?
I don't know. She's always late.
Hank, you're a sight for sore eyes.
- Hello, Uncle Jed.
- Oh, hello, Flo.
- You know everybody, don't you?
- Hello, darling.
- Oh, Eddie.
- Hello, Flo.
Oh, Eddie, tell me, did you have a good time on your honeymoon?
Yeah, great.
Oh, Eddie, when you open your new show...
...gonna give me a job, aren't you?
- Why, certainly.
Oh, you're grand.
Say, come on, stupid.
Let's run through the act for them.
Okay.
But, say, you know something?
She's a born trouper.
We're gonna break in the act and bring it to New York.
- That's great.
- Say, step on it, will you?
- I've got a matinee.
- Sure.
I want two choruses...
...and you follow us, not us you.
- Come on, Flo.
Say, listen. There's gonna be no part in your show for that dame, get me?
Of course not, honey.
It's kind of rough yet, but don't you say it's pretty good for an opening?
You know, if you don't hurry, you're gonna miss that train.
- Oh, the train.
- Sure, the train.
Oh, Hank. Hank, can I help you?
Yes, you could hold my coat for me.
I forgot all about the thing.
Oh, Hank.
That's all right, Queenie.
- Goodbye, Eddie.
- Goodbye, Hank.
Oh, you'll write to me soon, won't you?
Yeah, I'll write you from Peoria.
Now, where's my hat? Where's my hat?
- Oh, where's my hat!
- Here's your hat.
Here. Here. Here's your valise.
- All right. Bring it, Uncle Jed. Come on.
- It's pretty heavy.
- Goodbye, Hank.
- Goodbye, Hank.
- Goodbye, Hank.
- Don't forget to write. Goodbye.
Oh, don't cry, dear.
Hank won't be gone long.
The season will be over before you know it, and she'll be back here with us.
It ain't that, honey.
But it seems like Hank ain't never had a real break.
And I guess I haven't done much to make her any happier.
I wouldn't feel that way about it, dear.
Hank'll be much happier back on the road.
Why, she couldn't give it up.
It's her life.
She couldn't live without it.
And now that she knows you're taken care of...
Don't cry, honey.
People can't help falling in love.
It comes to you no matter what you do.
And I love you, dear.
Oh, and I love you, Eddie.
You were just meant for me.
Opening in Peoria.
Four shows a day.
Zanny said he'd make me a star in six months.
Say, listen, it's better to star in...
In Oshkosh than to starve on Broadway.
That's a bunk.
Say, now you listen to me, stupid. I'll handle things.
Yes, and I'll have you back on Broadway and in the Palace in less than six months.
- No fooling?
- Why, it's cream in the can, baby.
Sure, it's...
It's... It's in the can.

Part one.
"MEN AND MAGGOTS."
The spirit of revolution soared over the Russian land.
A tremendous, mysterious process was taking place in countless hearts.
The individual personality, having hardly had time to become conscious of itself... dissolved in the mass, and the mass itself became dissolved in the revolutionary √©lan.
Sailors Matyushenko and Vakulinchuk.
We, the sailors of Potemkin, must support the workers, our brothers... and stand among the front lines of the revolution!
Heavy and gloomy is the sleep of the off duty.
Attentive, but clumsy.
He vents his anger on a young man.
Hurtful...
Vakulinchuk 
Comrades! The time has come when we too must speak out.
Why wait? All of Russia has risen!
Are we to be the last?
Morning.
We've had enough rotten meat!
Even a dog wouldn't eat this!
The ship doctor Smirnov.
It could crawl overboard on its own!
These aren't worms.
They are dead fly larvae.
You can wash them off with brine!
Russian prisoners in Japan are fed better than we are!
We've had enough rotten meat!
It's good meat. End of discussion!
Senior Officer Giliarovsky
Impotent rage was overflowing.
The ship's store.
The sailors refused to eat the borscht.
GIVE US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD
Part two.
"DRAMA ON THE DECK."
Commander Golikov
Whoever is satisfied with the borscht take two steps forward!
The petty officers.
You're free to go!
I'll hang the rest on the yard!
Call the guards!
Matyushenko, under the guise of breaking ranks, calls the sailors to the gun turret.
To the turret...
To the turret!
To the turret...
Guys!...
It's time.
Most of them gathered by the turret.
Stop! Don't move!
They try to sneak through the admiral's hatch.
Back, scoundrels!
That way is not for you!
I'll shoot you all like dogs!
Cover them with canvas!
Got it!
Cover them!
Attention!
Dear Lord!
Make the disobedient see reason!
Fire right into the canvas!
Vakulinchuk decides.
Fire!
BROTHERS!
Who are you shooting at?!
The rifles quavered.
Shoot!
Everyone shoot!
Shoot, scum!
To the rifles, brothers!
Smash the dragons! Smash 'em!
Smash 'em all!
Have fear of God!
Beat it, sorcerer!
To the bottom to feed the worms!
Brothers! We've won!
The bleeding Vakulinchuk flees from the furious Giliarovsky.
Vakulinchuk's overboard!
Save Vakulinchuk!
And he who was first to sound the cry of rebellion was first to fall at the executioner's hand.
To the shore.
Odessa.
A tent on the new pier in Odessa is the final resting place for Vakulinchuk.
FOR A SPOONFUL OF BORSCHT
Part three.
"THE DEAD MAN CALLS OUT."
Mist lingered on from the night...
Rumours came from the pier.
Together with the sun, the news hit the city.
The battleship raided...
...rebellion...
...shore...
A killed sailor...
We'll remember.
For a spoonful of borscht.
"Citizens of Odessa! Lying before you is the body of the brutally killed sailor Grigory Vakulinchuk... killed by a senior officer of the squadron battleship Prince Tavrichesky.
Let's take revenge on the bloodthirsty vampires!
Death to the oppressors!
Signed: Crew of the squadron battleship 
Prince Tavrichesky."
Eternal memory to the fallen fighters!
All for one.
One for all.
Down with the executioners!
Down with tyranny!
Mothers and brothers!
Let there not be differences or hostility among us!
Smash the Jews!
Shoulder to shoulder.
The land is ours.
Tomorrow is ours.
A delegate from shore.
The enemy must be dealt a decisive blow!
Together with the rebelling workers from all of Russia
WE WILL WIN!
The shore watched Potemkin tensely and attentively.
Part four.
"THE ODESSA STAIRCASE."
In those memorable days, the city lived together with the rebellious battleship.
Like a white-winged flock, boats flew to the battleship.
AND SUDDENLY
Let's go! Let's convince them!
Listen! Don't shoot!
My boy is badly hurt.
COSSACKS!
And then the brutality of the military authorities in Odessa was answered with the battleship's shells.
The target - the Odessa theater.
The generals' headquarters.
Part five.
"RENDEZVOUS WITH THE SQUADRON."
Turbulent meetings went on until evening.
The people of Odessa are waiting for the liberators!
Land the troops and the army will join you.
Landing is not possible.
The admiral's squadron is coming our way.
With one heart, they decided to face the squadron.
Night came, full of anxiety.
The squadron was sneaking up in the darkness.
Sore from constant speech, throats breathe heavily and unevenly.
Squadron on the horizon!
All hands on deck!
Prepare for battle!
Full speed!
Hearts forward!
Top speed!
Potemkin and destroyer No. 267.
The admiral attacks!
The squadron draws near!
Give the signal: join us!
Join!...
...us!
The enemy is within firing range!
All against one.
ONE AGAINST ALL.
Shoot?... or...
BROTHERS!
Above the heads of the tsar's admirals thundered a brotherly hurrah.
And proudly waving the red flag of victory, without a single shot, the rebellious battleship passed through the rows of the squadron.

THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC
A film by Carl Th. Dreyer
At the Bibliotheque de la
Chambre des Deputes in Paris resides one of the most extraordinary documents in the history of the world: the record of the trial of
Joan of Arc, the trial that ended in her death.
The questions of the judges and Joan's responses were recorded exactly.
Reading it, we discover the real Joan... not in armor, but simple and human... a young woman who died for her country... and we are witness to an amazing drama: a young, pious woman confronted by a group of orthodox theologians and powerful judges.
I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth... nothing but the truth...
In France I'm called Joan... in my village,
I'm called Jeannette.
How old are you?
Nineteen...I think.
Do you know the Lord's Prayer?
Who taught it to you?
My mother.
Will you recite it?
You claim to be sent by God?
To save France... it's why I was born.
So you think God hates the English?
I don't know if God loves or hates the English... but I do know that the English will all be chased from France... except those that die here!
You have said that St. Michael appeared to you...in what form?
Did he have wings?
Did he wear a crown?
How was he dressed?
How did you know if it was a man or a woman?
Was he naked?
Do you think God was unable to clothe him?
Did he have long hair?
Why would he have cut it?
Why do you wear men's clothing?
If we give you women's clothing, would you wear it?
When the mission that God has entrusted to me is over...
I will again dress as a woman.
So it is God who orders you to dress as a man?
And what reward do you expect from God?
The salvation of my soul.
You blaspheme God.
This is disgraceful.
For me, she is a saint.
Has God made you promises?
That has nothing to do with this trial.
Shouldn't we let the judges decide that?
Shall we put this question to a vote?
So! What has God promised you?
Perhaps that you will be delivered from prison?
When?
I know neither the day... nor the hour.
Since she couldn't be made to confess easily... we will have to be clever...
Go find a letter bearing the signature of King Charles.
I will dictate a letter.
I have great sympathy for you!
Do you know the signature of your King?
I have a letter from him for you.
I can't read.
To our beloved Joan...
I am preparing to march on Rouen with a mighty army.
I send you this devoted priest.
Have confidence in him.
Just as Jesus is the son of God... you claim to be the daughter of God?
Will you recite the
Lord's Prayer?
God has told you that you shall be delivered from prison?
By a great victory!
God has promised you that you will go to Heaven?
So you are certain of being saved?
Be careful, it's a dangerous answer.
Since you are sure of your salvation... you have no need of the Church?
Are you in a state of grace?
Respond!
Are you in a state of grace?
If I am, may God keep me there.
If I am not, may God grant it to me!
Father... permit me to attend Mass.
Joan, if we permit you to attend Mass... will you stop wearing men's clothes?
So, you would rather dress as a man than attend Mass?
These shameless clothes... abominable to God...
You are no daughter of God...
You are Satan's creature!
Go prepare the torture chamber.
She really looks like a daughter of God, eh?
The torture chamber.
Regard your judges.
Do you not feel that these learned doctors are wiser than you?
But God is even wiser!
Listen, Joan, we know that your visions do not come from God... but from the devil.
How do you know a good angel from an evil angel?
You have knelt before Satan, not St. Michael!
Don't you see that it's the Devil who has turned your head... who has tricked you... and betrayed you?
I think she's ready to abjure!
The Church opens its arms to you... but if you reject it, the Church will abandon you... and you will be alone... alone!
Yes, alone... alone, with God!
Even if you part my soul from my body...
I will confess nothing...
And if I do confess, later I will say it was forced from me!
Not for anything in the world do I want her to die a natural death.
She is very weak.
She has a fever... we must bleed her.
Be careful, she could end her own life... she's very crafty.
Bring the Sacraments.
Is there something you wish to tell us?
I fear that I am about to die... and if I do, I ask you to bury me in sacred ground.
The Church is merciful...
It always welcomes the misguided lamb.
Joan, we all want what's best for you.
Look, I have sent for the Sacraments.
I am a good Christian.
Do you not know it is the
Body of Christ you refuse?
Do you not see that you outrage God by your obstinacy?
I love and honor God... with all my heart.
You claim...that I am... sent by the devil.
It's not true... to make me suffer, the devil has sent you... and you... and you... and you...
There is nothing left to be done... alert the executioner!
Let us try one last time to save this lost soul...
It is to you, Joan, that I speak.
It is to you that I say your King is a heretic!
My King is the most noble
Christian of all.
The arrogance of this woman is insane.
France has never seen such a monster...
I have never wronged anyone.
If you do not sign, you will be burned alive...
The stake awaits you...
You don't have the right to die.
Your King still needs you.
Joan, sign... and save your life!
Joan, we have great sympathy for you.
Sign, Joan!
In the name of the Lord. Amen.
Having recognized your errors, you shall not be excommunicated.
But as you have greatly sinned, we condemn you... to perpetual imprisonment, to eat the bread of sorrow and drink the water of anguish.
A good day's work: you have saved your life and your soul.
She has only made fools of you!
Long live Joan!
Go find the judges!
I take it back, I have lied...
Hurry!
I have committed a great sin...
I have denied God... to save my life.
But Joan, you have confessed before everyone that the devil misled you.
You still believe you were sent by God?
Her answer will bring her death.
Everything I said was for fear of the stake.
Have you anything else to tell us?
We have come to prepare you for death.
Now...already?
How am I to die?
At the stake.
I'll bring the last Sacrament.
How can you still believe that you are sent by God?
His ways are not our ways.
Yes, I am His child.
And the great victory?
...my martyrdom!
...and your deliverance?
...death!
Will you take confession?
May the Body of Our Lord
Jesus Christ keep my soul... unto life everlasting. Amen.
Be courageous, Joan.
Your last hour approaches.
Dear God, I accept my death gladly... but do not let me suffer too long.
Will I be with You tonight in Paradise?
Jesus!
You have burned a saint!
The flames sheltered
Joan's soul... as it rose to heaven -
Joan whose heart has become the heart of France...
Joan, whose memory will always be cherished... by the people of France.
WAY DOWN EAST
A Simple Story of Plain People.
Since the beginning of time man has been polygamous
- even the saints of Biblical history - but the son of
Man gave a new thought. and the world is growing nearer the true ideal. He gave of One Man for One
Woman.
Not by laws - our Statures are now overburdened by ignored laws - but within the heart of man, the truth must bloom that his greatest happiness lies in his purity and constancy.
Today Woman brought up grom childhood to expect
ONE CONSTANT MATE possibly suffers more than at any point in the history of mankind, because not yet has the man-animal reached this high standard
- except perhaps in theory.
If there is anything in this story that brings home to men the suffering caused by our selfishness, perhaps it will not be in vain.
Time and place - in the story world of make-believe,
Characters; Incidents - never occurred-yet always happening.
Let us suppose a remote village in New England.
Ana Moore and her mother.
We call her "Anna" - we might have called her
"Woman" - for is not herw the story -
Sore need of money drives the mother to appeal to the
Tremonts, their rich relatives in Boston.
Oh Mother, I hate to ask them for money.
So, through the troubled twilight...
All right Mother, I'll go.
THE DEPARTURE
Tell Cousin Emma I made this hug-me-tight my own hands.
The fashion paper says these gloves are style in the city.
An errand undertaken with the tremulous footsteps that ever mark the trail of the
"poor relation"
Her cousins, the Tremonts, were giving a bridge whist party the afternoon of
Anna's arrival.
Cousin Emma Tremon
Herself.
Diana Tremont, her daughter.
An occasional interloper in
Society - The dashing
Lennox Sanderson, who depends go his living upon a rich father.
He has three specialties:
Women! Women! And
WOMEN.
There is a young person - says she's your Cousin
Anna Moore - from
Greenville.
My dear child! Whatever brought you here?
Well, you see, things haven‚Äôt been going very well - and we wanted to ask you - if -
Courage failing, she changes the subject to the hug-me-tight.
I beg your pardon.
Mrs. Tremont imparts the embarrassing news of the country cousin's arrival to her daughters.
Well, get rid of her.
But to impress their eccentric, but enormously rich aunt, the sisters pretend to be nice to Anna.
I knew you both from your pictures.
Yes, I expect to stay quite a time - that is, if we suit each other.
CHAPTER II
Near the country estate of then Santerson family is
Bartlett Village.
Also the home of Squire
Bartlett, the richest farmer in the neighborhood.
The clock hand points to blossoms - and awakening.
David Bartlett though of plain stock, haw been tutored by poets and visions as the world.
Squire Bartlett, a stern old puritan, who lives according to his awn con- seption of the Scriptures, particularly the "Thou
Shalt Nots".
Mrs. Barlett, whose gentle soul is as sweet as her beloved Scriptures.
Day dreams of twenty-one.
The great Tremont ball - the climax of the social season.
Anna's dress that she and her mother had made in case she should go out in
Society.
It's quite all right - and from the balcony you can see uis dancing.
Solely to pique the sisters of whom she is not over-fond, the aunt makes different arrangements for Anna.
Oh, Aunty! - This dress
- where‚Äôs the top?
Beneath the alcove lights' golden glow.
Anna's delicate beauty a whip to Sanderson's laded appetite.
In your beauty lives again
Elaine, the lily maid, love dreaming at Astolat.
Tell me more.
Cousin Emma hurries Anna off to bed - perhaps in fear of her own daughters being outshone.
The susceptible Sanderson, obsesed by a new desire.
Sanderson, after managing several meetings, finally lures Anna to the apartment to meet a mythical aunt.
Wait - I'll call Aunty.
Strange, she isn't here.
Just five minutes! She'll be back any time.
If she doesn't come in five minutes - I must go.
You don't understand...
I mean... I want you to... to marry me.
Anna's inexperienced heart caught in a tide of infatuation.
Oh, I' m just going to tell everybody.
But Sanderson, dreading to cross the wishes of his rich father, upon whom he is de- pendent, persuades Anna to promise secrecy.
Sanderson belongs to a class which, if it cannot get what is wants in one way, it will go to any length to get it in another.
Evil plans.
Passion's urge knows no conscience and various its ways to betrayal.
Sanderson induces Anna to marry secretly before going home.
Far away it happens that
David Bartlett is dreaming a troubled dream.
Don't worry... everything's all right. Don't you trust me?
So... it is done.
The bridal suite at
Rose Tree Inn.
To her it is the fulfillment of the dreams of girlhood
- to him but another adventure.
Here conscience knocks at the door... perhaps the slightest interruptions might still avert this tragedy, but...
My... my husband!
The afternoon the Bartlett post office was robbed.
The dread minion of the
Law - Rube Whipple,
Constable.
Seth Holcomb waiting for
Martha Perkins, whom he has been following around for twenty years.
Seth takes his liquor under tha name of
"Long Life Bitters".
Martha Perkins, a relic, nobody needs newspaper when she is around.
The Constable on the man hunt.
Napoleon, his fiery steed.
Napoleon refuses to climb the hill.
The temptation of
Napoleon.
These men! I just can't keep tem from following me.
Great news! Post office bin robbed! Dollar eighty-two cents in postage stamps, eighteen postal cards!
Heavy loss to the government.
I'll 'low bno man to laugh at the law, Seth Holcomb.
The both win.
Charter IV.
One day of the honeymoon before Anna starts home with her great secret.
Promise now.
Only two days!
Anna's return home.
Anna relieves her mother's anxiety with happy mysterious hints of wealth to come.
The old way too pleasant to give up.
Less and less frequent their secret meetings until at last...
In answer to her urgent letter...
All right. I'll wait.
You haven't told anyone aboyt our marriage?
She tells him of a tender new reason why the secret cannot be kept any longer.
You mustn‚Äôt tell ANYONE.
Well...
Well... if you MUST know
The truth...
Because we aren't married at all!
You‚Äôre just joking... tell me, aren't you joking?
WE MUST be married... see... see... our ring...
Marriage would have meant my losing everything...
I intended to make it right... but...
For Heaven's sake, don't make a scene! I'll let you have lots of money and you can go away.
Mother! Mother!
When the mother returns...
Some time afterwards - left alone by her mother's death
- Anna hides away with her shame in the village of Belden.
Maternity:
Woman's Gethsemane.
Shadows across the time dial.
The baby without a name.
My child, your baby is very sick.
Ten drops of this in a little water every hour until
I return.
Where's your husband?
Oh... he's away.
The landlady solemnly reminds Anna that if the baby dies without being baptized, it will never see Got.
Helpless and alone in the dreadful hours of the night, and stricken with a terrible fear for her baby's soul... she herself performs the sacred rite.
In the name of the Father, and of the son... and of the Holy Ghost...
I baptize thee...
TRUST LENNOX.
The vigil.
The little hands grow cold upon her breast.
My child, your baby is dead.
Sanderson on his country estate at Bartlett.
Everybody is talking about you having no husband.
I guess you'll have to leave.
Upon her back the age-old Cross.
The Pilgrimage.
Hi Holler, the Barlett's chore boy, sprucing op in the barn to meet Kate, the Squire's niece.
A reckless spectator.
Oh! Hi! Hi Holler! Hurry up! It's time to fetch Kate!
Anna, in search of work, reaches Barlett Village.
Kate, the Squire's niece, returns from a short trip to Boston.
The Professor, summer boarder at Squire Barlett's. pursues his studies.
Is this the young niece you were expecting from
Boston?
I am looking for work.
Work? You don't 'pear to have no strength to work.
Where ye from?
Whose your folks?
I haven't any folks.
For all we know she might be some loose woman wanderin' 'round. I won't take her inter my hum!
Sorry, young lady, but I ain't got nothing for yet.
Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these... ye have done it unto me!
That's Scripture, Father.
All right, Mother, we'll try her. Nobody can't ever say
I went aging the Scriptures!
Whatever your troubles, child, remember, the Lord is your Shepherd, you shall not want.
Kate's Homecoming.
It has been settled by the
Squire and David‚Äôs childhood that they are to marry,
Open admiration.
The Professor, meeting
Kate, is converted to the scientific theory of Love at first sight.
Oh, Professor, my shoe is untied.
Well, well, neighbor
Sanderson, haven‚Äôt seen you since Kate went away.
Kate - Sanderson's newest infatuation.
David, you'll have time before supper to show
Neighbor Sanderson that heifer he wants to buy.
What are you doing here?
I am working.
You can't stay here.
I live right across the way.
Come right in, Mr. Sanderson!
Supper's ready.
You father was right.
I'm afraid I'm not strong enough for this work.
Release don't do away,
Miss Moore! I... we all... like you very much.
You'll get stronger after awhile, and...
Anna! David!
Come right in.
END OF PART I
WAY DOWN EAST
Part II
Meanwhile, Anna, her past still a closed book, has become a beloved member of the household.
Knowing only Anna's blameless life among them,
David thrilled with the thought that she is the virginal white flower of his dreams.
By the river and the distant music of the falls - Around them the sweet scent of summer fields.
The David points out the two forks of the river, that go into one...
And all a thrill with a great sincere love,
Visions to her how they two might go,
On through life together...
One heart for one heart,
One soul for one soul,
One love for one love,
Even through Eternity.
At last the freat over- whelming love - only to be halted by the stark ghosts of her past.
I am only trying to say I love you, Anna - it seems
I've always loved you!
So she tells him he must never speak like this again.
The summer goes, the winter comes,
We cannot rile the year,
Nor can we rule the barque of Fate,
Nor all its strange ways steer.
The Professor's love... burdened heart brings him down to the country to see
Kate.
I'm going ter read yer some funny jokes.
Why does a chicken cross the road?
None of the rooster‚Äôs
Business.
Ain't that funny?
Three eggs, two bad.
Miss Kate, I want to ask... if you will... be... my...
The ice is going out soon.
When the river starts you'd better look out down below there!
Anna goes ton the store after forgotten goodies for the big party planned for the evening.
The villain still pursues her.
The sewing circle next to the grocery store.
Maria Poole, the landlady from Belden, visits Barlett.
That's Anna Moor lives down to Squire
Barlett's.
Moore? Her name ain't
Moore...
She lived at my house.
Mrs. Lennox, she called herself... but she never had no husband at all!
And then... there was a baby!
The Squire thinks it time that David and Kate come to an understanding.
It's my bounden duty to go and expose this woman to the Squire.
Father's set on getting married but I don't think we can without proper love... do you?
Suppose, Squire, I had been like you suspected when you first saw me?
Would there be any hope of forgiveness?
When the law's broke. it's broke, ain't it? A wrong‚Äôs a wrong and nothing can make it right.
Of course...
I was just supposing.
On their way to the big barn dance.
Maria Poole, from Belden, was at the sewing circle and she says...
No. I shouldn't tell you!
It's that...
Oh, it's awful...
But before Martha tells her thrilling news...
On their way to the big party, they stop to warm up at the Squire's with an old- fashioned dance.
No, I am not invited to the party,
The Professor, dazed but happy.
All bound 'round a woolen string!
A great big hat with a great big brim.
All bound 'round, all bound 'round.
All bound 'round with a woolen string!
David, for some reason, suddenly discovers he is not interested in the party.
The neighbors' barn dance.
Moro and worried by Anna's presence... also afraid she will interfere in his pursuit of
Kate - Saderson -
I can't have you around here where I live!
Suppose they find out about your past life?
You'd have to fet out them!
Suppose they find out about YOUR past life!
Oh, it's different with a
MAN! He's supposed to sow his wild oats.
At last Martha gets her opportunity with the
Squire.
Does Lennox Sanderson mean anything to you?
Why do you ask such question?
Because I can't keep silent any longer.
I love you! I want you to be my wife.
It's about Anna Moore.
She lived in Belden under the name of Lennox.
Mrs. Lennox.
A baby was born, but there ware not no wedding ring to the finger.
No, father... you must have proof.
I'll go to Belden in the morning... and if it is true...
Please! Please don't!
I can never be ANY
MAN'S WIFE!
The next morning. The
Squire on his way to
Belden to investigate
Martha's story.
The Squire's on important business, isn't he?
So happens that
Sanderson...
At noon Squire arrives in Belden.
It's all true. Why, her baby was born in this very room.
Late afternoon.
Roses in wintertime!
Lan' sakes!
Don't want no supper of your getting!
The time's come for you to get your things and get out of this house!
Don't want no words!
Just get out!
It means she is going to get out of my house!
I found out all about her... she ain't fit to be here!
She's the mother of a baby, but she ain't got
NO HUSBAND!
Tell them it's a lie,
Anna!
I... I can't!
You found out so much!
Why didn't you find out the whole truth?
That I was an ignorant girl betrayed through a mock marriage.
This man... an honored guest at your table... why don't find out what
HIS life haw been?
For HE is the man who betrayed me!
And then the storm.
The sugar camp.
Anna's lost in the storm... get out men... quick!
Frenzied... tortured...
The calling river.
The storm lulls.
The great ice-break.
The ice jam gives way... rushing to the falls.
Quick! Quick!
The Doctor!
Toward morning.
The Squire asks forgiveness.
Come, Anna, I know I didn't the right thing. I'm willing to marry you now if you want me.
I... I will.
I will.
Interested witnesses.
Seth, wilt thou have this woman to be the wedded wife...?
I... I will.
The one man for the one woman,
Between them the
Sacramental bond...
Life's cleanest and sweetest.

Our story deals with one of those queer tricks that Fate sometimes plays.
Nobody would believe, for instance, that the entire lives of a peaceful American boy and girl -
- could be changed by a funny little war between two small countries far across the sea.
And yet it came to pass. The spies of the two little nations were at a Pacific seaport, -
- each trying to prevent the other getting ships and supplies.
"Gentlemen, the enemy have just purchased the steamship Navigator."
"There she lies now, and it is our patriotic duty to destroy that ship."
"We will send her adrift in the fog tonight before the new crew goes aboard. -
- The wind - the tide - and the rocks will do the rest."
The wealthy ship owner who has just sold the Navigator.
And his daughter.
Rollo Treadway - Heir to the
Treadway fortune - a living proof that -
- every family tree must have its sap.
"I think I'll get married."
"Today."
"We'll sail for Honolulu tomorrow on our honey-moon - get two tickets."
"He had completed all arrangements
- - except to notify the girl."
"Will you marry me?"
"Certainly not!"
"I think a long walk would do me good."
"Your tickets, sir - - and congratulations."
"The boat sails at ten in the morning, sir."
"I don't get up that early - so I'll go aboard tonight."
Going on a honeymoon without a bride is like singing the words of -
- "Kiss Me Again" to the music of "Alice, Where Art Thou."
"What pier, sir?"
"Pier two."
"I must get some papers off the
Navigator, so stop at Pier 12."
Pier 12 >>> Pier 2
"Is there any one on board?"
"Nobody."
Under the cover of darkness the foreign agents prepared to carry out their plans.
"Help!"
The next morning found the Navigator drifting helplessly at sea.
"Will you marry me?"
"This is a fine time to ask me that.
I'm cold and hungry and - -"
"Put up that bright one."
"She's quarantined."
"Try and catch them!"
"Hey! Wait a minute!"
By the time they were ready to say "good-night" -
- they had found a couple of sea-going tuxedos.

"Cannibals!"
"We're safer on the boat."
"We're drifting toward them."
"We're safe! I've anchored the ship."
"We are sinking! It's just a matter of time until we're captured."
"Can't you fix it?"
"That would have to be fixed from the outside."

"Aren't you going to enlist?"
"Your name?"
"Johnnie Gray."
"Occupation?"
"Engineer on the Western and Atlantic Railroad."
"Don't enlist him. He is more valuable to the South as an engineer."

A year later. In a Union encampment just North of Chattanooga.
General Thatcher, and his chief spy, Captain Anderson.
"I Know every foot of this railroad from Marietta to Chattanooga, and with ten picked men I cannot fail."
"We will enter the South as civilians coming from the neutral state of Kentucky to join the southern cause."
"At Big Shanty we will steal the train while the passengers and the crew are at dinner, and proceeding North we will burn every bridge, cutting off the supplies of the army now facing you."
"Then the day you steal the train I will have General Parker advance to meet you."
"As soon as I arrive I will let you know how seriously father is wounded."
"Big Shanty.
Twenty minutes for dinner."
"Three men stole my General.
I think they are deserters."
"Why not stop and fight them?"
"I'm afraid they have us greatly outnumbered."
The Southern army facing Chattanooga is ordered to retreat."
General Parker's victorious
Northern army advancing.
"There is only one man on that engine."
In the enemy's country, hopelessly lost, helplessly cold and horribly hungry.
"At Nine o'clock tomorrow morning our supply trains will meet and unite with General Parker's army at the Rock River bridge."
"Then the army, backed by our supply trains, will advance for a surprise attack on the rebels left flank."
"Once our trains and troops cross that bridge, nothing on the earth can stop us."
"This girl was in the baggage car when we stole the train, so I thought it best to hold her."
"We had better stay here until daybreak to see where we are."
"It was so brave of you to risk your life, coming into the enemy's country, just to save me."
After a nice, quiet, refreshing night's rest.
"We've got to get back to our lines somehow and warn them of this coming attack."
"I will get that spy before he reaches the Southern lines. You follow with the supply trains as planned."
"We must pick up more firewood."
The Rock River bridge.
The Northern division nearing the bridge to meet the supply trains.
"That bridge is not burned enough to stop you, and my men will ford the river."

"Is that your uniform?"
"I had to wear it to get through the lines."
"Take it off!"
"Enlist the lieutenant."

"Mr. Butler would like to marry you."
"That jellyfish couldn't take care of himself -- let alone a wife."
"We don't want any weaklings in our family."
"Weakling!
You don't know who he is."

"What's he doing here - training?"
Advice to the Lovesick by Beatrice Faircatch
I have outlined -
- the following proposal, with the answers you may expect:
He - "Do you think you could learn to love me?" 
She- "Why -what do you mean?" 
He - "I'm crazy about you." 
She- "This is so sudden."
He - "You're the only girl I ever loved." 
She- "Give me time to think."
He - "No, I must know now." 
She- "Have you ever proposed to any other girl?"
He - "Don't you care for me just a little?" 
She- "I don't know."
He - "It means everything to me." 
She- "What will father say?"
He - "Will you marry me?" 
She- "Do you really mean it?"
He - "Yes."   She- "Yes."
Then use your own Judgment,...
"Do you think you could learn to love me?"
"I have."
"When are you going to fight again?"
"When I'm drafted."
"I mean, who do you fight next?"
"Yes."
"Sir, it's time to take your liniment."
"These people will never know the difference - the champion -
- will win and no one will ever hear of Battling Butler again."
"If you're going to fight tomorrow you'll have to hurry to catch the train."
"Arrange the train."
"In this corner we have Battling Butler."
Butler's trainer and manager.
"- the Lightweight Champion."
"The Alabama Murderer challenges the winner."
"I'm champion."
"That means you cannot go back to the mountains, sir."
"You're wrong, I'm going back and tell her the truth. I'd rather lose her that way."

"That means you have to leave right away."
"Arrange it."
"I'll hurry and pack my things."
"I'm sorry, but you can't go."
"I want you to know me as I am -- not as the brutal, -
- blood-thirsty beast that
I am when fighting."
"Promise me you will never come near the training camp or to see me fight."
"Where do we go from here?"
"We'd better go to Butler's training camp, sir, -
- so that you can answer her letters from there."

"How's your heel?"
"He's all right."
"Let's go out for a little road work."
Eight miles later.
"I'm glad you came to see me -- now you must go right back home."
"I won't go home! I'm going to stay right here and help you train."
"Compliments of Mr. Butler."
"That woman says she's married to you, too."
"-- so you see, sir, it would wreck his home if she knew -
- the truth. Won't you be a good fellow and fix it for him."
"My dear, we are not the only
Butlers here. This is the -
- Lightweight Champion, Mr.
Battling Butler, and his wife."
"Don't forget your date Thanksgiving."
"What date?"
"With the Alabama Murderer."
"If he wants to be Battling
Butler let him fight the Alabama -
- Murderer, and he'll never flirt with anybody else's wife."
"I'm through - get him in shape the best you can."
"Don't you think it advisable, sir, to give this up?"
"No, Martin, I'd rather be killed by the
Alabama Murderer than have her know."
"Put up your hands."
By dinner time the only thing Alfred had on his mind was his stomach.
And so for three weeks Alfred trained and starved and suffered and ached -
- and bled and groaned and hoped and prayed and - and then came the storm.

"See that she gets a good seat."
"I hope you win -- father and brother wrote that they've bet all their money on you."
"Butler!"

"That was Battling Butler - he fought!"
"You didn't think we'd throw away a championship just to get even with you."
"Thanks - for saving me."
"I've been saving you for three weeks."
"That was Battling Butler."
"I lied to you -- I'm not even a fighter."
"I'm glad."

"IT" is that quality possessed by some... which draws all others with its magnetic force.
With "IT" you win all men if you are a woman - and all women if you are a man.
"IT" can be a quality of the mind as well as a physical attraction.
<u>Elinor Glyn</u> [signature]
WALTHAM 
THE BIGGEST STORE 
IN THE WORLD
Leaving his department store to his son, Cyrus P. Waltham... has gone to Herrin, Illinois, for the shooting.
"A gentleman to see you, sir."
Good luck
"For a good boy - on his first work day."
"If you ever go to work, Monty,
I'll do as much for you."
"IT" by Elinor Glyn
"IT" is that peculiar attribute that some people have, which attracts the opposite sex. 
The possessor of "IT" has it unconsciously and has irresistible sexual magnetism.
Mothers spoil boys with "IT", and women never refuse them!
"Old fruit, you've got 'IT'!"
"What the devil are you doing?"
"No - too bad - but you haven't any 'IT'!"
"Run away, Monty, the keepers are coming."
"I'm to look over the store. Come along."
"Hot socks - the new boss!"
"Sweet Santa Claus, give me him!"
"Let's have a double wedding - you and him - and me and the Prince of Wales!"
"Where do you figure?
The Prince is going to be our best man!"
"I've inspected all the lady employees - and not one of them has 'IT'!"
"You went over big, dearie!"
"Just you wait - I'll take the snap out of your garters yet!"
"Look! If I ever saw 'IT', that's 'IT'!"
"Shall we gnaw a chop at the club tonight?"
"Thanks, but I have an engagement at the Ritz."
"Could I - is it asking too much - would it be possible for me to - to drive you home?"
"I'd be very glad to go with you - if you'd ride in my car."
Betty lived in that fashionable downtown suburb -
Gas-house Gables -
"Would - could - do you ever dine?"
"I'd love to -"
"- at the Ritz!"
"Shall we dress?"
"Of course - how absurd!"
"Then I'll pop around at eight?"
"Toodles is hungry."
"The doctor says I can't go back to the store for a month - and
I can't let you do any more for me."
"Don't be sill, Molly! I won't go back on a pal!"
"That pest of a landlady and her friend just left.
The baby shouldn't do this - and I shouldn't do that -"
"If this was my baby,
I'd tell 'em where to head in!"
"I'm dining out tonight
- at the Ritz!"
Every evening in America, eighteen million blondes prepare to dine with gentlemen. One of the eighteen million -
"Mother, would you approve of my being Mrs. Cyrus T. Waltham?"
"He hasn't proposed yet
- but he's going to!"
"Mademoiselle's car is without."
"A nice, quiet table - in the corner, Mr. Montgomery?"
"I don't crave this table.
When I'm in the swim,
I want to be with the goldfish!"
"I'll take the same!"
"Who is the girl with Monty?"
"I don't know - but isn't she attractive?"
"Who's the blonde with
Mr. Waltham?"
"Adela Van Norman - they've been friends for years. Some day they'll marry and end it all."
"Of course you're reading
Elinor Glyn's latest story, 'IT'?"
"Monty was raving about it today. What is 'IT'?"
"Here's Elinor Glyn herself!
Let's ask her to tell us something about 'IT'."
"Madame Glyn, we've been talking about your latest story.
Just what is this 'IT'?"
"Self-confidence and indifference as to whether you are pleasing or not - and something in you that gives the impression that you are not at all cold. That's 'IT'!"
"If you have 'IT', you will win the girl you love."
"Cyrus, do you believe in 'IT'?"
"I certainly do!"
"I'm going to get my wish!"
"Oh, I must telephone!"
"Who is that charming girl with you?"
"This is a great pleasure."
"I'll bet you won't even recognize me, the next time we meet."
"I'll take the bet - and you can name the stakes."
In a shopgirl's day, the first thousand customers are the crabbiest.
"She always takes goods on approval - wears them around for six months - and then finds she doesn't approve!"
"- and the girl insulted me!"
"See that the garment is replaced - and send the salesgirl to my office."
"Young lady, in this store the customer is always right -"
"I'm the salesgirl!
Go on - bawl me out!"
"Well, anyway, I lose the bet for not recognizing you. What's the forfeit?"
"Oh, that wasn't a real bet.
I don't want anything -"
"Thanks, Adela, I'll be very happy to dine with you tonight."
"If you insist on paying your bet, you can take me out tonight."
"All right! Where?"
"Let's go to the beach - and do it up right!"
HOT DOGS!
Tasty and satisfying!
The best on the beach!
House of Amusements
"Hold me tight,
Mr. Waltham."
"Happy?"
"So you're one of those 
Minute Men - the minute you know a girl you think you can kiss her!"
Poverty is no disgrace -- until meddling neighbors hear of it.
"There's no use arguing!
We're going to take that baby to the Home, until you're well!"
"Get that story."
"If women like you would stay home and have babies of your own, we'd all be better off!"
"We're doing our duty.
The mother is ill - and she has no means of support."
"This is my baby!"
"I don't believe it."
"I'm the baby's mother -
I'm not sick - and I've got a job! Laugh that off!"
"Haven't I a job, Monty - at Waltham's? Tell 'em!"
"Is that the baby's father?"
"Him? He couldn't even give birth to a suspicion!"
"Who is your husband?
Have you a husband?"
"None of your business!"
"I say, Betty, this isn't really your child, is it?"
"Are you blind? Can't you see the resemblance?"
...forgive me for last night, Betty, and come to the theater with me tonight?
I promise not to make the same mistake
"I have tashted the milk of human kindnesh - an' it's a lot of Fermillac!"
"B'lieve it or not - my baby is its mother!"
The young mother fights hard for her baby, like a tigress in the sand confronting social workers.
A sharp-dressed man of the city declared that the girl had means enough and was able to keep all the obligations
"I'm the chappie - the man about town -
I'm the ample means!"
"We are investigating the case of a girl who says she's employed here -"
"- she - she - there's a baby."
"She gave the name of Betty Lou Spence."
The young mother clutched the little boy to her chest and defied all who tried to take the child.
"Thank you. You see, we had to verify her story."
"She's the one. She told me it's her baby - told me with her own lipsh!"
"Will you issue the bonus checks now, Mr. Waltham?"
"Are you mad at me because I slapped you?"
"I'm sorry - but a girl
has to do that.
You know how those things are!"
"Let's forget it.
We've got each other straight now, haven't we?"
"Yes - we have!"
"It's a star sapphire."
"It's pretty - but
I like diamonds better."
"Would you like some diamonds for yourself?"
"Betty, I'm crazy about you -"
"I love you, too."
"I'll buy you diamonds - clothes - everything you want -"
"What are you trying to do?
Offer me one of those left-hand arrangements?"
"I'm crazy about you!
Isn't that enough?"
"I suppose that's what you men call love!"
"Cancel my appointments, please. I'm leaving town for a week."
Betty was too poor to quit her job - and too proud to stay. So she quit!
Woman Offered Job
"I - I've come to forgive you."
"You don't mean you thought the baby was really mine?"
"There's its mother!
Can't you see the resemblance?"
"What a joke on Waltham -
I told him it was your baby!"
"He thought it was mine?"
"And he wouldn't even give me the benefit of the doubt!"
"I'll make him propose to me - and when he does, I'll laugh in his face! And you're going to help me do it!"
"But - he's going on a yachting cruise and - and I'm going with him!"
"Fine! I'll yacht with you."
"But, I say - what about your clothes?"
"That's the joke on you - you're going to buy them for me."
"Give me your word you won't tell him - anything!"
"Is Mr. Waltham aboard?"
"Not yet, sir."
"The party's off. We might as well go back."
"Oh no, sir! Mr. Waltham's expecting you - he'll be here any minute."
"Shall I show you to your cabins?"
"Something I can get for you, Mr. Montgomery?"
"No, thanks - I'm just prowling about."
"Just going for some - some - cigars."
"Everything ready, Captain?"
"Let's get under way."
"I'm not feeling so well."
"Tea, sir?"
"Feeling better, Monty?"
"I feel so low, old chap, that I could get on stilts and walk under a dachshund!"
"Shall I call Miss Van Cortland, sir? She's in her cabin."
"I say, I almost forgot about Miss Van Cortland."
"Miss Van Cortland - the - the girl I asked when you asked me to ask someone."
"Monty, who is Miss
Van Cortland?"
"You - you tell them, old thing."
"She's a very nice girl. I -
I believe Monty met her in Paris last summer."
"You idiot!
Who is this girl?"
"She's a ripping sort, really!
She's positively topheavy with 'IT'."
"Oh, Monty, am I late for tea? I'm so sorry."
"Mr. Waltham! It's been years, hasn't it?"
"Won't you have some tea?"
"Haven't I seen you some place?"
"In Paris, perhaps.
I'm there so often."
"Desirez-vous du sucre?"
"What do you mean by bringing her?"
"You know what sort she is - with her fatherless child!"
"But, I say - it isn't fatherless -"
"I won't have her on board! We'll put back to port."
"Do you think we'll have as nice a day as this all day, Captain?"
"That's the last time I'll get you out of a scrape!"
"Miss Van Cortland seems to be rather lacking in reserve, doesn't she?"
"Personally, I think she has plenty - in reserve!"
"Betty, I've something to say to you."
"Won't it wait until morning?"
"I've been thinking things over, Betty. I want to talk to you - seriously."
"Be serious - with you?
How silly!"
"I don't care what you've been - I want you to marry me!"
"I'd rather marry your office boy!"
"He asked me - and I laughed at him - and now it doesn't seem so darned funny, after all!"
"It was a ghastly joke, old man - her baby's just a moth -
I mean a myth!"
"It's her friend's baby!
And she's crying for you -
I mean Betty, not the baby -"
"But you said yourself it was her baby -"
"Take the wheel, Monty
- I'm going to find her."
"The ballast has shifted to port, sir - but there's no danger!"
"Silly of me, but I'm afraid I overdid it - made a left-hand turn and what not -"
"Take your girl friend.
I had to knock her cold - but maybe it'll do her good."
"Betty, where are you going?"
"I'm going home!"
"Monty will get you."
"Monty, I wonder if there's anything between them?"
"I'm afraid there is."
"We're just a couple of
It-less 'ITS'!"
Soon after its premiere, the film Metropolis was severely truncated and alterations were made.
From that time onward, more than a quarter of the film was assumed to have been lost.
Then, in 2008, a virtually complete version of the film was discovered in Buenos Aires.
What had been preserved was, however, a heavily damaged copy of the film that had been printed to 16mm film stock, lacking the full frame of the picture's original aspect ratio.
A considerable amount of the film reconstruction was able to be completed and the correct sequence of its editing established by means of this Argentinian material.
Spanish intertitles have been translated into German with the aid of the censor-cards.
In order to display in their correct position on the image the cropped elements taken from the 16mm negative, the missing portion of the frame has been marked by black.
The intertitles appear with their original graphic treatment.
Those titles which appear in a different typeface (like the one used here) have been added to summarise the content of still-missing scenes as far as is necessary to facilitate an adequate understanding of the storyline.
Shorter gaps are indicated by small segments of black leader.

Epigraph:
THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS
MUST BE THE HEART!
Shift change.
Deep beneath the earth lay the
City of the Workers.
As deep beneath the earth as the City of the Workers lay, so high above it towered the complex known as the "Sons' Club", with its lecture halls and libraries, its theatres and stadiums.
Fathers, for whom every revolution of a mechanical wheel meant gold, had bestowed upon their sons the wonder of the Eternal Gardens.
Which of you ladies shall today have the honour of entertaining Master Freder,
Joh Fredersen's son?
Look! These are your brothers!
Look - !
These are your brothers!
Who - was that?
But this was what happened to Freder - the son of Joh Fredersen, the master of Metropolis - as he sought out the girl:
To the new Tower of Babel - to my father - !
Why is it, Josaphat, that I learn of this explosion from my son, and not from you - !
Details - !
What were you looking for in the Machine-Halls, Freder?
I wanted to look into the faces of the people whose little children are my brothers, my sisters...
Your magnificent city, Father - and you the brain of this city - and all of us within the light of this city... -
...and where are the people, Father, whose hands built your city - ?
Off where they belong...
...off where they belong...?
...in the Depths...?
And if those in the Depths one day rise against you?
The chief foreman of the Heart-Machine, Grot, - with an important message...
There were two more copies of those damnable plans, Herr Fredersen...
...in the pockets of two men who met with an accident today at the M-Machine...
How is it, Josaphat, that these plans were brought to me by Grot, rather than by you?
Apply to the G-Bank for your remaining wages...
Father, do you know what it means to be dismissed by you? -
It means: To be sent below! -
Father - below! Into the Depths - !
Do you know what it means to be dismissed like that by Joh Fredersen?
Would you like to come with me,
Josaphat?
Go home, Josaphat, and wait for me...
I still have a long way to go tonight...
Into the Depths, - to my brothers...
From today on I wish to be kept precisely informed of my son's every move...
Brother...
...the Machine! There needs to be someone at the Machine!
There will be someone at the machine...
ME.
Listen to me...
I want to trade my life with you...
Josaphat.
99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.
Wait for me - both of you...
Josaphat.
99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.
In the middle of Metropolis, there stands a strange house that the centuries had overlooked.
The man who dwelled within was Rotwang, the inventor.
Hel
Born to bring me happiness and a benediction to all mankind.
Lost to Joh Fredersen.
Died giving life to Freder, Joh Fredersen's son.
A mind like yours, Rotwang, should be able to forget...
Only one time in life did I forget something: that Hel was a woman - and you a man...
Let the dead lie, Rotwang...
She's dead for you as she is for me...
For me she isn't dead, Joh Fredersen - for me she lives - !
Do you think the loss of a hand is too high a price for recreating Hel - ?!
Do you wish to see her - ?!
Now, Joh Fredersen - ?!
Isn't it worth losing a hand to have created the man of the future - the Machine-Man - ?!
24 more hours of work - and no man, Joh Fredersen, will be able to differentiate the Machine-Man from a mortal - !
The woman is mine, Joh Fredersen!
Hel's son was yours!
And what brings you my way,
Joh Fredersen?
I need your advice - as usual, when all my experts fail me...
Can you decipher for me these plans that for months have been getting discovered in the pockets of my workers?
...at two... once my shift ends!
She has summoned us again...
Father - ! Father - !
Will ten hours never come to an end - ??! !
- it's a blueprint of the two-thousand-year-old catacombs deep below the lowest levels of your Metropolis...
I should like to glean what my workers are doing exactly in those catacombs...
Today I shall tell you the legend of THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THE TOWER OF BABEL...
The Legend of THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THE TOWER OF BABEL
Come! Let us build a tower whose zenith shall reach unto the stars!
And at the tower's zenith we shall write:
Great is the world and its Maker!
And great is Man!
...but those who had conceived of the Tower of Babel could not build the Tower of Babel.
The task was too great.
So they paid wages to outside hands...
But the hands that built the Tower of Babel knew nothing of the dream of which the head that had conceived it had been fantasising.
The hymns of praise of one man became the curses of others.
The same language was spoken, but these men did not understand one another...
Great is the world and its Maker and great is Man
HEAD and HANDS require a Mediator.
THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS
MUST BE THE HEART!
And where is our Mediator,
Maria - ?
Wait for him!
He will surely come!
We will wait, Maria...!
But not for much longer - !
Oh Mediator, have you finally come...
You summoned me - here I am!
Rotwang, give the Machine-Man the likeness of this woman...
I shall sow discord between them and her!
I shall destroy their belief in this woman -
Leave me alone now, Joh Fredersen...
You'll find the way back without me...
You fool! Now you shall also lose the last remaining thing you still had from Hel... your son...
Until tomorrow, in the cathedral!
END OF THE PRELUDE
INTERMEZZO
Freder witnesses a monk at the pulpit who preaches:
"Verily, I say unto you: the days of which the Apocalypse speaks draw nigh!"
The monk's hand points to the Bible, in which it is written:
"And I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, having a golden cup in her hand.
And upon her forehead was a name written, a mystery:
BABYLON THE GREAT, the Mother of Abominations ofthe Earth.
And I saw the woman drunken with the blood ofthe Saints."
You will annihilate Joh Fredersen - him and his city and his son - !
GLUTTONY

Had you come earlier, you wouldn't have frightened me...
I now beg of you: stay away from me and my beloved...!
Where is the one whose clothes you are wearing?
Josaphat.
99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.
Would you please wake Georgy up?
He must lead me to the Workers' City at once...
No. 11811, get back to the Machine and forget that you ever left it - understood?
I have to have someone who's faithful to me, Josaphat, - otherwise, how shall I attain the end-goal of my path - ?!
I must go on, Josaphat, - must now, on my own, seek out the person to whom Georgy was supposed to lead me...
Tonight, Josaphat - tonight when I come back...
Josaphat.
99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.
So, what price are you demanding for leaving this residence tonight?
You still don't seem to have grasped who sent me here...
CENTRAL BANK OF METROPOLIS
This man doesn't want his son to find you still here tonight!
In three hours' time
I shall be calling for you!
Come! It is time to give the Man-Machine your face!
Where is Maria - ?!
She's with your father...
I'm telling you, she is with your father - !
"She is the most perfect and most obedient tool that a man has ever possessed!
Tonight you shall see how she holds up before the eyes ofthe upper hundred.
You shall see her dance, and if only one single person recognises the machine in her,
I will call myself a bungler who never succeeded at anything!
C. Rotwang"
"C. A. Rotwang requests Herr Joh Fredersen to be his guest this evening."
I want you to go to those in the Depths in order to annihilate the work of your prototype!
"C. A. Rotwang requests Herr Joh Fredersen to be his guest this evening."
Verily, I say unto you: the days of which the Apocalypse speaks draw nigh...!
All Seven Deadly Sins, on her behalf - !
Death overtakes the City - !
END OF THE INTERMEZZO
The Revelation of St. John
Avalun Publishing, Hellerau
I escaped from the Thin Man wearing this attire...
But for ten days your father's bloodhound has been making the Workers' City unsafe...
The only thing keeping the workers in check is their expectation for the Mediator promised unto them...
Even stranger things have been happening, Freder...
On that evening when you fell ill...
...once the best of friends... because of that woman...
...the other man... on that same evening...
...the Eternal Gardens lie abandoned... but night after night in Yoshiwara...
And this woman, at whose feet all sins are heaped...
...is also called Maria...
That same woman that those in the Depths regard as a saint - ?!
Many now go to the City of the Dead, to a woman they have judged to be as true as gold.
The Mediator is not likely to miss that occasion...
Whatever happens tonight: it is my express order to allow the workers to do as they please...
Joh Fredersen wants to let those in the Depths use force and do wrong so that he can claim the right to use force against them...
When you spoke to your poor brothers, you talked about peace, Maria... today a mouthpiece of Joh Fredersen incites them to rebel against him...
She will destroy their belief in the Mediator!
You know I've always talked about peace... but your Mediator hasn't come...
You've waited long enough!
Your time has come - !
...but I've tricked Joh Fredersen!
Your clone does not obey his will - only mine alone!
Who is the living fodder for the machines for Metropolis - ?!
Who smears the machine-joints with their own marrow - ?!
Who feeds the machines with their own flesh - ?!
Let the machines starve, you fools - !
Finish them off - ! !
Do them in - these machines - ! !
You aren't Maria - ! ! !
YOU ARE NOT MARIA - !
Maria talks of peace, not murder - !
This is not Maria - ! !
Joh Fredersen's son - ! !
Do him in, the dog, in his white silken hide - ! ! !
Get your women, your sons, out of the Workers' City!
Let no-one stay behind!
Death to the machines - ! ! !
In the attic of his home,
Rotwang displays for Maria his ever-growing intoxication with his triumph over Fredersen:
" - and twice over did I trick Joh Fredersen - !
For I concealed from him that his son wants to be the Mediator of your brothers - and is in love with you - !"
Maria isn't the only one listening to Rotwang.
On the other side of the attic's window,
Joh Fredersen was eavesdropping...
Joh Fredersen breaks into Rotwang's attic.
He wrestles with his old rival and overtakes him.
Maria is free.
...faithful after all...
Come, Freder!
We still have to go through the Workers' City.
Women and men, let no-one miss out on today - !
Death to the machines - ! !
Not one man - not one woman has stayed behind - !
Leave the machines - !
Let them race to their death - !
To the Heart-Machine - !
DANGER
Open the gates!
You have to open the gates!
If the Heart-Machine perishes, nothing in the Machine-District will be left standing - ! !
Have you lost your minds - ??
If the Heart-Machine perishes, the entire Workers' City will be laid to waste - ! !
Where are your fathers, your mothers?
Do you have any idea that your son is amongst the workers?!
Yes - you! You're Maria - !
To the air shafts - quickly! Quickly!
The reservoirs have burst! The city is drowning - !
We'll take the children to the Sons' Club!
Why are all the lights out?
I need to know - !
Where is my son?! ! !
Tomorrow thousands will ask in fury and desperation:
Joh Fredersen, where is my son - ?!
Where are your children??!
The city is drowned, the shafts are totally flooded - ! !
Who bade you attack the machines, without which you're finished, you idiots - ??!
It's the witch's fault - !
We'll be looking on as the world goes to the devil - !
Find the witch; this is all her fault - !
Strike her dead - ! !
Now I'm going to take you home, my Hel - !
The witch - ! the witch - !
There she is - ! there she is - !
Where are our children, you witch, you - ??!
Burn the witch. -
To the stake with her! ! !
To the stake with her - ! !
Hel - ! My Hel - ! !
Your children... saved - ! ! !
Head and hands want to join together, but they don't have the heart to do it...
Oh Mediator, show them the way to one another...
THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS
MUST BE THE HEART!

A German folk tale
Behold!
The portals of darkness are open, and the shadows of the dead hunt over the Earth...
"Back! Hold! Why dost thou scourge mankind with War, Plague, Famine?!"
"The Earth is mine!"
"Never will the Earth be thine:
Man belongs to God!"
"Look below!"
"All things in heaven and on Earth are wonderful!
But the greatest wonder is man's freedom to choose between good and evil!"
"Dost thou know Faust?"
"A knave like all others!
He preaches good and does evil!
He seeks to turn base metal into gold!
Behold his greed!"
"A wager: I will wrest
Faust's soul away from God!"
"If thou canst destroy what is divine in Faust, the Earth is thine!"
"No man can resist evil!
The bet is on!"
"The Plague! The Plague!"
The devastating pestilence raged: in a few days half the town lay dying.
To find a cure for the Plague,
Faust spent day and night in prayer with God.
And there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house without its dead.
"Lord God, bless this act of redemption!
Only you can alleviate our misery!"
"Help... help!
My mother is dying!"
Mortal terror and fear of death swept through the town.
"Repent, fast, pray!
Only Faith can vanquish death!"
"Have respect for the dead!"
"We still live, we still love! We shall die dancing in each other's arms!"
"Who has faith shall live!
But death will take the sinners!"
"The Plague! The Plague!"
"Compassion, Faust!
Only you can help us!"
"Get hence! We are lost!
No faith is any help.
No knowledge is any help.
All is vanity... "
Mine God, thou art merciful and a great goodness.
The third great Key to the Force of the Ghost of Hell.
And if thou would summon the Prince of
Darkness to aid thee and give thee all the might and glory of the world, go to a crossroad and call on him three times.
"I invoke thy aid,
Spirit of Darkness: show thyself!"
"Come forth, demon of evil!"
"As thou art called with thy unholy name:
MEPHISTO appear!"
"You have summoned me!"
"Here I am!"
I renounce God and his heavenly legion, and so shall be mine the power and glory of the world.
"Be gone from me, Satan!"
"To have the power to help for only one day!"
"One day! Try it!
Just one trial day!"
"When the hour-glass has run out... "
"... you go free, the Pact canceled! Sign!" glory... power
"Can you help the hungry and the sick?"
"What you wish I will perform: you are the master and I am your servant. "
"A drop of blood!"
"Blood is quite a remarkable substance!"
"Only for one day?"
"Until the sand has run out!"
"Faust! Help us!"
"Then I shall help in the devil's name!"
"A miracle! A miracle!"
"In the name of Christ crucified, help my child!"
"He cannot look upon the Holy Cross!"
"He is in league with the devil!
Stone him! Stone him!"
"Deliver me, elixir of death!"
"You may not cheat me! Remember our pact: the trial day is not over yet. "
"Death sets all men free!"
"Is that death?"
"It is life, Faust, seducing you with the fair image of your youth. "
"Wretched Faust, why do you seek death? You have not yet lived!"
"I despise my life!"
"Your life was only the dust and mold of books! Pleasure is all!"
"I am too old!"
"I offer you the greateast happiness: youth! Seize it!"
"Give me youth!"
"I've caught you, old boy!"
"Take me to her!"
"Step upon my cloak... "
"... and the spinning Earth will spread before you!"
"The wedding feast for the Duchess of
Parma, the most beautiful woman in Italy!"
"Strange guests!"
"To pay tribute to the highest beauty, my lord brings you his kingdom's treasures!"
"The day is over! The sand has run out!
Be as you were!"
"Youth... Leave me youth!"
"Our pact stands for eternity?"
"You have tasted all of life's pleasures, Faust! From indulgence to indulgence, sensation without end, yet nothing satisfied you!"
"What will you: a woman, a game of chance, an orgy?
Whatever you wish, I must grant!"
"Do you want the Emperor's crown?"
"Home!"
"Take me home! And at once!"
"Is today a feast day in your town?"
"Are you heathen born that you have never heard of Holy Easter?"
"It is as if life had stood still:
All is as it once was!"
"An innocent little girl, running to a priest... she is not for you!"
"Tedeum laudamus
Praise the Lord. "
"Vacation, mother!"
"I know more obliging wenches. for you here!"
"I want only her.
Do as I command!"
"Brother Valentin!"
"Once she has this little golden chain in the house she will begin to feel the devil's power!"
"Good gracious, how pretty you are!"
"Any lovers yet?"
"What have you, child?"
"Tell the mother of God, if you cannot tell me!"
"May I visit Aunt Marthe?"
Frau Marthe Schwerdtlein
"Three little drops from this love potion by night and all the girls' hearts will be yours!"
"Look Aunt Marthe what I found in my drawer... "
"A rich treasure!"
"I found it in my jewelry box!"
"Just once let me try on the beautiful necklace!"
"A small bouquet for the bridegroom, a little wreath for the bride!"
"Pardon, lovely lady.
I seek Frau Marthe Schwerdtlein!"
"From your cousin... from Lombardy...!"
"He gave me this necklace as a gift for you!"
"Those we encircle within this ring shall be sweethearts...!"
"One, two, three.
Makes you free!"
"Pardon: my stomach is too weak for such a fiery drink!"
"Permit, that I mix myself a litle drink as I learned it in Padua!"
"My friend, a prince of the noblest blood!"
"He loves me...
...loves me not...
...loves me... "
"Yes, with all his heart he loves you!"
"She loves me... "
"She loves me not. "
"She loves you!"
"I am yours forever!"
"He loves me!"
"What are you waiting for?
Your sweetheart herself lights the way for you!"
"Cursed matchmaker!"
"I will keep the brother out of the way!"
"To the prettiest girl in town!"
"No other girl is as pretty as your sister: long live Gretchen!"
"A pretty girl is not pure!"
"Here's to Gretchen!"
"Here's to your Gretchen!"
"If you hurry you can catch her lover before he slips out of her room. "
"Flee!... Flee!... you have murdered him!"
"Murder!"
"Murder... murder!"
"Murder... Murder... Murder!"
"Flee!... Flee! The deputes already seek the murderer!"
"Touch me not, you wanton, your lover has slain me!"
"First read a requiem. Mass for me!
Then to the stocks with this harlot!"
"Gretchen... Gretchen!"
"Now death and nature with surprise Behold the trembling sinners rise To meet the Judge's searching eyes. "
"For now before the Judge severe
No crime can pass unpunished here. "
"All hidden things must plain appear. "
"Mother! Mother!"
"And has born a little child in the depth of winter. "
"Have mercy on my child!"
"Are you not Gretchen, who stood in the stocks?"
"Mercy! Mercy! My child is dying!"
"She has killed her child!
Seize her, the murderess!"
"Faust... Faust... help your Gretchen!"
"Mephisto!"
"You have betrayed me!
She suffers! She suffers!"
"To the stake with the child murderer!"
"Save her, save Gretchen!"
"Too late! Even now they build her funeral pyre!"
"You are still my servant!
Bring me to her, or the pact is broken!"
"My steed awaits!
Quick, before morning comes!"
"Faster! Faster!"
"Oh had I never wished for youth, that brought this misery!
Curse... curse the delusion of youth!"
"You have yourself cursed youth!
What you wish I must grant!"
"Be as you were: an old man!"
"Forgive... forgive me my sin!"
"Gretchen!"
"Here is no place for thee!"
"I claim my wager!"
"One Word breaks thy pact!"
"Tell me the Word!"
"The Word that wings joyfully throughout the universe, The Word that appeases every pain and grief, The Word that expiates all human guilt, the Eternal Word... dost thou not know it?"
"Tel me the Word!"

THE END
Buster Keaton in The Saphead
Directed by Herbert Blache
Written by June Mathis
"The New Henrietta" was a
Broadway play in which...
Douglas Fairbanks scored a major success in 1913.
It was first filmed with him
1915 under the name THE LAMB.
When it was to be remade by Metro in 1920,...
Fairbanks himself suggested Buster Keaton for his former role.
Keaton was then under an exclusive contract with...
Joseph M. Schenck who agreed to loan him to Metro.
It was Keaton's first appearance in a feature-length film.
THE SAPHEAD'S great success earned Keaton star billings in his subsequent films.
A little street where money is everything- and everything is money.
Nicholas Van Alstyne- known, loved, and feared as "The Old Nick of The Street."
Old Nick's very private secretary -- "Mr. Musgrave."
"You tell him that Jim Hardy from Arizona is here."
"I used to pal with this old boy out west."
"What the blazes brought you east, Jim?"
"The Henrietta mine -- she's the all-fired biggest proposition I ever seen."
"Jim, you know more about a mine than anybody on earth -- except me --"
"I want a broker -- send for Watson Flint."
"If you say the Henrietta is that big -- watch me gamble on her!"
Mark Turner had succeeded in marrying Old Nick's daughter -
- but had never succeeded at anything else.
MARK TURNER
BROKER
His morning mail as usual was all bills and no business.
"There's a girl outside that wants to see you personal."
I am destitute and very ill. I must see you. Henrietta Reynolds
"Your wife's outside, sir."
"Go back and tell her she'll hear from me in a day or two."
"I came to invite you to lunch."
"I'm afraid you'd find me rotten company."
"I work like a dog, Rose -- but I don't get anywhere."
"Your father's commissions are worth a fortune to a broker -
- but he never gives me an order."
"I'll have a talk with Dad about you
-- when he gets home this afternoon."
Old Nick's castle.
Bertie Van Alstyne, Esquire, his father's hope and pride, breakfasts early -- in the afternoon.
"I want to talk to you about the way you treat Mark."
I am destitute and very ill. I must see you. Henrietta Reynolds
"You keep away -- I'll see her, and try to get your letters back."
"If you'll stop talking I'll see what I can do for your Mark."
Bertie had been in love for years and decided something must be done about it.
Nick's ward, Agnes, was the girl
Bertie loved. He had confided this -
- to his sister and his valet -- but had never mentioned it to her.
"Agnes has telegraphed that she's coming home from school today."
"Don't get excited ---- you'll have plenty of time to meet her ---
- the train doesn't arrive until 6:30."
"What's happened to you lately?
Getting home at daylight -
- and having a picture of Henrietta, the dancer, in your room--"
"I am leading a fast life because
I am in love with Agnes."
How to win the modern girl by Judith Blakely
How to win the modern girl. THE Modern Girl has no use for the old-fashioned man. She prefers -
- sports to saints. Few girls now-a-days can resist a dashing, gambling, drinking devil.
Agnes was to arrive at the Grand Central -
- so Bertie went to meet her at the Pennsylvania.
Six-thirty at the Grand Central.
Agnes was an orphan -- whom Nick has brought up as his own child.
"Nobody met me."
"The saphead! I suppose he forgot all about you."
"Ask Hutchins to let me know as soon as Mr. Bertie comes in."
"Mr. Bertie is never home before three in the morning, Miss."
"I was waiting for someone
-- but she didn't come."
Trash
The Gay White Way failing to cheer Bertie - his friends try the side streets.
"I'm having rotten luck -- lend me a couple of thousand."
"Are those things worth two thousand dollars?"
"What are they made of?"
"I'm awfully tired of this -- would you mind very much if I stop?"
"Your winnings, Mr. V.
-- thirty-eight thousand."
"Are you quite sure you can spare it?"
Bertie sees a chance to get a real reputation as a sport --
"Will you see to arresting me, please?"
Morning
RAID ON GAMBLING PALACE.
SON OF NICHOLAS VAN ALSTYNE
AMONG THOSE PRESENT.
Young Men of Prominent Families
Given Free Ride to Police Station.
"But they might come and take him to jail!"
"Is it true you were in that dreadful place?"
"I was there because I love Agnes."
"If you love Agnes, why didn't you meet her?"
"I did -- but she didn't come."
"Bertie -- you've changed somehow."
"I heard you tell Rose that you loved me -- and I love you, too."
"I've tricked you into loving me -- when you know the truth -
- I'm afraid you won't care for me any more."
"Tell me --"
"I'm good!"
"I've tried my best to get over it -- but I can't -- and I still kneel down -
- and say my prayers every morning -- before I go to bed."
"Bertie, who is Henrietta?"
"I bought her picture- but I never met her."
"Agnes, you'd better go."
"You've got to get out and shift for yourself --
- this is the last check you'll get from me!"
Bankers Trust Company
10,000 $   -  Nicholas Van Alstyne
"How can you be so cruel!
I love Bertie, whether you do or not, and I'm going to be his wife!"
"If you've had the impertinence to ask Agnes to marry you--"
"-- I suppose I've got to give you a little more."
Bankers Trust Company
"Not another cent!"
"Not another word about marrying
Agnes until you go to work ----
- and make something of yourself!"
Poor Bertie-- cut off with a million -- moved into humble quarters at the Ritz.
Watson Flint -- Nick's broker, and a friend of the family.
"I've got to go into business like you and Mark Turner."
Dearest Agnes, you wanted me to go into business so I have gone.
"I bought a seat on the Stock Exchange for a hundred thousand dollars."
"A hundred thousand dollars for a seat?"
"Well, furniture is way up now-a-days."
"I want to show you an engagement ring."
"You asked me to look after it, sir."
"If father won't let us marry, perhaps you'll keep it to remember me by."
"No matter what Uncle Nick says, I'll marry you whenever you want me --"
"We can't now, Bertie -- we must make arrangements first --
- let's say next Tuesday!"
"Leon, we're to be married secretly Tuesday evening --
- please make all the arrangements."
"It would be a wonderful surprise for her --
- if we could only get it ready in time."
"We must!"
You can never be sure a woman will be on time -- even for her wedding.
"I'm going to marry Bertie tonight."
"But, Agnes -- you mustn't run away
-- we'll have the wedding here!"
"Get out one of her little white dresses
-- and she can wear my wedding veil."
"I'll manage father, and send for the Reverend Murray Hilton."
"I took you into business because Rose wanted me to -
- and you're making good!"
"I've given you power of attorney because
I'm going on a cruise Wednesday -
- and you'll be in charge while I'm away."
"Bertie and Agnes are going to be married tonight --"
"Perhaps they've locked her up."
"All right -- let 'em be married in here
-- or down cellar -- or on the roof --"
"-- but I won't see them."
"I have called for Agnes."
"I'm through with you --"
"-- and as for Agnes, she has disobeyed me --"
"Now ask Bertie to forgive you."
"We're going to be married here!"
For the Minister
"Anything else?"
"I'll put one in every pocket -- then when the minister asks me -- there you are!"
Henrietta Reynolds
518 S. Vine St, Omaha, Nebraska
"If I die -- promise me you'll put these into Mrs. Turner's hands."
"I want Mrs. Turner!"
"Henrietta is dead -- and I gave her my sacred word I'd put these into your hands."
A dying mother appeals to you -
Have mercy on my little one. -
- The letters from her father which I send with this will tell you the rest.
Henrietta Reynolds
"I'm sorry this blow has come, Rose
-- I've tried to keep it from you --"
"Bertie, these belong to you
---- they're from Henrietta."
Bertie's valet had planned a great surprise for the bridal couple.
Tortured by thoughts of Agnes
-- Bertie hopes a visit to -
- the Stock Exchange may help him to forget.
"This is a new member
-- Mr. Van Alstyne."
"Mr. Turner wants to see you at
Van Alstyne's office right away."
"Do all these seats cost a hundred thousand dollars?"
HE'S NEW
MAKE HIM WELCOME
Knowing that the truth about Henrietta
Reynolds must soon come to light,
Mark has induced Nick to go on his yachting trip as planned.
With Nick out of the way, Mark sees a chance to clean up a fortune -
- before his relations with Henrietta
Reynolds are discovered.
"Mr. Van Alstyne notified you that I would be in -
- complete authority here during his absence -- ?"
"I want you to sell 'Henrietta
Mine' until you have -
- knocked the price down fifty points!"
"I can't accept a commission of that size without security."
"Great heavens, Turner! -- these securities belong to your father-in-law!"
"While he is away they are mine."
Bertie's introduction to the Floor grows more and more informal.
"All they do here is knock off hats -- but I enjoy it -- it occupies the mind."
"I'm going out to get some new ones so I can play it again."
The raid on Henrietta.
"They've started a raid on 'Henrietta'
-- you ought to be on the Floor!"
"When I want your advice
I'll send for you!"
"Mr. Tildon of the National City is here."
BIG SLUMP IN HENRIETTA MINING STOCK
"Mr. Van Alstyne won't return for a week
-- and Mr. Turner is in charge."
"Tell Turner if we don't receive collateral by three o'clock we'll be forced to -
- throw Van Alstyne's holdings on the market!"
"Thank God you've come, sir!"
"Thank God!
I was seasick--"
...PA           ...HEN               ...INP
"Call up Mr. Tildon -- and send to the Stock Exchange for Mark Turner!"
"Mr. Turner hasn't been on the Floor today!"
"Mark Turner is responsible for this raid, sir."
"Because he's a cheat -
I found out he was responsible for -
- that Henrietta girl, and put the blame on Mr. Bertie-"
"I'm sorry to hurry you -- but it's two-thirty, and your securities must be in the bank before the market closes."
"It's almost three o'clock.
There's nothing on earth I can do."
"You're too late. Flint's on the Floor now, knocking the last breath out of -
- the 'Henrietta' -- and I can buy your holdings for next to nothing!"
"Get the police!"
"All the police in the world can't prevent your losing control of the Henrietta Mine -
- when the gong rings in the
Stock Exchange!"
-HENRIETTA
-HENRIETTA
-HENRIETTA
-HENRIETTA!
-HENRIETTA!!
-HENRIETTA!!
-HENRIETTA
-HENRIETTA
-HENRIETTA
"Sir, you're insulting me!-- and I demand that you stop yelling that woman's name!"
HENRIETTA!
HENRIETTA
"They're all yelling that woman's name at me --
- and I can't make them stop!"
"Bertie, listen! -- I'll tell you something that will stop them!"
"Every time you hear a man yelling 'Henrietta' -
- you grab him and say -- 'I TAKE IT'!"
It seems to Bertie that the whole Stock Exchange -
- is taunting him by yelling
Henrietta's name.
"She's up forty points and going like a rocket!"

"I've been saved, Flint!
-- saved by a miracle!"
"It was no miracle -- it was Bertie!
He's the latest member of -
- the Stock Exchange!"
"He's bought a cottage on Long Island
-- this is his address."
"I have been on the Floor of the Stock Exchange."
"Why, my boy -- you've saved 'Henrietta'!"
"I mean the Henrietta mine! Now get dressed, because I've sent for
Agnes and the minister."

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Stupendous
Story of Adventure And Romance

Introducting Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the story.
I have wrought my simple plan
If I give one hour of joy
To the boy who's half a man
Or the man who's half a boy.
LONDON
I have a presentiment that you are going to propose, Ed.
I do wish you wouldn't, for this are so much nicer as they are.
But why can't you love me, Gladys?
Now tell me what's amiss with me.
I will only marry a man of great deeds and strange experiences...
- a man who can look death in the face without flinching!
In the office of the
London-Record Journal.
I want your legal advice. Profesor
Challenger threatens to sue my paper... for doubting his yarn about live dinosaurs.
FAMOUS ZOOLOGISTS RETURNS FROM SOUTH
AMERICA WITHOUTH PROOFS OF STRANGE TALE
Profesor Challenger, well-known author and scientist, has returned to London...
...with a strange tale of Mammoths,
Pterodoctyls and other prehistoric monsters...
...roaming at large somewhere on the upper reaches of the Amazon. Unfortunately...
...for the professor's reputation for veracity, he refuses to give the exact location of his alleged...
...discoveries, and still more unfortunately, the photographs in his possession are so badly damaged...
(when the Professor's canoe is said to have been overturned)
...that they certainly cannot be acepted...
...as evidence in this case.
I believe Challenger is insane!
He nearly killed three reporters
I sent to interview him today!
Mr. McArdle, couldn't you send me on a dangerous assignment?
All I need is an opportunity -
You seem very anxious to lose your life!
Have you been interviewing
Challenger, Malone?
Don't apologize - hurry over to Zoological
Hall and cover Challenger's lecture.
Reporters are barred
- but get in!
There's Sir John Roxton
- famous hunter and explorer.
He's here to check up on
Challenger's cock-and-bull story.
Well, Malone, we're in for a lively session tonight.
- the students are out in force to heckle old Challenger.
Challenger has made himself a public laughing
- stock by his tale about live dinosaurs!
What can he hope to gain by such lies?
The back country of the
Amazon contains over...
...fifty thousand miles of unexplored water-ways.
Who can say what may be living in that jungle - as vast as all Europe?
But how can Challenger's story be true?
These creatures have all been dead ten million years!
You might at least do him the justice to hear him state his own case.
Reporters are barred-
...if I show my press pass I'll get kicked out. I wonder if you -
Gladly - I'll take you in on my pass.
That's profesor Summerlee, the eminent coleopterist.
- owing to lack of proofs, this
Society cannot sponsor Profesor...
...Challenger's statement, but is glad to afford him this opportunity to state his case, and, we trust, clear his name.
Bring on your mastodons!
Bring on your mammoths!
I will - if any of you spineless worms are brave enough to go back with me...
...into the trackless jungles where these monsters live!
I told you old Challenger is sincere!
And I'm not here tonight to defend my statements - but to demand that...
...a committee be formed to go back to the Lost World with me -
Looks like a riot.
It's a beastly shame!
When dealing with undeveloped minds,
...it is useless to appeal to reason
- for they have none!
I am calling for volunteers!
Volunteers to face death - or worse
- for the sake of science.
I am sixty-seven years of age - but, because I think you are a liar and a fraud -
I accept your challenge, sir!
Accepted! Better an old fool - than a young coward!
I'm neither a student nor a scientist
- but I'd like to be counted in on this!
My friend, Sir John Roxton!
Accepted!
Your record as a hunter of big game will add weight to your testimony - if we return!
Professor Challenger,
I'd like to go on this expedition!
Probably the brain of a child
- but the body of an athlete.
Accepted.
What is your name?
Edward E. Malone -
And your occupation?
I- I'm a-a-er-a reporter, sir.
London-Record Journal.
Take me home - I've had enough of this!
Eleven Enmore Park, Kensington, West!
Professor Challenger, I've got to go on this expedition! The girl...
...I'm engaged to won't marry me until I've faced death or -
This man attacked me!
Do you give him in charge, sir?
No. I was to blame.
I intruded upon him.
Now, sir, can't we talk this expedition over sanely?
Sir John Roxton is a friend of mine-
Why didn't you mention that before?
You've hurt another nice young man!
I saw you from the dining room window!
If my husband gets abusive again - just call me!
You betrayed a glimmer of intelligence just now while talking to the policeman-
Sit down!
Do you want to join this expedition because you believe my statements are true?
Austin!
Tell Miss White
I wish to see her at once!
Have you shown Malone - the diary?
Property of Maple White?
BRONTOSAURUS
Miss Paula White - daughter of poor Maple White - the unfortunate explorer whose notebook you hold in your hands.
Miss White was her father's trained assistant.
She will tell you why she came to me.
I was in camp with jungle fever when my father...
...went up to explore that terrible plateau.
Carnivorous beast Allosaurus.
Evidently already almost externet even lea for I saw few of they.
A Living Brontosaurus
You mean that you actually saw living descendants of these monsters...
...that are supposed to have been dead for millions of years?
Yes, they were tremendous in size and ferocity.
Our bearers were so terrified they deserted-
...carrying me back to the coast - leaving my father...
...marooned up there - with those beasts -
He would go
- in spite of what we had - seen.
My husband promised to raise funds for a rescue party - but instead of...
...getting people to help him, he throws them out of windows and things!
Why, this is a great
human interest story -
And even if my paper was not convinced of the scientific value of your statements -
...it might finance a rescue party provided that the exclusive publication rights-
I'll swear not to send an article back to my paper without your full approval, sir!
If Sir John Roxton will go with me -
I believe we can make my managing editor see this thing!
I'm sure you know why I am going on this rescue party, Paula - don't you?
LIVERPOOL
AMAZON RIVER
I will not bore those whom this narrative may reach by an account of our voyage.
Eventually we found ourselves in that no-man's-land...
...which is formed by the half-defined frontiers...
...between Peru,
Brazil and Colombia.
The sealed map we promised Challenger to not open untill we arrived here is only...
...a blank page.
Excepting a miracle, our expedition seems to have come to a premature end.
May I come in?
From henceforth
I take command of this expedition.
Let it be clear that you are all perfectly helpless without me!
If that mischievious beast is to go with us,
I remain behind!
Jocko knows which berries and roots in the forest are edible, and which are poisonous...
- he will be far more use to us than you, my dear sir!
RECORD
EXPLORERS REACH LAST
OUTPOST OF CIVILIZATION
Record-Journal Party Searching for Lost Scientist to Make Way into Mystery World via Secret Rivers.
MAY NOT BE HEARD
FROM AGAIN FOR MONTHS
It's a Brazilian sloth - they always walk head downward. See the baby clinging to her?
Dear Mr. McArdle: It is three weeks since we sent back the canoes...
...and tonight we are camping at the base of the great plateau upon which...
...Maple White was marooned.
Challenger has guided us to this spot, and proven that...
...the Plateau is a fact -
...but we have no reason to believe that any monsters are roaming...
...about up there.
In fact, I don't think...
They're not cubs - but full grown
"spectacle bears" - great camp followers.
Paula says her father felled one of the trees on that pinnacle so that it dropped across...
...the chasm and made a bridge.
You can still see the stump of the old tree.
In the morning we'll climb the pinnacle - and drop the other tree over.
A Pterodactyl -
...proving definitely that the statements in poor Maple White's diary are true!
A Brontosaurus
- feeding merely on leaves.
Perfectly harmless - unless it happens to step on us.
Who would believe this! My elephant gun might as well be a bean-shooter!
Great guns!
We can't get back!
We're prisoners
- exactly like Maple White!
That means our folk are still alive!
What are you thinking of, Paula
- in this lost world of ours?
I was thinking if my father were still alive
- he would have seen our fire...
- and come to us.
An Allosaurus - a meat-eater - the most vicious pest of the ancient world.
The barrier might as well thistle-down
- and fire may not work with the next one...
- we've got to find a safe camp!
Jocko will be mighty lonesome down here without Miss.
Paula
- he climbed that big rock...
...this morning to get to her - he can't bear that girl out of his sight!
I have an idea! After supper bring all those hammocks into the tent!
We must establish camp here - our only refuge from these monsters -
...if we'll live long enough to search for your father.
Now that we've found these caves we could live here the rest of our lives -
...if we had some weapon capable of making a dent in a dinosaur!
I am now inventing such a weapon.
We can't rest until every inch of this plateau is explored!
It's miles in length - your father may have found other caves -
When I release the tree it will snap back with terrific force -
...and by calculating the curve the rock will describe as it rushes through the air-
A curve? Nonsense! Any school boy could tell you the rock will describe a parabola.
A curve!
A parabola!
I was right - you described a curve!
We'll work all night and make enough ladder to get you in the morning.
Fine! But how in thunder do you expect to get it up to us?
Bring Miss Paula to call Jocko - he'll climb anything to get to her!
There's only a small cave above this -
...but your father must be somewhere on the plateau...
- it's impossible to get away!
Do you mean we are to be here - always?
What difference does it make where we are
Paula - so long as we are - together?
But your engagement to - Gadys?
Paula, dear, we're as cut off from the world and its obligations and promises...
...as if we were on the moon.
I'm going to ask Professor
Summerlee to marry us.
You know he used to be a minister.
Go hunt up the professors
- I have something to - tell Paula-
A lovely specimen!
We'll stalk it and observe its habits!
That dormant volcano is waking!
The whole plateau will be covered in lava!
But this has been going on for hours -
I'm afraid they're lost -
If they get back we must be here to show them the way to the tunnel opening.
It's their only hope of escape!
The professors and Mr. Malone are safe - they'll be here in a minute or two!
I certainly hope that mud holds!
We're back in the world
- and its obligations.
Why should we let Gladys rob us of happiness, Paula?
I can't steal my happiness from another woman.
I'm Major Hibbard, of the
Brazilian geodetic Survey.
Yesterday I saw a cloud of smoke over the plateau -
And we smoked out quite a rat, Major!
I'd give my entrie personal fortune to get that beast to London - alive!
I'll send for men to dredge out this stream
- built a steel cage and a raft -
...and when the big rains come next month, we might float your "rat" out!
If we once could get our raft as far as the Amazon, you could charter a steamer from there!
Later - In London.
Tonight you will not jeer -
...for I have brought back a living proof of my statements!
May I ask what you mean when you say
"proof", Professor Challenger?
A living Brontosaurus
- nearly sixty feet long...
...from the nose to the tip of the tail!
Mr. Edward Malone, through whose efforts this expedition, was financed, is now superintending the unloading of the monster...
...from the ship we chartered-
The message I have been expecting has come!
I'll inform you in a moment when and where the Brontosaurus will be on view!
As we swung the cage out over the dock the cables broke-
The fall smashed the cage
- and it got out!
It's running wild
- the streets are in an uproar!
My Brontosaurus has escaped! Keep off the streets, untill I recapture it!
This is outrage - we've been hoaxed again -
Challenger should be run out of town!
How d'ydo, Gladys.
You see I'm - back.
And, as you really owe it all to me,
I hope you'll forgive me - for not waiting.
My husband, Percy Potts.
May I ask what great stunt, what heroic deed Mr. Potts performed -
...to win you, Gladys?
That was just my girlish whim!
Percy is a clerk at a store, and has never been out of London in his life!
Excuse me!
She didn't wait for me - she's married!
That's Sir John Roxton
- sportsman.

{126357}{126456}...foul monsters, shapes of death|beset the path?
{126532}{126607}A hundred years have I been here.
{126611}{126731}Many have gone this way|and none returned.

{128159}{128274}In Bagdad, the pavilion|of the Princess...
{128682}{128804}He too may return by the seventh moon.
{129111}{129259}... but his road is hard.|You must pray for him.

{129823}{129897}The Valley of Fire...
{131879}{131936}The second moon.
{131990}{132198}In search of rare treasure, The Persian Prince|came to the bazaars of Shiraz.
{132855}{132978}A crippled beggar knew a priceless secret.

{139749}{139874}In search of rare treasure,|the Prince of the Indies...
{139878}{140028}...came to a forgotten idol|near Kandahar.

{143862}{144023}The Old Man of the|Midnight Sea.

{144925}{145071}There thou wilt find a star-shaped key.
{150886}{151035}Now you must climb to the|Abode of the Winged Horse.

{153144}{153260}A court magician knew|a secret shrine.
{155691}{155761}The magic apple...
{156534}{156591}That fisherman.
{159913}{160039}Far rarer than India's crystal|or Persia's carpet.
{160291}{160361}Thou wilt haste to Bagdad and,|at the end of
{160365}{160442}this sixth moon, give order|that the Prince be poisoned.
{160488}{160616}The Citadel of the Moon...
{161003}{161159}The magic chest is wrapped|in a cloak of invisibility.
{161537}{161724}The Cloak of Invisibility|and the Magic Chest...
{162607}{162714}At the end of the|sixth moon...
{164765}{164975}A day's journey from Bagdad..|again the caravansary in the desert.
{166231}{166313}Let us haste to Bagdad.
{166643}{166768}O Prince of the Indies,|discover this with the crystal.
{166772}{166921}...Does the Princess wait as she pledged?
{167966}{168032}Spread the flying carpet.
{168203}{168349}With the magic apple we|shall save her life.
{169337}{169457}The learned doctor,|Zakariya of Kufa.

{174871}{174996}I was at the portals of death|and now I glow with health.
{175000}{175089}...What miracle is this?
{175439}{175489}I was I who brought you back.

Three different negatives were created for the film Der letzte Mann.
One of them was for Germany, one for general export, and the third for the US A.
The surviving German negative was preserved only incompletely, and was reconstructed in 2001/2002 with the aid of the following materials: an original negative from the
Bundesarchiv-Filmarchiv Berlin: a print from the Museum of
Modern Art, New York, produced in Germany in 1936: fragments of a duplicate possessed by the
Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Stiftung of a missing German print: as well as fragments of a print kept by the Cin√©math√®que Suisse in Lausanne.
The reconstruction took place in cooperation with the Bundesarchiv-Filmarchiv,
Berlin / Koblenz: the Cin√©math√®que Suisse, Lausanne: the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and the
Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Stiftung,

THE LAST MAN
In the Lead-Role:
EMIL JANNINGS
Direction:
F. W. MURNAU
Today, you are the first, respected by everyone, a minister, a general, maybe even a prince... -
Do you know what you'll be tomorrow?!
For tlhe Weddlng Guests however, due to your period of service of many years' standing, we've created an open position for you by sending the oldest employee of our firm to a shelter, effective today.
The reason for this measure is your old-age.
Here, at the place of his humiliation, the old man would waste away miserably for the rest of his life and here the story would, strictly speaking, be over.
But the author is looking out for him who has been abandoned by everyone, and so he bestows upon him an epilogue, telling a story that... - unfortunately... - usually doesn't occur in real life.
A SENSATIONAL INHERITANCE
As reported a short time ago, the celebrated Mexican multimillionaire
Mr. A. G. Monen died whilst washing his hands in the lavatory of the Atlantic-Hotel.
Upon going through his papers, a sensational will for this eccentric man was found to the effect that the person in whose arms he would happen to die was to become the sole heir to his enormous fortune.
Hence, the biblical promise, that the last shall be the first, seems already to have been fulfilled on earth, for the lucky one is... -

NOSFERATU THE VAMPIRE
According to Bram Stokers Dracula.
Adapted freely by Henrik Galeen.
Realisation:
F. W. Murnau
Costumes and decorations:
Albin Grau
ACT I
Report on the great mortality which prevails in Wisborg in the year of grace 1838
It is words lugubrious like the call of a bird of death.
Take care not to say them or your life will be populated shades and the phantoms which will haunt your dreams will be nourished of your blood.
I reflected a long time with the mortality which had struck my birthplace.
Here its history.
In Wisborg lived Hutter and his young woman Ellen
"Why you killed... these beautiful flowers?"
"Not so quickly, my young friend!
Nobody escapes from his destiny."
There was certain Knock, realtor.
All kinds of noises ran on him.
But it paid its people well.
"count Orlok, the lord of Transylvania... wishes to buy a beautiful house in our city..."
"You could earn much money..."
"Even if that costs a little efforts, of sweat... and perhaps a little blood... "
"He would like a beautiful abandoned house..."
"This house... opposite yours.
Propose it to him!"
"you start, my young friend, and made happy voyage to the country of the phantoms."
"I leave to travel far, to the country of the robbers and the phantoms."
Hutter left the concerned young woman
Under the protection of
Harding the ship owner & his sister
"Would be without fear."
After having traversed many dusty roads, the young person Hutter finally saw the summits of Carpates the horses tired.
"I have to eat... quickly.
I must go to the chateau of the count
Orlok!"
"do not go further. there are werewolf  in the wood."
VAMPIRES
Malfaisants spirits with the damned heart
Nosferatu nourishes on human blood.
It lives in the caves and in coffins, in the ground maudite of the cemeteries of Pestif√©r√©s
"more quickly!
The sun drops!"
"Pay what you want!
We will not go further!"
"let us not go there!
This place is sinister!"
As soon as Hutter had crossed the bridge, its fears, that it had entrusted to me, were not long in materializing.
"You made me wait.
It is almost midnight.
The servants sleep!"
END Of ACT I
ACT II
"You hurt yourself... Invaluable blood!"
"do you Want to hold me a little company, very expensive?
"There remains time until the rising of the sun and the day, my good,
I sleep of the deepest sleep." the paddle dissipated the shades of the night.
My love! My beloved! would not be sad to know me with far. the mosquitos are a true plague, they have bitten me around the neck.
One sleeps badly in this afflicted castle but is not worried.
At night, a spectral light seemed to animate the castle.
"Your wife has a splendid neck..."
"I buy the abandoned house...
We will be close... "
To continue its pitiful life
Nosferatu drinks the blood of its victims.
Take guard that its demonic shade does not torment your dreams.
At the same time
"a doctor... a doctor!"
"a benign congestion." the doctor allotted the anguishes of Ellen to an unknown disease.
But I know that your heart answered the call of the bird of death.
Nosferatu unfolded its wings.
Hutter sought to include/understand the terror of its nights. the boatmen did not know which terrible burden they went down in the valley.
END Of ACT II
ACT III
"Of the peasants transported it yesterday, at the hospital.
They say that it made a fall.
It is still feverish..."
"Of the coffins..."
Nosferatu was on the way.
The danger approached Wisborg. professor Bulwer, who studied the secrecies of nature, had spoken to me about it.
One had charged on Empusa of the coffins filled with ground. ship must even take the sea this night
Loading of Empusa Destination: Wisborg
At the same time, professor Bulwer explained to his pupils the cruelty of the plants carnivores. the secrecies of nature appeared in horrified eyes.
"is not this... like a vampire!"
It seems that the approach of malfaisant Nosferatu the realtor had a knock on influence.
"yesterday the patient had a delerious crisis."
"blood, it is the life!"
"See this one..."
"polyp with tentacles..."
"Transparency... Almost incorporeal... "
"A few things close, a phantom..."
"Of the spiders...!"
Ellen often walked in the loneliness of the dunes.
Its sadness flew away towards its beloved, while its eyes scanned the waves and the horizon.
My love! My beloved! would not be sad to know me with far.
The mosquitos are a true plague, they have bitten me around the neck.
One sleeps badly in this afflicted castle, but is not worried
"Now, I must leave... to regain the house as fast as possible!"
New epidemic of Black plague in the seaports.
Young people are decimated in mass.
All the victims carry the same wounds to the neck whose origin is still a enigma for the doctors.
Dardanelles are closed with all the suspect ships.
"a sailor is sick. The fever makes him delirious." the first sailor reached of this disease involved all the crew with him, in the black tomb of the waves
The evening, the captain and his second immersed their last comrade.
"I go down! If I am not there in ten minutes..." the ship of death had a new captain.
END Of ACT III
ACT IV
In spite of its weakness,
Hutter overcame the difficulties of the voyage the funeral breath of Nosferatu inflated the veils of the ship which sailed a such spectrum towards its goal.
"I must join it. It arrives!"
"the Master arrives..."
I wondered a long time about these coffins filled with ground that Nosferatu had carried. the vampires were to rest in this damned ground to preserve their diabolic capacities.
"It does not have there heart which lives on board."
July 12.The crew: a captain, a leading seaman, a foam, five sailors.
July 13. A sailor reached of fever.
Cape: south, south-west.
Direction of the wind: the North-East.
July 14. State of the sailor worsens.
The fever makes him delirious.
July 22. Rats on board. Danger of plague.
"Danger of plague!
Return on your premise! You barricade!"
Opinion with the population.
The plague is in the city. do not leave your houses. The burgomaster.
END Of ACT IV
ACT V
Hutter begged Ellen to give up the book which frightened it so much.
But it could not resist strange temptation.
To continue its pitiful life
Nosferatu drinks the blood of its victims
Take guard that its demonic shade does not torment your dreams. another safety
Know that a woman is pure in the heart by offering her blood to him would make the vampire forget the song of the cock
"I have the same vision, each evening...!" the fear reigned on all the city.
Which was still healthy? Who was sick?
"I run to seek Sievers..." another safety
Know that a woman is pure in the heart by offering her blood to him would make the vampire forget the song of the cock
The terrified city sought a victim: it was Knock.
"One saw it! It fled!
It strangled the guard... "
"It strangled it... the vampire!"
"Bulwer! Will seek Bulwer!"
"One captured Knock!"
"the Master... the Master...!"
"the Master...... died."
At the same moment, as by miracle, deaths ceased and, in the victorious rays of the morning sun, one saw disappearing the shade from the bird of death.

THE CIRCUS
THE CIRCUS
"So you missed the hoop again."
"Father, I couldn't help it."
"For that you don't eat tonight."
"And you're supposed to be funny!"
"Look at that house; empty!"
Around the Side Shows hungry and broke.
"Here you are, sir."
"Count it."
"Is it all there?"
"Say, gimme that money!"
"How d'you get out of here?"
"Rotten!"
"Get off!"
"Where's the funny man?"
"Bring on the funny man!"
The Funny Man.
Meal-time after the Show.
"Father won't let me."
"Do you want a job?"
"Be here in the morning, and we'll try you out."
Early the next morning.
Hungry.
"Run along home!"
"I live here."
"Excuse me, my cane."
The Tryout.
"Go ahead and be funny."
"That's awful!"
"Put on the William Tell act."
"Now then, watch this and see if you can do it."
"Go ahead and try it."
"Put on the barber-shop act."
"Now I must hit you."
"Now hit me!"
"I can't see."
"Just a moment!"
"We haven't talked terms yet."
"Get out and stay out!"
"Show's starting!"
"Aren't you coming in?"
"You're not leaving?"
"You see, we couldn't come to terms."
"Thank you for the egg."
The Show on.
Trouble with the
Property Men.
"How about our back pay?"
"Get to work!"
"We quit!"
"They've quit."
"Get anybody!"
"Do you want a job?"
"Don't touch that button!"
"He's a sensation, but he doesn't know it."
"Keep him on as a property man."
The Circus prospered, but not the property man.
And the girl led the same hard life.
"Keep him busy and don't let him know he's the hit of the show."
A Sick Horse.
"Blow this pill down the horse's neck!"
"The horse blew first --"
"Open the door, quick!"
"I told you the lions were dangerous!"
"Where's that pill?"
"Come here!"
"I've got to see a doctor!"
"It's a shame the way they make you work --"
"And you the hit of the show."
"Why of course!"
"All the crowds, all the applause is just for you."
"I knew it!"
"If you strike that girl, I'll quit!"
"And what's more
I want what I'm worth --"
"I'll give you fifty dollars a week."
"Sixty!"
"I'll double it!"
"Nothing less than a hundred."
The Next Show.
The success of the Tramp made life easier for the girl and himself.
"Oh, Merna, you must have your fortune told!"
"I see love and marriage with a dark, handsome man who is near you now."
A New Added Attraction,
Rex, a tight-rope walker.
"Pardon me."
"Go right ahead."
"I'll give you
Five Dollars for it."
"It's happened; I'm in love!"
"He's a tight-rope walker."
"I've just met him."
"Hurry up, you're on!"
The Act Over.
"What's the matter?"
"You hardly got a laugh!"
"This is my friend."
"I don't like tight-rope walkers."
Time brought many changes to the Circus;
New Hopes and
New Ambitions.
His New Ambition.
"Never mind the rope."
"You'd better try and be funny again or you'll go!"
The next performance- and not a smile.
"I've had enough of this;"
"You get one more chance."
"Where's Rex?"
"Rex, the tight-rope walker, hasn't shown up."
"Is Rex here?"
"You can do the act, can't you?"
"You'll do it or quit!"
"I'll do it; find his clothes!"
"There's the clothes!"
"You follow her!"
"He'll kill himself."
"That's all right;"
"I've got him insured."
"Take your time, there's another act to go on."
"Why, what is the meaning of this?"
"I am taking his place on the rope."
"You'll get killed."
"Oh, no, I have a charmed life."
"I'll give you five dollars if you'll do it."
"Not a word to anybody."
"Please don't do this."
"You've forgotten your tights."
"You're on!"
"You're through!!!"
That Night.
"I've run away from the circus."
"I'll never go back."
"Can't you take me with you?"
"I've got an idea."
"You stay here."
"Have you seen Merna?"
"She's run away --"
"I can do nothing for her -- --"
"Now, there's one way out."
"She's there now?"
"Take me to her!"
The Next Morning.
The Circus ready to leave.
"So you've come back -- You -- !"
"You're speaking to my wife!"
"Will you go on with the show?"
"-- -- if you take him."
"The end wagon for you."
"Come in with us."

I had to meet you because I was charmed by that lovely curl of hair.
Then I give it to you and hope you have a nice time
Now, yhat wasn't a very clever line, was it?
I'm Jill Cheyne, and I have a letter of introduction to
Mr. Hamilton
              ...Carmelita Geraghty
... that was all the money
I had, and now I don't know what to do!
Well, you can stay with me, and tomorrow I'll take you in to see Mr. Hamilton
This is my fiance back home.
I was getting nowhere, keeping company to an old lady out in the country.
I went to the theater straight from the station
Did you expect him to hire you just like that, with the cab waiting?
The man who gave me the letter said he was a good friend of
Hamilton's, so I thought...
Well, don't worry about it, luckily you have me to take care of you.
Passion Flowers
The Entire Company to be on stage for full rehearsal tomorrow, wednesday,
June 5th. at 11 a.m. Sharp
Stage Manager
Take a chance, Mr. Hamilton, and I'll show you some real hot steps!
No, I haven't danced anywhere professionally
Folks, I have a great artist here, who has never been on stage in her life but is sure she can show us how to dance.
Just anything in the charleston line will do.
I hate to admit it but you're pretty good. How's five pounds a week?
You know I'm better than that.
I'll take twenty to start.
Patsy, Miss Jill's fiance is here.
You must be the roommate, Patsy!
Jill was written me how nice you've been to her. I'm Hugh
Fieldding.
Sorry Jill isn't in right now, she's trying on a costume for the new revue.
At Hamilton's apartment
Let's not have any suggestions like that...
...until I have my own place
I could invite you to!
My company is sending me to the plantation overseas for two years - but after that I'll have enough to marry, and 
Jill has promissed to wait.
Patsy, I asked Mr.Levet to pick me up here. We work for the same outfit.
                 Miles Mander
In fact, Levet is already stationed out here, and is here for a two-month furlough.
We'll be working on the same plantation.
You have no idea, Miss Brand, how empty and lonely life out there...
Do you believe in love?
Her number's coming up next!
I'm so lucky to have a terrific girl for a fiancee!
May you have not only fame,
Jill, but also happiness!
This is Prince Ivan, Jill.
He wants to congratulate you in person.
It is a rare pleasure to watch you perform, and I intend to indulge myself often.
I know how you feel, Hugh, but I'll steer her away from these stage-door tomcats if I can.
I'm afraid poor Hugh has a rather dewy-eyed conception of his childhood sweetheart.
Soon after Hugh's departure overseas, Jill took a step up in the theatrical world.
Dear Paley
I am so sorry to leave you so soon but
I have had the opportunity to take a tiny furuislud flat for myself, because you will value that I couldn't stay in cheap lodgings
I am nearly a slave
Jill 
Midfull of her promise to
Hugh, Patsy makes a last attempt to straighten out
Jill.
Aren't you afraid of your reputation as a kept woman?
I cannot stand by and watch you throw yourself away like this...
...especially with a fine man like Hugh waiting for you!
Would you believe it, Prince, one of my casual friends form the chorus is trying to run my life!
I'm worried about Jill, Mr.
Levet. I promised to keep her out of danger, and now she's fooling around with that phony Prince.
I wouldn't woory, Patsy, that girl knows exactly what she's doing - and she likes it.
Odd, isn't it - he never barked at Hugh.
Maybe because he had no reason to be jealous of Hugh
I've got to nahd it to Jill - she'll make that fool marry her yet, I bet!
Patsy - I have only a short time here - can't we share our loneliness together?
There's a month left before
I have to go back out there for two years. What do you say?
If you are proposing, then my answer is Yes. I have come to love you in the last few weeks.
I'd like to, Patsy, but it really wouldn't be fair to you.
My position with the firm is no such that they'd let me take a wife out there.
I'll be glad to keep working and wait - as Mrs.Levet!
And I know you'll work your way up so you can send for me very soon.
...and he fixed it up so we can get married the day after tomorrow!
For a honeymoon, he's taking me to Italy!
I'm so happy!
The day of the wedding.
Sorry, Cuddles - I can't take you with me, but I'll be back in a month.
Honeymooning at Lake Como.
I asked God to grant us a happy life life together.
Don't let these thieving little brats make a fool of you!
You threw away the rose
I gave you.
Had to - it had wilted.
Glad to see you again, old chap. Tell me about Jill.
Sorry but, to tell you the truth, I didn't see her since she moved to her own place.
Still working at the Pleasure
Garden, Patsy now lives for but one thing ... the first letter from her husband.
Stop worrying so much - you can find a girl just as good or better anywhere.
Dear patsy,
I must go to him - he's sick and my place is with him.
Jill, all I ask is enough money to pay my fare out there.
Can't do, patsy - I'm spending everthing on my trousseau.
The Prince and I will be married soon.
How about Hugh's engagement ring, then - surely you won't need that now!
She's marrying the Prince and wouldn't lend me a penny!
You must be crazy if you think I could ever stay with you after this!
You filthy animal!
You're my wife - so you've got to stay with me!
Please take me away from here - this man's crazy!
Listen, maybe you can help nurse his friend, who's down with the fever, until you have to catch your next boat.
Poor Hugh, I'll stay with you until you get well!
Jill, my darling ... so good of you to come!
How about a kiss, sweetheart?
Patsy! It's you!
What happened?
That's my wife you're fooling around with, Hugh - and you'll pay for it!
You'd better come back, unless you want to see him with his head bashed in!
I can't let him go on like this while he's out of his mind. I'll go with him for now but will return as soon as I can.
Get away from me - my wife's here now. I don't need you any more!
She wants me to use the sword - she won't let me rest until
I've killed you, too!
Hugh told me what happened.
I'm having him brought in.
Don't thank me, Patsy - just seeing you saved my life, and I'm simply paying you back.
I'm sorry that Jill's turned out no good -
I hope you'll get over her, as I must try to get over this...
You're the only woman for me now, Patsy - I was blind not to see it before!
Coming home, Patsy
How do you like that -
Cuddles knew all the time!

Subtitle by Reza Fa
Well, we finished earlier than Ike and I expected.
- Are you going anywhere?
- No, I don't think so.
So the next time, I changed to another tailor, but found out that he was no better than the first.
I bought some pretty expensive cloth and took it to him and you should've seen the mess he made of it
I told him I wouldn't pay for the thing, but the trouble is, he's got my material.
Well, I left the suit with him and it's been there ever since.
- Good evening Miss White.
And how are you?
- I'm all right, thanks.
- I haven't seen you for a long time.
Have you come to take Frank for a walk.
Yes
- That's right.
- Well, I must push along.
- Good-night.
- Good-night Frank.
- Well dear.
- I've been waiting here half an hour for you.
- Good-night Sean.
- Good-night Frank.
Good-night George.
- Sorry sir. Full up. You'll have more room upstairs.
- Goaaannn.
I think I told you, there's more room upstairs!
Sorry Sir. Full up here. There's more room up...HEY!
Frank. I've lost one of my gloves.
I think I left it at the other table.
- Is this it?
- Yes, thanks.
Thought so, there's a hole in two fingers.
Would you like a pair of nail scissors for Christmas?
- Funny, aren't you?
- Oh Miss, Miss!
It's no good being impatient, you'll have to wait your turn.
What's the matter with you today?
Got out of bed the wrong side?
-I don't like waiting about for you.
Oh, don't you? Oh, Miss!
Do you expect the entire machinary of Scotland Yard to be held up to please you?
You and your Scotland Yard
If it weren't for Edgar Wallace nobody'd ever heard of it.
Funny, aren't you?
Anyway, what's the hurry? We're only going to the pictures, we've got all evening.
- Well, I don't think I want to go to the pictures.
- Oh, and why not?
-I've seen everything worth seeing.
- You haven't seen "Fingerprints".
I'd like to see that.
Still it's about Scotland Yard! might be amusing. They're bound to get all the details wrong.
I don't see why. I did hear they'd got a real criminal to direct it.
- So as to be on the safe side.
- Oh, oh Miss!
Oh, blast!
Well, I've ordered.
- I'll go to the pictures with you, if you like.
- uh, changed your mind.
Have you got an ashtray Miss? I never seem to get an ashtray where I sit.
Frank, Frank. I've changed my mind again.
- About what?
- About going to the pictures.
- You mean you don't want to go again?
- No, not particularly.
- Why not?
- I don't know , I just don't want to.
- Isn't that enough?
- No, it's not enough ‚Ä¶ oy, Miss!
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to get the bill.
I'm about fed up with you. lf you don't want to go, I do.
- Oh all right, I'll come too.
- oy, Miss!
Oh, don't let's have a row. I'm sorry.
I know I've been rather beastly today.
- Miss!
- Frank, I've said I'm sorry.
Here, that will cover it.
Hold on. I live here.
Do you? Then you needn't come any further.
Oh, no now I said that I'd see you home, and I will.
But I'm only just around the corner.
Do you know Whites? The newsagent?
- Yes?
In the Kings road?
Yes.
- That's my father.
No!
Yes.
Now isn't that fine?
Then we're neighbors.
- Have you ever seen an artist's studio?
- No, I'd love to.
- Come up and see mine.
- Oh, I can't now. Another time.
- Why not now?
- Why, it's so late.
- Are you frightened?
- No, course not.
Then why not now?
No, really. Thanks awfully.
I must be getting home.
- You are frightened.
- I'm certainly not ‚Ä¶ take more'n a man to frighten me.
Yes...that's what I thought....at first.
- What is the time?
- Not very late.
- Come on. What's the harm.
Oh, no harm really. Besides, I always think a girl knows instinctively when she can trust a man.
Yes, of course she does.
Do you trust me?
- Alice? May I call you Alice?
- If you like.
Come on.
- Oh Mr. Crewe. Before you go in, could I...?
- Excuse me, miss.
No!
That chap's nothing but a sponger.
Always pestering people up and down this street.
Well, here we are.
I'm right up there. Top!
Excuse me a minute, will you?
I say, I'm awfully sorry. I won't be a minute. You start walking up.
That's all right.
Oh good evening. Sorry to disturb you.
About this note, did he leave any message?
No, he wouldn't leave any message.
-Have you seen him before.
- Yes, the same gent what called here several times.
Thanks very much.
Goodnight.
Bit of a climb, wasn't it?
What a lovely room. Did you do it all yourself?
Hardly. I say, do you feel cold?
I think I'll light the fire.
- I say. That's good, isn't it?
- Oh that? Yes, that's a new one, just finished.
- How do you hold this?
- What?
Oh, that.
That's easy. I'll show you.
Oh Lord, not like that. Let me show you.
You take this and hold it like that, you see...Then you get the brush and hold it there. You try.
- Like this?
- Yes.
- Oh, look what I've done.
- Ooo, yes
- Draw something Alice.
- Shall I?
- Yes.
Rotten.
Never mind. We'll finish this masterpiece together.
Now you hold the brush. Steady.
There we are.
You are awful.
Wait a minute.
There. Already a pick ahead of me.
I'll go and get those drinks....Right you are.
I say, how would I do for one of your models?
That's an idea.
- Let's see it on you.
- Do you mean, put it on?
Yes, why not?
- Oh, it's so strong!
- Go on.....
Oh no, I don't think so. Besides I have to go home soon.
I see.
Pity. I would have like to have sketched you in it.
- Would you have really?
- Yes, but perhaps you are right. It wouldn't suit you.
I bet it would.
- Shall I really try it on?
- Yes, will you?
- All right.
- Good.
- Think this will be big enough for me.
- What?
- I said, do you think this will be big enough for me.
- Yes, I think so.
- Go on, play something.
- Wait a minute, how does that thing go?
I know.
And that's a song about you my dear.
You haven't said how you like it.
Marvellous.
- I can't do it up.
-Wait a minute. Where is this trouble?
- I can't do it all up.
- Never mind.
- How do I look?
- Wait a minute, it isn't quite right.
Put your hands there.
- I better go.
- I say.
I've got it.
- Please give it to me.
- All right, come on out.
There it is.
Don't be silly Alice. Don't be silly.
No, no, let me go! Let me go!
No, no....
- Who did you say it was?
- Mr. Crewe!
- Mr. Who?
- No! Crewe, I tell you! It's horrible!
- All right. Don't you worry. I'll send round straight away. What number did you say?
Seven or eleven?
- What?
- 31, I said.
- No, no, 31.
- Ah good. Just take a look around, will you?
- Right you are sir.
- Alice, wake up.
Anyone'd think you hadn't been asleep all night.
What do you think!? There's been a murder last night, round the corner.
They tell me the police are round there now.
We'll all be murdered in our beds, soon, I'm sure we will.
'cause I don't  think the police are what they were.
Morning, Alice. 'eard about the murder?
- Yes, I heard.
- Do you remember Frank's telephone number dear?
- No, but here, you'll find it in the book.
- I mean, some murders are so different to others aren't they?
Pushed his lady friends under the water when they was having a bath
What was his name? you remember?
I think that was ever so beastly.
It gave me the shivers.
After I read about it, I didn't dare 'ave a bath for a month.
An' for weeks after that I only used to 'ave a rinse down.
What was his name? You remember,
Smith, wasn't it?
What's wrong Alice? You don't look very cheerful this morning.
-You do look a little bit peeky, I must say.
- Dad, Alice, breakfast.
Good-morning, Mr. White.
- Good-morning, Sir, good-morning.
Breakfast!!!
I couldn't look bak'n in the face after what happened last night and under our very noses.
Mind you, I don't think, meself, it's all together the police's fault.
What I mean is, they 'ave to wink at some things.
I mean it's one thing to buy chocolates out of hours, but it's quite another to stick a knife into a gentleman.
I must say I feel the same way about that too.
A good, clean, honest whack over the 'ead with a brick is one thing....
...something British about that. But knives?
No. Knives is not right.
I must say that's what I think and that's what I'll keep.
Whatever the provocation,
I could never use a knife.
Now, mind you a knife is a difficult thing to handle.
I mean any knife.... knife.... knife.... a butcher's knife!
- Alice, cut us a bit of bread, will you?
Knife.... knife.... of a knife.... 
...you come up against a knife!
I mean, in Chelsea you mustn't use a..
KNIFE!
- Dear, you ought to be more careful.
You might have cut somebody with that.
Customer.....
- No news of the murder yet?
- No, not yet.
- Thank you. Good-morning.
- Well, I must be going. I can't stand here gossiping all day like some people.
Chatter, chatter, chatter.... give
'em a chance to talk about other people's business, and they'll take it.
- What's the matter Alice?
Had another row with Frank?
- Another customer Alice.
- Good morning, Alice.
- Dear, it's Frank. Hello Frank.
- I say, have you 'eard about our murder?
- Yes, they put me on it.
- Did they? That's good isn't it?
Well, I hope you get him Frank!
- If they do, that will mean promotion, won't it?
- D'you reck'n you'll get him soon?
- Well, uh, I don't know.
-Well, I came in here to phone.
- That's all right.
-  Alice? Come here a minute will you?
- Well I must be going now. Good-bye,
Mrs. White, good-bye,  Mr. White.
Now you two.
- Sssshhhh.....Be careful...
What happened last night?
Why don't you tell me?
Look, you know where I found that?
It's the only piece of evidence that you were there. I'm keeping it back at present.
For God's sake, say something!
- If you're not using the phone...uh, may I?
I, uh, I want to get on to Scotland Yard.
- I say.
- I want the best cigar in the shop.
Certainly sir. Perhaps you'd like to telephone while I get it down?
- No thanks, that can wait.
- What does he mean?
- Very well sir. Now, uh, what sort of a cigar would you like sir? I've got..
I' ve got 'enry Clay or Corona, Corona?
- Corona.
- Certainly sir.
- Any news of the murder.
- No, nothing yet.
- Have you heard anything?
- No, no news.
- Are you, uh, quite sure?
- What the hell business is it of yours, anyway?
- You know, I looked everywhere for that other glove last night.
But, of course, you detectives are better trained at finding these things.
- Ah, here we are sir.
- Excuse me, will you?
Thank you.
Oh, they look good.
- They ought to. I've had ' em for years.
Is it all right sir?
- Yes, I thought the top was broken, but it's all right.
- Have you a light?
- Yes, here you are.
- How silly of me, hadn't noticed it.
- Uh.. all right sir?
- Oh, ha, of course, sorry.
Extraordinary actually...
I can't quite...
I say... would you pay for this?
Is this gentleman a friend of yours, Frank?
Well, we're not exactly friends. At least not yet.
But we're going to do a little business together, aren't we, Frank?
I'll look after the shop, Father.
You go and finish your paper.
What for?
Oh....all right my dear, all right.
Rather unfortunate that poor man died around the corner last night.
Look here you....
Perhaps it's rather fortunate, that your little secret only came into the hands of a man like me.
D'you know, there are some men who would make money out of a thing like that.
What a chance for blackmail.
Oh, oh that's awful.
I couldn't do a thing like that.
Morning, Miss. Two of each there.
By the way. You're a detective.
Let me give you a tip.
Don't wave important clues in telephone boxes. They've got glass doors.
You know, uh, detectives in glass houses shouldn't wave clues.
Come on, out with it. What do you want?
What do I want?
Oooooh, well, uh...
Couldn't we discuss that over breakfast?
Mother this is a friend of Frank's. Mr.?
- Tracy.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Mr. Tracy, would you like something to eat?
- Thank-you.
- Lovely weather, we're having.
- Yes, splendid.
- Who did you say that man was?
- He's a very important friend of Frank's.
I'll get the breakfast for him.
- Here! Aren't we rude?
Won't you take my chair?
- Oh, thanks.
- Did you see, or hear anything during the night?
- No, sir.
- What time did you go to bed?
- About half past ten, sir.
- Did you write this?
- Yes.
- How old would you say this man was.
- I'm afraid I couldn't tell you, sir, he had his hat on.
- Did you notice anything particular about his clothes?
- Well, uh, he had a black hat and a loose kind of collar.
'nd a tie and that's about all, I think.
- Was he dark or fair?
- Well, you couldn't say he was a blond and you couldn't say he was a brunette. He was a bit of both, you know, kind of mousey.
- Anything else?
- No.
- Except when he spoke to you, he went like this.
- All right.
Give me records.
- Well, bring him along. Let's hear what he's got to say.
- Understood?
-Yes, sir.
- Right, get along with it..
- That'll do to go on with.
- How much longer is that man going to stay? Don't tell me he'll be here to dinner.
- Don't make things awkward mother.
It means a lot to to me and Frank.
- Well, I don't see why they should carry on their business in my parlour.
- I'll take it.
- Very well.
- But I don't like that man and the sooner he goes the better.
You are very clever.
I can see that all right.
- Frank? Just a minute will you?
A pal of yours at the Yard, said he thought you might be here.
- Oh, all right.
Hello?
Yeah. Yes.
Well, I thought you wouldn't mind if...
What?
Who?
- Any news Frank?
- Alice, lock that door.
As you were saying ... rather unfortunate the way that poor man round the corner, uh, died last night.
On the other hand, perhaps it's fortunate. For us, that is... that a suspicious looking man, with a criminal record, was seen hanging around the place.
- You....
Look here, don't you try and swing this thing on me. That won't get you anywhere.
- Also rather unfortunate, that Scotland
Yard, are at present looking for that man.
- I say, Frank!
- Just a minute Alice.
- But there's one thing you seem to have forgotten....
- Oh, and what's that?
- Before we get to any hanging,
I shall have quite a lot to say.
And the first thing I shall say is, that she was there too.
- Oh, you will, will you?
Isn't there one thing you seem to have forgotten, that our word's as good as, or perhaps a bit better...
...than that of a jailbird.
So we'll face that when the time comes.
Meanwhile, we'll just sit quietly here until the squad van arrives.
- That surprises you doesn't it?
- No, it doesn't surprise me in the least.
When it comes, the surprise won't be for me.
- Very well then, we are both satisfied.
- Yes, we're both satisfied.
It's my word, against hers.
- Frank, you can't do this.
- Why not?
- Well, because...
- Now, now, don't interfere,
Alice, I know what I'm doing.
You don't, you don't.
- Please Frank.
- Oh, for God's sake, be quiet Alice.
- Why can't you let her speak.
- You mind your own business.
In any case, she'll speak at the right moment.
- Look here Frank. Why can't we, both of us, chuck the whole thing now?
I've got nothing against you.
You've got nothing against me.
Except, of course, I had some cash from you, but I wasn't serious.
Well, look here, have it back now.
Well can't you see, that she wants to chuck it up too? And so do I, you know.
Look here, Miss. You tell him.
Tell him that he's playing with fire and...
And we shall, all of us, burn our fingers.
I'm not bad really, I only... things have gone wrong lately, and one's got to live, you know.
All right then. It's still my word against hers.
That's it?
Oy!
You men meet me in the back, Frank, follow me!
I say, it's not me you want.....
It's him.....ask him.
Why his own....
Hello. Not very often I see you so early in the day as this.
- Called to see Frank?
- No.
No, I want to see lnspector Walls, please.
-Then you'll have to fill out one of these forms, you know.
- All right.
- Do you know something about this?
- Yes.
George, just a minute.
Take this along to inspector Walls.
Well I suppose you're going to tell him who did it, Miss.
Yes.
- You can come along now
- Here you are, Miss.
- Come in, please.
Won't you sit down?
You've something to tell us about this case.
- Yes.
- Well, what is it?
Well, you see. I know who did it.
Is this worthwhile sir, now that everything has been cleared up?
Let's hear what she's got to say.
What I was going to say is this...
I'd better say, what I have to say now...
I would rather not wait.
What I wanted to say is...
- I was the one.
- One moment please.
Hello.
Yes, yes.
Yes, hold on. Will you deal with this young lady,
I shall be busy for a minute. Yes, sir.
This way Miss, please.
Alice, whatever made you come here?
I did it.
- I know.
- You don't know.
He tried oh, I can't tell you.
It's too terrible. I was defending myself.
I didn't know what I was doing and then...
- My dear.
- Ha, ha! So you found him,
Miss. Did she tell you who did it.
- Yes.
You'll want to look out, or you'll be losing your job my boy.
I suppose we'll soon have lady detectives up in the Yard, eh.
And I shall be all right on the dole, won't I.

In the great Gold Rush, Alaska was the hope and dream of men, the ruthless siren of the Far North, beckoning thousands to her icy bosom.
Beckoning thousands to her unknown regions.
Chilkoot Pass was the great barrier to the gold fields.
Over this Pass men faced untold misery and hardship.
Many lost their lives.
Some fell by the wayside, others lost courage and turned back.
But the brave went on.
Far into the icy north, deep into the silent nowhere, came an undaunted lone prospector.
And somewhere in that nowhere was another lone prospector.
With cheerful optimism our little Columbus descended, then stopped, stepped, slipped and slid.
"Now let me see", thought the little fellow.
"Before I know where I am,
I must get there."
There in that frozen wilderness a dream came true, and a lone voice shrieked into the solemn sky,
"Eureka! I've found it, a mountain of gold!"
But the elements laughed, roared and thundered.
In that raging nowhere was a lone cabin, and another lone man,
Black Larson, an unmitigated, predatory scoundrel.
Out of the lashing storm came the Little Fellow to find shelter and perhaps a little hospitality.
There he sat, resting his weary bones as the icy wind howled through the knothole.
"Come here", said Larson.
"What are you doing?"
"Eating, obviously."
"Get out."
"Go on!"
"Get out!"
The wind also was giving
Big Jim his troubles.
Big Jim was the noble type.
He had suffered.
Oh, how he loved to suffer.
He suffered about everything.
"Get out", said Black Larson.
"Or I'll fill you both full of lead."
"Now then, the pair of you, get out!"
"Out!"
That kind of noise
Jim don't tolerate.
"I'll stay right here, understand?"
"Right here", said Big Jim.
"Yes, sir, he'll stay right here", said the Little Fellow.
"Understand? We stay right here."
And stay they did, for days and nights.
The cabin moaned and groaned.
Two men walked and never talked, hunger gnawed their bones.
"I must have food!" yelled Big Jim.
"I must have food!"
"What are you eating?"
Said Black Larson.
"Nothing."
"Open your mouth!"
"Liar! It's that candle."
"That?" said the Little Fellow.
"How revolting."
"If I thought you were holding out on me, I'd slit your gizzard!"
"One of us must brave that storm, if we're to get food."
"Come here, the pair of you."
"We'll cut the cards and the low man goes."
"You're the man", said Jim.
"Goodbye, good luck."
"Don't forget to bring home the bacon."
Somewhere in that nowhere, the law was looking for Black Larson.
Desperate with hunger and here it was Thanksgiving Day.
Nevertheless there was something to be thankful for.
"Not quite done yet, give it two more minutes."
"Come on, come on", said Big Jim.
After scouring the country for food, the Little Fellow had to admit he had seen nothing, not even a field mouse.
From the pangs of hunger,
Big Jim was becoming delirious, hysterical.
In fact he was a pain in the neck.
"Food, food!" he thundered.
"I can put another shoe in the pot."
"No, no, anything but that!"
Poor Jim, he couldn't take it.
"What's the matter?"
Said the Little Fellow.
"I thought you were a chicken."
"Well, build up the fire", said Big Jim.
"What's the matter with you?"
Said the Little Fellow.
"Come, my pretty bird", said Big Jim.
"Don't be childish."
"Hey, quit it.
Don't be foolish, it's me!"
"You!" said Jim.
"I'm sorry. I must be crazy."
"You're telling me", said the Little Fellow.
"You go inside. I'll take the gun in case you lose it."
Chicken or no chicken, the Little Fellow looks appetizing to Big Jim.
Meanwhile Black Larson stumbled onto Big Jim's mountain of gold.
Then came the parting of the ways,
Big Jim to his mine, our hero to his fate.
"Goodbye", said the Little Fellow.
"It's been a great pleasure knowing you."
Treachery awaited Big Jim at his mountain of gold.
Big Jim looked deep into the eyes of Black Larson and saw there the soul of a skunk.
Caught in a maelstrom of desperate deeds,
Black Larson swept on to impending doom.
And out of a dream in that frozen waste, a city grew.
And humanity warmed it with living, loving and desiring.
Georgia.
Jack was a ladies' man.
Georgia was quick and impulsive, proud and independent.
In the evening Georgia worked as a dancehall girl.
Jack had lots of appeal for Georgia.
Perhaps that's why she resented him.
Out of the night came the Little Fellow, towards the dancehall, that beacon light of pleasure, that retreat of lost dreams.
"Georgia, why aren't you nice to Jack?"
"I believe he really likes you", said the girl.
"He likes everybody", said Georgia quite audibly.
"I'm bored with this place", she continued.
"I'd give it all up if I could find someone honest and worthwhile."
"Don't worry,
I'll find him someday."
Then she turned and looked and looked and looked.
"Kinda fresh, ain't ya?"
Thought Jack.
"Get down off that high horse."
"Me and you are gonna dance."
"Hey there, pan out a tune."
"Just a moment,
I said we're gonna dance."
"I beg your pardon", said Georgia.
To show her utter contempt for Jack, she picked out the most deplorable looking tramp in the dancehall.
"Hey you, come here."
"Yes, you. Do you want to dance?"
"You see, I'm very particular about whom I dance with."
And there he stood, the dauntless cavalier, guarding... her sanctuary.
"If you wanna make a hit with your lady friend",
"you should put your hat on straight, like this!"
"Take that you... Ouch!"
"Huh! Very good."
"Didn't know me own strength", said the Little Fellow.
Hank Curtis' cabin was a stone's throw from the dancehall.
Hank was a mining engineer who lived alone and occasionally went on long expeditions into the Far North.
Hank was kind and human, and our hero cold and hungry, and the beans smelled good and the coffee was steaming hot.
So the Little Fellow devised a way of getting breakfast.
Big Jim recovered from the blow he received from Black Larson but lost his memory.
Hank's partner arrives.
Both are ready to leave on a long expedition.
Hank informs his partner that the Little Fellow is to look after the cabin while he's away.
"Goodbye", said Hank.
"And don't forget to feed the mule."
Since that night in the dancehall the Little Fellow hadn't seen Georgia, but an incident was to bring them together again.
There she stood, her loveliness lighting the room, filling his soul with the music of romance for which he was so ill-fitted.
As she introduced her friends, his heart began to sing.
As they warmed up by the stove, he excused himself to get firewood.
And in that cabin his secret was revealed, his love for Georgia.
And the girls giggled and laughed, perhaps in order to hide their pity.
For in the world of the dancehall it wasn't wise for the girls to reveal their hearts.
And so they thought they'd have a little fun with him.
There in the gloaming they sat, their faces alight with mischief, but all the while his heart was singing.
And so she fooled and flirted and stroked his hair.
He knew she was fooling, but he was happy.
For she was near him, holding his hand, smiling at him.
"Nice place you have here", said Georgia.
"I hope you will invite us again."
What if she were fooling?
He was enjoying the warmth of her attention.
And the lady was enjoying the warmth of his chair.
And now she was leaving.
The light of her loveliness would be gone.
And he would be left with an emptiness, to return to his bleak, lonely existence.
"Pardon me", said the Little Fellow,
"But, uh..."
He was lost for words.
"Would you really like to come again?"
"Of course", said Georgia.
"What do you say, girls?"
"We'll come for dinner
New Year's Eve", said the ladies.
"Very well", said Georgia.
"We'll come to dinner
New Year's Eve."
Of course at that moment
Georgia would forget her gloves!
For the next few days the Little
Fellow hustled and shoveled in order to buy that New Year's dinner.
The eve of a new year.
New hopes and new dreams.
And there was Georgia, caressing him with her smiles and tender glances.
And the girls called for a speech.
But he was too happy to speak.
All that mattered was Georgia was there. Georgia!
So he muttered and stuttered and finally said,
"I can't make a speech but I'll do a dance."
And a dance he did, with the rolls.
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And days of auld lang syne
For auld lang syne
My dear
For auld lang...
In the midst of all their revelry the vague memory of a promise crept into Georgia's mind.
"Let's go up and visit the Little Fellow", she said.
"We'll have some fun with him", said Jack.
"We'll send Georgia in first, then give him a scare."
"Oh, forget it", said Jack.
"How about giving me a little attention?"
A day or so later in the Recorder's office,
Big Jim tried to convince the assayers that he had a mountain of gold.
"Where is this place?" they said.
But Big Jim's memory had failed him.
All he knew was that it was near the cabin.
"The cabin, that's it!"
"F I could find my way to the cabin
I could find the mine."
"But I can't remember."
"Hey!" said Jack,
"Georgia's been looking for you."
The Little Fellow knew otherwise.
How dare that cad mention her name so lightly?
For two pins he'd give him another thrashing.
However being a little underweight he would ignore the insult.
But it was true.
Georgia had been looking for him.
Georgia had written him a letter.
And as he went looking for Georgia, so Big Jim went looking for him.
"You, you!" said Big Jim.
"You! The very man
I've been looking for!"
"The cabin, the cabin! Where is it?"
"Answer me, I say!"
"Can't you speak, man? Tell me!"
"Where's the cabin? Where is it?"
"At last I shall find my mountain of gold."
"To your feet man, quick!"
"You're coming with me!"
"Take me to the cabin and I'll make you a millionaire!"
"Georgia! Just a moment", said the Little Fellow.
"Georgia, you don't have to explain.
I understand."
"I love you.
I'll take you away from this life."
"I'm going away, and when I return",
"I shall come back."
Exhausted and footweary, they arrived at the cabin.
"Ah!" said Big Jim,
"it won't be long now."
"Bring in the eats and tomorrow we'll start for the mine.
"Here, take a swig of this.
It'll put hair on your topcoat."
"My, this is a heavy lamb chop", said the Little fellow.
Then fate - it's always fate - played its little joke, and again the elements laughed, roared and thundered, but through it all our heroes soundly slumbered.
Then came the dawn.
The Little Fellow awoke, blissfully ignorant of what happened the night before, but feeling definitely conscious of "the morning after".
"Oh well, may as well tidy up and get breakfast."
"This is the worst liver attack
I've ever had."
"Feel that rocking?"
"It's the stomach."
"It's not the stomach."
"Let's go to the other side."
"We'll see how far it will go over."
"Something must be missing underneath."
"I'll go outside and see what it is."
"Now", said Big Jim,
"don't get excited."
"Take it easy, don't move, don't breathe!"
"I said don't breathe, stupid."
"You can be most annoying at times."
"If you'll only be cool, be calm", said Big Jim,
"We have nothing to worry about."
"Now show a little character!
Where's your willpower?"
"Now listen,
I've got a very good idea."
"Hold your hands like this, then I can get out first."
"You see what I mean?"
Said Big Jim.
"Your mind is chaotic.
You have no psychology."
"You have no control."
And Big Jim discovered his claim!
"Now we shall be rich", said Jim.
"We shall be millionaires!"
And so they were.
Now they were homeward bound and they were leaving the hardship and toil of Alaska to live in the land of milk and honey.
To live, laugh and indulge themselves in the lap of luxury.
They were famous, and sought after by the press.
In their cabin deluxe they were welcomed and waited upon.
The reporter wanted to write the Little Fellow's life story,
"From Rags to Riches", and he graciously consented.
And Big Jim was manicured.
"Not the nails", said he,
"the corns".
The reporter thought of a good idea, to have the Little Fellow pose in his mining clothes.
It would make a human story.
Georgia...
There she was in the steerage.
Neither knew of the other's presence.
Georgia overheard the officer say there was a stowaway aboard.
"You!" said Georgia.
"I thought I'd never see you again."
And then she mistook him for the stowaway.
The officer was going to put him in irons.
But Georgia pleaded for him and said she would pay his fare.
"Heck!" said the Captain.
"That's no stowaway."
"That's Big Jim's partner, the multimillionaire."
Then of course there were apologies.
The Little Fellow gathered himself together.
James, the valet, was told to prepare for an extra guest.
"Pardon me", said the reporter,
"but who's the lady?"
"Buzz buzz buzz!"
"Oh, you don't say!
Well, congratulations."
"This will make a great story, and with a happy ending."
And so it was.
A happy ending.

END
There it is, Herb.
One verse and two choruses.
- Is this a good song, Eddie?
- It's a good song, Herb.
- It's as good as the doll-dance number.
- All right.
Skip the verse, do the chorus, tempo.
Hot, eh?
- Good morning.
- Hello, Jimmy.
I've got the hottest song you ever heard in your life.
- Is that so?
- Yes, that's so.
Got it? Have you got it?
Jimmy, if you can get this crowd to keep quiet, I'll sing it for you.
- How about a little harmony?
- All right.
Listen, let's go through it.
One and two.
The second chorus, a little jazz, a little pep.
Come on, I'll vamp until ready.
Let's go.
Go on, Herb.
- That's it.
- The chorus in F-sharp.
Hot dog!
Listen, kid, if we can get that number, we're a cinch for the Palace.
- Hello, girls.
- Hello, Eddie.
Listen, Eddie, we'll take that song and smack it over for you.
Sure!
Oh, no. Not this song, babies.
Zanfield's bought it for his new revue.
And the Mahoney Sisters are coming from the West to put it over for me.
Listen, Eddie, you're not gonna waste a swell number like that...
...on a smalltime sister act, are you?
Nix cracking, Rosie.
Half of that sister team is going to be the future Mrs. Eddie Kearns.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Eddie.
If you wanna be made overnight, just give us a crack at that number.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
No, no. Positively not.
I've gotta get back to the hotel.
The girls are waiting for me.
Oh, but listen, if you want a song...
...see Georgie Cohan.
He writes good music too.
How about it, Jimmy?
Oh, I'll take that, thank you.
Gee, this is elegant, ain't it?
Tell you better when
I get a peek at the beds.
Quiet. I told you to pack that cooking outfit in the trunk.
Yeah? Well, I'm taking no chances.
If we can't pay our bill and the hotel holds the trunks, we still eat.
And, baby, when you don't eat, you lose a lot of calories.
Calories? What are they?
Oh, acrobats, you big sap.
- Well, I never got fat on your cooking.
- No?
You never got that complexion from the Greeks.
- Don't talk to me like...
- Ixnay, ixnay.
- Leave us plenty of towels too.
- I did.
And I counted them.
How high can you count?
Well, everything's okay.
Will there be anything else?
Yeah, food.
I think he may stall for a tip. Get to the window and give me the high sign.
Hank, I don't wanna do that.
Don't be such a cheapskate.
Screw.
Say, did they run out of everything but dollar signs on this thing?
One coffee, one order of fried eggs.
There's two in an order, ain't they?
- Yep.
- And one order of rolls.
- Hank.
- Yes?
Come look at the elegant view.
Oh, that will be all, thank you.
Cup of coffee, order of rolls, a couple of eggs.
It worked.
Oh, Queenie, New York.
The place we've dreamed and talked about.
- Ain't it swell?
- Yeah.
But there's something about it that scares me, Hank.
Scares you?
Well, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Well, it seems like we're taking an awful chance.
We were getting along so well out west.
Plenty of work, small jumps, a chance to save money.
And the act always went over big.
But here, nobody knows us.
Oh, I'm afraid.
Now don't lose your nerve, honey.
But we haven't got much money.
Oh, Hank, couldn't we go back, just for one more year?
Back to those opera houses and town halls?
Those cheap hotels and their lobby comics?
Cooking our own food...
...washing our own clothes and ironing them on mirrors.
Riding in those smelly day-coaches.
Going ragged all summer and then darn near freezing in the winter. And why?
Just to save money enough to get to New York and show our act.
Oh, honey.
With your looks and my ability...
I wouldn't steer you wrong.
Now don't worry.
You see that electric sign of the fellow in BVDs?
- Yeah.
- Well, right there...
...they're gonna have the Mahoney Sisters.
- In BVDs?
- Yes, in BVD...
Baby, they were plenty smart when they made you beautiful.
Come on, let's get cleaned up before Eddie gets here.
I'll run a tub for you.
The Mahoney Sisters in BVDs.
Hey, what are you singing?
The bubble song from Lux.
Will you join me?
No use of us both getting wet.
Will you wash mine?
I might as well. You never wash anything but your neck.
I not only wash them.
I gotta pick them up.
Oh, Hank, I didn't think.
Oh, you never do.
Oh, don't strain yourself.
I'll get them.
Oh, boy, this is going to be good.
Oh, I'll go.
Can you imagine my embarrassment?
Uncle Jed!
Hello, honey. How are you?
- Fine, and you?
- Great.
- Gee, I'm glad to see you, Hank.
- Oh, Queenie, hurry up. It's Uncle Jed!
Uncle Jed?
I'll be right out.
What a break for you.
- I'll be with you in just a minute.
- All right, honey, but hurry.
What do you know, Uncle Jed?
I've got you booked for 30 weeks over at the Manley Time.
Nothing doing.
We're in New York to stay.
Say, listen, girls...
...you know, I know this town better than you do. And there are more sisters...
...doing their acts over the lunch counters in New York than over the...
Than in the theaters.
You're just a crapehanger.
Maybe, but let me tell you...
...tell you, tell you, tell you...
What's the name of that record you're playing?
Say, listen, girls...
Yeah?
Well, what is it?
I love both you girls, and I want to see you get along.
Sure, Uncle Jed, we know that.
But we aren't leaving this town till we get a flash at Babe Ruth and Grant's Tomb.
- Oh, will you get that, Uncle Jed?
- You bet.
Oh, girls, your break... Your break...
Your coffee's here.
Bring the toothbrush glass when you come.
- All right.
- Will you have some coffee, Uncle Jed?
No, thanks. I just had my breakf...
I just ate.
- Yeah?
- Uncle Jed!
Queenie!
Gosh, what a big girl you are.
- And so beautiful.
- Ain't she, though?
Well, I suppose you've decided to stay in New York.
Yeah, we're all set.
But thanks for the offer, Uncle Jed.
That's all right.
I'll keep it open for a few days.
- All right.
- Goodbye.
- Oh, goodbye, Uncle Jed.
- If you wanna see me, just call me up.
Yeah, all right.
You're in the phone book?
You bet.
I think we're making an awful mistake not to take that work.
I know what I'm doing.
We stand as big a chance as anybody else.
What did the Duncans have when they hit Times Square?
"My Patio."
Say, we've got more than the Duncans ever had.
Well, the Duncans are pretty good too.
Say, what'd we do to them on the Gus Sun Time?
We knocked them off their seats.
Come in.
- Eddie!
- Hank!
Oh, baby.
Let me have a good look at you.
- Gee, but it's good to see you.
- Oh, boy, is it good to see you! Oh, gee!
That's my Queenie!
- Queenie? You don't mean to tell me it's...
- Sure.
Queenie, all grown up and everything.
Ain't she? That sisterly kiss won't be so hard to take now.
I'll say it won't.
- Take it big.
- I did.
You were a funny-looking thing the first time I saw you...
...with those gangly legs and freckles.
But you certainly turned out to be a beautiful girl.
Well, I'll go get some clothes on.
I'm just crazy about her, Eddie.
She's so young and beautiful.
Of course she is.
Well, Hank, now that you're here, when are we going to get married?
Oh, not till we've put this act over.
I'm gonna give Queenie a break.
Always doing something for somebody else.
No wonder I love you.
- I kind of got a weakness for you too.
- Yeah?
Mrs. Eddie Kearns?
Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?
Swell, Eddie.
Yeah, and you can feature that anytime in the electric lights.
- Gee, still the same sweet kid, ain't you?
- Why, certainly.
Hank, did you pack my new dress in the trunk?
I'll get it for you in a minute.
Come here, Queenie.
- Gee, I can't get over how she's changed.
- Well, you sure look elegant, Eddie.
- Doesn't he, Hank?
- He's an eyeful.
Three carats.
Platinum.
And here's the payoff.
Look, but don't laugh.
Gold garters!
Oh, Eddie, I always knew you'd make good.
Yeah, and I ain't forgetting that you're the little girl that made me come to New York.
Remember when I wanted to quit and give the whole thing up...
...and you made me stick it out?
Well, now I'm gonna do something for you.
Zanfield's bought my new song,
"The Broadway Melody."
And he's naming his revue after it.
- But I've already spoken to him about you.
- You think we've got a chance?
Chance? Don't be silly.
One word from me, and you're in.
- Queenie, ain't that great?
- Sure, if it's true.
True? You don't know how I stand with Zanfield.
- If we're in, what do we do?
- When do we start?
And how much do we get?
You're gonna sing my "Broadway Melody" with me.
The Mahoney Sisters and Eddie Kearns.
Yeah, Eddie Kearns and the Mahoney Sisters.
Well, how does it go?
How's it go? Now, listen, I sing a verse, and you come in on the chorus.
Then we do another chorus, and then go into a little dance.
- Give us an idea of the dance.
- I'll give you an idea.
- Good?
- Swell, Eddie, do it again.
Let's move back this table, kids.
We'll do our dance.
All ready, girls?
Come on, now, let's go.
There you are.
Queenie, why don't you look at my feet?
Look at her.
Attagirl!
You like that?
Don't do that.
Don't do that!
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute!
- What's the matter with the left leg?
- I've got a headache.
Go on, sit down, take a load off your mind.
- Don't talk to me like that. I don't feel well.
- Listen, don't answer me back, understand?
Come here.
There's Eddie. Hello, hey!
Your rhythm is all wrong.
Nothing like I showed you.
All right, now watch.
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, how are you?
We had a tough time getting in!
When do we show the act?
In a few minutes.
I haven't had a chance to talk to Zanfield yet.
- It's okay, ain't it?
- We're in?
Sure, it's in the bank.
- Whatever I say goes.
- Hey, Kearns!
Yes, sir?
We don't wanna take all afternoon to set one dance.
Yes, sir.
Maybe we'd better get undressed.
Come on.
All right, Sam, let it go.
- Oh, George.
- Wait a minute, hold it there. Hold it, Sam.
The sets are all ready for your okay, Mr. Zanfield.
That's just an idea of what it's gonna be.
I can see that. It's just an idea.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
But don't worry, I'll fix it.
- Okay on those sets.
- Yes, sir.
Remind me to see that rehearsal in the morning. Make a note of that.
I'm having lunch at the Knickerbocker.
Oh, Mr. Zanfield, this material, I couldn't get it in the gold design, only in the silver.
- Isn't it lovely?
- It's fine. Get it in the gold.
- Remember, I want that in the gold.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, Mr. Zanfield, pardon me, will you take a look at the Mahoney Sisters right now?
- The Maloney Sisters?
- No, the Mahoney Sisters.
- Who are they? I never heard of them.
- It's the sister act I told you about.
- Where are they?
- Right over there, across stage.
All right, wheel them in.
- Tell George I'll take a look at the act.
- Thanks, Mr. Zanfield.
Well, kids, you all set?
Got your music?
Well, go over there and tell him what you want.
The Baloney Sisters.
Give us the introduction pickup and some choruses. And swell to the finish.
- But you follow us.
- Yes, ma'am.
Sam, looks like some carnival lost a good act.
I'm gonna lay that dame like a roll of linoleum.
- Hank, you can't pull that around here.
- Hank, don't start anything now.
- Get her in the dressing room.
- Sure. Now, come on. Get together.
- All set now?
- Oh, wait a minute.
- Don't mind if I put this down?
- No, ma'am.
I'll vamp till ready, and don't forget:
We do things intimately.
- All set.
- All set, fine. Babies, smack it over big.
You ain't got nothing to worry about.
You're as good as in now.
- I'll go and see how the boss likes it.
- All right.
Well, all right, shoot.
- Play it, will you?
- Something wrong with the piano.
- Do I have to come over and play it for you?
- Okay, go ahead.
What's the matter with them?
There's something wrong with the piano.
- Say, are you trying to crab our act?
- No, I'm not.
- Well, will you play it then, hot or cold?
- Well, go ahead then.
All right. All right, girls.
Mr. Zanfield's seen enough.
He'll let you know. Come in next Friday.
- But he ain't seen the finish yet.
- Yes. I know, all right. Line up, girls.
Oh, Mr. Zanfield, please give them a break.
You haven't seen their act.
I saw enough.
I can use the blond, but that little cluck is out.
But don't you know it's tough to put comedy over on a bare stage?
They'll be all right at the performance.
Give them another chance.
I know, Eddie.
Gee, kid, that's a tough break. Even if the act is a louse, he should've seen the finish.
It ain't a louse. It's a good act.
We stopped the show every performance we did for Jake Wells.
Yeah, the one I saw would stop a tank.
Say, you've been asking for trouble, and now you're gonna get it.
You great big peroxide-headed dizzy blond, you! What do you think of this act?
Hey, come here! Come here, girls!
Come here!
Let me at her, will you?
Let me at her!
Next time I'll give you a facial instead of a scalp treatment.
- Yeah, and I'll fix you, you little peanut.
- Let go of me!
- Oh, boy, I'll sock her...
- Stop it, Hank, you're crabbing everything.
Go get your clothes on.
I'll fix everything.
The big blond baboon! Why'd she pick on me? I didn't start any fight with her.
- Where's my music?
- Here's your music.
- Well, where's my bag?
- Now, be quiet. Be quiet, Hank!
Get in there. Straighten it out.
Let's get smart, Sam. Where are you?
Don't let them throw you up in the air.
I'm not gonna waste all day at it.
Give me a pickup and two choruses.
And let me tell you dames something:
If I get ahold of her, I'll rip her wide open.
Flo, what was the trouble about?
- I was beside the piano, not doing a thing...
- Wait a minute.
- I can't stand for quarreling.
- I didn't start it.
Never mind who started it. Now run along and be a good little girl.
- Oh, all right.
- And remember, no more quarreling.
- Excuse me, Mr. Zanfield.
- Well?
I heard what you said about me.
Please, couldn't you use the both of us at the same salary?
I might.
I think I can slip her in somewhere.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Zanfield!
- All right.
My sister is the business manager of the act.
You won't let on that it ain't the both of us you want, will you?
Of course not.
- You send her over, and I'll talk to her.
- Oh, thank you!
All right.
Oh, Hank!
He can take his old show and put it where it'll do him the most good!
Don't act like that, Hank.
He didn't see your act, that's all.
- He's a very busy man.
- Oh, he's busy?
Well, so am I busy, with 30 weeks waiting for me.
- Now, don't get so excited over nothing.
- Hank, quick!
Mr. Zanfield wants to see you.
- Oh, yeah?
- On the level?
- Maybe we're in after all.
- Sure!
Let me handle this. I can always take care of these things better with nobody around.
I'll talk to him.
All right, girls, we'll take this right from the beginning. Okay, Sam, let it go.
I heard what you said to Zanny.
- You won't let on to Hank, will you, Eddie?
- Of course not.
Gee, that was wonderful of you,
Queenie.
I could kiss you for that.
You mustn't do that, Eddie.
I guess I shouldn't.
I never realized you were...
Gee, you're the sweetest little girl
I ever knew.
You mean next to Hank.
Yeah, sure.
You know, Hank's been everything in the world to me.
She's looked after me and worked for me, and fought for me, protected me.
I could never repay her for all her love and care.
Of course you love her, Queenie.
And you're gonna be everything that she wants you to be.
And I don't blame her for loving you.
Gee, but you're a cute kid.
And she loves you, Eddie.
I guess you and me are about all she ever thinks of.
Oh, I never wanna hurt her, Eddie.
And I want her to be happy with you.
Why, Queenie, I'd rather lose my pipes so I couldn't sing...
...and go lame so I couldn't dance than to hurt Hank.
- Sure you would. So would I.
- Can you imagine?
- We're in! Rehearsal in the morning!
- That's great!
- I knew you'd put it over, Hank!
- Oh, just leave it to me!
I ain't booked acts for 10 years and not know how to handle them!
- You bet you haven't!
- You're both swell kids!
- And plenty smart!
- And how!
- Gee, rehearsal in the morning! Ain't it great?
- Yeah!
Come on.
I got a lot of washing and ironing to do.
- You have?
- I want you to look your best, honey.
But tell me, how did you put it over?
What did you say to him?
I said to him, "Now, you listen here,
Mr. Zanfield, this is a sister team.
And we splits up for nobody!"
And with that, he smiled as nice as you please...
...and said, "That's all right, Miss Maloney."
Can you imagine calling me Maloney?
And everybody knows our name's Mahoney.
- Yeah, can you imagine that?
- Imagine that.
"Maloney"!
Hey, come on and get those clothes on, will you?
- Hurry up!
- Well, are we all set?
Yes, sir, everything ready to go when you say the word.
All right.
- Are you safe up there, Audrey?
- Okay.
Yes, that's perfectly safe.
- You get the orchestra in the pit.
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, Hagerty.
- Yes?
- That looks very good.
- I think it'll be very effective.
- So do I.
- Yes, sir.
Can you imagine? Putting on all this makeup for just one show a day?
Oh, dear! I'm just shaky all over.
Queenie, will you stop?
You're getting me nervous now.
It ain't a bit different than it was in Reading, PA.
And we're going over just as big.
- Oh, Hank, do you think so?
- Why, it's cream in the can, baby.
- Are you decent, girls?
- Yeah, come in.
Oh, Hank, get a load of this.
"Big mammoth appearance of the Mahoney Sisters on Broadway.
Zanfield saw them once, and they were in.
With appreciation and regards to our agent, Uncle Jed."
- Is that a pippin or not?
- You care for that?
- Do I?
- Hank, will you get Eddie out of here?
I'm nervous!
What's eating her?
Eddie, you gotta run along now.
We're nervous.
I get you.
Now, Queenie, don't be nervous.
- Remember, this is your big opportunity.
- Will you get out of here?
- Beat it, Eddie, will you?
- Now, don't forget, a lot depends on this.
- Oh, get out!
- Get out!
Stop, stop! Girls, girls!
- Be careful of my hats!
- We gotta get down on the stage!
I don't care!
I won't allow you to ruin them.
I told you they were too high and too wide.
Well, big woman, I design the costumes for the show...
...not the doors for the theater.
I know that. If you had, they'd have been done in lavender.
Pardon me, Mr. Zanfield, but the orchestra's killing my "Broadway Melody" number.
- Too much brass. They can't hear me.
- Kearns, tell them to keep it down.
Thanks, Mr. Zanfield.
- All right, boys, I think we can go.
- Yes, sir!
Hey, you!
When you get through with that noise, try and play my number.
Cut out the brass, and keep it very piano.
Are you back again?
Yes, and I'm telling you how I want my music played.
I've conducted opera.
What do you know about music?
- Nothing. I only wrote it, that's all.
- Then you have the best of me.
You don't have to listen.
I'll tell Zanny what a sap he was for buying it.
Maybe he'll get you to write the music for the show.
If I couldn't do better than this...
If you could, you wouldn't be waving a stick!
Electrician!
A little more this way with that spotlight.
What are you trying to do, ruin my profile?
Your profile was ruined the day you were born.
That's a smart crack.
Hit me with it and keep it here.
Hey, put that spotlight over here on this girl!
- He wants it over there.
- But it goes over here.
That spotlight goes here.
I can't sing without a spotlight.
Say, you couldn't sing if you had a searchlight.
- Did you get everything you wanted?
- Pardon me, Mr. Zanfield.
Would you okay this bill for Miss William's second act?
What's the idea? Two grand for a coat worn for less than three minutes? I won't pay it!
But you said ermine.
You'll giggle yourself right out of here one day.
Yes, sir.
- It's a gorgeous garment, isn't it?
- Isn't it gorgeous?
In fact, it's the gorgeous-est thing
I have ever seen. You sweet little cutie!
- There you are.
- Thank you, Mr. Zanfield.
- Come here, Unconscious.
- Hello, boys.
Say, Joe LeBlanc saw the rehearsal, and he says there's a fortune in the show.
- Yes, sir!
- We ought to know. We put it in.
- You think it's a good show then, Zanny?
- It's just an oil well.
- Let's see your gusher.
- Looks like a mine to me.
From all the gold-diggers you got in the troupe.
Any old time one of them can pry a nugget off of his ledge, they're going some!
Come on, Unconscious, put the load down.
Overture, girls.
This is the "Broadway Melody" number.
Get out of here and hurry up.
Come on. Come on. Get out of here.
Come on. Go on, get out.
Oh, there's the overture.
Oh, where's my hat?
Where's my hat?
Where's my hat?
Oh, where's my hat?!
- Over there!
- Over where?
- On the floor, under the clothes.
- Oh, yes. The clothes carton.
Why didn't you say so in the first place?
And make it snappy.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
Now, honey, remember:
The dress rehearsal is tougher...
...than a first-night performance.
So don't be nervous.
- I'm not nervous.
- Neither am I.
No, it's over that shoulder.
That's the idea.
More. With those beads.
That's it. That's better.
That's the idea. In this...
All right! Out of the way.
Clear the way.
Elgin, call a doctor.
Elgin! Call a doctor! Elgin!
What are we gonna do?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Hold it!
That number's too slow.
Cut out the Maloney Sisters.
- Cut out the whole first chorus?
- Yes.
Why, has he cut us out altogether?
Ain't it awful, the way they cut out these big stars?
I'll get to you in a minute.
Listen here, Mr. Zanfield, you can't cut us out like that.
We've got equity contract.
Kearns, go into the dance on the first chorus and end it there.
One more cut for you, dearie, and you'll be holding a spear.
And one more crack from you, bimbo, and you'll be holding a lily.
Listen to me, Mr. Zanfield, we...
Keep quiet. Will you cut it out and give me a chance to do my number?
But he cut us out of the whole show.
He can't do that.
Did you hear that, Mr. Zanfield?
They're trying to drown me out.
- Are you trying to drown him out?
- We're doing our best.
Mr. Zanfield, would you come backstage a moment? It's very important.
- All right.
- Yes, sir.
What's the trouble now?
The other dame flopped.
How about this one?
No, sir.
- Terrible.
- What are we gonna do about her?
There he is now.
I'm gonna give that guy an earful.
Where's that blond McGinty sister?
Use her.
Mahoney's the name, and let me tell you something...
Excuse me, Mr. Zanfield.
I'll get her up there.
You may not know it, but we've played some of the very best...
Listen, we want you on the prow of that boat.
Come on now.
Let's get your clothes off.
But I don't want to take my clothes off.
No, that'll be all right.
But listen to me. I've never taken my clothes off in my life.
I know all about that. Come on.
- How've you got this thing hooked?
- I don't know.
Over here.
Say, do I get that spot, or don't I?
That's tough. I missed him.
- How's everything going, Zanny?
- Very smoothly. Very, very smoothly.
- That's fine.
- Great.
Sit down with us.
Oh, Jules. Jules.
I like that number.
That's a very good arrangement.
How do you do it?
Where do you pick them?
I guess it's just a gift.
By the way, what's the name of that little beauty on the boat?
Ask her.
It'll give you something to do.
- That's a great idea.
- Come on, Unconscious.
Yes, sir.
- You were great, Mahoney.
- I'll say you were.
- You'll be in a Rolls-Royce by Thursday.
- Go on.
What a flock of Johns will be waiting at that stage door!
- Go on. You can't kid me.
- I'm not kidding you.
I may be there myself.
- Oh, Queenie.
- Go in and change.
Hank, did you see Queenie?
What's the matter, Hank?
Aren't you happy?
Wasn't Queenie great?
Aren't you proud of her?
Of course, Eddie.
I'm glad to see her make good.
Oh, but gee, we ain't never had to get by on our legs before.
Oh, that don't mean nothing, Hank.
Those guys are not gonna pay 10 bucks to look at your face.
This is Broadway.
Yeah. Broad's way.
Now, run along and change.
I'll get Queenie.
Attagirl.
Queenie, everybody is raving about you.
- Gee, but you're a beautiful kid.
- I'm glad you like me, Eddie.
Like you? Oh, boy. When I got a peek at you up there on that boat...
- Isn't this the beautiful lady of the boat?
- Yes.
- Kearns. They're waiting for you.
- Yes, sir.
- I'm Jock Warriner.
- How do you do?
- And this is Stew and Bay.
- How do you do?
I bet them that the most beautiful girl in New York will have supper with us.
- You've got to help me win that bet.
- What have I got to do with that?
- Well, you see, you're the girl.
- Oh, no, I'm not.
- I guess we win that bet, Jock.
- Now, wait a minute. Not yet.
- Hey, Unconscious, where you going?
- I'm gonna get on that boat.
Come here, sap. You can't get on that.
That's not a real boat.
Please.
Please, won't you change your mind?
- I'm sorry, but really, I can't.
- Oh, come on. Please do.
- No. Not tonight.
- No?
- Come on. Slip us the 50.
- Wait a minute. I haven't lost yet.
Oh, yeah...?
Come here, Unconscious, come here.
You can't go up there, you'll get kicked out.
It's a ladies' dressing room.
- Let's go on the boat.
- On the boat. Get out of here.
Don't worry, Hank.
They only cut one number.
We got a couple of others.
"Zanny saw them once, and they were in."
Zanny saw me once, and I was out.
Not altogether. And what of it?
Yeah, I know.
Do you think that's all I'll get to do, go on without any clothes on?
Not if I can help it.
But you don't need to worry.
You got a lot more on when you ain't got anything...
...than most of the dames
I've seen around here.
Well, I guess I'll go get undressed again.
Come in.
- Hello, kids. Are you all ready?
- Yep. All ready.
Well, listen. Zanny is giving a big party at his apartment tonight.
- Let's go over.
- Gee, that's great. Did he invite us?
Not exactly, but what's the difference?
Ain't I the star of this troupe?
That guy threw me out of your song tonight.
I ain't gonna give him a chance to throw me out of a window.
Let's get a bowl of chop suey, and we'll rewrite the show.
If it'll write me back in the show,
I'd go for a bowl of anything.
Well, you can get most anything out of a bowl of chop suey.
Oh, cutie!
Come on, Queenie.
You two run along.
I've got some things to do, and I'll join you later.
Why, what's the matter?
Well, I've...
I've got an awful headache.
I'm sorry, honey.
We'll go straight home if you'd rather.
Oh, no, Hank. You two run along.
You'll have a lot of fun, anyway.
Come on, Queenie.
We don't wanna go without you.
Get your hat. You'll feel better when you get out of here.
Oh, sure, honey, come on.
I can't go.
- You got a date with somebody, huh?
- Of course not.
- Who, Queenie? You're crazy.
- Crazy, am I?
You've got a date with that Jock Warriner, I'll bet.
- Well, and what if I have?
- Well, I don't like it.
Oh, you can't go out with that bird.
I'll have to show you whether I can or not.
Come in.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.
Well, here I am again.
You can't get rid of me.
- I'll be right with you, Mr. Warriner.
- All right.
Maybe you had better wait for me just a few minutes down on the stage.
- Shall I wait at the stage door?
- Please.
- Now, don't be long.
- No, I won't.
- Hurry.
- I will.
Now, Queenie, don't act this way.
He ain't the right kind of a guy for you to go out with.
What difference does it make what kind of a guy he is?
I'm going out with him because I...
Well, because I want to.
- Oh, no, you're not.
- Oh, yes, I am.
You're not! You're gonna listen to me.
I can take care of myself. And you can both mind your own business.
Why don't you mind your sister?
She knows best.
You keep out of this.
I've got my own life to live, and I'm gonna live it.
I'm not gonna be the third wheel to anybody's bicycle!
Oh, Queenie!
Oh, Eddie, what'll we do?
Why, she's never gone against my advice before.
Don't worry, Hank. She's only a kid.
She'll snap out of it.
I guess the bright lights got under her skin.
Come on, let's go and get a bowl of chili.
Queenie!
- Oh, you didn't go. You didn't go!
- I couldn't, Hank.
Oh, dear! I'm so glad.
Oh, they're elegant.
- Yeah. Where do I park them?
- Wait a minute. Put them over there.
Good morning, beautiful lady.
Oh, you frightened me.
Good morning.
- Oh, they're elegant. Thanks.
- Just a little birthday card.
Yes, well, they're lovely.
You'll excuse me now?
You have some place to go, haven't you?
Are you putting me out?
What's the matter?
Don't you like the flowers?
- Oh, they're beautiful.
- They're not half so beautiful as you.
Any girl that can look beautiful so early in the morning...
That sounds like you know a lot about girls.
I do. I'm an expert.
- Much obliged for the compliment.
- You're welcome.
Well, so long.
- Must I go?
- Please do.
- And thank you for being so nice to me.
- Not half so nice as I'd like to be.
I'm arranging a little party tonight for your birthday.
- A party for me?
- Yes.
Come in.
But you mustn't do that.
- But why not?
- Because I don't want you to.
That's silly. Everything's arranged.
You must come.
Please don't.
Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, Queenie.
- Oh, hello.
- How are you? Where's Hank?
- She's out.
Then I'm gonna wait right here till she gets back.
Well, it looks as if I'd better take the air.
I'll give you a ring a little later, shall I?
Fine.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
And thank you again for the flowers.
Well, I've got my suspicions about any guy that kisses a girl's hand.
- What do you mean?
- He'll give you a ring later.
He'll give you a ring.
On the telephone, but not here.
What are you burned up about?
- He hasn't done anything to you.
- No.
- And what's more, he ain't going to.
- Sit down and cool off.
Hank'll be here in a minute, and you can start raving to her.
Oh, Eddie, don't be such a crab.
Why do you let a guy like that hang around you?
Say, will you lay off him? I'm sick of hearing you crab all the time.
- I'll give him a sock in the nose.
- You and how many others?
I don't need any others.
I can do it all by myself.
What do you think of that?
I know. But you haven't anything to do in the show.
I can team you up with this blond and still book you as the Mahoney Sisters.
Nope. I've gotta stick around and keep an eye on Queenie.
Queenie? What has she been doing?
She's changed, Uncle Jed.
She don't tell me things anymore.
Night after night, she's out with Jock Warriner.
If it wasn't for Queenie,
I'd be the happiest girl in the world.
With Eddie?
Now, now listen, Hank.
Why don't you give Eddie a break and marry him?
- Maybe I will.
- Maybe.
Maybe that's just what Queenie needs:
- To see you and Eddie happy.
- Do you think so?
It's exactly what
I've been trying to... Sure!
- You see, it's very simple.
- Rolling his own.
That's it.
Now, watch this one.
Boy, if you could do that with my wife.
Say, give us something good, something new.
Say, can you pull a rabbit from that?
Hello, everybody.
- I brought the radio with me.
- Joe, what have you got there?
- Gee, I can get Chicago with that.
- Chicago? Why, that's nothing.
- I got Scotland last night.
- How do you know you got Scotland?
Why, I heard the guy singing
"The Best Things in Life Are Free."
Take this cake in the other room, and when you hear us yell "surprise"...
...bring it back lighted.
Now, don't forget.
Hey, give me a few of those things.
Give me a few of them.
Someone's coming. Are you all set?
Quiet, quiet.
Surprise!
Surprise! Surprise!
- Well, where's Queenie?
- Yeah, where's Queenie?
Why, there was another party, and I forgot to tell her about this one.
I thought she'd have more fun there.
I'm sorry.
Jock Warriner, huh.
Say, listen, I've got an idea.
Let's give the party...
Let's give the party...
- For Hank.
- Great!
Wait a minute, folks.
Just a second.
Take all the things down to my room.
We'll hold our party there.
Hank doesn't feel very well.
Well, all right, we'll go down to your room.
Good night. I hope you feel better.
Look, Hank, I'm awfully sorry.
- I'm sorry, Hank.
- I left a present for you.
- I hope you're feeling better, Hank.
- We'll see you tomorrow.
You see what you're missing?
Why don't you have a little drink?
It might buck you up.
- Good night, Hankie.
- Good night, Uncle Jed.
Good night, dear.
Hey, Eddie.
Ain't you coming down?
You run along, Jed.
I've got to tell Hank something.
- I'll see you in a little while.
- Sure.
But don't make it too long. You know that bottle won't last very long.
Queenie and me have always been on the level.
And now I'm fronting for her.
Won't you please give her all the best of the breaks?
What's the matter, Hank?
I lost something.
Oh, Eddie.
At least I've still got you.
That's one break.
Goodbye, baby.
Happy birthday.
Queenie, aren't you having a good time?
I'm having a marvelous time,
Mr. Warriner.
Now don't call me Mr. Warriner.
Call me Jock, won't you?
All right.
Mr. Warriner.
- Wait a minute, everybody. Queenie.
- Oh, I can't.
I want you to stand up here where everyone can see you.
- A toast!
- A toast to Queenie!
A happy birthday to Queenie, the queen of New York's beautiful girls.
- Many happy returns!
- Happy birthday!
I can't say anything but thanks, everybody. A lot.
Oh, it's a lovely surprise... Jock.
Oh, it's nothing at all.
Will you dance now?
That cake is just elegant...
...but I can't eat it all.
Well, you eat as much as you can, and we'll save the rest.
Please, Mr. Warriner, ask them to play something else.
- I hate sentimental music.
- All right.
"Broadway Melody."
Don't wear a frown on old Broadway.
Tell me...
...why don't you like that song?
I don't know.
Well, what do you like?
I like cake.
Won't you tell me that you like me a little?
Maybe.
You mean it?
Maybe.
Will you tell me why you're so nice to me?
Maybe.
Please, I wanna dance.
Oh, no, come on.
Let's sit this one out.
But look, everybody's dancing, and the music is playing and everything.
Mr. Warriner.
You don't mean this for me?
Why, of course.
Diamonds should only be worn by beautiful girls.
Oh, it's just adorable.
I'd like to do a lot of things for you, Queenie.
How would you like an apartment all your own?
Say, on Park Avenue.
And a car all your own.
Perhaps a Rolls-Royce.
Oh, and a lot of nice things.
Well, I'd have to think about that.
Say, where have you been?
I've been looking all over the place for you.
You would come in at a time like this.
Certainly. Come on, little love boat.
Let's have this dance.
- Were you asleep, Hank?
- No, honey.
Well, that's swell, because I wanna to tell you...
...about the grandest party that ever happened to me.
Look at that. Look at that. Did you ever see anything more beautiful in all your life?
No, sirree. Because that's class, that is.
And Eddie said he wouldn't even give me a ring.
What would I want with his ring?
There's more diamonds in a bracelet, ain't they? Ain't they?
Honey, I don't know what you're saying this for...
...but I know you don't mean it.
You can't mean it.
- It ain't in you to mean it.
- Sure I mean it.
Why shouldn't I mean it?
And that ain't all I'm gonna have, either.
I'm gonna have a Rolls-Royce.
And an apartment on Park Avenue.
And everything that goes with it.
That's what I'm gonna have.
Now, honey, listen to me.
I know we ain't had the greatest break in the world since we hit New York.
But that's gonna change.
That's got to.
And you're gonna meet somebody that's right.
Somebody you can be proud of, who'll just be crazy about you.
Somebody who's really worthy of you.
Somebody like Eddie.
Yeah? Well, that's all right for you...
...but I ain't craving any hall-rooms...
...with some song-and-dance guy...
...who expects me to cook his meals over a gas-jet...
...listen to a lot of smart wisecracks and bum songs.
- No, sir.
- Oh, Queenie.
Move over.
No more of these kind of dumps for mine.
I'm gonna have everything in the world I want.
That's me.
And you're gonna have Eddie.
Queenie, I don't want you to answer me like that again.
- Then keep your nose out of my business.
- Well, your business is my business.
That package is from Warriner, ain't it?
- What if it is?
- I won't let you keep it, that's all.
How are you gonna stop me?
Oh, Queenie, don't you see what
I'm doing is for your own good?
And don't you see what I'm doing is for your...
Oh, what are you talking about?
Now you listen to me.
You're not gonna go out with that guy, hear me?
I'll stop you if I have to tie you up to do it. You hear me?
Cut it out. Be quiet.
They can hear you out front.
Well, you hear me. I'm going out with whoever I want...
...and I won't hear orders from anyone about it.
- Now get that and get it straight.
- Queenie!
You ain't my boss. So mind your own business and shut up.
Oh, Queenie.
I won't shut up.
And you're gonna listen to me.
I won't listen to you any more than
I will to her. So you needn't get started.
- Getting near you, Kearns.
- All right.
Hank, you run along. I'll talk to her.
Now, listen, Queenie. You're young yet, and you don't know things.
What Hank has been saying to you is for your own good.
Yeah, and I suppose what you're saying is for my own good too.
As far as that goes, yes, it is.
Whether you believe me or not,
I'm saying this because I...
- Hank finished that. Got nowhere with it.
- Well, I'm gonna get somewhere.
And whether you like me or hate me, you're gonna pay attention to me...
...because I'm...
Well...
Me and Hank won't let you go out with that guy. He's no good.
- He wants girls who...
- You never went out with girls...
...like he does.
- Plenty, but none since I met you.
You and Hank...
Get me right, sweetie.
I'm being on the level with you.
Here's your pants, sir.
- Hurry up, Kearns.
- All right.
Oh, can't I say nothing that will make you see what I mean?
You're wasting time talking against
Mr. Warriner, if that's what you mean.
Mr. Warriner. Do you know what they say about that guy?
I don't care what they say.
They're jealous, that's all.
- You and the rest.
- Me, jealous?
What are you so interested for?
What business is it of yours where I go and who I go with?
It's my business because...
Well, because it is.
Oh, you ought to know why I'm doing this.
- It's because I...
- No, no, Eddie. Don't say it.
Oh, I gotta say it, Queenie.
I can't stop from saying it now.
And you gotta hear it.
I love you, Queenie.
I love you, and you know it.
I can't help it. I tried, but I can't.
But it's easy to say now.
I love you, dear.
And I love you, Eddie. Never forget it.
- No matter what happens.
- Do you, Queenie?
Yes, Eddie.
And that's why we can't...
Oh, don't you see now why...
Why what?
- I'm going out with Jock Warriner...
- No, you're not.
Don't try to stop me, Eddie.
It's the best way.
Here's your coat, sir.
- If you go out with that guy, I'll...
- There's a stage wait, Kearns.
Let it wait.
Queenie, I gotta go on now.
- Promise me you won't go out with him.
- Are you trying to ruin the show?
- Promise me, Queenie.
- Oh, I can't promise.
- Then you won't?
- Well, then I won't.
I'll murder that guy. I'll tear him apart.
Go on out with him. Go ahead.
Get on there, Kearns.
Queenie, you better be here when I get off.
- Get up to your dressing room.
- All right.
Oh, Queenie. You ain't got no idea what you're doing.
Oh, yes, I have. Can't I have a little fun without you trying to stop me?
Oh, I ain't trying to stop you having fun...
...but this thing will turn out bad.
That guy don't mean to marry you.
His kind don't never marry.
He ain't the type to take a girl out and buy her drinks...
...and let it go at that. You know that.
And you know what the finish will be.
Now listen to me, Hank.
Get this straight, once and for all.
I'm old enough to know what I'm gonna do.
And I don't want no more cracks from you and Mr. Wise-Guy Kearns about it either.
You can go your way, and I'll go mine.
What I'm saying's for your own good.
- Tell it to somebody you don't know.
- I ain't gonna let you get away with it.
- Give me that. That's mine.
- It's not yours...
- Well, it is mine, and you will give it...
- No, I won't.
You will give it to me.
Queenie.
Queenie, you mustn't go.
Queenie, you can't go.
Eddie, stop her.
Do something, will you?
- Queenie, just a moment, Queenie.
- Get your hands off me.
You're not gonna leave except with me and Hank.
- You get out of my way.
- You heard what I said.
You can't get away with it.
I'll kill that guy just as sure as anything.
I'll make him suffer the way he's making me suffer.
Shut up!
- I'm going.
- You can't go, Queenie.
Gonna stay right here. No.
Let go of me.
I've heard all I'm gonna hear from either of you. You've said enough.
- I'd like to see you kill anybody.
- Queenie.
You dirty, cheap little songwriter, you.
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!
Queenie, Queenie!
- Say, what kind of a sap are you, anyway?
- What do you mean?
You gonna let a john like that steal her from you because he's got a little more jack?
Well, if you do, all I can say is you're a rotten quitter.
You love her, don't you?
Oh, don't lie to me. I know you do.
Say, if I loved a girl like you do Queenie...
...l'd fight for her. What's the matter with you? Where's your nerve?
- But, Hank, you don't...
- Oh, don't pass the buck to me.
What do you think I've been meaning all along? I was on the level with this thing?
That I was in love with you?
That's a hot one.
I just been playing you for all
I could get out of you for the act.
- You been kidding me all the time?
- Sure, I been kidding you.
Say, I wouldn't marry you if you was the last man on earth.
And at that, I ain't so sure you're the right guy for her.
You're a coward.
You're afraid of Jock Warriner, or you'd go out and fight for her.
- But you're just yellow.
- You think I'm yellow?
- Sure, you're yellow.
- I'll show you how much I'm yellow.
You're yellow. You hear me?
You're yellow.
- I'm yellow?
- Yes, you are. You're yellow!
You're yellow. Do you hear me?
Oh, Eddie, you're not yellow.
You're white.
Murray Hill-8400. Yes, please.
Hello.
Hello, Uncle Jed?
It's Hank.
Say, I've decided to take those 30 weeks.
You can team me up with that blond.
I'm breathless.
Oh, I don't know what to say.
It's wonderful.
Oh, I can't thank you enough.
It's not half good enough for you.
I want you to have everything in the world.
Thank you.
- Hello, Eddie.
- Where's Queenie?
I want you to meet my girlfriend.
- Come on, let's go back to the party.
- Oh, Queenie, not yet.
Why, I haven't had you to myself for a moment tonight.
Oh, but I'd rather go back, please.
Wait, Queenie.
I have so many things
I want to tell you alone.
Oh, well, you can tell me out there.
Wait a minute, Queenie.
I've done all these things for you.
Aren't you going to be nice to me?
- Oh, Jock, let me go.
- Why should I let you go?
- Please let me go, please.
- No, I won't let you go.
You're going to stay right here with me.
- No, I'm not gonna stay here with you.
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.
- I will keep you here.
You won't keep me here, do you hear me? You won't.
- Let me go.
- I won't let you go.
I won't stay with you another minute.
- Let me go.
- I told you not to come here.
- Why did you come?
- Oh, Eddie, take me away.
What do you mean coming in here? Get out.
- I won't before I'm finished with you.
- Oh, Eddie, let's go.
- I've been looking for you.
- Now that you've found me...
...what do you want?
- I'll show you what I want.
Oh, Eddie.
What's the matter?
Oh, darling, let me see you.
Oh, Eddie. Have they hurt you, sweetheart?
Have they?
You just hit him again if you dare.
Just try it, that's all.
- Eddie, let me see you.
- Queenie, Queenie.
You don't realize what you're doing.
You let me go. And you can take your jewelry and your presents...
...and everything. I don't want anything to do with you.
Let me get a sock at that guy.
- No, Eddie don't...
- Let me get at him, just let me get at him.
- I wanna get at that guy.
- Throw him out.
- Out he goes.
- No, don't.
Don't let them. They're going to kill him.
Oh, Eddie. Don't you do that to him.
And stay out.
What do you know about that guy?
Got rid of that guy anyhow.
Oh, Eddie. Eddie, dear.
You dirty bums, you.
- Oh, Eddie, have they hurt you?
- What do you think?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I'll bet you are.
I am.
I don't know why you feel sorry for anybody like me.
I'm no good.
I can't even scrap a little.
I let a heel like that take a sock at me and get away with it.
Well, Eddie, he's bigger than you are.
- Yeah, a little bigger.
- And he's awfully strong.
I suppose you found that out from his hugs.
Well, if you couldn't stop them from throwing you out...
...how could I stop him from hugging me?
Well, there's something in that.
I guess you'd better go home.
Oh, Eddie, aren't you gonna take me home?
- I'll take you home.
- Don't you like me anymore?
Like you? Why, Queenie, I...
Oh, what is it? They've hurt you, I know they have.
Oh, I'm all right, Queenie.
Come on, let's go.
Now understand, it took six of them to throw me out.
Yes, Eddie.
Oh, what is it?
Oh, they'll be here any minute.
What does it...? What does it...?
Read it.
"Arriving 2:30, wonderful honeymoon.
See you the minute we get in.
Love to our Hank, Queenie and Eddie."
Oh, I'm so excited. What time is it?
- 12:00 last night.
- It's what?
Well, what's the matter with this thing?
See who that is.
- Hello, Jed.
- Hank!
Oh, gee.
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, Hank.
Oh, come here.
Well, well, Queenie. Congratu...
- How are you?
- Oh, fine, Uncle Jed. How are you?
Oh, I'm great. What's it going to be in the electric lights this time?
Queenie Kearns and Company?
No, sirree.
I'm only gonna be connected with the stage by marriage.
Oh, Hank, we found the cutest little home down on Long Island.
- Yeah?
- Where Eddie can work.
And say, when you're finished with this tour, you're coming to live with us.
Oh, nothing doing. Hotels for mine, where I can get service.
- I'd be all out of step in a real home.
- What do you mean?
- You're coming to live with us, all right.
- I should say she is.
Just like a trouper.
Troupers are all tramps.
Here today and gone tomorrow.
No home, no nothing.
Hank, you're just a born trouper.
Doggone this weather. It certainly is tough on colds, isn't it?
Well, say, I want Queenie and Eddie to see the act.
Say, where is that blond, anyway?
I don't know. She's always late.
Hank, you're a sight for sore eyes.
- Hello, Uncle Jed.
- Oh, hello, Flo.
- You know everybody, don't you?
- Hello, darling.
- Oh, Eddie.
- Hello, Flo.
Oh, Eddie, tell me, did you have a good time on your honeymoon?
Yeah, great.
Oh, Eddie, when you open your new show...
...gonna give me a job, aren't you?
- Why, certainly.
Oh, you're grand.
Say, come on, stupid.
Let's run through the act for them.
Okay.
But, say, you know something?
She's a born trouper.
We're gonna break in the act and bring it to New York.
- That's great.
- Say, step on it, will you?
- I've got a matinee.
- Sure.
I want two choruses...
...and you follow us, not us you.
- Come on, Flo.
Say, listen. There's gonna be no part in your show for that dame, get me?
Of course not, honey.
It's kind of rough yet, but don't you say it's pretty good for an opening?
You know, if you don't hurry, you're gonna miss that train.
- Oh, the train.
- Sure, the train.
Oh, Hank. Hank, can I help you?
Yes, you could hold my coat for me.
I forgot all about the thing.
Oh, Hank.
That's all right, Queenie.
- Goodbye, Eddie.
- Goodbye, Hank.
Oh, you'll write to me soon, won't you?
Yeah, I'll write you from Peoria.
Now, where's my hat? Where's my hat?
- Oh, where's my hat!
- Here's your hat.
Here. Here. Here's your valise.
- All right. Bring it, Uncle Jed. Come on.
- It's pretty heavy.
- Goodbye, Hank.
- Goodbye, Hank.
- Goodbye, Hank.
- Don't forget to write. Goodbye.
Oh, don't cry, dear.
Hank won't be gone long.
The season will be over before you know it, and she'll be back here with us.
It ain't that, honey.
But it seems like Hank ain't never had a real break.
And I guess I haven't done much to make her any happier.
I wouldn't feel that way about it, dear.
Hank'll be much happier back on the road.
Why, she couldn't give it up.
It's her life.
She couldn't live without it.
And now that she knows you're taken care of...
Don't cry, honey.
People can't help falling in love.
It comes to you no matter what you do.
And I love you, dear.
Oh, and I love you, Eddie.
You were just meant for me.
Opening in Peoria.
Four shows a day.
Zanny said he'd make me a star in six months.
Say, listen, it's better to star in...
In Oshkosh than to starve on Broadway.
That's a bunk.
Say, now you listen to me, stupid. I'll handle things.
Yes, and I'll have you back on Broadway and in the Palace in less than six months.
- No fooling?
- Why, it's cream in the can, baby.
Sure, it's...
It's... It's in the can.

Part one.
"MEN AND MAGGOTS."
The spirit of revolution soared over the Russian land.
A tremendous, mysterious process was taking place in countless hearts.
The individual personality, having hardly had time to become conscious of itself... dissolved in the mass, and the mass itself became dissolved in the revolutionary √©lan.
Sailors Matyushenko and Vakulinchuk.
We, the sailors of Potemkin, must support the workers, our brothers... and stand among the front lines of the revolution!
Heavy and gloomy is the sleep of the off duty.
Attentive, but clumsy.
He vents his anger on a young man.
Hurtful...
Vakulinchuk 
Comrades! The time has come when we too must speak out.
Why wait? All of Russia has risen!
Are we to be the last?
Morning.
We've had enough rotten meat!
Even a dog wouldn't eat this!
The ship doctor Smirnov.
It could crawl overboard on its own!
These aren't worms.
They are dead fly larvae.
You can wash them off with brine!
Russian prisoners in Japan are fed better than we are!
We've had enough rotten meat!
It's good meat. End of discussion!
Senior Officer Giliarovsky
Impotent rage was overflowing.
The ship's store.
The sailors refused to eat the borscht.
GIVE US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD
Part two.
"DRAMA ON THE DECK."
Commander Golikov
Whoever is satisfied with the borscht take two steps forward!
The petty officers.
You're free to go!
I'll hang the rest on the yard!
Call the guards!
Matyushenko, under the guise of breaking ranks, calls the sailors to the gun turret.
To the turret...
To the turret!
To the turret...
Guys!...
It's time.
Most of them gathered by the turret.
Stop! Don't move!
They try to sneak through the admiral's hatch.
Back, scoundrels!
That way is not for you!
I'll shoot you all like dogs!
Cover them with canvas!
Got it!
Cover them!
Attention!
Dear Lord!
Make the disobedient see reason!
Fire right into the canvas!
Vakulinchuk decides.
Fire!
BROTHERS!
Who are you shooting at?!
The rifles quavered.
Shoot!
Everyone shoot!
Shoot, scum!
To the rifles, brothers!
Smash the dragons! Smash 'em!
Smash 'em all!
Have fear of God!
Beat it, sorcerer!
To the bottom to feed the worms!
Brothers! We've won!
The bleeding Vakulinchuk flees from the furious Giliarovsky.
Vakulinchuk's overboard!
Save Vakulinchuk!
And he who was first to sound the cry of rebellion was first to fall at the executioner's hand.
To the shore.
Odessa.
A tent on the new pier in Odessa is the final resting place for Vakulinchuk.
FOR A SPOONFUL OF BORSCHT
Part three.
"THE DEAD MAN CALLS OUT."
Mist lingered on from the night...
Rumours came from the pier.
Together with the sun, the news hit the city.
The battleship raided...
...rebellion...
...shore...
A killed sailor...
We'll remember.
For a spoonful of borscht.
"Citizens of Odessa! Lying before you is the body of the brutally killed sailor Grigory Vakulinchuk... killed by a senior officer of the squadron battleship Prince Tavrichesky.
Let's take revenge on the bloodthirsty vampires!
Death to the oppressors!
Signed: Crew of the squadron battleship 
Prince Tavrichesky."
Eternal memory to the fallen fighters!
All for one.
One for all.
Down with the executioners!
Down with tyranny!
Mothers and brothers!
Let there not be differences or hostility among us!
Smash the Jews!
Shoulder to shoulder.
The land is ours.
Tomorrow is ours.
A delegate from shore.
The enemy must be dealt a decisive blow!
Together with the rebelling workers from all of Russia
WE WILL WIN!
The shore watched Potemkin tensely and attentively.
Part four.
"THE ODESSA STAIRCASE."
In those memorable days, the city lived together with the rebellious battleship.
Like a white-winged flock, boats flew to the battleship.
AND SUDDENLY
Let's go! Let's convince them!
Listen! Don't shoot!
My boy is badly hurt.
COSSACKS!
And then the brutality of the military authorities in Odessa was answered with the battleship's shells.
The target - the Odessa theater.
The generals' headquarters.
Part five.
"RENDEZVOUS WITH THE SQUADRON."
Turbulent meetings went on until evening.
The people of Odessa are waiting for the liberators!
Land the troops and the army will join you.
Landing is not possible.
The admiral's squadron is coming our way.
With one heart, they decided to face the squadron.
Night came, full of anxiety.
The squadron was sneaking up in the darkness.
Sore from constant speech, throats breathe heavily and unevenly.
Squadron on the horizon!
All hands on deck!
Prepare for battle!
Full speed!
Hearts forward!
Top speed!
Potemkin and destroyer No. 267.
The admiral attacks!
The squadron draws near!
Give the signal: join us!
Join!...
...us!
The enemy is within firing range!
All against one.
ONE AGAINST ALL.
Shoot?... or...
BROTHERS!
Above the heads of the tsar's admirals thundered a brotherly hurrah.
And proudly waving the red flag of victory, without a single shot, the rebellious battleship passed through the rows of the squadron.

THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC
A film by Carl Th. Dreyer
At the Bibliotheque de la
Chambre des Deputes in Paris resides one of the most extraordinary documents in the history of the world: the record of the trial of
Joan of Arc, the trial that ended in her death.
The questions of the judges and Joan's responses were recorded exactly.
Reading it, we discover the real Joan... not in armor, but simple and human... a young woman who died for her country... and we are witness to an amazing drama: a young, pious woman confronted by a group of orthodox theologians and powerful judges.
I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth... nothing but the truth...
In France I'm called Joan... in my village,
I'm called Jeannette.
How old are you?
Nineteen...I think.
Do you know the Lord's Prayer?
Who taught it to you?
My mother.
Will you recite it?
You claim to be sent by God?
To save France... it's why I was born.
So you think God hates the English?
I don't know if God loves or hates the English... but I do know that the English will all be chased from France... except those that die here!
You have said that St. Michael appeared to you...in what form?
Did he have wings?
Did he wear a crown?
How was he dressed?
How did you know if it was a man or a woman?
Was he naked?
Do you think God was unable to clothe him?
Did he have long hair?
Why would he have cut it?
Why do you wear men's clothing?
If we give you women's clothing, would you wear it?
When the mission that God has entrusted to me is over...
I will again dress as a woman.
So it is God who orders you to dress as a man?
And what reward do you expect from God?
The salvation of my soul.
You blaspheme God.
This is disgraceful.
For me, she is a saint.
Has God made you promises?
That has nothing to do with this trial.
Shouldn't we let the judges decide that?
Shall we put this question to a vote?
So! What has God promised you?
Perhaps that you will be delivered from prison?
When?
I know neither the day... nor the hour.
Since she couldn't be made to confess easily... we will have to be clever...
Go find a letter bearing the signature of King Charles.
I will dictate a letter.
I have great sympathy for you!
Do you know the signature of your King?
I have a letter from him for you.
I can't read.
To our beloved Joan...
I am preparing to march on Rouen with a mighty army.
I send you this devoted priest.
Have confidence in him.
Just as Jesus is the son of God... you claim to be the daughter of God?
Will you recite the
Lord's Prayer?
God has told you that you shall be delivered from prison?
By a great victory!
God has promised you that you will go to Heaven?
So you are certain of being saved?
Be careful, it's a dangerous answer.
Since you are sure of your salvation... you have no need of the Church?
Are you in a state of grace?
Respond!
Are you in a state of grace?
If I am, may God keep me there.
If I am not, may God grant it to me!
Father... permit me to attend Mass.
Joan, if we permit you to attend Mass... will you stop wearing men's clothes?
So, you would rather dress as a man than attend Mass?
These shameless clothes... abominable to God...
You are no daughter of God...
You are Satan's creature!
Go prepare the torture chamber.
She really looks like a daughter of God, eh?
The torture chamber.
Regard your judges.
Do you not feel that these learned doctors are wiser than you?
But God is even wiser!
Listen, Joan, we know that your visions do not come from God... but from the devil.
How do you know a good angel from an evil angel?
You have knelt before Satan, not St. Michael!
Don't you see that it's the Devil who has turned your head... who has tricked you... and betrayed you?
I think she's ready to abjure!
The Church opens its arms to you... but if you reject it, the Church will abandon you... and you will be alone... alone!
Yes, alone... alone, with God!
Even if you part my soul from my body...
I will confess nothing...
And if I do confess, later I will say it was forced from me!
Not for anything in the world do I want her to die a natural death.
She is very weak.
She has a fever... we must bleed her.
Be careful, she could end her own life... she's very crafty.
Bring the Sacraments.
Is there something you wish to tell us?
I fear that I am about to die... and if I do, I ask you to bury me in sacred ground.
The Church is merciful...
It always welcomes the misguided lamb.
Joan, we all want what's best for you.
Look, I have sent for the Sacraments.
I am a good Christian.
Do you not know it is the
Body of Christ you refuse?
Do you not see that you outrage God by your obstinacy?
I love and honor God... with all my heart.
You claim...that I am... sent by the devil.
It's not true... to make me suffer, the devil has sent you... and you... and you... and you...
There is nothing left to be done... alert the executioner!
Let us try one last time to save this lost soul...
It is to you, Joan, that I speak.
It is to you that I say your King is a heretic!
My King is the most noble
Christian of all.
The arrogance of this woman is insane.
France has never seen such a monster...
I have never wronged anyone.
If you do not sign, you will be burned alive...
The stake awaits you...
You don't have the right to die.
Your King still needs you.
Joan, sign... and save your life!
Joan, we have great sympathy for you.
Sign, Joan!
In the name of the Lord. Amen.
Having recognized your errors, you shall not be excommunicated.
But as you have greatly sinned, we condemn you... to perpetual imprisonment, to eat the bread of sorrow and drink the water of anguish.
A good day's work: you have saved your life and your soul.
She has only made fools of you!
Long live Joan!
Go find the judges!
I take it back, I have lied...
Hurry!
I have committed a great sin...
I have denied God... to save my life.
But Joan, you have confessed before everyone that the devil misled you.
You still believe you were sent by God?
Her answer will bring her death.
Everything I said was for fear of the stake.
Have you anything else to tell us?
We have come to prepare you for death.
Now...already?
How am I to die?
At the stake.
I'll bring the last Sacrament.
How can you still believe that you are sent by God?
His ways are not our ways.
Yes, I am His child.
And the great victory?
...my martyrdom!
...and your deliverance?
...death!
Will you take confession?
May the Body of Our Lord
Jesus Christ keep my soul... unto life everlasting. Amen.
Be courageous, Joan.
Your last hour approaches.
Dear God, I accept my death gladly... but do not let me suffer too long.
Will I be with You tonight in Paradise?
Jesus!
You have burned a saint!
The flames sheltered
Joan's soul... as it rose to heaven -
Joan whose heart has become the heart of France...
Joan, whose memory will always be cherished... by the people of France.
WAY DOWN EAST
A Simple Story of Plain People.
Since the beginning of time man has been polygamous
- even the saints of Biblical history - but the son of
Man gave a new thought. and the world is growing nearer the true ideal. He gave of One Man for One
Woman.
Not by laws - our Statures are now overburdened by ignored laws - but within the heart of man, the truth must bloom that his greatest happiness lies in his purity and constancy.
Today Woman brought up grom childhood to expect
ONE CONSTANT MATE possibly suffers more than at any point in the history of mankind, because not yet has the man-animal reached this high standard
- except perhaps in theory.
If there is anything in this story that brings home to men the suffering caused by our selfishness, perhaps it will not be in vain.
Time and place - in the story world of make-believe,
Characters; Incidents - never occurred-yet always happening.
Let us suppose a remote village in New England.
Ana Moore and her mother.
We call her "Anna" - we might have called her
"Woman" - for is not herw the story -
Sore need of money drives the mother to appeal to the
Tremonts, their rich relatives in Boston.
Oh Mother, I hate to ask them for money.
So, through the troubled twilight...
All right Mother, I'll go.
THE DEPARTURE
Tell Cousin Emma I made this hug-me-tight my own hands.
The fashion paper says these gloves are style in the city.
An errand undertaken with the tremulous footsteps that ever mark the trail of the
"poor relation"
Her cousins, the Tremonts, were giving a bridge whist party the afternoon of
Anna's arrival.
Cousin Emma Tremon
Herself.
Diana Tremont, her daughter.
An occasional interloper in
Society - The dashing
Lennox Sanderson, who depends go his living upon a rich father.
He has three specialties:
Women! Women! And
WOMEN.
There is a young person - says she's your Cousin
Anna Moore - from
Greenville.
My dear child! Whatever brought you here?
Well, you see, things haven‚Äôt been going very well - and we wanted to ask you - if -
Courage failing, she changes the subject to the hug-me-tight.
I beg your pardon.
Mrs. Tremont imparts the embarrassing news of the country cousin's arrival to her daughters.
Well, get rid of her.
But to impress their eccentric, but enormously rich aunt, the sisters pretend to be nice to Anna.
I knew you both from your pictures.
Yes, I expect to stay quite a time - that is, if we suit each other.
CHAPTER II
Near the country estate of then Santerson family is
Bartlett Village.
Also the home of Squire
Bartlett, the richest farmer in the neighborhood.
The clock hand points to blossoms - and awakening.
David Bartlett though of plain stock, haw been tutored by poets and visions as the world.
Squire Bartlett, a stern old puritan, who lives according to his awn con- seption of the Scriptures, particularly the "Thou
Shalt Nots".
Mrs. Barlett, whose gentle soul is as sweet as her beloved Scriptures.
Day dreams of twenty-one.
The great Tremont ball - the climax of the social season.
Anna's dress that she and her mother had made in case she should go out in
Society.
It's quite all right - and from the balcony you can see uis dancing.
Solely to pique the sisters of whom she is not over-fond, the aunt makes different arrangements for Anna.
Oh, Aunty! - This dress
- where‚Äôs the top?
Beneath the alcove lights' golden glow.
Anna's delicate beauty a whip to Sanderson's laded appetite.
In your beauty lives again
Elaine, the lily maid, love dreaming at Astolat.
Tell me more.
Cousin Emma hurries Anna off to bed - perhaps in fear of her own daughters being outshone.
The susceptible Sanderson, obsesed by a new desire.
Sanderson, after managing several meetings, finally lures Anna to the apartment to meet a mythical aunt.
Wait - I'll call Aunty.
Strange, she isn't here.
Just five minutes! She'll be back any time.
If she doesn't come in five minutes - I must go.
You don't understand...
I mean... I want you to... to marry me.
Anna's inexperienced heart caught in a tide of infatuation.
Oh, I' m just going to tell everybody.
But Sanderson, dreading to cross the wishes of his rich father, upon whom he is de- pendent, persuades Anna to promise secrecy.
Sanderson belongs to a class which, if it cannot get what is wants in one way, it will go to any length to get it in another.
Evil plans.
Passion's urge knows no conscience and various its ways to betrayal.
Sanderson induces Anna to marry secretly before going home.
Far away it happens that
David Bartlett is dreaming a troubled dream.
Don't worry... everything's all right. Don't you trust me?
So... it is done.
The bridal suite at
Rose Tree Inn.
To her it is the fulfillment of the dreams of girlhood
- to him but another adventure.
Here conscience knocks at the door... perhaps the slightest interruptions might still avert this tragedy, but...
My... my husband!
The afternoon the Bartlett post office was robbed.
The dread minion of the
Law - Rube Whipple,
Constable.
Seth Holcomb waiting for
Martha Perkins, whom he has been following around for twenty years.
Seth takes his liquor under tha name of
"Long Life Bitters".
Martha Perkins, a relic, nobody needs newspaper when she is around.
The Constable on the man hunt.
Napoleon, his fiery steed.
Napoleon refuses to climb the hill.
The temptation of
Napoleon.
These men! I just can't keep tem from following me.
Great news! Post office bin robbed! Dollar eighty-two cents in postage stamps, eighteen postal cards!
Heavy loss to the government.
I'll 'low bno man to laugh at the law, Seth Holcomb.
The both win.
Charter IV.
One day of the honeymoon before Anna starts home with her great secret.
Promise now.
Only two days!
Anna's return home.
Anna relieves her mother's anxiety with happy mysterious hints of wealth to come.
The old way too pleasant to give up.
Less and less frequent their secret meetings until at last...
In answer to her urgent letter...
All right. I'll wait.
You haven't told anyone aboyt our marriage?
She tells him of a tender new reason why the secret cannot be kept any longer.
You mustn‚Äôt tell ANYONE.
Well...
Well... if you MUST know
The truth...
Because we aren't married at all!
You‚Äôre just joking... tell me, aren't you joking?
WE MUST be married... see... see... our ring...
Marriage would have meant my losing everything...
I intended to make it right... but...
For Heaven's sake, don't make a scene! I'll let you have lots of money and you can go away.
Mother! Mother!
When the mother returns...
Some time afterwards - left alone by her mother's death
- Anna hides away with her shame in the village of Belden.
Maternity:
Woman's Gethsemane.
Shadows across the time dial.
The baby without a name.
My child, your baby is very sick.
Ten drops of this in a little water every hour until
I return.
Where's your husband?
Oh... he's away.
The landlady solemnly reminds Anna that if the baby dies without being baptized, it will never see Got.
Helpless and alone in the dreadful hours of the night, and stricken with a terrible fear for her baby's soul... she herself performs the sacred rite.
In the name of the Father, and of the son... and of the Holy Ghost...
I baptize thee...
TRUST LENNOX.
The vigil.
The little hands grow cold upon her breast.
My child, your baby is dead.
Sanderson on his country estate at Bartlett.
Everybody is talking about you having no husband.
I guess you'll have to leave.
Upon her back the age-old Cross.
The Pilgrimage.
Hi Holler, the Barlett's chore boy, sprucing op in the barn to meet Kate, the Squire's niece.
A reckless spectator.
Oh! Hi! Hi Holler! Hurry up! It's time to fetch Kate!
Anna, in search of work, reaches Barlett Village.
Kate, the Squire's niece, returns from a short trip to Boston.
The Professor, summer boarder at Squire Barlett's. pursues his studies.
Is this the young niece you were expecting from
Boston?
I am looking for work.
Work? You don't 'pear to have no strength to work.
Where ye from?
Whose your folks?
I haven't any folks.
For all we know she might be some loose woman wanderin' 'round. I won't take her inter my hum!
Sorry, young lady, but I ain't got nothing for yet.
Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these... ye have done it unto me!
That's Scripture, Father.
All right, Mother, we'll try her. Nobody can't ever say
I went aging the Scriptures!
Whatever your troubles, child, remember, the Lord is your Shepherd, you shall not want.
Kate's Homecoming.
It has been settled by the
Squire and David‚Äôs childhood that they are to marry,
Open admiration.
The Professor, meeting
Kate, is converted to the scientific theory of Love at first sight.
Oh, Professor, my shoe is untied.
Well, well, neighbor
Sanderson, haven‚Äôt seen you since Kate went away.
Kate - Sanderson's newest infatuation.
David, you'll have time before supper to show
Neighbor Sanderson that heifer he wants to buy.
What are you doing here?
I am working.
You can't stay here.
I live right across the way.
Come right in, Mr. Sanderson!
Supper's ready.
You father was right.
I'm afraid I'm not strong enough for this work.
Release don't do away,
Miss Moore! I... we all... like you very much.
You'll get stronger after awhile, and...
Anna! David!
Come right in.
END OF PART I
WAY DOWN EAST
Part II
Meanwhile, Anna, her past still a closed book, has become a beloved member of the household.
Knowing only Anna's blameless life among them,
David thrilled with the thought that she is the virginal white flower of his dreams.
By the river and the distant music of the falls - Around them the sweet scent of summer fields.
The David points out the two forks of the river, that go into one...
And all a thrill with a great sincere love,
Visions to her how they two might go,
On through life together...
One heart for one heart,
One soul for one soul,
One love for one love,
Even through Eternity.
At last the freat over- whelming love - only to be halted by the stark ghosts of her past.
I am only trying to say I love you, Anna - it seems
I've always loved you!
So she tells him he must never speak like this again.
The summer goes, the winter comes,
We cannot rile the year,
Nor can we rule the barque of Fate,
Nor all its strange ways steer.
The Professor's love... burdened heart brings him down to the country to see
Kate.
I'm going ter read yer some funny jokes.
Why does a chicken cross the road?
None of the rooster‚Äôs
Business.
Ain't that funny?
Three eggs, two bad.
Miss Kate, I want to ask... if you will... be... my...
The ice is going out soon.
When the river starts you'd better look out down below there!
Anna goes ton the store after forgotten goodies for the big party planned for the evening.
The villain still pursues her.
The sewing circle next to the grocery store.
Maria Poole, the landlady from Belden, visits Barlett.
That's Anna Moor lives down to Squire
Barlett's.
Moore? Her name ain't
Moore...
She lived at my house.
Mrs. Lennox, she called herself... but she never had no husband at all!
And then... there was a baby!
The Squire thinks it time that David and Kate come to an understanding.
It's my bounden duty to go and expose this woman to the Squire.
Father's set on getting married but I don't think we can without proper love... do you?
Suppose, Squire, I had been like you suspected when you first saw me?
Would there be any hope of forgiveness?
When the law's broke. it's broke, ain't it? A wrong‚Äôs a wrong and nothing can make it right.
Of course...
I was just supposing.
On their way to the big barn dance.
Maria Poole, from Belden, was at the sewing circle and she says...
No. I shouldn't tell you!
It's that...
Oh, it's awful...
But before Martha tells her thrilling news...
On their way to the big party, they stop to warm up at the Squire's with an old- fashioned dance.
No, I am not invited to the party,
The Professor, dazed but happy.
All bound 'round a woolen string!
A great big hat with a great big brim.
All bound 'round, all bound 'round.
All bound 'round with a woolen string!
David, for some reason, suddenly discovers he is not interested in the party.
The neighbors' barn dance.
Moro and worried by Anna's presence... also afraid she will interfere in his pursuit of
Kate - Saderson -
I can't have you around here where I live!
Suppose they find out about your past life?
You'd have to fet out them!
Suppose they find out about YOUR past life!
Oh, it's different with a
MAN! He's supposed to sow his wild oats.
At last Martha gets her opportunity with the
Squire.
Does Lennox Sanderson mean anything to you?
Why do you ask such question?
Because I can't keep silent any longer.
I love you! I want you to be my wife.
It's about Anna Moore.
She lived in Belden under the name of Lennox.
Mrs. Lennox.
A baby was born, but there ware not no wedding ring to the finger.
No, father... you must have proof.
I'll go to Belden in the morning... and if it is true...
Please! Please don't!
I can never be ANY
MAN'S WIFE!
The next morning. The
Squire on his way to
Belden to investigate
Martha's story.
The Squire's on important business, isn't he?
So happens that
Sanderson...
At noon Squire arrives in Belden.
It's all true. Why, her baby was born in this very room.
Late afternoon.
Roses in wintertime!
Lan' sakes!
Don't want no supper of your getting!
The time's come for you to get your things and get out of this house!
Don't want no words!
Just get out!
It means she is going to get out of my house!
I found out all about her... she ain't fit to be here!
She's the mother of a baby, but she ain't got
NO HUSBAND!
Tell them it's a lie,
Anna!
I... I can't!
You found out so much!
Why didn't you find out the whole truth?
That I was an ignorant girl betrayed through a mock marriage.
This man... an honored guest at your table... why don't find out what
HIS life haw been?
For HE is the man who betrayed me!
And then the storm.
The sugar camp.
Anna's lost in the storm... get out men... quick!
Frenzied... tortured...
The calling river.
The storm lulls.
The great ice-break.
The ice jam gives way... rushing to the falls.
Quick! Quick!
The Doctor!
Toward morning.
The Squire asks forgiveness.
Come, Anna, I know I didn't the right thing. I'm willing to marry you now if you want me.
I... I will.
I will.
Interested witnesses.
Seth, wilt thou have this woman to be the wedded wife...?
I... I will.
The one man for the one woman,
Between them the
Sacramental bond...
Life's cleanest and sweetest.

Our story deals with one of those queer tricks that Fate sometimes plays.
Nobody would believe, for instance, that the entire lives of a peaceful American boy and girl -
- could be changed by a funny little war between two small countries far across the sea.
And yet it came to pass. The spies of the two little nations were at a Pacific seaport, -
- each trying to prevent the other getting ships and supplies.
"Gentlemen, the enemy have just purchased the steamship Navigator."
"There she lies now, and it is our patriotic duty to destroy that ship."
"We will send her adrift in the fog tonight before the new crew goes aboard. -
- The wind - the tide - and the rocks will do the rest."
The wealthy ship owner who has just sold the Navigator.
And his daughter.
Rollo Treadway - Heir to the
Treadway fortune - a living proof that -
- every family tree must have its sap.
"I think I'll get married."
"Today."
"We'll sail for Honolulu tomorrow on our honey-moon - get two tickets."
"He had completed all arrangements
- - except to notify the girl."
"Will you marry me?"
"Certainly not!"
"I think a long walk would do me good."
"Your tickets, sir - - and congratulations."
"The boat sails at ten in the morning, sir."
"I don't get up that early - so I'll go aboard tonight."
Going on a honeymoon without a bride is like singing the words of -
- "Kiss Me Again" to the music of "Alice, Where Art Thou."
"What pier, sir?"
"Pier two."
"I must get some papers off the
Navigator, so stop at Pier 12."
Pier 12 >>> Pier 2
"Is there any one on board?"
"Nobody."
Under the cover of darkness the foreign agents prepared to carry out their plans.
"Help!"
The next morning found the Navigator drifting helplessly at sea.
"Will you marry me?"
"This is a fine time to ask me that.
I'm cold and hungry and - -"
"Put up that bright one."
"She's quarantined."
"Try and catch them!"
"Hey! Wait a minute!"
By the time they were ready to say "good-night" -
- they had found a couple of sea-going tuxedos.

"Cannibals!"
"We're safer on the boat."
"We're drifting toward them."
"We're safe! I've anchored the ship."
"We are sinking! It's just a matter of time until we're captured."
"Can't you fix it?"
"That would have to be fixed from the outside."

The Western and Atlantic Flyer speeding into Marrietta, Ga., in the Spring 1861.
There were two loves in his live.
His engine,
And--
"Fort Sumter has been fired upon."
"Then the war is here."
"Yes, dad, and I'm going to be one of the first to enlist."
"Aren't you going to enlist?"
"Your name?"
"Johnnie Gray."
"Occupation?"
"Engineer on the Western and Atlantic Railroad."
"Don't enlist him. He is more valuable to the South as an engineer."
"We can't use you."
"William Brown."
"Occupation?"
"Bartender."
"If you lose this war don't blame me."
"Did Johnnie enlist?"
"He didn't even get in line."
"He's a disgrace to the South.
"Why didn't you enlist?"
"They wouldn't take me."
"Please don't lie. I don't want you to speak to me again until you are in uniform.
A year later. In a Union encampment just North of Chattanooga.
General Thatcher, and his chief spy, Captain Anderson.
"I Know every foot of this railroad from Marietta to Chattanooga, and with ten picked men I cannot fail."
"We will enter the South as civilians coming from the neutral state of Kentucky to join the southern cause."
"At Big Shanty we will steal the train while the passengers and the crew are at dinner, and proceeding North we will burn every bridge, cutting off the supplies of the army now facing you."
"Then the day you steal the train I will have General Parker advance to meet you."
"As soon as I arrive I will let you know how seriously father is wounded."
"Big Shanty.
Twenty minutes for dinner."
"Three men stole my General.
I think they are deserters."
"Why not stop and fight them?"
"I'm afraid they have us greatly outnumbered."
The Southern army facing Chattanooga is ordered to retreat."
General Parker's victorious
Northern army advancing.
"There is only one man on that engine."
In the enemy's country, hopelessly lost, helplessly cold and horribly hungry.
"At Nine o'clock tomorrow morning our supply trains will meet and unite with General Parker's army at the Rock River bridge."
"Then the army, backed by our supply trains, will advance for a surprise attack on the rebels left flank."
"Once our trains and troops cross that bridge, nothing on the earth can stop us."
"This girl was in the baggage car when we stole the train, so I thought it best to hold her."
"We had better stay here until daybreak to see where we are."
"It was so brave of you to risk your life, coming into the enemy's country, just to save me."
After a nice, quiet, refreshing night's rest.
"We've got to get back to our lines somehow and warn them of this coming attack."
"I will get that spy before he reaches the Southern lines. You follow with the supply trains as planned."
"We must pick up more firewood."
The Rock River bridge.
The Northern division nearing the bridge to meet the supply trains.
"That bridge is not burned enough to stop you, and my men will ford the river."
Heroes of the day.
"Is that your uniform?"
"I had to wear it to get through the lines."
"Take it off!"
"Enlist the lieutenant."
"Occupation?"
"Soldier."

She- "Why -what do you mean?" 
He - "I'm crazy about you." 
She- "This is so sudden."
He - "You're the only girl I ever loved." 
She- "Give me time to think."
He - "No, I must know now." 
She- "Have you ever proposed to any other girl?"
He - "Don't you care for me just a little?" 
She- "I don't know."
He - "It means everything to me." 
She- "What will father say?"
He - "Will you marry me?" 
She- "Do you really mean it?"
He - "Yes."   She- "Yes."
Then use your own Judgment,...
"Do you think you could learn to love me?"
"I have."
"When are you going to fight again?"
"When I'm drafted."
"I mean, who do you fight next?"
"Yes."
"Sir, it's time to take your liniment."
"These people will never know the difference - the champion -
- will win and no one will ever hear of Battling Butler again."
"If you're going to fight tomorrow you'll have to hurry to catch the train."
"Arrange the train."
"In this corner we have Battling Butler."
Butler's trainer and manager.
"- the Lightweight Champion."
"The Alabama Murderer challenges the winner."
"I'm champion."
"That means you cannot go back to the mountains, sir."

"That was Battling Butler - he fought!"
"You didn't think we'd throw away a championship just to get even with you."
"Thanks - for saving me."
"I've been saving you for three weeks."
"That was Battling Butler."
"I lied to you -- I'm not even a fighter."
"I'm glad."

Subtitle by Reza Fa
"IT" is that quality possessed by some... which draws all others with its magnetic force.
With "IT" you win all men if you are a woman - and all women if you are a man.
"IT" can be a quality of the mind as well as a physical attraction.
<u>Elinor Glyn</u> [signature]
WALTHAM 
THE BIGGEST STORE 
IN THE WORLD
Leaving his department store to his son, Cyrus P. Waltham... has gone to Herrin, Illinois, for the shooting.
"A gentleman to see you, sir."
Good luck
"For a good boy - on his first work day."
"If you ever go to work, Monty,
I'll do as much for you."
"IT" by Elinor Glyn
"IT" is that peculiar attribute that some people have, which attracts the opposite sex. 
The possessor of "IT" has it unconsciously and has irresistible sexual magnetism.
Mothers spoil boys with "IT", and women never refuse them!
"Old fruit, you've got 'IT'!"
"What the devil are you doing?"
"No - too bad - but you haven't any 'IT'!"
"Run away, Monty, the keepers are coming."
"I'm to look over the store. Come along."
"Hot socks - the new boss!"
"Sweet Santa Claus, give me him!"
"Let's have a double wedding - you and him - and me and the Prince of Wales!"
"Where do you figure?
The Prince is going to be our best man!"
"I've inspected all the lady employees - and not one of them has 'IT'!"
"You went over big, dearie!"
"Just you wait - I'll take the snap out of your garters yet!"
"Look! If I ever saw 'IT', that's 'IT'!"
"Shall we gnaw a chop at the club tonight?"
"Thanks, but I have an engagement at the Ritz."
"Could I - is it asking too much - would it be possible for me to - to drive you home?"
"I'd be very glad to go with you - if you'd ride in my car."
Betty lived in that fashionable downtown suburb -
Gas-house Gables -
"Would - could - do you ever dine?"
"I'd love to -"
"- at the Ritz!"
"Shall we dress?"
"Of course - how absurd!"
"Then I'll pop around at eight?"
"Toodles is hungry."
"The doctor says I can't go back to the store for a month - and
I can't let you do any more for me."
"Don't be sill, Molly! I won't go back on a pal!"
"That pest of a landlady and her friend just left.
The baby shouldn't do this - and I shouldn't do that -"
"If this was my baby,
I'd tell 'em where to head in!"
"I'm dining out tonight
- at the Ritz!"
Every evening in America, eighteen million blondes prepare to dine with gentlemen. One of the eighteen million -
"Mother, would you approve of my being Mrs. Cyrus T. Waltham?"
"He hasn't proposed yet
- but he's going to!"
"Mademoiselle's car is without."
"A nice, quiet table - in the corner, Mr. Montgomery?"
"I don't crave this table.
When I'm in the swim,
I want to be with the goldfish!"
"I'll take the same!"
"Who is the girl with Monty?"
"I don't know - but isn't she attractive?"
"Who's the blonde with
Mr. Waltham?"
"Adela Van Norman - they've been friends for years. Some day they'll marry and end it all."
"Of course you're reading
Elinor Glyn's latest story, 'IT'?"
"Monty was raving about it today. What is 'IT'?"
"Here's Elinor Glyn herself!
Let's ask her to tell us something about 'IT'."
"Madame Glyn, we've been talking about your latest story.
Just what is this 'IT'?"
"Self-confidence and indifference as to whether you are pleasing or not - and something in you that gives the impression that you are not at all cold. That's 'IT'!"
"If you have 'IT', you will win the girl you love."
"Cyrus, do you believe in 'IT'?"
"I certainly do!"
"I'm going to get my wish!"
"Oh, I must telephone!"
"Who is that charming girl with you?"
"This is a great pleasure."
"I'll bet you won't even recognize me, the next time we meet."
"I'll take the bet - and you can name the stakes."
In a shopgirl's day, the first thousand customers are the crabbiest.
"She always takes goods on approval - wears them around for six months - and then finds she doesn't approve!"
"- and the girl insulted me!"
"See that the garment is replaced - and send the salesgirl to my office."
"Young lady, in this store the customer is always right -"
"I'm the salesgirl!
Go on - bawl me out!"
"Well, anyway, I lose the bet for not recognizing you. What's the forfeit?"
"Oh, that wasn't a real bet.
I don't want anything -"
"Thanks, Adela, I'll be very happy to dine with you tonight."
"If you insist on paying your bet, you can take me out tonight."
"All right! Where?"
"Let's go to the beach - and do it up right!"
HOT DOGS!
Tasty and satisfying!
The best on the beach!
House of Amusements
"Hold me tight,
Mr. Waltham."
"Happy?"
"So you're one of those 
Minute Men - the minute you know a girl you think you can kiss her!"
Poverty is no disgrace -- until meddling neighbors hear of it.
"There's no use arguing!
We're going to take that baby to the Home, until you're well!"
"Get that story."
"If women like you would stay home and have babies of your own, we'd all be better off!"
"We're doing our duty.
The mother is ill - and she has no means of support."
"This is my baby!"
"I don't believe it."
"I'm the baby's mother -
I'm not sick - and I've got a job! Laugh that off!"
"Haven't I a job, Monty - at Waltham's? Tell 'em!"
"Is that the baby's father?"
"Him? He couldn't even give birth to a suspicion!"
"Who is your husband?
Have you a husband?"
"None of your business!"
"I say, Betty, this isn't really your child, is it?"
"Are you blind? Can't you see the resemblance?"
...forgive me for last night, Betty, and come to the theater with me tonight?
I promise not to make the same mistake
"I have tashted the milk of human kindnesh - an' it's a lot of Fermillac!"
"B'lieve it or not - my baby is its mother!"
The young mother fights hard for her baby, like a tigress in the sand confronting social workers.
A sharp-dressed man of the city declared that the girl had means enough and was able to keep all the obligations
"I'm the chappie - the man about town -
I'm the ample means!"
"We are investigating the case of a girl who says she's employed here -"
"- she - she - there's a baby."
"She gave the name of Betty Lou Spence."
The young mother clutched the little boy to her chest and defied all who tried to take the child.
"Thank you. You see, we had to verify her story."
"She's the one. She told me it's her baby - told me with her own lipsh!"
"Will you issue the bonus checks now, Mr. Waltham?"
"Are you mad at me because I slapped you?"
"I'm sorry - but a girl
has to do that.
You know how those things are!"
"Let's forget it.
We've got each other straight now, haven't we?"
"Yes - we have!"
"It's a star sapphire."
"It's pretty - but
I like diamonds better."
"Would you like some diamonds for yourself?"
"Betty, I'm crazy about you -"
"I love you, too."
"I'll buy you diamonds - clothes - everything you want -"
"What are you trying to do?
Offer me one of those left-hand arrangements?"
"I'm crazy about you!
Isn't that enough?"
"I suppose that's what you men call love!"
"Cancel my appointments, please. I'm leaving town for a week."
Betty was too poor to quit her job - and too proud to stay. So she quit!
Woman Offered Job
"I - I've come to forgive you."
"You don't mean you thought the baby was really mine?"
"There's its mother!
Can't you see the resemblance?"
"What a joke on Waltham -
I told him it was your baby!"
"He thought it was mine?"
"And he wouldn't even give me the benefit of the doubt!"
"I'll make him propose to me - and when he does, I'll laugh in his face! And you're going to help me do it!"
"But - he's going on a yachting cruise and - and I'm going with him!"
"Fine! I'll yacht with you."
"But, I say - what about your clothes?"
"That's the joke on you - you're going to buy them for me."
"Give me your word you won't tell him - anything!"
"Is Mr. Waltham aboard?"
"Not yet, sir."
"The party's off. We might as well go back."
"Oh no, sir! Mr. Waltham's expecting you - he'll be here any minute."
"Shall I show you to your cabins?"
"Something I can get for you, Mr. Montgomery?"
"No, thanks - I'm just prowling about."
"Just going for some - some - cigars."
"Everything ready, Captain?"
"Let's get under way."
"I'm not feeling so well."
"Tea, sir?"
"Feeling better, Monty?"
"I feel so low, old chap, that I could get on stilts and walk under a dachshund!"
"Shall I call Miss Van Cortland, sir? She's in her cabin."
"I say, I almost forgot about Miss Van Cortland."
"Miss Van Cortland - the - the girl I asked when you asked me to ask someone."
"Monty, who is Miss
Van Cortland?"
"You - you tell them, old thing."
"She's a very nice girl. I -
I believe Monty met her in Paris last summer."
"You idiot!
Who is this girl?"
"She's a ripping sort, really!
She's positively topheavy with 'IT'."
"Oh, Monty, am I late for tea? I'm so sorry."
"Mr. Waltham! It's been years, hasn't it?"
"Won't you have some tea?"
"Haven't I seen you some place?"
"In Paris, perhaps.
I'm there so often."
"Desirez-vous du sucre?"
"What do you mean by bringing her?"
"You know what sort she is - with her fatherless child!"
"But, I say - it isn't fatherless -"
"I won't have her on board! We'll put back to port."
"Do you think we'll have as nice a day as this all day, Captain?"
"That's the last time I'll get you out of a scrape!"
"Miss Van Cortland seems to be rather lacking in reserve, doesn't she?"
"Personally, I think she has plenty - in reserve!"
"Betty, I've something to say to you."
"Won't it wait until morning?"
"I've been thinking things over, Betty. I want to talk to you - seriously."
"Be serious - with you?
How silly!"
"I don't care what you've been - I want you to marry me!"
"I'd rather marry your office boy!"
"He asked me - and I laughed at him - and now it doesn't seem so darned funny, after all!"
"It was a ghastly joke, old man - her baby's just a moth -
I mean a myth!"
"It's her friend's baby!
And she's crying for you -
I mean Betty, not the baby -"
"But you said yourself it was her baby -"
"Take the wheel, Monty
- I'm going to find her."
"The ballast has shifted to port, sir - but there's no danger!"
"Silly of me, but I'm afraid I overdid it - made a left-hand turn and what not -"
"Take your girl friend.
I had to knock her cold - but maybe it'll do her good."
"Betty, where are you going?"
"I'm going home!"
"Monty will get you."
"Monty, I wonder if there's anything between them?"
"I'm afraid there is."
"We're just a couple of
It-less 'ITS'!"
Soon after its premiere, the film Metropolis was severely truncated and alterations were made.
From that time onward, more than a quarter of the film was assumed to have been lost.
Then, in 2008, a virtually complete version of the film was discovered in Buenos Aires.
What had been preserved was, however, a heavily damaged copy of the film that had been printed to 16mm film stock, lacking the full frame of the picture's original aspect ratio.
A considerable amount of the film reconstruction was able to be completed and the correct sequence of its editing established by means of this Argentinian material.
Spanish intertitles have been translated into German with the aid of the censor-cards.
In order to display in their correct position on the image the cropped elements taken from the 16mm negative, the missing portion of the frame has been marked by black.
The intertitles appear with their original graphic treatment.
Those titles which appear in a different typeface (like the one used here) have been added to summarise the content of still-missing scenes as far as is necessary to facilitate an adequate understanding of the storyline.
Shorter gaps are indicated by small segments of black leader.

Epigraph:
THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS
MUST BE THE HEART!
Shift change.
Deep beneath the earth lay the
City of the Workers.
As deep beneath the earth as the City of the Workers lay, so high above it towered the complex known as the "Sons' Club", with its lecture halls and libraries, its theatres and stadiums.
Fathers, for whom every revolution of a mechanical wheel meant gold, had bestowed upon their sons the wonder of the Eternal Gardens.
Which of you ladies shall today have the honour of entertaining Master Freder,
Joh Fredersen's son?
Look! These are your brothers!
Look - !
These are your brothers!
Who - was that?
But this was what happened to Freder - the son of Joh Fredersen, the master of Metropolis - as he sought out the girl:
To the new Tower of Babel - to my father - !
Why is it, Josaphat, that I learn of this explosion from my son, and not from you - !
Details - !
What were you looking for in the Machine-Halls, Freder?
I wanted to look into the faces of the people whose little children are my brothers, my sisters...
Your magnificent city, Father - and you the brain of this city - and all of us within the light of this city... -
...and where are the people, Father, whose hands built your city - ?
Off where they belong...
...off where they belong...?
...in the Depths...?
And if those in the Depths one day rise against you?
The chief foreman of the Heart-Machine, Grot, - with an important message...
There were two more copies of those damnable plans, Herr Fredersen...
...in the pockets of two men who met with an accident today at the M-Machine...
How is it, Josaphat, that these plans were brought to me by Grot, rather than by you?
Apply to the G-Bank for your remaining wages...
Father, do you know what it means to be dismissed by you? -
It means: To be sent below! -
Father - below! Into the Depths - !
Do you know what it means to be dismissed like that by Joh Fredersen?
Would you like to come with me,
Josaphat?
Go home, Josaphat, and wait for me...
I still have a long way to go tonight...
Into the Depths, - to my brothers...
From today on I wish to be kept precisely informed of my son's every move...
Brother...
...the Machine! There needs to be someone at the Machine!
There will be someone at the machine...
ME.
Listen to me...
I want to trade my life with you...
Josaphat.
99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.
Wait for me - both of you...
Josaphat.
99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.
In the middle of Metropolis, there stands a strange house that the centuries had overlooked.
The man who dwelled within was Rotwang, the inventor.
Hel
Born to bring me happiness and a benediction to all mankind.
Lost to Joh Fredersen.
Died giving life to Freder, Joh Fredersen's son.
A mind like yours, Rotwang, should be able to forget...
Only one time in life did I forget something: that Hel was a woman - and you a man...
Let the dead lie, Rotwang...
She's dead for you as she is for me...
For me she isn't dead, Joh Fredersen - for me she lives - !
Do you think the loss of a hand is too high a price for recreating Hel - ?!
Do you wish to see her - ?!
Now, Joh Fredersen - ?!
Isn't it worth losing a hand to have created the man of the future - the Machine-Man - ?!
24 more hours of work - and no man, Joh Fredersen, will be able to differentiate the Machine-Man from a mortal - !
The woman is mine, Joh Fredersen!
Hel's son was yours!
And what brings you my way,
Joh Fredersen?
I need your advice - as usual, when all my experts fail me...
Can you decipher for me these plans that for months have been getting discovered in the pockets of my workers?
...at two... once my shift ends!
She has summoned us again...
Father - ! Father - !
Will ten hours never come to an end - ??! !
- it's a blueprint of the two-thousand-year-old catacombs deep below the lowest levels of your Metropolis...
I should like to glean what my workers are doing exactly in those catacombs...
Today I shall tell you the legend of THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THE TOWER OF BABEL...
The Legend of THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THE TOWER OF BABEL
Come! Let us build a tower whose zenith shall reach unto the stars!
And at the tower's zenith we shall write:
Great is the world and its Maker!
And great is Man!
...but those who had conceived of the Tower of Babel could not build the Tower of Babel.
The task was too great.
So they paid wages to outside hands...
But the hands that built the Tower of Babel knew nothing of the dream of which the head that had conceived it had been fantasising.
The hymns of praise of one man became the curses of others.
The same language was spoken, but these men did not understand one another...
Great is the world and its Maker and great is Man
HEAD and HANDS require a Mediator.
THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS
MUST BE THE HEART!
And where is our Mediator,
Maria - ?
Wait for him!
He will surely come!
We will wait, Maria...!
But not for much longer - !
Oh Mediator, have you finally come...
You summoned me - here I am!
Rotwang, give the Machine-Man the likeness of this woman...
I shall sow discord between them and her!
I shall destroy their belief in this woman -
Leave me alone now, Joh Fredersen...
You'll find the way back without me...
You fool! Now you shall also lose the last remaining thing you still had from Hel... your son...
Until tomorrow, in the cathedral!
END OF THE PRELUDE
INTERMEZZO
Freder witnesses a monk at the pulpit who preaches:
"Verily, I say unto you: the days of which the Apocalypse speaks draw nigh!"
The monk's hand points to the Bible, in which it is written:
"And I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, having a golden cup in her hand.
And upon her forehead was a name written, a mystery:
BABYLON THE GREAT, the Mother of Abominations ofthe Earth.
And I saw the woman drunken with the blood ofthe Saints."
You will annihilate Joh Fredersen - him and his city and his son - !
GLUTTONY
AVARICE
PRIDE
LUST
ENVY
ANGER
SLOTH
Had you come earlier, you wouldn't have frightened me...
I now beg of you: stay away from me and my beloved...!
Where is the one whose clothes you are wearing?
Josaphat.
99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.
Would you please wake Georgy up?
He must lead me to the Workers' City at once...
No. 11811, get back to the Machine and forget that you ever left it - understood?
I have to have someone who's faithful to me, Josaphat, - otherwise, how shall I attain the end-goal of my path - ?!
I must go on, Josaphat, - must now, on my own, seek out the person to whom Georgy was supposed to lead me...
Tonight, Josaphat - tonight when I come back...
Josaphat.
99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.
So, what price are you demanding for leaving this residence tonight?
You still don't seem to have grasped who sent me here...
CENTRAL BANK OF METROPOLIS
This man doesn't want his son to find you still here tonight!
In three hours' time
I shall be calling for you!
Come! It is time to give the Man-Machine your face!
Where is Maria - ?!
She's with your father...
I'm telling you, she is with your father - !
"She is the most perfect and most obedient tool that a man has ever possessed!
Tonight you shall see how she holds up before the eyes ofthe upper hundred.
You shall see her dance, and if only one single person recognises the machine in her,
I will call myself a bungler who never succeeded at anything!
C. Rotwang"
"C. A. Rotwang requests Herr Joh Fredersen to be his guest this evening."
I want you to go to those in the Depths in order to annihilate the work of your prototype!
"C. A. Rotwang requests Herr Joh Fredersen to be his guest this evening."
Verily, I say unto you: the days of which the Apocalypse speaks draw nigh...!
All Seven Deadly Sins, on her behalf - !
Death overtakes the City - !
END OF THE INTERMEZZO
The Revelation of St. John
Avalun Publishing, Hellerau
I escaped from the Thin Man wearing this attire...
But for ten days your father's bloodhound has been making the Workers' City unsafe...
The only thing keeping the workers in check is their expectation for the Mediator promised unto them...
Even stranger things have been happening, Freder...
On that evening when you fell ill...
...once the best of friends... because of that woman...
...the other man... on that same evening...
...the Eternal Gardens lie abandoned... but night after night in Yoshiwara...
And this woman, at whose feet all sins are heaped...
...is also called Maria...
That same woman that those in the Depths regard as a saint - ?!
Many now go to the City of the Dead, to a woman they have judged to be as true as gold.
The Mediator is not likely to miss that occasion...
Whatever happens tonight: it is my express order to allow the workers to do as they please...
Joh Fredersen wants to let those in the Depths use force and do wrong so that he can claim the right to use force against them...
When you spoke to your poor brothers, you talked about peace, Maria... today a mouthpiece of Joh Fredersen incites them to rebel against him...
She will destroy their belief in the Mediator!
You know I've always talked about peace... but your Mediator hasn't come...
You've waited long enough!
Your time has come - !
...but I've tricked Joh Fredersen!
Your clone does not obey his will - only mine alone!
Who is the living fodder for the machines for Metropolis - ?!
Who smears the machine-joints with their own marrow - ?!
Who feeds the machines with their own flesh - ?!
Let the machines starve, you fools - !
Finish them off - ! !
Do them in - these machines - ! !
You aren't Maria - ! ! !
YOU ARE NOT MARIA - !
Maria talks of peace, not murder - !
This is not Maria - ! !
Joh Fredersen's son - ! !
Do him in, the dog, in his white silken hide - ! ! !
Get your women, your sons, out of the Workers' City!
Let no-one stay behind!
Death to the machines - ! ! !
In the attic of his home,
Rotwang displays for Maria his ever-growing intoxication with his triumph over Fredersen:
" - and twice over did I trick Joh Fredersen - !
For I concealed from him that his son wants to be the Mediator of your brothers - and is in love with you - !"
Maria isn't the only one listening to Rotwang.
On the other side of the attic's window,
Joh Fredersen was eavesdropping...
Joh Fredersen breaks into Rotwang's attic.
He wrestles with his old rival and overtakes him.
Maria is free.
...faithful after all...
Come, Freder!
We still have to go through the Workers' City.
Women and men, let no-one miss out on today - !
Death to the machines - ! !
Not one man - not one woman has stayed behind - !
Leave the machines - !
Let them race to their death - !
To the Heart-Machine - !
DANGER
Open the gates!
You have to open the gates!
If the Heart-Machine perishes, nothing in the Machine-District will be left standing - ! !
Have you lost your minds - ??
If the Heart-Machine perishes, the entire Workers' City will be laid to waste - ! !
Where are your fathers, your mothers?
Do you have any idea that your son is amongst the workers?!
Yes - you! You're Maria - !
To the air shafts - quickly! Quickly!
The reservoirs have burst! The city is drowning - !
We'll take the children to the Sons' Club!
Why are all the lights out?
I need to know - !
Where is my son?! ! !
Tomorrow thousands will ask in fury and desperation:
Joh Fredersen, where is my son - ?!
Where are your children??!
The city is drowned, the shafts are totally flooded - ! !
Who bade you attack the machines, without which you're finished, you idiots - ??!
It's the witch's fault - !
We'll be looking on as the world goes to the devil - !
Find the witch; this is all her fault - !
Strike her dead - ! !
Now I'm going to take you home, my Hel - !
The witch - ! the witch - !
There she is - ! there she is - !
Where are our children, you witch, you - ??!
Burn the witch. -
To the stake with her! ! !
To the stake with her - ! !
Hel - ! My Hel - ! !
Your children... saved - ! ! !
Head and hands want to join together, but they don't have the heart to do it...
Oh Mediator, show them the way to one another...
THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS
MUST BE THE HEART!

A German folk tale
Behold!
The portals of darkness are open, and the shadows of the dead hunt over the Earth...
"Back! Hold! Why dost thou scourge mankind with War, Plague, Famine?!"
"The Earth is mine!"
"Never will the Earth be thine:
Man belongs to God!"
"Look below!"
"All things in heaven and on Earth are wonderful!
But the greatest wonder is man's freedom to choose between good and evil!"
"Dost thou know Faust?"
"A knave like all others!
He preaches good and does evil!
He seeks to turn base metal into gold!
Behold his greed!"
"A wager: I will wrest
Faust's soul away from God!"
"If thou canst destroy what is divine in Faust, the Earth is thine!"
"No man can resist evil!
The bet is on!"
"The Plague! The Plague!"
The devastating pestilence raged: in a few days half the town lay dying.
To find a cure for the Plague,
Faust spent day and night in prayer with God.
And there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house without its dead.
"Lord God, bless this act of redemption!
Only you can alleviate our misery!"
"Help... help!
My mother is dying!"
Mortal terror and fear of death swept through the town.
"Repent, fast, pray!
Only Faith can vanquish death!"
"Have respect for the dead!"
"We still live, we still love! We shall die dancing in each other's arms!"
"Who has faith shall live!
But death will take the sinners!"
"The Plague! The Plague!"
"Compassion, Faust!
Only you can help us!"
"Get hence! We are lost!
No faith is any help.
No knowledge is any help.
All is vanity... "
Mine God, thou art merciful and a great goodness.
The third great Key to the Force of the Ghost of Hell.
And if thou would summon the Prince of
Darkness to aid thee and give thee all the might and glory of the world, go to a crossroad and call on him three times.
"I invoke thy aid,
Spirit of Darkness: show thyself!"
"Come forth, demon of evil!"
"As thou art called with thy unholy name:
MEPHISTO appear!"
"You have summoned me!"
"Here I am!"
I renounce God and his heavenly legion, and so shall be mine the power and glory of the world.
"Be gone from me, Satan!"
"To have the power to help for only one day!"
"One day! Try it!
Just one trial day!"
"When the hour-glass has run out... "
"... you go free, the Pact canceled! Sign!" glory... power
"Can you help the hungry and the sick?"
"What you wish I will perform: you are the master and I am your servant. "
"A drop of blood!"
"Blood is quite a remarkable substance!"
"Only for one day?"
"Until the sand has run out!"
"Faust! Help us!"
"Then I shall help in the devil's name!"
"A miracle! A miracle!"
"In the name of Christ crucified, help my child!"
"He cannot look upon the Holy Cross!"
"He is in league with the devil!
Stone him! Stone him!"
"Deliver me, elixir of death!"
"You may not cheat me! Remember our pact: the trial day is not over yet. "
"Death sets all men free!"
"Is that death?"
"It is life, Faust, seducing you with the fair image of your youth. "
"Wretched Faust, why do you seek death? You have not yet lived!"
"I despise my life!"
"Your life was only the dust and mold of books! Pleasure is all!"
"I am too old!"
"I offer you the greateast happiness: youth! Seize it!"
"Give me youth!"
"I've caught you, old boy!"
"Take me to her!"
"Step upon my cloak... "
"... and the spinning Earth will spread before you!"
"The wedding feast for the Duchess of
Parma, the most beautiful woman in Italy!"
"Strange guests!"
"To pay tribute to the highest beauty, my lord brings you his kingdom's treasures!"
"The day is over! The sand has run out!
Be as you were!"
"Youth... Leave me youth!"
"Our pact stands for eternity?"
"You have tasted all of life's pleasures, Faust! From indulgence to indulgence, sensation without end, yet nothing satisfied you!"
"What will you: a woman, a game of chance, an orgy?
Whatever you wish, I must grant!"
"Do you want the Emperor's crown?"
"Home!"
"Take me home! And at once!"
"Is today a feast day in your town?"
"Are you heathen born that you have never heard of Holy Easter?"
"It is as if life had stood still:
All is as it once was!"
"An innocent little girl, running to a priest... she is not for you!"
"Tedeum laudamus
Praise the Lord. "
"Vacation, mother!"
"I know more obliging wenches. for you here!"
"I want only her.
Do as I command!"
"Brother Valentin!"
"Once she has this little golden chain in the house she will begin to feel the devil's power!"
"Good gracious, how pretty you are!"
"Any lovers yet?"
"What have you, child?"
"Tell the mother of God, if you cannot tell me!"
"May I visit Aunt Marthe?"
Frau Marthe Schwerdtlein
"Three little drops from this love potion by night and all the girls' hearts will be yours!"
"Look Aunt Marthe what I found in my drawer... "
"A rich treasure!"
"I found it in my jewelry box!"
"Just once let me try on the beautiful necklace!"
"A small bouquet for the bridegroom, a little wreath for the bride!"
"Pardon, lovely lady.
I seek Frau Marthe Schwerdtlein!"
"From your cousin... from Lombardy...!"
"He gave me this necklace as a gift for you!"
"Those we encircle within this ring shall be sweethearts...!"
"One, two, three.
Makes you free!"
"Pardon: my stomach is too weak for such a fiery drink!"
"Permit, that I mix myself a litle drink as I learned it in Padua!"
"My friend, a prince of the noblest blood!"
"He loves me...
...loves me not...
...loves me... "
"Yes, with all his heart he loves you!"
"She loves me... "
"She loves me not. "
"She loves you!"
"I am yours forever!"
"He loves me!"
"What are you waiting for?
Your sweetheart herself lights the way for you!"
"Cursed matchmaker!"
"I will keep the brother out of the way!"
"To the prettiest girl in town!"
"No other girl is as pretty as your sister: long live Gretchen!"
"A pretty girl is not pure!"
"Here's to Gretchen!"
"Here's to your Gretchen!"
"If you hurry you can catch her lover before he slips out of her room. "
"Flee!... Flee!... you have murdered him!"
"Murder!"
"Murder... murder!"
"Murder... Murder... Murder!"
"Flee!... Flee! The deputes already seek the murderer!"
"Touch me not, you wanton, your lover has slain me!"
"First read a requiem. Mass for me!
Then to the stocks with this harlot!"
"Gretchen... Gretchen!"
"Now death and nature with surprise Behold the trembling sinners rise To meet the Judge's searching eyes. "
"For now before the Judge severe
No crime can pass unpunished here. "
"All hidden things must plain appear. "
"Mother! Mother!"
"And has born a little child in the depth of winter. "
"Have mercy on my child!"
"Are you not Gretchen, who stood in the stocks?"
"Mercy! Mercy! My child is dying!"
"She has killed her child!
Seize her, the murderess!"
"Faust... Faust... help your Gretchen!"
"Mephisto!"
"You have betrayed me!
She suffers! She suffers!"
"To the stake with the child murderer!"
"Save her, save Gretchen!"
"Too late! Even now they build her funeral pyre!"
"You are still my servant!
Bring me to her, or the pact is broken!"
"My steed awaits!
Quick, before morning comes!"
"Faster! Faster!"
"Oh had I never wished for youth, that brought this misery!
Curse... curse the delusion of youth!"
"You have yourself cursed youth!
What you wish I must grant!"
"Be as you were: an old man!"
"Forgive... forgive me my sin!"
"Gretchen!"
"Here is no place for thee!"
"I claim my wager!"
"One Word breaks thy pact!"
"Tell me the Word!"
"The Word that wings joyfully throughout the universe, The Word that appeases every pain and grief, The Word that expiates all human guilt, the Eternal Word... dost thou not know it?"
"Tel me the Word!"

THE END
Buster Keaton in The Saphead
Directed by Herbert Blache
Written by June Mathis
"The New Henrietta" was a
Broadway play in which...
Douglas Fairbanks scored a major success in 1913.
It was first filmed with him
1915 under the name THE LAMB.
When it was to be remade by Metro in 1920,...
Fairbanks himself suggested Buster Keaton for his former role.
Keaton was then under an exclusive contract with...
Joseph M. Schenck who agreed to loan him to Metro.
It was Keaton's first appearance in a feature-length film.
THE SAPHEAD'S great success earned Keaton star billings in his subsequent films.
A little street where money is everything- and everything is money.
Nicholas Van Alstyne- known, loved, and feared as "The Old Nick of The Street."
Old Nick's very private secretary -- "Mr. Musgrave."
"You tell him that Jim Hardy from Arizona is here."
"I used to pal with this old boy out west."
"What the blazes brought you east, Jim?"
"The Henrietta mine -- she's the all-fired biggest proposition I ever seen."
"Jim, you know more about a mine than anybody on earth -- except me --"
"I want a broker -- send for Watson Flint."
"If you say the Henrietta is that big -- watch me gamble on her!"
Mark Turner had succeeded in marrying Old Nick's daughter -
- but had never succeeded at anything else.
MARK TURNER
BROKER
His morning mail as usual was all bills and no business.
"There's a girl outside that wants to see you personal."
I am destitute and very ill. I must see you. Henrietta Reynolds
"Your wife's outside, sir."
"Go back and tell her she'll hear from me in a day or two."
"I came to invite you to lunch."
"I'm afraid you'd find me rotten company."
"I work like a dog, Rose -- but I don't get anywhere."
"Your father's commissions are worth a fortune to a broker -
- but he never gives me an order."
"I'll have a talk with Dad about you
-- when he gets home this afternoon."
Old Nick's castle.
Bertie Van Alstyne, Esquire, his father's hope and pride, breakfasts early -- in the afternoon.
"I want to talk to you about the way you treat Mark."
I am destitute and very ill. I must see you. Henrietta Reynolds
"You keep away -- I'll see her, and try to get your letters back."
"If you'll stop talking I'll see what I can do for your Mark."
Bertie had been in love for years and decided something must be done about it.
Nick's ward, Agnes, was the girl
Bertie loved. He had confided this -
- to his sister and his valet -- but had never mentioned it to her.
"Agnes has telegraphed that she's coming home from school today."
"Don't get excited ---- you'll have plenty of time to meet her ---
- the train doesn't arrive until 6:30."
"What's happened to you lately?
Getting home at daylight -
- and having a picture of Henrietta, the dancer, in your room--"
"I am leading a fast life because
I am in love with Agnes."
How to win the modern girl by Judith Blakely
How to win the modern girl. THE Modern Girl has no use for the old-fashioned man. She prefers -
- sports to saints. Few girls now-a-days can resist a dashing, gambling, drinking devil.
Agnes was to arrive at the Grand Central -
- so Bertie went to meet her at the Pennsylvania.
Six-thirty at the Grand Central.
Agnes was an orphan -- whom Nick has brought up as his own child.
"Nobody met me."
"The saphead! I suppose he forgot all about you."
"Ask Hutchins to let me know as soon as Mr. Bertie comes in."
"Mr. Bertie is never home before three in the morning, Miss."
"I was waiting for someone
-- but she didn't come."
Trash
The Gay White Way failing to cheer Bertie - his friends try the side streets.
"I'm having rotten luck -- lend me a couple of thousand."
"Are those things worth two thousand dollars?"
"What are they made of?"
"I'm awfully tired of this -- would you mind very much if I stop?"
"Your winnings, Mr. V.
-- thirty-eight thousand."
"Are you quite sure you can spare it?"
Bertie sees a chance to get a real reputation as a sport --
"Will you see to arresting me, please?"

"But they might come and take him to jail!"
"Is it true you were in that dreadful place?"
"I was there because I love Agnes."
"If you love Agnes, why didn't you meet her?"
"I did -- but she didn't come."
"Bertie -- you've changed somehow."
"I heard you tell Rose that you loved me -- and I love you, too."
"I've tricked you into loving me -- when you know the truth -
- I'm afraid you won't care for me any more."
"Tell me --"
"I'm good!"
"I've tried my best to get over it -- but I can't -- and I still kneel down -
- and say my prayers every morning -- before I go to bed."
"Bertie, who is Henrietta?"
"I bought her picture- but I never met her."
"Agnes, you'd better go."
"You've got to get out and shift for yourself --
- this is the last check you'll get from me!"
Bankers Trust Company
10,000 $   -  Nicholas Van Alstyne
"How can you be so cruel!
I love Bertie, whether you do or not, and I'm going to be his wife!"
"If you've had the impertinence to ask Agnes to marry you--"
"-- I suppose I've got to give you a little more."
Bankers Trust Company
"Not another cent!"
"Not another word about marrying
Agnes until you go to work ----
- and make something of yourself!"
Poor Bertie-- cut off with a million -- moved into humble quarters at the Ritz.
Watson Flint -- Nick's broker, and a friend of the family.
"I've got to go into business like you and Mark Turner."
Dearest Agnes, you wanted me to go into business so I have gone.
"I bought a seat on the Stock Exchange for a hundred thousand dollars."
"A hundred thousand dollars for a seat?"
"Well, furniture is way up now-a-days."
"I want to show you an engagement ring."
"You asked me to look after it, sir."
"If father won't let us marry, perhaps you'll keep it to remember me by."
"No matter what Uncle Nick says, I'll marry you whenever you want me --"
"We can't now, Bertie -- we must make arrangements first --
- let's say next Tuesday!"
"Leon, we're to be married secretly Tuesday evening --
- please make all the arrangements."
"It would be a wonderful surprise for her --
- if we could only get it ready in time."
"We must!"
You can never be sure a woman will be on time -- even for her wedding.
"I'm going to marry Bertie tonight."
"But, Agnes -- you mustn't run away
-- we'll have the wedding here!"
"Get out one of her little white dresses
-- and she can wear my wedding veil."
"I'll manage father, and send for the Reverend Murray Hilton."
"I took you into business because Rose wanted me to -
- and you're making good!"
"I've given you power of attorney because
I'm going on a cruise Wednesday -
- and you'll be in charge while I'm away."
"Bertie and Agnes are going to be married tonight --"
"Perhaps they've locked her up."
"All right -- let 'em be married in here
-- or down cellar -- or on the roof --"
"-- but I won't see them."
"I have called for Agnes."
"I'm through with you --"
"-- and as for Agnes, she has disobeyed me --"
"Now ask Bertie to forgive you."
"We're going to be married here!"
For the Minister
"Anything else?"
"I'll put one in every pocket -- then when the minister asks me -- there you are!"
Henrietta Reynolds
518 S. Vine St, Omaha, Nebraska
"If I die -- promise me you'll put these into Mrs. Turner's hands."
"I want Mrs. Turner!"
"Henrietta is dead -- and I gave her my sacred word I'd put these into your hands."
A dying mother appeals to you -
Have mercy on my little one. -
- The letters from her father which I send with this will tell you the rest.
Henrietta Reynolds
"I'm sorry this blow has come, Rose
-- I've tried to keep it from you --"
"Bertie, these belong to you
---- they're from Henrietta."
Bertie's valet had planned a great surprise for the bridal couple.
Tortured by thoughts of Agnes
-- Bertie hopes a visit to -
- the Stock Exchange may help him to forget.
"This is a new member
-- Mr. Van Alstyne."
"Mr. Turner wants to see you at
Van Alstyne's office right away."
"Do all these seats cost a hundred thousand dollars?"
HE'S NEW
MAKE HIM WELCOME
Knowing that the truth about Henrietta
Reynolds must soon come to light,
Mark has induced Nick to go on his yachting trip as planned.
With Nick out of the way, Mark sees a chance to clean up a fortune -
- before his relations with Henrietta
Reynolds are discovered.
"Mr. Van Alstyne notified you that I would be in -
- complete authority here during his absence -- ?"
"I want you to sell 'Henrietta
Mine' until you have -
- knocked the price down fifty points!"
"I can't accept a commission of that size without security."
"Great heavens, Turner! -- these securities belong to your father-in-law!"
"While he is away they are mine."
Bertie's introduction to the Floor grows more and more informal.
"All they do here is knock off hats -- but I enjoy it -- it occupies the mind."
"I'm going out to get some new ones so I can play it again."
The raid on Henrietta.
"They've started a raid on 'Henrietta'
-- you ought to be on the Floor!"
"When I want your advice
I'll send for you!"
"Mr. Tildon of the National City is here."
BIG SLUMP IN HENRIETTA MINING STOCK
"Mr. Van Alstyne won't return for a week
-- and Mr. Turner is in charge."
"Tell Turner if we don't receive collateral by three o'clock we'll be forced to -
- throw Van Alstyne's holdings on the market!"
"Thank God you've come, sir!"
"Thank God!
I was seasick--"
...PA           ...HEN               ...INP
"Call up Mr. Tildon -- and send to the Stock Exchange for Mark Turner!"
"Mr. Turner hasn't been on the Floor today!"
"Mark Turner is responsible for this raid, sir."
"Because he's a cheat -
I found out he was responsible for -
- that Henrietta girl, and put the blame on Mr. Bertie-"
"I'm sorry to hurry you -- but it's two-thirty, and your securities must be in the bank before the market closes."
"It's almost three o'clock.
There's nothing on earth I can do."
"You're too late. Flint's on the Floor now, knocking the last breath out of -
- the 'Henrietta' -- and I can buy your holdings for next to nothing!"
"Get the police!"
"All the police in the world can't prevent your losing control of the Henrietta Mine -
- when the gong rings in the
Stock Exchange!"
-HENRIETTA
-HENRIETTA
-HENRIETTA
-HENRIETTA!
-HENRIETTA!!
-HENRIETTA!!
-HENRIETTA
-HENRIETTA
-HENRIETTA
"Sir, you're insulting me!-- and I demand that you stop yelling that woman's name!"
HENRIETTA!
HENRIETTA
"They're all yelling that woman's name at me --
- and I can't make them stop!"
"Bertie, listen! -- I'll tell you something that will stop them!"
"Every time you hear a man yelling 'Henrietta' -
- you grab him and say -- 'I TAKE IT'!"
It seems to Bertie that the whole Stock Exchange -
- is taunting him by yelling
Henrietta's name.
"She's up forty points and going like a rocket!"

"It was no miracle -- it was Bertie!
He's the latest member of -

"He's bought a cottage on Long Island

"I have been on the Floor of the Stock Exchange."
"Why, my boy -- you've saved 'Henrietta'!"
"I mean the Henrietta mine! Now get dressed, because I've sent for
Agnes and the minister."

LONDON
I have a presentiment that you are going to propose, Ed.
I do wish you wouldn't, for this are so much nicer as they are.
But why can't you love me, Gladys?
Now tell me what's amiss with me.
I will only marry a man of great deeds and strange experiences...
- a man who can look death in the face without flinching!
In the office of the
London-Record Journal.
I want your legal advice. Profesor
Challenger threatens to sue my paper... for doubting his yarn about live dinosaurs.
FAMOUS ZOOLOGISTS RETURNS FROM SOUTH
AMERICA WITHOUTH PROOFS OF STRANGE TALE
Profesor Challenger, well-known author and scientist, has returned to London...
...with a strange tale of Mammoths,
Pterodoctyls and other prehistoric monsters...
...roaming at large somewhere on the upper reaches of the Amazon. Unfortunately...
...for the professor's reputation for veracity, he refuses to give the exact location of his alleged...
...discoveries, and still more unfortunately, the photographs in his possession are so badly damaged...
(when the Professor's canoe is said to have been overturned)
...that they certainly cannot be acepted...
...as evidence in this case.
I believe Challenger is insane!
He nearly killed three reporters
I sent to interview him today!
Mr. McArdle, couldn't you send me on a dangerous assignment?
All I need is an opportunity -
You seem very anxious to lose your life!
Have you been interviewing
Challenger, Malone?
Don't apologize - hurry over to Zoological
Hall and cover Challenger's lecture.
Reporters are barred
- but get in!
There's Sir John Roxton
- famous hunter and explorer.
He's here to check up on
Challenger's cock-and-bull story.
Well, Malone, we're in for a lively session tonight.
- the students are out in force to heckle old Challenger.
Challenger has made himself a public laughing
- stock by his tale about live dinosaurs!
What can he hope to gain by such lies?
The back country of the
Amazon contains over...
...fifty thousand miles of unexplored water-ways.
Who can say what may be living in that jungle - as vast as all Europe?
But how can Challenger's story be true?
These creatures have all been dead ten million years!
You might at least do him the justice to hear him state his own case.
Reporters are barred-
...if I show my press pass I'll get kicked out. I wonder if you -
Gladly - I'll take you in on my pass.
That's profesor Summerlee, the eminent coleopterist.
- owing to lack of proofs, this
Society cannot sponsor Profesor...
...Challenger's statement, but is glad to afford him this opportunity to state his case, and, we trust, clear his name.
Bring on your mastodons!
Bring on your mammoths!
I will - if any of you spineless worms are brave enough to go back with me...
...into the trackless jungles where these monsters live!
I told you old Challenger is sincere!
And I'm not here tonight to defend my statements - but to demand that...
...a committee be formed to go back to the Lost World with me -
Looks like a riot.
It's a beastly shame!
When dealing with undeveloped minds,
...it is useless to appeal to reason
- for they have none!
I am calling for volunteers!
Volunteers to face death - or worse
- for the sake of science.
I am sixty-seven years of age - but, because I think you are a liar and a fraud -
I accept your challenge, sir!
Accepted! Better an old fool - than a young coward!
I'm neither a student nor a scientist
- but I'd like to be counted in on this!
My friend, Sir John Roxton!
Accepted!
Your record as a hunter of big game will add weight to your testimony - if we return!
Professor Challenger,
I'd like to go on this expedition!
Probably the brain of a child
- but the body of an athlete.
Accepted.
What is your name?
Edward E. Malone -
And your occupation?
I- I'm a-a-er-a reporter, sir.
London-Record Journal.
Take me home - I've had enough of this!
Eleven Enmore Park, Kensington, West!
Professor Challenger, I've got to go on this expedition! The girl...
...I'm engaged to won't marry me until I've faced death or -
This man attacked me!
Do you give him in charge, sir?
No. I was to blame.
I intruded upon him.
Now, sir, can't we talk this expedition over sanely?
Sir John Roxton is a friend of mine-
Why didn't you mention that before?
You've hurt another nice young man!
I saw you from the dining room window!
If my husband gets abusive again - just call me!
You betrayed a glimmer of intelligence just now while talking to the policeman-
Sit down!
Do you want to join this expedition because you believe my statements are true?
Austin!
Tell Miss White
I wish to see her at once!
Have you shown Malone - the diary?
Property of Maple White?
BRONTOSAURUS
Miss Paula White - daughter of poor Maple White - the unfortunate explorer whose notebook you hold in your hands.
Miss White was her father's trained assistant.
She will tell you why she came to me.
I was in camp with jungle fever when my father...
...went up to explore that terrible plateau.
Carnivorous beast Allosaurus.
Evidently already almost externet even lea for I saw few of they.
A Living Brontosaurus
You mean that you actually saw living descendants of these monsters...
...that are supposed to have been dead for millions of years?
Yes, they were tremendous in size and ferocity.
Our bearers were so terrified they deserted-
...carrying me back to the coast - leaving my father...
...marooned up there - with those beasts -
He would go
- in spite of what we had - seen.
My husband promised to raise funds for a rescue party - but instead of...
...getting people to help him, he throws them out of windows and things!
Why, this is a great
human interest story -
And even if my paper was not convinced of the scientific value of your statements -
...it might finance a rescue party provided that the exclusive publication rights-
I'll swear not to send an article back to my paper without your full approval, sir!
If Sir John Roxton will go with me -
I believe we can make my managing editor see this thing!
I'm sure you know why I am going on this rescue party, Paula - don't you?
LIVERPOOL
AMAZON RIVER
I will not bore those whom this narrative may reach by an account of our voyage.
Eventually we found ourselves in that no-man's-land...
...which is formed by the half-defined frontiers...
...between Peru,
Brazil and Colombia.
The sealed map we promised Challenger to not open untill we arrived here is only...
...a blank page.
Excepting a miracle, our expedition seems to have come to a premature end.
May I come in?
From henceforth
I take command of this expedition.
Let it be clear that you are all perfectly helpless without me!
If that mischievious beast is to go with us,
I remain behind!
Jocko knows which berries and roots in the forest are edible, and which are poisonous...
- he will be far more use to us than you, my dear sir!
RECORD
EXPLORERS REACH LAST
OUTPOST OF CIVILIZATION
Record-Journal Party Searching for Lost Scientist to Make Way into Mystery World via Secret Rivers.
MAY NOT BE HEARD
FROM AGAIN FOR MONTHS
It's a Brazilian sloth - they always walk head downward. See the baby clinging to her?
Dear Mr. McArdle: It is three weeks since we sent back the canoes...
...and tonight we are camping at the base of the great plateau upon which...
...Maple White was marooned.
Challenger has guided us to this spot, and proven that...
...the Plateau is a fact -
...but we have no reason to believe that any monsters are roaming...
...about up there.
In fact, I don't think...
They're not cubs - but full grown
"spectacle bears" - great camp followers.
Paula says her father felled one of the trees on that pinnacle so that it dropped across...
...the chasm and made a bridge.
You can still see the stump of the old tree.
In the morning we'll climb the pinnacle - and drop the other tree over.
A Pterodactyl -
...proving definitely that the statements in poor Maple White's diary are true!
A Brontosaurus
- feeding merely on leaves.
Perfectly harmless - unless it happens to step on us.
Who would believe this! My elephant gun might as well be a bean-shooter!
Great guns!
We can't get back!
We're prisoners
- exactly like Maple White!
That means our folk are still alive!
What are you thinking of, Paula
- in this lost world of ours?
I was thinking if my father were still alive
- he would have seen our fire...
- and come to us.
An Allosaurus - a meat-eater - the most vicious pest of the ancient world.
The barrier might as well thistle-down
- and fire may not work with the next one...
- we've got to find a safe camp!
Jocko will be mighty lonesome down here without Miss.
Paula
- he climbed that big rock...
...this morning to get to her - he can't bear that girl out of his sight!
I have an idea! After supper bring all those hammocks into the tent!
We must establish camp here - our only refuge from these monsters -
...if we'll live long enough to search for your father.
Now that we've found these caves we could live here the rest of our lives -
...if we had some weapon capable of making a dent in a dinosaur!
I am now inventing such a weapon.
We can't rest until every inch of this plateau is explored!
It's miles in length - your father may have found other caves -
When I release the tree it will snap back with terrific force -
...and by calculating the curve the rock will describe as it rushes through the air-
A curve? Nonsense! Any school boy could tell you the rock will describe a parabola.
A curve!
A parabola!
I was right - you described a curve!
We'll work all night and make enough ladder to get you in the morning.
Fine! But how in thunder do you expect to get it up to us?
Bring Miss Paula to call Jocko - he'll climb anything to get to her!
There's only a small cave above this -
...but your father must be somewhere on the plateau...
- it's impossible to get away!
Do you mean we are to be here - always?
What difference does it make where we are
Paula - so long as we are - together?
But your engagement to - Gadys?
Paula, dear, we're as cut off from the world and its obligations and promises...
...as if we were on the moon.
I'm going to ask Professor
Summerlee to marry us.
You know he used to be a minister.
Go hunt up the professors
- I have something to - tell Paula-
A lovely specimen!
We'll stalk it and observe its habits!
That dormant volcano is waking!
The whole plateau will be covered in lava!
But this has been going on for hours -
I'm afraid they're lost -
If they get back we must be here to show them the way to the tunnel opening.
It's their only hope of escape!
The professors and Mr. Malone are safe - they'll be here in a minute or two!
I certainly hope that mud holds!
We're back in the world
- and its obligations.
Why should we let Gladys rob us of happiness, Paula?
I can't steal my happiness from another woman.
I'm Major Hibbard, of the
Brazilian geodetic Survey.
Yesterday I saw a cloud of smoke over the plateau -
And we smoked out quite a rat, Major!
I'd give my entrie personal fortune to get that beast to London - alive!
I'll send for men to dredge out this stream
- built a steel cage and a raft -
...and when the big rains come next month, we might float your "rat" out!
If we once could get our raft as far as the Amazon, you could charter a steamer from there!
Later - In London.
Tonight you will not jeer -
...for I have brought back a living proof of my statements!
May I ask what you mean when you say
"proof", Professor Challenger?
A living Brontosaurus
- nearly sixty feet long...
...from the nose to the tip of the tail!
Mr. Edward Malone, through whose efforts this expedition, was financed, is now superintending the unloading of the monster...
...from the ship we chartered-
The message I have been expecting has come!
I'll inform you in a moment when and where the Brontosaurus will be on view!
As we swung the cage out over the dock the cables broke-
The fall smashed the cage
- and it got out!
It's running wild
- the streets are in an uproar!
My Brontosaurus has escaped! Keep off the streets, untill I recapture it!
This is outrage - we've been hoaxed again -
Challenger should be run out of town!
How d'ydo, Gladys.
You see I'm - back.
And, as you really owe it all to me,
I hope you'll forgive me - for not waiting.
My husband, Percy Potts.
May I ask what great stunt, what heroic deed Mr. Potts performed -
...to win you, Gladys?
That was just my girlish whim!
Percy is a clerk at a store, and has never been out of London in his life!
Excuse me!
She didn't wait for me - she's married!
That's Sir John Roxton
- sportsman.

{61303}{61419}The suitors are at the Palace gates.
{61725}{61868}The Prince of the Indies whose palace|is covered with an hundred thousand rubies.
{62325}{62481}He glowers. I like him not -|with all his rubies.

{86110}{86189}The Prince of the Indies...
{86288}{86354}The Prince of Persia.
{86551}{86635}The Prince of the Mongols...
{86843}{87044}The Just One, the Holy, the High-Born...|the Caliph of Bagdad.
{87107}{87232}The Princess, according to ancient custom|of our House...
{87236}{87336}...hath made her choice.
{87903}{88078}Let her ring be placed upon|the hand of the chosen.
{88836}{88931}He has not wed her yet.
{89832}{89991}My daughter's choice and heir|to the throne of Bagdad.
{90037}{90137}The word is said.
{90141}{90241}If any have protest, voice it now.
{90245}{90345}When the moon tips the cypress...
{90349}{90451}...the betrothal will be consummate in feast.|Come.
{92218}{92366}He is the thief who yesternight|did rob the Palace.
{93136}{93311}Desecration most foul, O mighty Caliph,|hath been wrought upon thy noble House!
{93315}{93465}This Ahmed is but a common thief.
{94719}{94894}This Ahmed who calls himself a Prince,|hunt him down!
{95860}{95938}I am not a Prince.
{96278}{96465}I am less than the slave who serves you..|a wretched outcast... a thief.
{97197}{97410}What i wanted, I took.|I wanted you... I tried to take you...
{97473}{97623}But, when I held you in my arms...|the very world did change.
{97627}{97763}The evil in me died.
{98341}{98567}I can bear a thousand tortures,|endure a thousand deaths...|but not thy tears.
{98709}{98872}This Arab Prince is but a thief.|Seek him out!
{99253}{99470}Quick! Hide thyself. If thou art|found with me, they will be merciless.
{100020}{100089}I love you.
{101564}{101712}Thou dog! What torments|can we devise for thee!
{101955}{102033}Flog him!
{103311}{103475}Fling him to the ape!|Let him be torn to pieces.
{104899}{105024}A pearl to every guard.
{105028}{105184}Have him placed in safety through|the secret panel into the streets.
{105640}{105718}She shall choose again.
{106012}{106104}The secret panel into the streets...
{107108}{107182}Choose! I command you.
{107512}{107615}I myself will make the choice.
{107947}{108022}Betray not the sands of Mecca.
{108026}{108140}Gain time. Defer the outcome.
{108837}{108962}Send them to distant lands to seek some rare treasure.
{108966}{109091}At the seventh moon let them return.
{109095}{109248}Who brings the rarest treasure I will wed.
{109593}{109777}When marriage plans have gone amiss,|The seventh moon betokens bliss.
{110265}{110333}Morning...
{112192}{112317}Come, if you still wouldst steal her.
{112321}{112449}I have found a way through|the tunnels of the tigers.
{113252}{113401}The Princes will return at the|seventh moon bearing treasure.
{113405}{113530}The one who brings the rarest wins the Princess.
{114047}{114212}Lose not thy hope, the rose persists,|and something good will come of this.
{115186}{115352}Turned lily-white he now goes|mewling to the mosque. Bah!
{116351}{116397}Thou art wounded.
{116631}{116705}In heart and soul.
{117068}{117138}I love a Princess.
{117283}{117364}Make thyself a Prince.
{117658}{117773}Allah hath made thy soul|to yearn for happiness...
{117777}{117881}...but thou must earn it.
{118479}{118554}Stay you in Bagdad.
{118558}{118658}I will send soldiers under guise|of porters bearing gifts.
{118662}{118742}Build me an army within the walls.
{119639}{119811}And so.. on the bedrock of humility|thou canst build any structure.
{119904}{119989}Come with me and I will set thy feet...
{119993}{120099}...on the path that leads to treasure|beyond thy dreams.
{120515}{120590}Three suitors leave thy city gate...
{120594}{120682}...But four are numbered in her fate.
{121162}{121243}At the end of the way is a silver chest...
{121247}{121328}...that doth contain the greatest magic.
{121332}{121429}Thou must be brave. Go now.|Control thy destiny.
{121917}{122045}Give this to her who hath|already my heart.
{122694}{122824}A day's journey from Bagdad...|a caravansary in the desert...
{123135}{123256}Thus far the three Princes|have traveled in company.
{123410}{123485}Great Lords of Asia,|good fortune to you...
{123489}{123565}...second only to mine own!
{123569}{123644}Let us meet here at the end|of the sixth moon.
{124823}{124900}Set spies to follow each.
{125355}{125459}A Defile in the Mountains|of Dread Adventure...
{125751}{125832}The Hermit of the Defile.
{125972}{126130}I seek a magic chest that|lies beyond this defile.
{126263}{126353}Knowest thou, rash youth...|devouring flames,
{126357}{126456}...foul monsters, shapes of death|beset the path?
{126532}{126607}A hundred years have I been here.
{126611}{126731}Many have gone this way|and none returned.
{126773}{126927}But, if thy resolve be firm,|I will help thee.
{126964}{127089}If thou dost reach the Cavern|of Enchanted Trees...
{127093}{127231}...touch with this talisman the midmost tree.
{128159}{128274}In Bagdad, the pavilion|of the Princess...
{128682}{128804}He too may return by the seventh moon.
{129111}{129259}... but his road is hard.|You must pray for him.
{129624}{129760}The first moon.
{129823}{129897}The Valley of Fire...
{131879}{131936}The second moon.
{131990}{132198}In search of rare treasure, The Persian Prince|came to the bazaars of Shiraz.
{132855}{132978}A crippled beggar knew a priceless secret.
{133121}{133250}The magic carpet.|They know not its value.
{133987}{134072}My Prince, here is|the greatest rarity in the world,
{134076}{134164}...the flying carpet.
{134788}{134895}The third moon.
{134956}{135086}The Valley of the Monsters.
{136705}{136854}The Cavern of the Enchanted Trees.
{137703}{137783}Thou hast shown great courage...
{137787}{137866}...but thy way is yet hard.
{138196}{138391}This is the chart to guide thee to|the Old Man of the Midnight Sea.
{139582}{139695}The fourth moon.
{139749}{139874}In search of rare treasure,|the Prince of the Indies...
{139878}{140028}...came to a forgotten idol|near Kandahar.
{143056}{143226}This is the greatest rarity in|the world, the magic crystal.
{143728}{143835}The fifth moon.
{143862}{144023}The Old Man of the|Midnight Sea.
{144771}{144921}At the bottom of the sea|is an iron-bound box.
{144925}{145071}There thou wilt find a star-shaped key.
{150886}{151035}Now you must climb to the|Abode of the Winged Horse.
{151039}{151217}That star-shaped key will|give you entrance here.
{151312}{151429}The Abode of the|Winged Horse...
{152458}{152566}The sixth moon.
{152632}{152782}In search of rare treasure,|the Prince of the Mongols...
{152786}{152915}...came to the Island of Wak.
{153144}{153260}A court magician knew|a secret shrine.
{155691}{155761}The magic apple...
{156534}{156591}That fisherman.
{159913}{160039}Far rarer than India's crystal|or Persia's carpet.
{160291}{160361}Thou wilt haste to Bagdad and,|at the end of
{160365}{160442}this sixth moon, give order|that the Prince be poisoned.
{160488}{160616}The Citadel of the Moon...
{161003}{161159}The magic chest is wrapped|in a cloak of invisibility.
{161537}{161724}The Cloak of Invisibility|and the Magic Chest...
{162607}{162714}At the end of the|sixth moon...
{164765}{164975}A day's journey from Bagdad..|again the caravansary in the desert.
{166231}{166313}Let us haste to Bagdad.
{166643}{166768}O Prince of the Indies,|discover this with the crystal.
{166772}{166921}...Does the Princess wait as she pledged?
{167966}{168032}Spread the flying carpet.
{168203}{168349}With the magic apple we|shall save her life.
{169337}{169457}The learned doctor,|Zakariya of Kufa.
{171783}{171845}Out of the clouds...
{174871}{174996}I was at the portals of death|and now I glow with health.
{175000}{175089}...What miracle is this?
{175439}{175489}I was I who brought you back.
{175493}{175611}No other gift can match|my golden apple.
{176006}{176105}He makes rash claim.|'Twas this rare crystal...
{176109}{176175}...disclosed your desperate plight.
{176590}{176679}My magic carpet brought us here.
{176683}{176799}By the beard of the Prophet,|it is rarest.
{177089}{177169}Her life belongs to me.
{177206}{177242}¬°To me!
{177311}{177351}To me!
{177599}{177740}It is for me to decide|which gift is rarest.
{178607}{178770}A moment, O Princes!|Who can say which gift is rarest?
{178986}{179086}Without the crystal you|could not have known.
{179090}{179190}Without the carpet you could not have come.
{179194}{179297}...Without the apple you|could not have cured me.
{179357}{179457}Apple.. crystal.. carpet.|No one of them is rarest.
{179461}{179554}Each had been useless without|the other two.
{179948}{180071}Cease! There's wisdom here.|'Tis best that we deliberate.
{180365}{180440}Bide your time.
{180444}{180547}You have twenty thousand troops|within the walls.
{180769}{180917}Yourself hath said it.|'Tis best that we deliberate.
{181505}{181607}Through the night...

{188495}{188585}We shall be wed at once.|Prepare thyself.
{188649}{188720}It is my command.

{194687}{194793}...Thy troops have fled.
{194856}{194971}Set my guard at|the Palace gates!
{195103}{195220}Open wide the gates|to our deliverer!
{196179}{196311}Great Khan, every way|of escape is blocked.
{197598}{197699}The flying carpet...|and the Princess.
{199136}{199202}Quick... the magic carpet.

Three different negatives were created for the film Der letzte Mann.
One of them was for Germany, one for general export, and the third for the US A.
The surviving German negative was preserved only incompletely, and was reconstructed in 2001/2002 with the aid of the following materials: an original negative from the
Bundesarchiv-Filmarchiv Berlin: a print from the Museum of
Modern Art, New York, produced in Germany in 1936: fragments of a duplicate possessed by the
Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Stiftung of a missing German print: as well as fragments of a print kept by the Cin√©math√®que Suisse in Lausanne.
The reconstruction took place in cooperation with the Bundesarchiv-Filmarchiv,
Berlin / Koblenz: the Cin√©math√®que Suisse, Lausanne: the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and the
Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Stiftung,
Wiesbaden.

Do you know what you'll be tomorrow?!
For tlhe Weddlng Guests however, due to your period of service of many years' standing, we've created an open position for you by sending the oldest employee of our firm to a shelter, effective today.
The reason for this measure is your old-age.
Here, at the place of his humiliation, the old man would waste away miserably for the rest of his life and here the story would, strictly speaking, be over.
But the author is looking out for him who has been abandoned by everyone, and so he bestows upon him an epilogue, telling a story that... - unfortunately... - usually doesn't occur in real life.
A SENSATIONAL INHERITANCE
As reported a short time ago, the celebrated Mexican multimillionaire
Mr. A. G. Monen died whilst washing his hands in the lavatory of the Atlantic-Hotel.
Upon going through his papers, a sensational will for this eccentric man was found to the effect that the person in whose arms he would happen to die was to become the sole heir to his enormous fortune.
Hence, the biblical promise, that the last shall be the first, seems already to have been fulfilled on earth, for the lucky one is... -

ACT I
Report on the great mortality which prevails in Wisborg in the year of grace 1838
It is words lugubrious like the call of a bird of death.
Take care not to say them or your life will be populated shades and the phantoms which will haunt your dreams will be nourished of your blood.
I reflected a long time with the mortality which had struck my birthplace.
Here its history.
In Wisborg lived Hutter and his young woman Ellen
"Why you killed... these beautiful flowers?"
"Not so quickly, my young friend!
Nobody escapes from his destiny."
There was certain Knock, realtor.
All kinds of noises ran on him.
But it paid its people well.
"count Orlok, the lord of Transylvania... wishes to buy a beautiful house in our city..."
"You could earn much money..."
"Even if that costs a little efforts, of sweat... and perhaps a little blood... "
"He would like a beautiful abandoned house..."
"This house... opposite yours.
Propose it to him!"
"you start, my young friend, and made happy voyage to the country of the phantoms."
"I leave to travel far, to the country of the robbers and the phantoms."
Hutter left the concerned young woman
Under the protection of
Harding the ship owner & his sister
"Would be without fear."
After having traversed many dusty roads, the young person Hutter finally saw the summits of Carpates the horses tired.
"I have to eat... quickly.
I must go to the chateau of the count
Orlok!"
"do not go further. there are werewolf  in the wood."
VAMPIRES
Malfaisants spirits with the damned heart
Nosferatu nourishes on human blood.
It lives in the caves and in coffins, in the ground maudite of the cemeteries of Pestif√©r√©s
"more quickly!
The sun drops!"
"Pay what you want!
We will not go further!"
"let us not go there!
This place is sinister!"
As soon as Hutter had crossed the bridge, its fears, that it had entrusted to me, were not long in materializing.
"You made me wait.
It is almost midnight.
The servants sleep!"
END Of ACT I
ACT II
"You hurt yourself... Invaluable blood!"
"do you Want to hold me a little company, very expensive?
"There remains time until the rising of the sun and the day, my good,
I sleep of the deepest sleep." the paddle dissipated the shades of the night.
My love! My beloved! would not be sad to know me with far. the mosquitos are a true plague, they have bitten me around the neck.
One sleeps badly in this afflicted castle but is not worried.
At night, a spectral light seemed to animate the castle.
"Your wife has a splendid neck..."
"I buy the abandoned house...
We will be close... "
To continue its pitiful life
Nosferatu drinks the blood of its victims.
Take guard that its demonic shade does not torment your dreams.
At the same time
"a doctor... a doctor!"
"a benign congestion." the doctor allotted the anguishes of Ellen to an unknown disease.
But I know that your heart answered the call of the bird of death.
Nosferatu unfolded its wings.
Hutter sought to include/understand the terror of its nights. the boatmen did not know which terrible burden they went down in the valley.
END Of ACT II
ACT III
"Of the peasants transported it yesterday, at the hospital.
They say that it made a fall.
It is still feverish..."
"Of the coffins..."
Nosferatu was on the way.
The danger approached Wisborg. professor Bulwer, who studied the secrecies of nature, had spoken to me about it.
One had charged on Empusa of the coffins filled with ground. ship must even take the sea this night
Loading of Empusa Destination: Wisborg
At the same time, professor Bulwer explained to his pupils the cruelty of the plants carnivores. the secrecies of nature appeared in horrified eyes.
"is not this... like a vampire!"
It seems that the approach of malfaisant Nosferatu the realtor had a knock on influence.
"yesterday the patient had a delerious crisis."
"blood, it is the life!"
"See this one..."
"polyp with tentacles..."
"Transparency... Almost incorporeal... "
"A few things close, a phantom..."
"Of the spiders...!"
Ellen often walked in the loneliness of the dunes.
Its sadness flew away towards its beloved, while its eyes scanned the waves and the horizon.
My love! My beloved! would not be sad to know me with far.
The mosquitos are a true plague, they have bitten me around the neck.
One sleeps badly in this afflicted castle, but is not worried
"Now, I must leave... to regain the house as fast as possible!"
New epidemic of Black plague in the seaports.
Young people are decimated in mass.
All the victims carry the same wounds to the neck whose origin is still a enigma for the doctors.
Dardanelles are closed with all the suspect ships.
"a sailor is sick. The fever makes him delirious." the first sailor reached of this disease involved all the crew with him, in the black tomb of the waves
The evening, the captain and his second immersed their last comrade.
"I go down! If I am not there in ten minutes..." the ship of death had a new captain.
END Of ACT III
ACT IV
In spite of its weakness,
Hutter overcame the difficulties of the voyage the funeral breath of Nosferatu inflated the veils of the ship which sailed a such spectrum towards its goal.
"I must join it. It arrives!"
"the Master arrives..."
I wondered a long time about these coffins filled with ground that Nosferatu had carried. the vampires were to rest in this damned ground to preserve their diabolic capacities.
"It does not have there heart which lives on board."
July 12.The crew: a captain, a leading seaman, a foam, five sailors.
July 13. A sailor reached of fever.
Cape: south, south-west.
Direction of the wind: the North-East.
July 14. State of the sailor worsens.
The fever makes him delirious.
July 22. Rats on board. Danger of plague.
"Danger of plague!
Return on your premise! You barricade!"
Opinion with the population.
The plague is in the city. do not leave your houses. The burgomaster.
END Of ACT IV
ACT V
Hutter begged Ellen to give up the book which frightened it so much.
But it could not resist strange temptation.
To continue its pitiful life
Nosferatu drinks the blood of its victims
Take guard that its demonic shade does not torment your dreams. another safety
Know that a woman is pure in the heart by offering her blood to him would make the vampire forget the song of the cock
"I have the same vision, each evening...!" the fear reigned on all the city.
Which was still healthy? Who was sick?
"I run to seek Sievers..." another safety
Know that a woman is pure in the heart by offering her blood to him would make the vampire forget the song of the cock
The terrified city sought a victim: it was Knock.
"One saw it! It fled!
It strangled the guard... "
"It strangled it... the vampire!"
"Bulwer! Will seek Bulwer!"
"One captured Knock!"
"the Master... the Master...!"
"the Master...... died."
At the same moment, as by miracle, deaths ceased and, in the victorious rays of the morning sun, one saw disappearing the shade from the bird of death.

THE CIRCUS
THE CIRCUS
"So you missed the hoop again."
"Father, I couldn't help it."
"For that you don't eat tonight."
"And you're supposed to be funny!"
"Look at that house; empty!"
Around the Side Shows hungry and broke.
"Here you are, sir."
"Count it."
"Is it all there?"
"Say, gimme that money!"
"How d'you get out of here?"
"Rotten!"
"Get off!"
"Where's the funny man?"
"Bring on the funny man!"
The Funny Man.
Meal-time after the Show.
"Father won't let me."
"Do you want a job?"
"Be here in the morning, and we'll try you out."
Early the next morning.
Hungry.
"Run along home!"
"I live here."
"Excuse me, my cane."
The Tryout.
"Go ahead and be funny."
"That's awful!"
"Put on the William Tell act."
"Now then, watch this and see if you can do it."
"Go ahead and try it."
"Put on the barber-shop act."
"Now I must hit you."
"Now hit me!"
"I can't see."
"Just a moment!"
"We haven't talked terms yet."
"Get out and stay out!"
"Show's starting!"
"Aren't you coming in?"
"You're not leaving?"
"You see, we couldn't come to terms."
"Thank you for the egg."
The Show on.
Trouble with the
Property Men.
"How about our back pay?"
"Get to work!"
"We quit!"
"They've quit."
"Get anybody!"
"Do you want a job?"
"Don't touch that button!"
"He's a sensation, but he doesn't know it."
"Keep him on as a property man."
The Circus prospered, but not the property man.
And the girl led the same hard life.
"Keep him busy and don't let him know he's the hit of the show."
A Sick Horse.
"Blow this pill down the horse's neck!"
"The horse blew first --"
"Open the door, quick!"
"I told you the lions were dangerous!"
"Where's that pill?"
"Come here!"
"I've got to see a doctor!"
"It's a shame the way they make you work --"
"And you the hit of the show."
"Why of course!"
"All the crowds, all the applause is just for you."
"I knew it!"
"If you strike that girl, I'll quit!"
"And what's more
I want what I'm worth --"
"I'll give you fifty dollars a week."
"Sixty!"
"I'll double it!"
"Nothing less than a hundred."
The Next Show.
The success of the Tramp made life easier for the girl and himself.
"Oh, Merna, you must have your fortune told!"
"I see love and marriage with a dark, handsome man who is near you now."
A New Added Attraction,
Rex, a tight-rope walker.
"Pardon me."
"Go right ahead."
"I'll give you
Five Dollars for it."
"It's happened; I'm in love!"
"He's a tight-rope walker."
"I've just met him."
"Hurry up, you're on!"
The Act Over.
"What's the matter?"
"You hardly got a laugh!"
"This is my friend."
"I don't like tight-rope walkers."
Time brought many changes to the Circus;
New Hopes and
New Ambitions.
His New Ambition.
"Never mind the rope."
"You'd better try and be funny again or you'll go!"
The next performance- and not a smile.
"I've had enough of this;"
"You get one more chance."
"Where's Rex?"
"Rex, the tight-rope walker, hasn't shown up."
"Is Rex here?"
"You can do the act, can't you?"
"You'll do it or quit!"
"I'll do it; find his clothes!"
"There's the clothes!"
"You follow her!"
"He'll kill himself."
"That's all right;"
"I've got him insured."
"Take your time, there's another act to go on."
"Why, what is the meaning of this?"
"I am taking his place on the rope."
"You'll get killed."
"Oh, no, I have a charmed life."
"I'll give you five dollars if you'll do it."
"Not a word to anybody."
"Please don't do this."
"You've forgotten your tights."
"You're on!"
"You're through!!!"
That Night.
"I've run away from the circus."
"I'll never go back."
"Can't you take me with you?"
"I've got an idea."
"You stay here."
"Have you seen Merna?"
"She's run away --"
"I can do nothing for her -- --"
"Now, there's one way out."
"She's there now?"
"Take me to her!"
The Next Morning.
The Circus ready to leave.
"So you've come back -- You -- !"
"You're speaking to my wife!"
"Will you go on with the show?"
"-- -- if you take him."
"The end wagon for you."
"Come in with us."

I had to meet you because I was charmed by that lovely curl of hair.
Then I give it to you and hope you have a nice time
Now, yhat wasn't a very clever line, was it?
I'm Jill Cheyne, and I have a letter of introduction to
Mr. Hamilton
              ...Carmelita Geraghty
... that was all the money
I had, and now I don't know what to do!
Well, you can stay with me, and tomorrow I'll take you in to see Mr. Hamilton
This is my fiance back home.
I was getting nowhere, keeping company to an old lady out in the country.
I went to the theater straight from the station
Did you expect him to hire you just like that, with the cab waiting?
The man who gave me the letter said he was a good friend of
Hamilton's, so I thought...
Well, don't worry about it, luckily you have me to take care of you.
Passion Flowers
The Entire Company to be on stage for full rehearsal tomorrow, wednesday,
June 5th. at 11 a.m. Sharp
Stage Manager
Take a chance, Mr. Hamilton, and I'll show you some real hot steps!
No, I haven't danced anywhere professionally
Folks, I have a great artist here, who has never been on stage in her life but is sure she can show us how to dance.
Just anything in the charleston line will do.
I hate to admit it but you're pretty good. How's five pounds a week?
You know I'm better than that.
I'll take twenty to start.
Patsy, Miss Jill's fiance is here.
You must be the roommate, Patsy!
Jill was written me how nice you've been to her. I'm Hugh
Fieldding.
Sorry Jill isn't in right now, she's trying on a costume for the new revue.
At Hamilton's apartment
Let's not have any suggestions like that...
...until I have my own place
I could invite you to!
My company is sending me to the plantation overseas for two years - but after that I'll have enough to marry, and 
Jill has promissed to wait.
Patsy, I asked Mr.Levet to pick me up here. We work for the same outfit.
                 Miles Mander
In fact, Levet is already stationed out here, and is here for a two-month furlough.
We'll be working on the same plantation.
You have no idea, Miss Brand, how empty and lonely life out there...
Do you believe in love?
Her number's coming up next!
I'm so lucky to have a terrific girl for a fiancee!
May you have not only fame,
Jill, but also happiness!
This is Prince Ivan, Jill.
He wants to congratulate you in person.
It is a rare pleasure to watch you perform, and I intend to indulge myself often.
I know how you feel, Hugh, but I'll steer her away from these stage-door tomcats if I can.
I'm afraid poor Hugh has a rather dewy-eyed conception of his childhood sweetheart.
Soon after Hugh's departure overseas, Jill took a step up in the theatrical world.
Dear Paley
I am so sorry to leave you so soon but
I have had the opportunity to take a tiny furuislud flat for myself, because you will value that I couldn't stay in cheap lodgings
I am nearly a slave
Jill 
Midfull of her promise to
Hugh, Patsy makes a last attempt to straighten out
Jill.
Aren't you afraid of your reputation as a kept woman?
I cannot stand by and watch you throw yourself away like this...
...especially with a fine man like Hugh waiting for you!
Would you believe it, Prince, one of my casual friends form the chorus is trying to run my life!
I'm worried about Jill, Mr.
Levet. I promised to keep her out of danger, and now she's fooling around with that phony Prince.
I wouldn't woory, Patsy, that girl knows exactly what she's doing - and she likes it.
Odd, isn't it - he never barked at Hugh.
Maybe because he had no reason to be jealous of Hugh
I've got to nahd it to Jill - she'll make that fool marry her yet, I bet!
Patsy - I have only a short time here - can't we share our loneliness together?
There's a month left before
I have to go back out there for two years. What do you say?
If you are proposing, then my answer is Yes. I have come to love you in the last few weeks.
I'd like to, Patsy, but it really wouldn't be fair to you.
My position with the firm is no such that they'd let me take a wife out there.
I'll be glad to keep working and wait - as Mrs.Levet!
And I know you'll work your way up so you can send for me very soon.
...and he fixed it up so we can get married the day after tomorrow!
For a honeymoon, he's taking me to Italy!
I'm so happy!
The day of the wedding.
Sorry, Cuddles - I can't take you with me, but I'll be back in a month.
Honeymooning at Lake Como.
I asked God to grant us a happy life life together.
Don't let these thieving little brats make a fool of you!
You threw away the rose
I gave you.
Had to - it had wilted.
Glad to see you again, old chap. Tell me about Jill.
Sorry but, to tell you the truth, I didn't see her since she moved to her own place.
Still working at the Pleasure
Garden, Patsy now lives for but one thing ... the first letter from her husband.
Stop worrying so much - you can find a girl just as good or better anywhere.
Dear patsy,
I must go to him - he's sick and my place is with him.
Jill, all I ask is enough money to pay my fare out there.
Can't do, patsy - I'm spending everthing on my trousseau.
The Prince and I will be married soon.
How about Hugh's engagement ring, then - surely you won't need that now!
She's marrying the Prince and wouldn't lend me a penny!
You must be crazy if you think I could ever stay with you after this!
You filthy animal!
You're my wife - so you've got to stay with me!
Please take me away from here - this man's crazy!
Listen, maybe you can help nurse his friend, who's down with the fever, until you have to catch your next boat.
Poor Hugh, I'll stay with you until you get well!
Jill, my darling ... so good of you to come!
How about a kiss, sweetheart?
Patsy! It's you!
What happened?
That's my wife you're fooling around with, Hugh - and you'll pay for it!
You'd better come back, unless you want to see him with his head bashed in!
I can't let him go on like this while he's out of his mind. I'll go with him for now but will return as soon as I can.
Get away from me - my wife's here now. I don't need you any more!
She wants me to use the sword - she won't let me rest until
I've killed you, too!
Hugh told me what happened.
I'm having him brought in.
Don't thank me, Patsy - just seeing you saved my life, and I'm simply paying you back.
I'm sorry that Jill's turned out no good -
I hope you'll get over her, as I must try to get over this...
You're the only woman for me now, Patsy - I was blind not to see it before!
Coming home, Patsy
How do you like that -
Cuddles knew all the time!

Well, we finished earlier than Ike and I expected.
- Are you going anywhere?
- No, I don't think so.
So the next time, I changed to another tailor, but found out that he was no better than the first.
I bought some pretty expensive cloth and took it to him and you should've seen the mess he made of it
I told him I wouldn't pay for the thing, but the trouble is, he's got my material.
Well, I left the suit with him and it's been there ever since.
- Good evening Miss White.
And how are you?
- I'm all right, thanks.
- I haven't seen you for a long time.
Have you come to take Frank for a walk.
Yes
- That's right.
- Well, I must push along.
- Good-night.
- Good-night Frank.
- Well dear.
- I've been waiting here half an hour for you.
- Good-night Sean.
- Good-night Frank.
Good-night George.
- Sorry sir. Full up. You'll have more room upstairs.
- Goaaannn.
I think I told you, there's more room upstairs!
Sorry Sir. Full up here. There's more room up...HEY!
Frank. I've lost one of my gloves.
I think I left it at the other table.
- Is this it?
- Yes, thanks.
Thought so, there's a hole in two fingers.
Would you like a pair of nail scissors for Christmas?
- Funny, aren't you?
- Oh Miss, Miss!
It's no good being impatient, you'll have to wait your turn.
What's the matter with you today?
Got out of bed the wrong side?
-I don't like waiting about for you.
Oh, don't you? Oh, Miss!
Do you expect the entire machinary of Scotland Yard to be held up to please you?
You and your Scotland Yard
If it weren't for Edgar Wallace nobody'd ever heard of it.
Funny, aren't you?
Anyway, what's the hurry? We're only going to the pictures, we've got all evening.
- Well, I don't think I want to go to the pictures.
- Oh, and why not?
-I've seen everything worth seeing.
- You haven't seen "Fingerprints".
I'd like to see that.
Still it's about Scotland Yard! might be amusing. They're bound to get all the details wrong.
I don't see why. I did hear they'd got a real criminal to direct it.
- So as to be on the safe side.
- Oh, oh Miss!
Oh, blast!
Well, I've ordered.
- I'll go to the pictures with you, if you like.
- uh, changed your mind.
Have you got an ashtray Miss? I never seem to get an ashtray where I sit.
Frank, Frank. I've changed my mind again.
- About what?
- About going to the pictures.
- You mean you don't want to go again?
- No, not particularly.
- Why not?
- I don't know , I just don't want to.
- Isn't that enough?
- No, it's not enough ‚Ä¶ oy, Miss!
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to get the bill.
I'm about fed up with you. lf you don't want to go, I do.
- Oh all right, I'll come too.
- oy, Miss!
Oh, don't let's have a row. I'm sorry.
I know I've been rather beastly today.
- Miss!
- Frank, I've said I'm sorry.
Here, that will cover it.
Hold on. I live here.
Do you? Then you needn't come any further.
Oh, no now I said that I'd see you home, and I will.
But I'm only just around the corner.
Do you know Whites? The newsagent?
- Yes?
In the Kings road?
Yes.
- That's my father.
No!
Yes.
Now isn't that fine?
Then we're neighbors.
- Have you ever seen an artist's studio?
- No, I'd love to.
- Come up and see mine.
- Oh, I can't now. Another time.
- Why not now?
- Why, it's so late.
- Are you frightened?
- No, course not.
Then why not now?
No, really. Thanks awfully.
I must be getting home.
- You are frightened.
- I'm certainly not ‚Ä¶ take more'n a man to frighten me.
Yes...that's what I thought....at first.
- What is the time?
- Not very late.
- Come on. What's the harm.
Oh, no harm really. Besides, I always think a girl knows instinctively when she can trust a man.
Yes, of course she does.
Do you trust me?
- Alice? May I call you Alice?
- If you like.
Come on.
- Oh Mr. Crewe. Before you go in, could I...?
- Excuse me, miss.
No!
That chap's nothing but a sponger.
Always pestering people up and down this street.
Well, here we are.
I'm right up there. Top!
Excuse me a minute, will you?
I say, I'm awfully sorry. I won't be a minute. You start walking up.
That's all right.
Oh good evening. Sorry to disturb you.
About this note, did he leave any message?
No, he wouldn't leave any message.
-Have you seen him before.
- Yes, the same gent what called here several times.
Thanks very much.
Goodnight.
Bit of a climb, wasn't it?
What a lovely room. Did you do it all yourself?
Hardly. I say, do you feel cold?
I think I'll light the fire.
- I say. That's good, isn't it?
- Oh that? Yes, that's a new one, just finished.
- How do you hold this?
- What?
Oh, that.
That's easy. I'll show you.
Oh Lord, not like that. Let me show you.
You take this and hold it like that, you see...Then you get the brush and hold it there. You try.
- Like this?
- Yes.
- Oh, look what I've done.
- Ooo, yes
- Draw something Alice.
- Shall I?
- Yes.
Rotten.
Never mind. We'll finish this masterpiece together.
Now you hold the brush. Steady.
There we are.
You are awful.
Wait a minute.
There. Already a pick ahead of me.
I'll go and get those drinks....Right you are.
I say, how would I do for one of your models?
That's an idea.
- Let's see it on you.
- Do you mean, put it on?
Yes, why not?
- Oh, it's so strong!
- Go on.....
Oh no, I don't think so. Besides I have to go home soon.
I see.
Pity. I would have like to have sketched you in it.
- Would you have really?
- Yes, but perhaps you are right. It wouldn't suit you.
I bet it would.
- Shall I really try it on?
- Yes, will you?
- All right.
- Good.
- Think this will be big enough for me.
- What?
- I said, do you think this will be big enough for me.
- Yes, I think so.
- Go on, play something.
- Wait a minute, how does that thing go?
I know.
And that's a song about you my dear.
You haven't said how you like it.
Marvellous.
- I can't do it up.
-Wait a minute. Where is this trouble?
- I can't do it all up.
- Never mind.
- How do I look?
- Wait a minute, it isn't quite right.
Put your hands there.
- I better go.
- I say.
I've got it.
- Please give it to me.
- All right, come on out.
There it is.
Don't be silly Alice. Don't be silly.
No, no, let me go! Let me go!
No, no....
- Who did you say it was?
- Mr. Crewe!
- Mr. Who?
- No! Crewe, I tell you! It's horrible!
- All right. Don't you worry. I'll send round straight away. What number did you say?
Seven or eleven?
- What?
- 31, I said.
- No, no, 31.
- Ah good. Just take a look around, will you?
- Right you are sir.
- Alice, wake up.
Anyone'd think you hadn't been asleep all night.
What do you think!? There's been a murder last night, round the corner.
They tell me the police are round there now.
We'll all be murdered in our beds, soon, I'm sure we will.
'cause I don't  think the police are what they were.
Morning, Alice. 'eard about the murder?
- Yes, I heard.
- Do you remember Frank's telephone number dear?
- No, but here, you'll find it in the book.
- I mean, some murders are so different to others aren't they?
Pushed his lady friends under the water when they was having a bath
What was his name? you remember?
I think that was ever so beastly.
It gave me the shivers.
After I read about it, I didn't dare 'ave a bath for a month.
An' for weeks after that I only used to 'ave a rinse down.
What was his name? You remember,
Smith, wasn't it?
What's wrong Alice? You don't look very cheerful this morning.
-You do look a little bit peeky, I must say.
- Dad, Alice, breakfast.
Good-morning, Mr. White.
- Good-morning, Sir, good-morning.
Breakfast!!!
I couldn't look bak'n in the face after what happened last night and under our very noses.
Mind you, I don't think, meself, it's all together the police's fault.
What I mean is, they 'ave to wink at some things.
I mean it's one thing to buy chocolates out of hours, but it's quite another to stick a knife into a gentleman.
I must say I feel the same way about that too.
A good, clean, honest whack over the 'ead with a brick is one thing....
...something British about that. But knives?
No. Knives is not right.
I must say that's what I think and that's what I'll keep.
Whatever the provocation,
I could never use a knife.
Now, mind you a knife is a difficult thing to handle.
I mean any knife.... knife.... knife.... a butcher's knife!
- Alice, cut us a bit of bread, will you?
Knife.... knife.... of a knife.... 
...you come up against a knife!
I mean, in Chelsea you mustn't use a..
KNIFE!
- Dear, you ought to be more careful.
You might have cut somebody with that.
Customer.....
- No news of the murder yet?
- No, not yet.
- Thank you. Good-morning.
- Well, I must be going. I can't stand here gossiping all day like some people.
Chatter, chatter, chatter.... give
'em a chance to talk about other people's business, and they'll take it.
- What's the matter Alice?
Had another row with Frank?
- Another customer Alice.
- Good morning, Alice.
- Dear, it's Frank. Hello Frank.
- I say, have you 'eard about our murder?
- Yes, they put me on it.
- Did they? That's good isn't it?
Well, I hope you get him Frank!
- If they do, that will mean promotion, won't it?
- D'you reck'n you'll get him soon?
- Well, uh, I don't know.
-Well, I came in here to phone.
- That's all right.
-  Alice? Come here a minute will you?
- Well I must be going now. Good-bye,
Mrs. White, good-bye,  Mr. White.
Now you two.
- Sssshhhh.....Be careful...
What happened last night?
Why don't you tell me?
Look, you know where I found that?
It's the only piece of evidence that you were there. I'm keeping it back at present.
For God's sake, say something!
- If you're not using the phone...uh, may I?
I, uh, I want to get on to Scotland Yard.
- I say.
- I want the best cigar in the shop.
Certainly sir. Perhaps you'd like to telephone while I get it down?
- No thanks, that can wait.
- What does he mean?
- Very well sir. Now, uh, what sort of a cigar would you like sir? I've got..
I' ve got 'enry Clay or Corona, Corona?
- Corona.
- Certainly sir.
- Any news of the murder.
- No, nothing yet.
- Have you heard anything?
- No, no news.
- Are you, uh, quite sure?
- What the hell business is it of yours, anyway?
- You know, I looked everywhere for that other glove last night.
But, of course, you detectives are better trained at finding these things.
- Ah, here we are sir.
- Excuse me, will you?
Thank you.
Oh, they look good.
- They ought to. I've had ' em for years.
Is it all right sir?
- Yes, I thought the top was broken, but it's all right.
- Have you a light?
- Yes, here you are.
- How silly of me, hadn't noticed it.
- Uh.. all right sir?
- Oh, ha, of course, sorry.
Extraordinary actually...
I can't quite...
I say... would you pay for this?
Is this gentleman a friend of yours, Frank?
Well, we're not exactly friends. At least not yet.
But we're going to do a little business together, aren't we, Frank?
I'll look after the shop, Father.
You go and finish your paper.
What for?
Oh....all right my dear, all right.
Rather unfortunate that poor man died around the corner last night.
Look here you....
Perhaps it's rather fortunate, that your little secret only came into the hands of a man like me.
D'you know, there are some men who would make money out of a thing like that.
What a chance for blackmail.
Oh, oh that's awful.
I couldn't do a thing like that.
Morning, Miss. Two of each there.
By the way. You're a detective.
Let me give you a tip.
Don't wave important clues in telephone boxes. They've got glass doors.
You know, uh, detectives in glass houses shouldn't wave clues.
Come on, out with it. What do you want?
What do I want?
Oooooh, well, uh...
Couldn't we discuss that over breakfast?
Mother this is a friend of Frank's. Mr.?
- Tracy.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Mr. Tracy, would you like something to eat?
- Thank-you.
- Lovely weather, we're having.
- Yes, splendid.
- Who did you say that man was?
- He's a very important friend of Frank's.
I'll get the breakfast for him.
- Here! Aren't we rude?
Won't you take my chair?
- Oh, thanks.
- Did you see, or hear anything during the night?
- No, sir.
- What time did you go to bed?
- About half past ten, sir.
- Did you write this?
- Yes.
- How old would you say this man was.
- I'm afraid I couldn't tell you, sir, he had his hat on.
- Did you notice anything particular about his clothes?
- Well, uh, he had a black hat and a loose kind of collar.
'nd a tie and that's about all, I think.
- Was he dark or fair?
- Well, you couldn't say he was a blond and you couldn't say he was a brunette. He was a bit of both, you know, kind of mousey.
- Anything else?
- No.
- Except when he spoke to you, he went like this.
- All right.
Give me records.
- Well, bring him along. Let's hear what he's got to say.
- Understood?
-Yes, sir.
- Right, get along with it..
- That'll do to go on with.
- How much longer is that man going to stay? Don't tell me he'll be here to dinner.
- Don't make things awkward mother.
It means a lot to to me and Frank.
- Well, I don't see why they should carry on their business in my parlour.
- I'll take it.
- Very well.
- But I don't like that man and the sooner he goes the better.
You are very clever.
I can see that all right.
- Frank? Just a minute will you?
A pal of yours at the Yard, said he thought you might be here.
- Oh, all right.
Hello?
Yeah. Yes.
Well, I thought you wouldn't mind if...
What?
Who?
- Any news Frank?
- Alice, lock that door.
As you were saying ... rather unfortunate the way that poor man round the corner, uh, died last night.
On the other hand, perhaps it's fortunate. For us, that is... that a suspicious looking man, with a criminal record, was seen hanging around the place.
- You....
Look here, don't you try and swing this thing on me. That won't get you anywhere.
- Also rather unfortunate, that Scotland
Yard, are at present looking for that man.
- I say, Frank!
- Just a minute Alice.
- But there's one thing you seem to have forgotten....
- Oh, and what's that?
- Before we get to any hanging,
I shall have quite a lot to say.
And the first thing I shall say is, that she was there too.
- Oh, you will, will you?
Isn't there one thing you seem to have forgotten, that our word's as good as, or perhaps a bit better...
...than that of a jailbird.
So we'll face that when the time comes.
Meanwhile, we'll just sit quietly here until the squad van arrives.
- That surprises you doesn't it?
- No, it doesn't surprise me in the least.
When it comes, the surprise won't be for me.
- Very well then, we are both satisfied.
- Yes, we're both satisfied.
It's my word, against hers.
- Frank, you can't do this.
- Why not?
- Well, because...
- Now, now, don't interfere,
Alice, I know what I'm doing.
You don't, you don't.
- Please Frank.
- Oh, for God's sake, be quiet Alice.
- Why can't you let her speak.
- You mind your own business.
In any case, she'll speak at the right moment.
- Look here Frank. Why can't we, both of us, chuck the whole thing now?
I've got nothing against you.
You've got nothing against me.
Except, of course, I had some cash from you, but I wasn't serious.
Well, look here, have it back now.
Well can't you see, that she wants to chuck it up too? And so do I, you know.
Look here, Miss. You tell him.
Tell him that he's playing with fire and...
And we shall, all of us, burn our fingers.
I'm not bad really, I only... things have gone wrong lately, and one's got to live, you know.
All right then. It's still my word against hers.
That's it?
Oy!
You men meet me in the back, Frank, follow me!
I say, it's not me you want.....
It's him.....ask him.
Why his own....
Hello. Not very often I see you so early in the day as this.
- Called to see Frank?
- No.
No, I want to see lnspector Walls, please.
-Then you'll have to fill out one of these forms, you know.
- All right.
- Do you know something about this?
- Yes.
George, just a minute.
Take this along to inspector Walls.
Well I suppose you're going to tell him who did it, Miss.
Yes.
- You can come along now
- Here you are, Miss.
- Come in, please.
Won't you sit down?
You've something to tell us about this case.
- Yes.
- Well, what is it?
Well, you see. I know who did it.
Is this worthwhile sir, now that everything has been cleared up?
Let's hear what she's got to say.
What I was going to say is this...
I'd better say, what I have to say now...
I would rather not wait.
What I wanted to say is...
- I was the one.
- One moment please.
Hello.
Yes, yes.
Yes, hold on. Will you deal with this young lady,
I shall be busy for a minute. Yes, sir.
This way Miss, please.
Alice, whatever made you come here?
I did it.
- I know.
- You don't know.
He tried oh, I can't tell you.
It's too terrible. I was defending myself.
I didn't know what I was doing and then...
- My dear.
- Ha, ha! So you found him,
Miss. Did she tell you who did it.
- Yes.
You'll want to look out, or you'll be losing your job my boy.
I suppose we'll soon have lady detectives up in the Yard, eh.
And I shall be all right on the dole, won't I.
