Little perishers, aren't they?
You don't look well, lass
What are you doing in Addisford?
You looking for someone?
Man
Arch Wilson is his name Wilson?
There was a Pug Wilson once, went to sea a few years back
Little fella, no hair
Wouldn't be him, eh?
You sure this is where you want?
That's what he said
Well, then
I gotta be gettin' home
She needs help, Mother
Get her washed up, eh?
What are you lot gawping at?
You you didn't tell me your name
What's your name?
Isabella
My other name is Ford
Come on, then
Let's get you dry
Bless this, our sister
Succour her in her need
Look down on her distress and lead her into pastures new, where she may rest her weary head
Take her unto you and let your bounty once more flow through her heart
Our merciful father, forgive us if in our own ease, our own comfort, our blindness, we sometimes forget others
For that which we are about to receive, may the Lord make us truly thankful Amen
You know of any Wilsons hereabouts, Mother?
Not as I recall
There used to be some

Our Nell's no use for 'em
We lost her three years back
Rheumatic fever
Go on, try it on, then
I had her when I was about your age
Still too young, mind
Like you would have been
I'd have had my eyes closed if I didn't see how you were that first night
Not be telling the others, though
Was it him you were looking for?
Said he'd marry you, did he?
Yes, he did
Well, you'll not be the first to believe that
Doubt you'll be the last
You're young, you'll forget
No, I won't forget
Have you no one to help you?
I have a sister who's moved to Ireland
There you are, then
She has troubles of her own
What about your mother?
She died My father, too
I dare say you could stay on here a while with us
If you wanted to
You'd have to do your share, mind
Fetch the leather from the factory to make up the shoes
Oh, I'll do anything as I can
We want 'em back on Thursday, Mr Sampson
Want 'em back pretty sharp
When can you get 'em back?
- I'll sit up all night if needs be
- You were late last week
I'll have 'em back here by
Thursday, never you fear
Hey, Bella?
Where you going? Bella!
Arch? Arch!
Arch Wilson!
I'm looking for Arch Wilson
There's no
Arch Wilson here
But I just saw him
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
I said, what are you doing here?
I told you, I'm looking for Arch Wilson
And I told you there is no Arch Wilson
And what are you really up to, eh?
You're lying
I've seen him
Are you calling me a liar?
Hey! Take your hands off her
And who are you?
Never mind who I am I think you owe this lady an apology
I'm not apologizing to anybody until you get out of here
Are you all right? Is this the man you're looking for?
It's not him Con
Come on
Stop it Stop it!
Get him down!
Take your hands off me and I'll go
Down them stairs
Go! Don't come back here no more
Nor you neither
Evening, Con Evenin'
So Mitchy came home with a full basket this evening?
He's before us
You better make sure you're ahead of him tomorrow
Try Parsons over at Aylesburgh
Five or six mile
Need to leave early
Are you above that?
I'm not above anything
Out before six?
Five or six miles, we can do that easy
You'd be best going your own way.
Ewings at Northridge.
But Ma
There's no good you going together
She only been out there once
I can manage alone
You'll not be getting far in those
They'll be all right
Wear your other pair
The ones with the buckles
I can't Why ever not?
They're too large
Well, that's easy fix
Matty will make a sock for 'em
I brought you a present
Oh, they're lovely
Oh
I love them
You can wear them on our wedding day
Evening, Miss Ford Evenin'
We could put a sock in 'em
But there's no point
Why not?
They're cheap
Yankee ones
Machine-made Look at the linings
Cheap?
I'll make you a new pair
No, you've enough work to do
Wish I had
This lot are all finished
And we've no others waitin'
It'll be a present, that's what it'll be
For a special occasion
When's your birthday?
May 25th
You've done enough for me already, all of you
Well, let's take a look anyway
You'd be fours
And you're high in the instep
Mother's got supper at the table
All right
Let's see if the other foot's the same Left
It tickles Hold still, come on
I always thought I was a three
That's why my feet hurt
Threes? Threes would kill you
You do such fine work, Matty
Made the smallest pair of shoes in England once
Was the only one who could do it
Size of a bean pod, they were
For a little midget
Worked the halls in London
You have pride in your work
You have to
Even here
What do you mean?
There's no future in Addisford
Machines'll be doing all the work soon
Then it's only London where they'll have enough money for handmade shoes
London's the place
You!
I know you're there
You come out!
It's only me
It's Con
What are you doing?
I always come along whenever I can
I like peaceful here
You-you frightened me
Did I?
Yes!
I'm sorry
Look, there's a heron See?
Con, why were you following me?
I was wondering
I wanted to ask you something
What?
I bought you an apple
It's a windfall
Bella, I was wondering, would you like to come out with me?
If you'd like to walk out with me I mean
You and me together like
Con, I Right, fine
No, no, I
It don't matter
Forget I asked
I've no mind to be walking out with anyone
Keep the apple
Con!
Con!
Matty!
Where is that lad?
The time Come on
Meet and right it is to praise God, the giver of all grace
God, whose mercies are bestowed on the evil and the good
Makes his sun on sinners rise, showers his blessings from the skies
Least of all thy creatures, we daily thy salvation see
As by heavenly manna fed, through a world of dangers led
For what we're about to receive may the Lord make us truly thankful Amen
Happy birthday, Bella
Your birthday?
Why didn't you tell us?
I had to get the leather especially from London
Oh, Matty!
Glad you had the money for it
Feel how light they are
Doeskin, see
Lovely and soft
30 stitches to the inch
Oh, they're lovely
And look at the shape of the toe
I see That's the latest thing
Is it?
Thank you, Matty Thank you
Happy birthday, Bella
Many of them
Thank you
You should've told me
Might've had a cake
No I didn't want no fuss
Let us sing hymn number 431

Saw you nodding off
Not true, Mother!
Giving your eyes a rest, were you?
No!
What are you saying? Eh?
What you doing here?
I followed you
What for?
Are they yours?
Well
They live here They like you!
I just feed 'em
My place, this one
Don't tell no one, will you?
No
You like being alone, don't you?
It's all right Not my choosing
It's always Pa and Jedd and Matty and Mother
Nell used to come here sometimes
Seems it's always the people we love is get taken away
Isn't it?
That's God's will, that's what Ma says
I think God's wrong, that's what I think
Do you?
Sometimes
What about you?
You like being alone?
Not my choosing either
Now this is what I call a welcome, eh?
There you are, lad Hello, Mother
All right, Sergeant?
All right, Corporal
Miss Ford, too
How is Miss Ford, eh?
Keepin' fair to mid?
Midding very fair, I'd say
I like Miss Ford's mid,
Sergeant Don't you?
It's a little more plush on the upholstery now, than it was?
That's enough of that sort of talk
You're not in the barracks now
No, very true, Mother, very true
How's Squire Wyman's wheat doin'? And the oats
How's the oats?
Uncommon well, Corporal

Ford Don't forget we got her
You ever make a bond, Bella?
No No?
Well, you'll have to learn before we start
Tell you what Why don't you come along with me and I'll show you how?
Listen, my lad, she's got better to do than go traipsing about with you
Better?
Something better than walking over to Wyman's with Corporal Wainwright?
Why, there's nothing better than that from here to Barrackpore
Here, cop hold of that, Sergeant
Come on, Bella
You and me's off to make a bond
You needn't leave her there all afternoon with your fool talk
What's that?
Huh? Medal
Got it in the Afghan War
They said it was for an act of bravery, but it seemed like common sense to me at the time
Here, hold on I'll go first
Give you a hand over
Thank you There, all right?
Let's rest a moment, eh?
That's the colour I like to see your face
It's better than you were that first night
You know what?
What?
You've got the prettiest eyes
I ever saw
Hm, I bet you tell all the girls that in Salisbury
No, no No
Well, not all of them
So have you let Con kiss you?
What about Matty?
So what about me, eh?
How were that?
Nice, weren't it?
You look as if you thought so
Uh-huh
Walk out with me tonight?
You know, I could tell you about about places and things you never even dreamed of
I'm not like the other two, you know
Aren't you?

Rent collector, eh?
That what you are?
Eh, I'm talking to you
Had a bit too much spin, that one, I'd say Wouldn't you?
Yes, I'm a rent collector
You're not from around these parts, you're not
No, he's from Celbridge
Only it ain't too safe for him to go drinkin' down there
What do you do if the poor buggers can't pay up?
Throw 'em out in the street, do ya?
Leave it Dad, eh?
Just play the game
He should have that shot again
What are you talkin' about,
"have it again"?
How can he play, eh?
With you shoutin' about

That's my girl
All right Let's get our heads down for a few hours, eh?
I tell you what
A cup of tea at half past three might be nice
Four sugars, mind
I hope you're pleased with yourself
And why not?
Where's the harm in a good evenin'?
You should try it yourself sometime

Corporal?
You don't know the meaning of real work How could ya?
You've never been outside

Blimey, you're like a lot of pigs on straw
Reckon some of you'd lay here till fools' noon if anybody'd let you

You've earned it
You'll be courting this time next year
Excellent work, Mitchell,
Mrs Mitchell
Lovely spread, Squire
Some of us hoppers brought forth a hundredfold, Mr Wyman
Some only 30-fold
It's the spirit that's all-important, Mitchell
That is true
The Holy Spirit You might say
Have you had enough?
I'm fit to burst, thank you
Are you? You might starve all winter
Everyone's near bursting come harvest home, isn't that right,
Mr Wyman?
You've obviously been enjoying yourself tonight, Wainwright
Tom
Ben Stop it
You're looking pretty as a picture tonight, Bella
You ever had your photograph taken?
Not as I remember
No? Well, we'll go to the photographer's at Celbridge on my way back to the barracks, then
Good idea, Corporal
We got our photographs taken
Why not one of our Bella, eh?
It's a long way to Celbridge, isn't it?
No, it's only 20 minutes on the train, ain't it?
You've never been to Celbridge?
No
It's a grand place
Shouldn't miss the chance, should she, Mother?
Not if you say so, Ben
It's all settled then, eh?
We'll go over there, have a grand time
Give me some more of that
And I'll have some more bread
I'd like to dance with you later on
Would you?
Yes Yes, I would
Can't dance
You could if you could be bothered
Come on, Bella!
You want to do the next one, eh?
One more
It's a waltz,
I'd say
My turn, Jedd
All right If the lady pleases, eh?
You all right, Silas?
You enjoying yourself?
I am
Bella, I've decided I'm going to London in a couple of days
Have you told your ma?
I haven't told anyone yet
Then why are you telling me?
I wondered
Would you come with me?
What?
Would you?
Just like that?
Just the two of us?
I'll take care of you
I ask nothing in return No
No, I'd not walk out like that
Your ma and pa have been good to me
Excuse me, Matty, please What?
I'd like to come in
Wait till the end of the dance
Er, Mother, fancy a dance?
Don't be daft
Go on They'll do a nice, fast one next
Dancing with you?
Go on You sit here much longer, you're gonna put down roots
Thank you What's that?
Come on, Con
What's going on, Kate?
I'll show you what to do
I'll show you
I can't do this
I'll show you what to do
That's the way,
Mother, that's the way!
Ow!
Christ! I'm sorry
You all right?
Hey, Mother, he's trod upon her
Crippled for life now, I expect
What's it like dancing with a carthorse, Bella?
Now, you stop that,
Jedd Come on!
I'm sorry, Bella
No one is as sorry as I am
I'd never danced at harvest before
Not as easy as it looks
You can learn No
I'll teach you if you like
What, you'd risk it?
Careful
Long as you take off your boots
Can you sit yourself down there?
Steady All right
You tired?
My hands hurt Yeah Let's see
That's bonding that does that
You tired?
Not really
You frightened me out there in the fields
Well, he wouldn't leave you alone
He was just larking about
He was He was just larking
No, he weren't larking
You don't
He weren't larking
You don't know Jedd
He knew what he was doing, he always does
Con, I don't want you fighting over me
I wasn't fighting over you
Well, that's what it looks like
And I'm living under your ma and pa's roof
I wasn't fighting over you Jedd, see, he don't listen to me
I'm used to it But he wasn't listening to you, and that's not right
When our Nell, my sister, died, she looked like she was very frightened at the end
And I asked if we could read the Noah story at her funeral
See, Nell's favorite story was the one about
Noah and the rainbow and and how the rainbow's a sign not to be scared or nothin'
But Jedd said no
"Pa wants Psalm 23"
And besides, it's more appropriate"
But, see, I know Nell would've like that story, the Noah story
They didn't listen
Jedd weren't listening to me
He got crosser and crosser and the crosser he got, the more you laughed
That was your fault, pulling all them faces at me behind his back
Better be on me way, then
I'll walk to the station with you
No No, no, no
I'm up for a fine welcome, but never a goodbye
Can't abide it Never could
So
Come and see me down in Salisbury?
No I'll see you when you come back at Christmastime
Well, it was worth a try, eh?
You! Goodbye, Jedd
Goodbye, then
No, no
Never say goodbye, eh?
It's too well, final
I'll send you on a photograph just as soon as they arrive
If they do arrive
Everything's got to go!
Live chicken, madam?
No, thank you
Come on, get your chicken and geese!
Flowers! Fresh cut!
Flowers! Fresh cut!
Good morning
Come on, dear, out you come now That's a good girl
That's my beauty
Mind where you're going, Ruth For heaven's sake
Hello!
Pretty
You all right, then, Sam?
Hello?
- Hello, hello!
- There you are!
How's my little angel?
She all right this morning?
She's all right
We'll go and see Mr
And Mrs Goose, shall we?
We'll go and see
Mr and Mrs Goose
You fed the goose this morning?
No No eggs, neither
No eggs? That's not very good, is it?
We'll have to wring their necks and have them for our supper, won't we?
My beautiful little angel
Nice, rosy cheeks, haven't ya?
You been out in the fresh air this morning, have you?
Arch!
Arch, mind you keep her warm
I'll keep her warm!
And why are you so late?
What?
You're always nagging me, you are
I'm not nagging you
You're always late!
You always nag me
You're not pleased to see me
Have you paid
Mr Thompson's bill yet?
I paid that last week
But I saw Mrs
Thompson and she doesn't
Well, she don't know nothing about it
I paid him, not her
Believe me for once, eh?
Arch, I worry about you
You say you're comin' home and you don't come home
Oh, come on
There's no need
After a hard day,
I just want a bit of peace and quiet
I just worry, that's all
Why are you going back inside?
Here we are, just up here
You all right, son?
Now that the harvest is done, it's time I was going
I think you should wait
I made up my mind
Evening, Mrs Wainwright Evening
Matty
You see Jedd away all right, did you?
Yes, I did
I don't want to cause no trouble here
Maybe not, but you're a bit of a one for it all the same
No I've done nothing as it seems
That makes everything all right, does it?
No
Setting brother against brother would be seen as causing trouble in anyone's book
One of my sons might have died in that cornfield
You think about that before you count yourself innocent of all blame
I have thought about it
Bella not back yet?
Ma?
She's gone
What?
Packed her bags and gone
No, she can't, she got no money
She has enough
Watch where you're going!
Ma says you're leaving
Why?
I have to
No No
Look, I won't fight with Jedd no more, I promise
It's not just that,
I have to leave
It won't happen again, I swear
You don't know me, Con No No, I
I know, I know No, you don't
I can't say what I mean
You know nothing about me
I've been with a man!

Hello
You're as beautiful as ever
So how've you been?
I have to go Excuse me
Stay!
Let's just talk for a minute, eh?
Still got the prettiest eyes
I ever did see
I never did forget your eyes
You know, I came over to
Selmouth a couple months back
Did you?
They told me you'd gone
Are you living here now?
No
Where, then?
Addisford
Where you said you lived
I live in Celbridge
I know
I saw you there
Well, well, no
I was at Addisford for a time
Well, you know,
I get all over the place with my work
You lied to me
Addisford, eh?
Say, you've got a fair there next weekend, haven't you?
I'll probably see you there
You lied
Keep still You've got a hair in your eye
Keep still
I took Mother to the fair that summer we were courting, do you remember?
Once was enough
There she was, all dressed up
I took her on the merry-go-round
Ben
Anyway, she'd had too many cockles, you see
There she was, very proper, up and down, up and down, round and round
That'll do
Anyway, she brought it all up, you see
I was all right,
I was upwind of her
Everyone else was splattered!
Not at the table
You haven't been able to look at another cockle since, have you, Mother?
Ben, I said, that's enough
Watch what you're doing, son
Right
Now seems as good a time as any
For what? Eh?
Come on, then
You got something to say, spit it out
Bella Ford, will you marry me?
Don't care what anyone says
Bella, will you marry me?
Will you?
Yes, I will
Yeah?
What's been going on?
Yes
So why didn't you tell me, eh?
Why didn't you tell me?
I never knew I was gonna ask
Congratulations, love Yeah
Ah, come on, Mother, come on
Give them your blessing
Come on
Mother
You! Why'd you have to ask me like that, in front of Ma?
'Cause I made up my mind,
I couldn't wait
I had to do it
You're meant to get down on one knee and ask me all romantic-like
All right Bella
Miss Bella Ford, will you marry me?
No!
Go on, you bloody better
Walter, Sally, may I present my fiancée, Miss Bella Ford
Congratulations Thank you
Thanks, Walter
Congratulations Thank you
I'm getting married, Walter, can you believe it?
Stop it You're making me feel foolish
I'm sorry, but once I get something in my head,
I got to do it
I've always been like that
I remember once, when I was little,
I was in chapel one Sunday
And there was this old boy preaching, Ben Masters
He had this big beard like Moses and he'd fix you with his eye till you thought he was God himself
And on one Sunday, all of a sudden he started shouting:
"Has anybody here seen Jesus?
Has anybody here seen Jesus?"
And he looked straight at me
And I was angry because I thought, why is he asking such a stupid question?
And I stood up and
I shouted back as loud as I could,
"No! No! Course we ain't!
He's dead, ain't he?"
And I got out my pew and I ran down the back of the chapel
I opened the door and I ran and I ran until I couldn't run no more
There's one of Ben Masters' old disciples Mitchy!
Mrs Mitchy!
Mr Mitchell, if you don't mind
Afternoon I've got something to announce
Me and Bella here, who you know, we're getting wed
Well, now! Congratulations to the pair of you!
Oh, I'm so pleased for you
Like I said to the wife on our wedding day
We're gonna go around the river first,
Mr Mitchell, Mrs Mitchell
Good afternoon Goodbye
I never thought he'd end up with her
Spoiled, that one
She might be just the girl for him
Hey, boys
Mind the lines, eh?
Sorry, mister
- Any luck?
- Not much
I reckon it's too hot
What are you using?
Maggots Maggots Try caddis
Sometimes they'll go for caddis when it's hot
I know my fishing, see?
Nosy bugger
Aw
Look at that, Billy
Isn't that romantic?
So you're a fisherman, are you?
I think you've had too much cider, that's what I think
Con Con! Where are you going?
Con, turn the boat around
You want to try?
- Come on
- Thank you
You're splashing me Stop it!
Hey, hey, hey!
Watch out for the line, eh?
I'm nowhere near your line
Hello, Bella
Told you I'd see you, didn't I?
Like the hat
Who's that?
Nobody
You having a good time of it, eh?
What do you want?
A word with an old friend, that's all
Hey, Bella?
It's him, isn't it?
Bella?
Let's go home
Seems you don't want to know me any more
Come on, Bella, eh?
Give us a smile Come on

You used to work here last summer, didn't you?
Yes It's good to see you again
Don't you remember me?
Oh, yes How are you?
I'm well Won't you?
Oh, no, thank you,
I'm with someone
Excuse me well, you'll want to watch it or you'll end up like that bloke in the paper
They say his face was that smashed you could hardly recognise him
- Poor fellow
- Terrible business
You know him?
So did you too, if you think about it
How did I know him?
He came down for the fishing last summer
I don't remember
He was a tall fellow
Black hair
Used to like joking
I saw him again up Celbridge way
He and his wife brought their nipper over for a Christmas party
Did you know that he had a wife and child?
I did After
Thank you
Con, look at me
Do you love me?
You know I do
Then stay with me Stay with me
The missus and I like a few mackerel
Just the job

I'll not be going
It'll be all right
We're leaving now
You can't trust me

You can't But I do Why not?
Because I can't trust myself
Once we leave here, it'll be all right
No
Things will be different then

So you're leaving tomorrow for Dublin? Before eight?
Yes Good
Did you see Ma, Pa and Matty earlier?
No
Matty's doing well Is he?
Looks like it
Fancy coat
I reckon London suits him fine
I thought I
What?
What?
I can't remember what I was gonna say
I walked by the river yesterday It was cold
Was it?
First frost last night
Bleedin' freezing in here
It is, isn't it?
It is cold, isn't it?
Yes
Thought it was just me
No, it's cold
You have to finish up now, Con
Just a bit another minute,
Tom Just a bit longer
A little bit longer, eh?
You all right? Good
All right, then
All right, then
- Now, come on, miss
- Come on now
Easy there, now Easy
- Keep it forward!
- Aye, aye, Sir!
Let go of the hull!
All right!
Yes! From home to the hospital in under seven minutes! We did it.
Yes, the hard part is truly over.
No, but come on, we're off to a great start, aren't we?
I knew I'd get here fast, but this has gotta be some kind of a record!
-Oh, you made it!
-Hi.
-How the hell did you beat us here?
-We took a cab. Did you guys walk?
No, we took a cab too.
But I did test runs..
Hey, you made it!
Okay, is there some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?
Ross, you stay here and talk.
I'm gonna go have a baby.
Okay. Hi, this is Rachel Greene.
I'm Ross Geller. We called from the car.
Right. We have a semi-private labor room waiting for you, so..
Oh, whoa! I'm sorry. Semi-private?
We asked for a private room.
Yes, I see that here. Unfortunately, we can't guarantee a private room.
-And, currently, they're all unavailable.
-Man, if only you'd gotten here sooner.
I'm sorry. Semi-private rooms are all we have.
Okay. Just give us a second. Ross?
Yeah?
-Give her some money.
-I really think they're out of rooms.
They're not, Ross. They're just saving them for important people!
Okay? What if I was the president?
Well, then, we'd be in a lot of trouble.
You don't know where any countries are.
Okay.
Say, would you mind checking again?
See if any private rooms may have opened up?
This is a hospital.
Okay, I see.
Could we please talk to the manager?
There is no manager.
Just nurses, doctors and semi-private rooms.
Okay, you know what? I have to say,
I don't really care for your tone.
And this is not the only hospital in this city, and we have no problem.. Oh, gosh!
-What? What?
-Contraction!
-Would you like to see a semi-private room?
-Yeah, it couldn't hurt to look.
Well, you're only two centimeters dilated, and we need to get to 10.
-It'll be a while.
-Oh, okay.
-I'll be back in an hour to check you again.
-Thank you.
Oh, wait, Dr. Long.
Can I ask you something?
Is labor really as painful as everybody says it is?
Oh, look at that.
My beeper's going crazy.
Hey, don't.. You know what?
You're gonna be fine.
-I guess we have some time to kill.
-Yeah, guess so.
Oh, check these out.
Never done this before.
Doesn't feel good.
Yeah, well, it looks great.
Thank you very much.
I think we're ready to..
Hi, I'm Ross. I'm here to ruin this magical day for you.
Oh, no, not at all. It's okay.
Marc Horger. This is my wife, Julie.
-Hi, Julie. This is Rachel.
-Oh, hi, Rachel.
-Is this your first?
-Yeah, it is.
Well, little Jamie here is our third.
So if you have any questions, or you need anything at all, just holler.
-That's so sweet.
-Yeah.
-Let me give you guys some privacy.
-Nonsense. We're all in this together.
We are gonna share every moment of this with you.
-I think we're gonna have some fun.
-Yeah.
-Oh, okay, I guess.
-Hey, smile!
-I don't know if..
-I really don't want any..
Oh, thank you.
Oh, Ross!
Here comes another contraction.
Okay, just breathe.
-Oh, honey, I think I'm having one too!
-Oh, my God!
Hey, look at this.
-Here you go!
-Oh, no!
Oh, wow. Three hours and still no baby.
The miracle of birth sure is a snooze-fest.
-Hey, you wanna see something?
-Sure. What?
This is gonna be fun.
Watch me freak out Chandler.
-Honey?
-Yeah?
Listen, I've been doing some thinking.. and I don't know whether it's because we're here.. or Rachel's giving birth.. but I think we should try to have a baby.
Okay.
What's that now?
Okay. I've been thinking about it too, and I think we're ready.
Are you kidding? You think we're ready to have a baby now?
This is fun.
You're ready to have a baby?
My boy's all grown up!
You said you were ready too.
Yeah, but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird..
Like mine is now!
Yes, but haven't you wanted a kid, like, forever?
Yeah, but no one ever wanted to have one with me. I mean..
Now I'm just gonna have a baby if I want to. Oh, what are you doing to me?
I'm sorry I brought it up.
Okay, then, back off, mister!
Because I am ready to have a baby.
I just want Joey to be the father.
-What? Are you crazy?
-That's it, right there! That's all I wanted!
I am sorry. The doctor insisted on closing the curtain for the exam.
Oh, that's very..
Really, very, very okay.
Julie's cervix is dilated seven centimeters. That's about four fingers!
-Doctor let me feel it myself.
-Have you felt Rachel's cervix, Ross?
-No, I don't.. We're not gonna do that.
-We won't be doing that.
Well, if you like, you could feel
Rachel's, then feel mine to compare.
-Am I interrupting?
-Yes! Thank you! Later.
-No, you can't leave me alone with them.
-Oh, I'm sorry.
No, Ross? Ross? Ross?
My child has no father!
I'm so glad you're here, but it's gonna be a while. I wish you'd called first.
That's all right.
I'm coming back later with your father.
-I needed to talk to you before the birth.
-Okay. What's up?
Ross, I want to talk to you as your mother.. even though I know that you and I are also very close friends.
I really don't know what you're talking about, but okay.
I brought something that I want to give you.
Assuming, of course, that you want it.
Ma, you're asking me to marry you?
This is your grandmother's engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.
-Mom, no. Come on. Thank you.
-Just hear me out..
No! Okay? We've been through this.
We're not gonna get married just because she's pregnant. Okay?
Honestly, Ross, this isn't just some girl you picked up in a bar and humped.
You think young people use that word more than we actually do.
Ross, a child should have a family.
You know what? I can't deal with this right now. I'm sorry.
Go.. Hey, go talk to Monica.
She got a new haircut.
You'll hate it.
Just think about it. If you don't,
I'll talk more about humping.
Give me.
-Hi, dear.
-Hi. Thank you so much for coming.
Ross, get in here!
You wanna see something funny?
Monica.
Okay. All right, stop it.
You're freaking me out.
Do it again. Do it again.
Hey, Rachel had the baby.
-What?
-Really?
No.
I don't know why
I thought that'd be funny.
You said hi to Mom before she left, right?
I thought that was her.
Yeah, I called her name, and she ducked into a stairwell.
Well, you know what?
Consider yourself lucky.
She pulled me out of the labor room to ask me why I'm not with Rachel.
-Oh, my God.
-How annoying.
Yeah.
-Why aren't you with Rachel?
-You're kidding, right?
Look, we're not gonna be together just because we're having this baby.
And I know she's not just some girl I humped..
Oh, humped?
Come on, Ross.
But it just seems that you two belong together.
Okay, stop it. I can't deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby.
Right. And with who again?
He's crazy. Why doesn't he wanna be with Rachel?
I know.
Seriously, she's like the perfect woman.
I mean, I know she turned me down.. but if she hadn't and she wanted to be with me..
I would take her in my arms and..
I haven't bummed you guys out like this in a while, have I?
-Hey.
-Hey.
-Who's that?
-New people.
What happened to the Disgustingtons?
They're having their baby.
It's not fair, Ross. I got here first!
Right after you left, they wheeled her off into delivery.
Oh, but not before she gave me a nice, juicy shot of little Jamie crowning away.
Wow. Sorry.
So how are the new people?
Well, they have some unusual pet names for each other.
Including "Evil Bitch" and "Sick Bastard."
-Oh, gosh, a contraction.
-Yeah? Okay, okay. Just breathe.
-Are you looking at her?
-No!
-Don't you look at her, you sick bastard!
-Honey, I swear I wasn't looking at her!
She's in labor. You like that, you sick son of a bitch?
I'm just gonna..
See? It's because you were looking, you fat pervert.
No, no. I'm sure no one was looking.
Just want some privacy.
You miss your girlfriend?
Just ignore them.
-You okay?
-Yeah.
-Ross.
-What?
-He's looking at me.
-Hey!
You wanna live to see your baby?
Don't you talk to my husband like that, you stupid bastard!
Oh, good God! If you want a baby so bad, just go steal it!
Oh, don't worry.
These babies are far too ugly for us.
What is going on with you.
Since when are you so crazy about babies?
I'm not crazy about babies.
I'm crazy about us.
What?
We've always talked about having babies someday, not now.. but I'm starting to think that we can handle it. We're good.
We're really good.
We are pretty good.
But nothing has to happen until you're ready.
Well, maybe I'm ready now.
I mean, it's a little scary, but maybe it's right.
What? It's not right!
We're not ready to have a kid now!
-What?
-I'm kidding. This is gonna be fun.
So we're gonna try?
I mean, we're trying?
We're trying to get pregnant.
I'm not comfortable doing this in front of the babies.
-So when do you want to start trying?
-All right, hold on a sec.
-Period math?
-Yeah.
Well, we could start trying now.
-Right here?
-No, not here.
Maybe here.
It's perfect. We got a lot of time to kill, and we're in a building that's full of beds!
And it's so clean!
Come on, you stupid machine! Come on!
-It ate your money?
-No.
-I'll see you downstairs then.
-All right.
Hey, I got one! I got one!
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Oh, up or down?
-Oh. Down, please.
I hate to be a ball-buster, but can I just do it?
-Could you press up too?
-Sure.
-I feel bad. I broke my leg once too.
-Yeah? How'd yours happen?
Well, it's a long story, it's kind of embarrassing.
Let's just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual.
-How about you?
-Car accident.
Some idiot on a cell phone wasn't paying attention?
Yeah. Me.
-Sorry.
-Oh, no. No, don't be.
Nobody else got hurt.
And I was pretty lucky.
Well, I, for one, am glad you made it.
Are you sure?
I mean, you don't know me.
I could have been sent from another planet to destroy Earth.
Couldn't press the "down" button.
I think Earth's okay.
Oh, hey, that's me.
Hey, I take it you're just visiting someone.
Well, if you have some time and you wanna visit someone else..
Yeah, I would like that.
-Great. I'm in room..
-Wait! What? No! Elevator! No!
You gotta press the button.
The nurse said they're bringing in another woman.
Oh. Is she pregnant yet?
She doesn't need to be.
She'll still have the baby before I do.
-Oh, Ross! Another contraction.
-Oh, okay. Here, here.
That's it.
-Oh, that sounded like a bad one.
-Yeah, it was.
Mine haven't been so bad.
Oh, here comes one now.
Oh, that was a big one.
That was, like, the biggest one yet.
Are you okay, honey?
I'm okay, honey.
Well, I got some bad news.
It gets worse.
And when you get to the end, they get really big.. and they come, like, every minute.
Well, mine are pretty close together.
I think..
-Excuse me.
-Yeah, that's quite all right.
Oh, by the way, my name's Johanna.
What's yours?
Excuse me, could you help me with something?
I'm looking for a man.
Well, who isn't?
You. You aren't.
Good for you.
Anyway, the patient
I'm looking for has a broken leg.
He's in a wheelchair. He's early to mid-30s, very attractive.
Even you would think so.
-I know who you're talking about.
-Great! What room number is he in?
I'm sorry.
Patient information is confidential.
No, I'm not gonna bother him.
We were talking earlier..
Ma'am, I'm sorry. That information is restricted to hospital staff.
-She's with me. Dr. Drake Ramoray.
-Dr. Drake who?
Ramoray. It's Portuguese.
We need that information. I'm a doctor.
-A doctor at this hospital?
-Damn it, we're losing precious time.
You want this man's blood on your head..?
-Hands.
-Hands!
It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room he is staying in.
He's a patient of mine.
I've treated him for years.
-He's in room 816.
-816. Thank you.
-And what is his name?
-No.
-I think we found a place.
-Okay.
Wait. Wanna set the mood a little?
Hello, Monica.
-Not like that.
-Oh, okay.
-We'll dim the lights.
-Okay.
Or turn them out altogether.
No scented candles.
Okay, here. There we go.
Okay, okay.
Making me sterile, but okay.
Okay. I'm sorry. Oh, wait.
Do we have a condom?
Oh, right!
Yes, 98.6. You're gonna be fine.
This is it!
-That's him!
-Great. Go get him!
Wait a second.
Or maybe you could go in first.
He's not really my type.
Not you. Dr. Ramoray. Ask him questions and see what he's like.
-People tell doctors everything.
-You said he was this great guy.
All the guys I meet seem nice at first, then turn out to be big jerks.
-You do attract some stinkers.
-Yeah, I know.
Dr. Long, I've been at this for 17 hours.
Three women have come and gone with their babies.
You gotta give me good news. How many centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?
-Three.
-Just three?
I'm dilated three!
We are moving along just slowly.
Don't worry, you're doing great.
-I'll be back soon.
-Thank you.
You know what? I'm not waiting.
I'm gonna push this baby out.
I'm doing it. Three centimeters.
That's gotta be like this, right?
-Actually, it's more like this.
-Oh, stupid metric system.
We're gonna need to take you straight to the delivery room.
Oh, for the love of God!
It's coming! It's coming!
And here it is!
Oh, come on!
I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray. I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.
Really? I've been dealing with Dr. Wells.
I know. I'm a neurologist.
Just to be on the safe side..
Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview. So he sent me.
Dr. Wells is a woman!
That was a test. Good response.
-All right. Full name?
-Clifford Burnett.
-Date of birth?
-November 16, 1968.
Age?
-Can't you figure that out?
-I'm a doctor, not a mathematician.
-I'm 33.
-Okay.
-And are you married?
-No.
Oh, really? So 33 and single? Would you say you have commitment issues?
Are all the questions this personal?
Yes.
Well, if you must know, I'm a widower.
-Oh, that's terrible. I'm really sorry.
-Yeah.
I lost my wife five years ago to a mild cardial infarction.
-A heart attack, doctor.
-Oh, yeah. Well, yeah, mild car..
Are you experiencing any dizziness?
No.
-Has the pain been getting worse?
-No.
Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
-No.
-Excellent. Excellent.
And finally, are you into any weird stuff, you know, sexually?
-No!
-Wrong answer.
-This room's available.
-Okay! Wait, you listen to me!
Since I have been waiting, four women.. that's four, one higher than the number of centimeters I'm dilated.. have come and gone with their babies.
I'm next. It's my turn. It's only fair.
If you bring in one more woman who has her baby before me, I will sue you.
Not this hospital. I'm gonna sue you.
My husband is a lawyer.
-Rach?
-You get back on that case, honey!
I don't think the next patient is very far along.
Okay. Well, then bring her in.
Oh, my God!
I can't believe this!
And yet, somehow, it's true.
I mean, this is so great.
We're gonna be baby buddies!
Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby's ears.
-Hi, sweetie!
-Hi, sweetheart.
This is my husband, Sid. I don't think you've met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid.
I nabbed him a year ago at the dermatologist's office.
Thank God for adult acne!
I still can't believe it.
I'm the luckiest guy in the world.
Really?
What'd he say?
You have to speak very loudly, he's almost completely deaf.
-Oh, there you go.
-Of course he is.
Congratulations, you two.
I didn't even know you got married.
-Oh, we didn't.
-What?
We're just having this baby together, but that's all, you know.
Why?
We're just not in that place, you know?
But we're very excited about this.
Oh. Well, then shut me up.
Just tell me how.
Oh, I feel another one coming.
Sid, you lucky, deaf bastard.
-What else? What else?
-He's 33.
A widower.
He seemed like a standup guy.
And he's not into anything weird sexually.
Enter Phoebe!
Should we tell Rachel there's an empty private room right next door to hers?
We could. Or we could have sex in it.
Well, let me think about that while I remove my pants!
Okay, mister! Fertilize me!
Does that sound like Janice?
If it's not, then there's two of them.
And that would mean it's the end of the world!
Hey.
-Hey.
-Hi.
I can't believe this is taking so long.
How you doing?
Not bad. You know that feeling, trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?
And soon someone will call her "Mom."
Weirdest thing. Did I hear..?
Mother of God, it's true!
Chandler Bing!
Janice.
Not just Janice. Janice in labor.
Contracting and everything.
Oh, this should be easy.
I have a very wide pelvis.
You remember, Chandler.
I feel so bad for you.
She's your ex. And I have Richard.
Janice, I didn't even know you were pregnant.
Who's the unwitting human whose essence you've stolen?
It's you.
This is yours.
What?
Look how nervous he gets!
We haven't slept together in years!
That's funny. Does it hurt?
Does the labor hurt?
Okay, I've got one for you.
If you had to, which would you eat?
A Seeing Eye dog or a talking gorilla?
I'd have to say the talking gorilla.
Because at least I could explain to him that you're making me eat him.
-Oh. Somebody went to college.
-Yeah.
Wow. What is it? I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. My foot itches like crazy.
Oh. I'll get it.
I usually get to know a girl better before I let her spoon me.
Relax. It's not like we're forking.
When. When.
Thank you. Listen.
You seem to really know what to do with a utensil.
Would you like to go to dinner sometime?
-Yeah, I'd really like that.
-Yeah?
Yeah. And I promise I won't make you eat any remarkable animals.
I was thinking..
I'd kind of like to make a move.
But, you know, with the leg.
Oh, yeah.
Maybe a little help.
Okay.
Let me fix your pillow.
Cliff, you're so forward.
Oh, it was really nice meeting you.
Sid!
That's the first time I heard her voice.
I didn't care for it.
Oh, that's five, Ross.
Five women have had five babies.. and I have had no babies.
Why doesn't she want to come out?
You know what I think it is?
I think you made such a nice home for her.. over the last nine months that she just doesn't want to leave.
Oh, look at you making up crap for me.
-Oh, God.
-Okay. Okay.
Twenty-one hours. You're a hero.
Doctor, you gotta do something!
Get me drugs.. or light a fire up in there and just smoke it out!
Actually, I think you're ready to go to the delivery room.
What?
Ten centimeters.
You're about to become a mom.
Oh, my God. Okay.
Beat you, sucker! Oh, baby.
Is this the same spoon that was in my cast?
You know what?
This one is.
Oh, my God! That's the doctor who was in my room before.
Well, it must be one of those closed-circuit hospital channels.
No, no. That's a soap opera.
This is a very dramatic hospital.
I'm telling you, the guy from that show was here.. asking me all these weird questions.
Okay, Mr. Percocet.
I swear to you, that's the guy.
Okay, Cliff.
Do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?
What probably happened was you were watching this, you drifted off to sleep.. and you dreamt he was here.
Rachel's having her baby!
Which is of no interest to me as a neurologist. I..
That's him! You know him?
Wake up, Cliff!
What is going on?
Okay. Okay. I.. Okay.
I sent my friend, Joey, in here to find out stuff about you.
If it.. You know, if it helps, you came off great.
A lot better than I'm coming off right now.
I don't believe this. You got him to pretend he was a fake doctor?
Fake? Excuse me? Hello?
-You tried making me think I was crazy?
-That was wrong. I'm so sorry.
It's just that I liked you so much.
Can we just start over?
I don't think so.
If I may? You told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right?
Now, maybe it would help if you knew some personal stuff about her.
She was married to a gay ice dancer.
She gave birth to her brother's triplets.
Her twin sister used to do porn.
-We're trying to dial down the crazy.
-Right.
We don't really know each other, so it'd be easy to forget about this.. but there's something between us.
I don't know about you.. but that doesn't happen to me a lot.
-It doesn't happen to me either.
-Me neither!
-The baby! Rachel!
-Right, right!
Oh, I love this scene.
Okay, look. I gotta go too.
But.. What do you say?
Can we just have that dinner?
The triplets.
You and your brother didn't..?
No! No, they implanted embryos.
-Then dinner sounds great.
-Great! Okay.
All right, then I'll see you later.
Our friend's having a baby.
-Her own?
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.
No, she's really old-fashioned.
Push. Push. We're gonna push for five more seconds.
Five, four..
Three, two, one! Oh!
The next contraction should be in about 20 seconds.
-I can't push anymore!
-You're doing great.
Oh, God! Twenty seconds, my ass!
Here we go. Okay, keep pushing.
-Come on.
-Push. Wait.
-I see something.
-What, you do? You do? Oh, my God!
-Don't say "Oh, my God!" What?!
-What is that?
The baby's buttocks. She's breech.
-I thought she had two heads.
-Oh, God!
Is she gonna be okay?
-She's gonna be fine.
-Okay.
She's in a more difficult position, so you have to push harder now.
-Okay.
-That's it. Push. Push.
You're gonna have to push even harder.
-I'm sorry, I can't! I can't!
-Yes, you can. I know you can do this.
I had no idea.
Please, you do it for me!
Let's go. One more time.
One final push. Ready? One, two, three.
Good.
Keep pushing!
Are you okay?
You have no idea how much this hurts.
Keep going! Keep going!
Here we go!
She's upside down, but she's coming!
-Oh, God!
-Oh! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, she's here.
Oh, she's perfect.
Oh, wow! Oh, she's so tiny.
-Where'd she go?
-They're just wrapping her up.
Okay. Well, be careful with her, she's really tiny.
Here she is.
Oh, thanks for coming out of me.
I know. Oh.
She's looking at me. Hi. I know you.
-Do we have a name yet?
-No, not yet.
That's fine. For now we'll just call her Baby Girl Greene.
Oh, no. Baby Girl Geller-Greene.
Hello, Baby Girl.
-Can we come in?
-Oh, come on in.
-Oh, there she is.
-Oh, she's so beautiful.
Here.
Oh, my God. She's amazing.
Oh, I'm so glad you guys got drunk and had sex.
It's incredible. I mean, one minute she's inside you.. and then 47 hours later, here she is.
She looks so real.
You know what I mean.
She's this whole tiny little person.
And she already has eyelashes and knees and..
-What?
-Oh, no, no. It's okay.
For a second, I counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand. So we're good.
-Okay, my turn. My turn.
-Aunt Phoebe.
Oh, baby. Oh, you're so cute!
Oh, I could squeeze your little head.
I won't.
-Honey, what's the matter?
-Nothing. I just can't stop crying.
The doctor said it's normal, with all the hormones, plus you're sleep-deprived.
So. You guys are all sleep-deprived.
I don't see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet.
Oh, God.
-What's the matter now?
-I was reliving it.
Do you know what you're gonna call her yet?
Wait, it's not gonna be Baby Girl?
I thought that was so original.
Actually, we've narrowed it down to two names.
And you know what? I love them both.
So just pick one, and that'll be it.
Wow, okay. Everyone.. this is Isabella.
-Hi, Isabella!
-Hi.
What?
That's not her name.
I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel like an Isabella.
So then I guess Ferdinand is out.
-What was the other one?
-Delilah.
Oh, great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.
So I guess we're back to Baby Girl.
What are we gonna do?
-It's okay. You'll find a name.
-Easy for you to say.
You already know what your kids' names will be.
-You do?
-I had them picked out since I was 14.
Oh, no, it's gonna be named after some snack or baked good, isn't it?
-Well, tell us, what are they?
-Okay. If it's a boy, it's Daniel.
-And if it's a girl?
-I don't wanna say.
Oh, stop. Tell us.
We're not gonna want it.
Okay. It's Emma.
Emma.
See, I don't want it.
Do you have any other totally perfect names that you're not gonna use?
-Take it.
-What?
She's clearly an Emma.
Oh, honey, but you love that name.
Yeah, but I love you more.
Besides, nothing goes with Bing.
So I'm screwed.
Hi, Emma.
Yep, that's you.
You're our little Em.
What's that, honey?
What?
Oh, you want a little cousin?
You want a cousin right now?
Do I look like a giant sperm to all of you, or..?
-That was amazing.
-I know.
Hey, do you realize that we may have just changed our lives forever?
We may have started our family.
In nine months we could be here.. having our own baby.
And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
I love you so much.
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.
You wanna do it again?
This time just for us?
Probably.
Aaron Lipman-Guralnick would like to say hello to his future bride.
Wow, he kind of takes your breath away, doesn't he?
He's a keeper.
Look at the little munchkin.
Don't you worry. By the time you're old enough to date him.. he's gonna have a different nose.
-How you feeling?
-Oh, I'm fine.
I really admire what you're doing.
Just raising her all alone.
I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.
Sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?
Well, then he gets a divorce.
It's Ross.
I'm telling you, Rachel, listen to Janice.
They all say they're gonna be there, until they start their real family.
-That's never gonna happen with Ross.
-That's what I thought.
I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend a weekend with her father.. and little Miss New Boobs.
Really?
I hate to be the one to say it.. but, honey, you two are on your own.
Well, that's.. You know, that's..
We've been alone for the last
20 minutes and we're doing okay.
Maybe we won't be alone.
Because lately things have been happening between me and Ross.
And right before I went into labor, we had this kiss. You know?
So it might be the beginning of something.
-Hey, Janice.
-Oh, hi.
Who's this little guy?
-Aaron, your future son-in-law.
-Oh, no, no.
No.
-I'm gonna leave you three alone.
-Okay.
Man, you see the kid on that nose?
You know what I was thinking about?
That kiss before we left the apartment.
That was something, huh?
Yeah. Yeah, it really was.
But we.. We gotta be careful.
We.. You know, we can't let that happen again, you know?
Right.
-We don't want to go down that road.
-No. That's why I brought it up.
-They didn't have any sodas?
-Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
I was talking to this nurse.
Completely forgot.
And so it begins.
She in there?
Yeah. She's putting her down now.
That's her.
Isn't it amazing how every baby is beautiful?
Except that one.
What is this? A petting zoo?
Look. Look at Emma.
I can't decide who she looks like, you or Rachel.
Oh, what, are you kidding?
She's gorgeous! It's all Rachel.
I'm sorry. For the last time, why aren't you two together again?
No, I know.
Because you're not in that place.
Which would be fine, except you totally are.
It's complicated, okay?
Yeah, that's true.
You love her, you always have, you have a child together.
There's no right answer.
Look, we've been together.
Then apart. Then together, then apart.
And now we have a baby.
It's just, if we got together again and it didn't work out..
I could never do that to Emma.
I mean, she came into this world thinking everything.. Now me.
What, do they put something in the water here?
It's just, Rachel and I, we're doing really well now.
I know. If you try to make it more, you might wreck it.
-Yeah, exactly.
-Right.
Or you might get everything you've wanted since you were 15.
Hey.
I saw a woman breast-feeding twins at the same time.
It is like a freak show up here.
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.
What is it? Hey.
-Really, it's nothing. I'm..
-Rach, come on. What?
I've just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
What are you talking about?
What about Ross?
Please. He'll be with his real family.
The twins and little Miss New Boobs.
Okay, how long was I watching that woman?
I'm just saying that, you know.. someday Ross is gonna meet somebody.. and he's gonna have his own life.
Right?
Yeah, I guess so.
I just never thought I'd be raising this baby all by myself.
That's pretty dumb, huh?
Hey, you listen to me. Listen to me.
You are never, ever gonna be alone.
Okay? I promise
I won't let that happen.
Joey. Oh, sweetie, what would I do without you?
You don't have to worry about that, okay?
Could you grab me my other box of tissues?
-They're under Ross' coat.
-Sure.
Oh, my God!
Joey?
Oh, my God.
Okay.
MA'’’AM?
WHAT YOU LOOKING

YOUR MOTHER, YOUR KIDS.
YOUR NEIGHBORS

YOUR NAME WILL BE MUD.
YOU CAN'’’T GET AWAY

WEREN'’’T YOU THE MAN,

YOU KNOW WHAT

THE DEEP UNDERCURRENT
ALWAYS THERE.
AND THEN FRANCE

WORLD OPENING UP.
AND THEN THE WAR, SEEING
THE NAZIS IN ACTION.
SEEING THE ULTIMATE
CONSEQUENCES OF HATRED.
THEN BEING BLINDED,
CHANGING WORLDS AGAIN.
LUCY, I'’’VE GOT

PLEASE TRY

THE ONLY ONE HERE WITH
SENSE ENOUGH TO CARRY ON
AN INTELLIGENT
CONVERSATION.
THANK YOU.
I'’’M NOT PURE NEGRO.
MY MOTHER WAS FRENCH.
PART FRENCH.
MY FATHER...PART INDIAN.
SHE WAS PORTUGUESE, MY
MOTHER, A LOVELY WOMAN.
GEE, I WONDER WHAT KIND
OF BLOOD YOU GOT.
GIVE ME A MINUTE.
CHRISTOPHE NEVER
MAKES A MISTAKE.
I CAN ALWAYS TELL WHAT KIND
OF BLOOD A MAN'’’S GOT IN HIM.
[WHISPERS]
NO PLEASE.
I HAVE IT NOW.
PLEASE.
FLORIDA, NAVAJO.
YOUR MOTHER WAS FLORIDA,
NAVAJO, WASN'’’T SHE.
WELL, YOU'’’RE
PRETTY SHARP.
CHRISTOPHE NEVER MISSES.
I HATE US, FATHER.
LOOK AT THOSE PUNKS.
THOSE IGNORANT BASTARDS.
I'’’M NOT A PRIEST.
AH, YOU CAN'’’T
FOOL CHRISTOPHE.
I TELL YOU THE TRUTH.
I AM JUST OUT OF
THE PEN FOR 4 YEARS.
I FOUND MY WIFE
WITH ANOTHER GUY.
HAVE YOU TOLD
YOUR PRIEST ABOUT IT?
I HAVEN'’’T BEEN INSIDE
A CHURCH FOR 17 YEARS.
THAT IS THE ONLY PEACE.
IT'’’S NEVER TOO LATE
TO GO BACK.
NOW, I GOT TO SHOOT UP
A COUPLE OF GUYS.
DON'’’T WORRY, DADDY...
JUST WATCH OUT.
COME WITH ME, WE SHOOT
UP THESE BASTARDS
AND HAVE OURSELVES
A TIME, EH?
NO?
GOOD-BYE, FATHER.
GOOD-BYE.
[CHILDREN GIGGLING]
MR. HODGES.
MR. HORTON.
AFTERNOON.
WELL, HARD WORK.
IT'’’S ABOUT THE ROMANS.
I LIKE IT.
T.
I'’’LL LET YOU KEEP AT I
IT MAKES
ME KIND OF HOMESICK.
[PLAYS PIANO KEYS]
DO YOU PLAY?
OH, A LITTLE BIT, SURE.
PLAY SOMETHING, PLEASE.
NOBODY EVERY PLAYS.
YEAH, DO.
[PLAYING PIANO]
HOW LONG WILL
IT TAKE, DOCTOR?
NOW, YOU CAN'’’T RUSH THIS.
THERE'’’S DANGER
OF DAMAGE TO THE LIVER.
WE'’’LL KEEP A CLOSE CHECK
FOR SEVERAL WEEKS
TO SEE IF YOUR SYSTEM
CAN TAKE IT.
PUT YOUR CLOTHES ON.
I'’’M ANXIOUS TO GET STARTED
LOOK HERE, THIS IS A FAIRLY
UNPRECEDENTED PROCEDURE,
I'’’M SURE YOU REALIZE.
THE ONLY EXPERIENCE WE HAVE TO
GO ON ARE CASES OF VITILIGO.
T.
AND THEN IT'’’S JUST 2 OR 3
WHITE SPOTS WE'’’RE TRYING TO DO
THIS IS MORE COMPLEX.
I'’’LL GIVE YOU THESE
SHOTS ONCE A WEEK.
YOU CAN SUPPLEMENT THEM WITH
SUN LAMP TREATMENTS AT HOME.
I'’’M A LONG WAYS
AWAY FROM HOME.
YEAH, I KNOW.
INCIDENTALLY, I NEED
YOUR LOCAL ADDRESS.
IT'’’S 25 MAGNOLIA DRIVE
I'’’M USING
A FRIEND'’’S APARTMENT
WHILE HE'’’S OUT OF TOWN
HE HAS NO IDEA
WHAT I'’’M TRYING TO DO.
DOCTOR, WHERE CAN
I GET A SUN LAMP?
THEY SELL THEM
AT THE DRUGSTORE.
NOW, YOU USE IT
MORNING AND NIGHT.
10 MINUTES TO START WITH.
WE'’’LL INCREASE
THE DOSES LATER ON.
YOU TAKE THESE
PILLS TWICE A DAY.
IN A FEW WEEKS YOU'’’LL
BE BLACK ENOUGH YOUR MOTHER
WOULDN'’’T KNOW YOU.
HOW LONG WILL
THE COLOR LAST, DOCTOR?
A FEW MONTHS.
REMEMBER, YOU LEAVE OFF
THE PILLS, YOUR SKIN
WILL GRADUALLY GET LIGHTER.
YOU GOT BLUE EYES.
I CAN'’’T HELP YOU WITH THAT.
WELL, I'’’LL JUST HAVE T
O TAKE MY CHANCES ON THAT.
PERSONALLY, I DON'’’T THINK
YOU GONNA STICK IT.
IS THAT A SCIENTIFIC
PROGNOSIS, DOCTOR?
MY CONSIDERED MEDICAL OPINION,
YOU'’’RE GONNA END UP
WITH A KNIFE IN YOUR BACK.
WELL, THANK YOU, DOCTOR.
I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW
WHY YOU'’’RE DOING THIS.
WELL, THERE
ARE MANY REASONS.
ONE OF THEM IS THAT
I WAS BLINDED IN KOREA.
IT TOOK ME 6 YEARS
TO REGAIN MY SIGHT.
I DON'’’T KNOW QUITE HOW THAT
HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT,
BUT IT CERTAINLY DOES.
SEE, DOCTOR, WHEN
YOU'’’RE BLIND, THERE ARE
NO COLOR DIFFERENCES.
YOU LEARN TO SEE DIFFERENTLY
AND JUDGE DIFFERENTLY.
WHAT GOOD'’’S IT GONNA D
O WHATEVER YOU FIND OUT?
WELL, WHEN I WRITE IT, IT
MAY MAKE SOME PEOPLE THINK.
IT MIGHT, YOU KNOW,
JUST BECAUSE IT IS
SUCH A CRAZY IDEA.
I DON'’’T DISAGREE
WITH THAT.
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.
HOW DO YOU DO, MRS. INGRAM?
YOU SEEM TO KNOW
EVERYBODY AROUND HERE.
I NEVER FORGETS A FACE,
NOR A PAIR OF SHOES.
[CHUCKLES]
WELL, I SUPPOSE IT'’’S
GOOD FOR BUSINESS.
I'’’M A STRANGER
HERE MYSELF.
I DON'’’T KNOW A SOUL.
WELL, THERE'’’S LOTS TO TOUR.
WELL, I'’’M NOT
EXACTLY A TOURIST.
I'’’M A WRITER.
I'’’M DOING A SERIES
OF ARTICLES ON THE SOUTH
FOR A MAGAZINE.
WELL, AIN'’’T THAT GRAND.
I GUESS I'’’M
TRYING TO FIND OUT
ABOUT LIVING CONDITIONS,
RACE RELATIONS, CHANGES.
HOW ARE THINGS HERE
FOR THE NEGRO?
UH, THIS IS A GOOD TOWN.
WE AIN'’’T HAD NO
TROUBLE HERE, NO, SIR.
EVERYBODY TENDS
THEIR OWN BUSINESS.
THAT'’’S THE WAY TO GET ALONG,
TEND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.
OF COURSE.
NO, SIR, I CAN'’’T COMPLAIN.
I MAKES A LIVING JUST
TEND MY OWN LITTLE BUSINESS
RIGHT HERE, THAT'’’S ALL.
THANK YOU.
IT'’’S A NICE JOB.
KEEP THE CHANGE.
INDECENTLY,

I SUPPOSE YOU WILL REMEMBER
ME WHEN I COME BACK.
JUST TRY ME OUT, MR. HORTON.
YOU'’’D BE AMAZED.
HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

WELL, WHY DIDN'’’T

ANYTHING FAMILIAR
ABOUT THOSE SHOES?
WELL, YEAH.

THAT'’’S RIGHT.
YOU KNOW HIM?
I'’’M HIM.
AH, NAH.
YOU'’’RE KIDDING ME.
GO ON!
I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE
MAN WHO NEVER FORGOT A
PAIR OF SHOES OR A FACE.
HEH HEH HEH.
WELL, I'’’LL BE DARNED.
[LAUGHING]
I'’’M TRULY A SON OF A BITCH.
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE,
YOU CAN'’’T FOOL ME.
YOU'’’RE A COLORED MAN
AND YOU BEEN PASSING.
NO.
WELL, AIN'’’T THAT SOMETHING.
WELL, HOW DID YOU EVER--
THAT AIN'’’T SHOE BLACK?

WORK, BUT THEY DO.
WELL, I'’’LL BE.
WELL, WHAT'’’S THE BIG IDEA?
I WANT FIND OUT
WHAT IT'’’S LIKE TO BE
A NEGRO IN THE SOUTH.
YOU'’’RE KIDDING.

NO, IT'’’LL WEAR OFF
AS SOON AS I STOP
TAKING THE PILLS.
THE NAME IS JOHN.
JOHN, HUH?
I GUESS YOU'’’RE
REALLY SERIOUS.
YOU'’’RE THE ONE
PERSON WHO CAN HELP ME.
ME?
YES, YOU.
HOW COME?
WHAT CAN I DO?
BREAK ME IN.
NOW, AFTER THAT, I DON'’’T
WANT ANYBODY TO KNOW,
BUT YOU CAN TEACH ME
HOW TO--HOW TO ACT RIGHT.
IF I COULD JUST
HANG AROUND HERE.
I COULD LEARN TO
SHINE SHOES, MAYBE.
YOU, MR. HORTON?
JOHN, EXCUSE ME.
I WOULDN'’’T EXPECT
ANY MONEY FOR IT.
YOU WOULDN'’’T GET
RICH AROUND HERE,
BUT YOU COULD KEEP
YOUR TIPS IF YOU MADE ANY.
YOU SURE YOU
WANT TO DO THIS?
IT AIN'’’T SIMPLE, YOU KNOW.
I KNOW THAT.
WELL, WHY NOT?
LET'’’S GO.
FIRST, YOU GOTTA
LOOK DIFFERENT.
TAKE OFF YOUR COAT.
NOW TAKE YOUR TIE OFF.
ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVES.
YOU'’’RE STILL
TOO WELL DRESSED.
YOU GOT
TO LEARN HOW TO ACT.
YOU TALK
TOO EDUCATED IN ONE WAY
AND IN ANOTHER WAY
YOU GOT TO GET SMARTER.
AH, YOU'’’RE GONNA
BE A PROBLEM.
YOU THINK IT'’’S
EASY BEING COLORED?
FOR INSTANCE, MAN COMES UP
AND SAY, I'’’M HERE WRITING
AN ARTICLE ON RACE RELATIONS.
WHAT YOU SAY?
WELL, I SAY,
IF THERE'’’S ANYTHING
I CAN TELL YOU, SIR,
I'’’D BE ONLY
TOO GLAD TO HELP.

HA HA. I MUST HAVE
SOUNDED KIND OF STUPID.

OH, MAKE THEM BLACK.
HOW'’’S BUSINESS?

TO MAKE AN EASY BUCK, BOY?
DO YOU KNOW WHERE I CAN
GET A GAL AROUND HERE?
NOW, I'’’M NOT PARTICULAR,
SHE DON'’’T HAVE
TO BE AN EYE GAL, JUST
AS LONG AS SHE'’’S CLEAN.
THE BEST GIRLY SHOWS
IS OVER ON KING STREET.
YOU'’’LL FIND
JUST WHAT YOU'’’RE
LOOKING FOR THERE.
THAT'’’D BE 10 CENTS, SIR.
THEY CAN GET REAL DEMOCRATIC
WHEN THEY WANTS TO SIN.
THERE'’’S LOTS OF
ANGLES TO THIS BUSINESS.
IT AIN'’’T SIMPLE.
YOU GOT A LOT TO LEARN.
THIS MAN COMES IN
SAYING, HURRY UP, BOY,
I AIN'’’T GOT NO TIME.
WHAT YOU SAY?
THEN THIS OTHER MAN
COMES UP AND SAY,
DAMN NIGGERS, YOU CAN'’’
T TRUST NONE OF THEM.
WHAT YOU DO?
THERE'’’S
PLENTY OF ANGLES.
MAN, YOU GOT
SO MUCH TO LEARN.
YOU GOT TO ACT
DIFFERENT.
YOU GOT TO TALK DIFFERENT.
YOU EVEN GOT
TO THINK DIFFERENT.
I CAN SEE THAT.
ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANTS
TO KNOW, YOU JUST ASK ME.
WHAT ABOUT CHURCHES?
WHAT DENOMINATION?
CATHOLIC.
THERE'’’S A CATHOLIC CHURCH
2 BLOCKS OVER ON MERCER.
WHERE'’’S THE NEARES

WELL, NOW, MAN, WHAT YOU
WANT TO DO, PRAY OR SPRAY?
WELL, I GUESS IT DOESN'’

BOTH ONCE IN A WHILE.
YOU ARE SO RIGHT.
LORDY, YOU'’’RE SO RIGHT.
YOU STICK AROUND
THIS TOWN LONG ENOUGH
AND YOU'’’LL END UP DOING MOST O
YOUR PRAYING FOR A PLACE TO GO.
YOU CAN GO AT THE STATION
AND PLACES LIKE THAT, YOU
JUST HAVE TO LOCATE THEM.
BUT I TRAINED MYSELF
TO WAIT TILL I GETS HOME.
DON'’’T DRINK NO WATER.
OK, JOHN, I GUESS
I BETTER LEARN YOU HOW

HOW ABOUT YOU TAKE THEM
BRUSHES THERE

HIM FROM A PUP.
OH, DID YOU?
HE LIKES YOU.
[LAUGHING]
A DOG CAN TELL.
YOU KNOW
HE COULD TELL ABOUT
THAT HUSBAND OF MINE.
YOU THINK THAT'’’S CRAZY
WELL, HE NEVER WOULD
TAKE NOTHIN'’’ FROM BUD
AND I DON'’’T CARE
HOW HARD HE TRIED.
YOU WANNA COME IN?
U?
YOU'’’RE REALLY
TIED UP, AREN'’’T YO
YES.
DON'’’T BE SO SERIOUS.
YOU'’’RE TOO SERIOUS
ABOUT EVERYTHING.
HA HA HA.
I CAN'’’T HELP IT.
IT'’’S THE BOOK LEARNING
HA HA.
MM-HMM.
IT RUINS A FELLOW
FOR HAVING FUN.
I REALLY HAD FUN TONIGHT.
WELL, I GUESS I'’’LL
SEE YOU AROUND, HUH?
YES.
BOY, YOU SURE GIVE
THE GIRLS A HARD TIME.
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT.
THAT'’’LL BE A DOLLAR.
[STATIC]
[TURNS OFF RADIO]
YOU COMING ALONG?
OH, HI, STRETCH.
I'’’M PICKING UP
THE GIRLS.
IT'’’S GEORGIE'’
’S NIGHT OFF.
LET'’’S GO DOWN
TO RUBY'’’S.
OH, COUNT ME OUT.
I'’’VE DONE TOO MUCH
PARTYING LATELY.
STAY COOL.
SO LONG.
Man: HEY, NIGGER!
YOU STOP RIGHT THERE!
THERE AIN'’’T NO NICE
PEOPLE ON THIS STREET
YOU CAN HIDE BEHIND THERE.
HEY, WHY DO YOU KEEP
WALKING WHEN I TOLD YOU
TO STOP, NIGGER?
HELLO THERE, FUZZ HEAD.
HEY, NIGGER.
HEY, BURR HEAD!
THE WAY I SEE YOU...
WE'’’RE GONNA GET YOU.
EXCUSE ME, SIR,
I'’’M IN TROUBLE.
THERE'’’S 2 MEN
CHASING ME.
I DON'’’T KNOW WHAT THEY WANT,
BUT THEY'’’RE CHASING ME.
WHO IS CHASING YOU?
2 MEN, JUST AROUND
THE CORNER THERE.
I DON'’’T SEE NOBODY.
SIR, COULD YOU TELL ME WHERE
I COULD FIND THE POLICE?
I DON'’’T SEE
ANYONE CHASING YOU.
WELL, THEY'’’RE THERE.
BELIEVE ME. SIR?
[ENGINE STARTS]
AIN'’’T NO WAY YOU CAN GET
AWAY FROM US, FUZZ HEAD.
YOU MAY AS WELL
STOP RIGHT THERE.
[HORN BLASTING]
HEY, NIGGER!
YOU STOP RIGHT THERE!
THERE AIN'’’T NO NICE
PEOPLE ON THIS STREET YOU
CAN HIDE BEHIND THERE.
HEY, WHY DO YOU KEEP
WALKING WHEN I TOLD
YOU TO STOP, NIGGER?!
ALL RIGHT, BOYS,
THIS IS JUST WHAT
I'’’VE BEEN WAITING FOR!
NOW, YOU
COME ON IN HERE!
COME ON IN,
I'’’M WAITING FOR YA!
AH...I DON'’’T DIG YOU, DADDY.
WELL, YOU JUST COME IN
HERE AND YOU WILL!
COME ON!
I'’’M WAITIN'’’!
DEAR SAINT JUDE...
KEEP THEM AWAY FROM ME.
[CAT MEOWING]
Man: NIGGER!
WELL, JOHN.
OH, IT'’’S BEEN A LONG TIME.
COME ON IN.
I'’’D BE
KNOWING YOU ANYWHERE.
ANY TROUBLE?
NO, I PICKED HIM UP RIGHT
IN FRONT OF THE DRUGSTORE.
A COUPLE OF DIRTY
LOOKS IS ALL.
ALL YOU NEED NOW
ARE COLORED VISITORS.
YOU'’’RE QUITE
A SIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
I KNOW THE TROUBLE
YOU'’’VE BEEN HAVING
AND YOU SHOULDN'’’T
HAVE LET ME COME HERE.
NOW, YOU MAKE
YOURSELF AT HOME.
COME ON, SIT DOWN, JOHN.
YOU'’’LL NEVER KNOW HOW
WONDERFUL IT IS TO BE HERE.
THIS EXPERIENCE
HAS BEEN SO...
WHY DON'’’T
YOU TELL US LATER?
I'’’M GOING TO FIX
YOU SOME COLD CHICKEN.
SIT DOWN, JOHN.
COME ON.
WELL, ED,
HOW'’’S IT WITH YOU?
OH, DON'’’T WORRY ABOUT ME.
I'’’M BENT, BUT NOT BROKEN.
NEWSPAPER?
WELL, I WROTE WHAT
I THOUGHT WERE MY EDITORIALS,
NOW I GOT 3 SUBSCRIBERS
LEFT IN THE STATE.
YOU GOT ONE IN SHELBY,
TEXAS, YOU KNOW.
I GOT ENOUGH READERS OUT OF
THE STATE TO PAY THE PRINTERS.
YOU KNOW, IT'’’S GETTING KIND OF
HARD TO MAINTAIN THE ILLUSION
THAT THE SOUTH IS WAITING
FOR MY LIBERAL MESSAGE.
[CHUCKLES] BOURBON?
NO, NOTHING.
IT TAKES COURAGE, ED, AND I'’’VE
JUST ABOUT RUN OUT OF MINE.
YOU GOT GUTS.
ME? NO, I'’’M ONE OF
THE LAST GENUINE COWARDS
LEFT IN THIS WORLD.
I STOPPED BY
A RED LIGHT IN TRAFFIC
IN TOWN THE OTHER DAY,
THIS CHARACTER PULLS
UP ALONG SIDE ME AND YELLS,
AREN'’’T YOU ED SAUNDERS?
IF YOU GET OUT OF
THAT DAMN CAR, I'’’LL MOP UP
THE STREET WITH YA.
WELL, LUCKY FOR ME THE TRAFFIC
LIGHT CHANGED JUST THEN,
SO I SAYS, WELL,
YOU DON'’’T OFFER A MAN
MUCH INDUCEMENT, DO YA?
HA HA. YOU SHOULD
HAVE SEEN THE LOOK ON HIS
FACE WHEN I DROVE OFF.
ONE OF MY FORMER
READERS NO DOUBT.
COME ON AND EAT, JOHN.
I BET YOU HAD NO DINNER.
THANK YOU, MARY.
I HAD NO INTENTION
OF CALLING YOU,
BUT I COULDN'’’T STAND
IT ANOTHER MINUTE.
YOU KNOW I WANTED THIS THING
TO GO ON FOR SEVERAL MONTHS.
YOU DON'’’T HAVE TO EXPLAIN
A THING, JUST RELAX.
OH, I QUIT.
NOW, THAT'’’S WHAT'’’S B
EEN HAPPENING TO ME.
SEVERAL MONTHS AND HERE
IN THE SIXTH WEEK
I SIT AND I'’’M ASKING
YOU TO TAKE ME BACK.
I WANT TO ESCAPE.
I'’’M SAYING TAKE ME BAC
K TO THE WHITE WORLD.
YOU LOOK BEAT, JOHN.
WILL YOU TAKE ME IN?
MARY, SET OUT THE GUEST
TOWELS, THE BLACK ONES.
JOHN'’’S GONNA STAY THE NIGHT
AND LONGER, IF NECESSARY.
AND I THOUGHT I'’’D
SEEN EVERY FORM OF
HUMAN DEGRADATION BEFORE.
NOW, BOTH OF
YOU STOP TALKING.
COME AND ENJOY
YOUR FOOD.
COME ON, JOHN, SIT DOWN.
I'’’M SORRY.
[CRYING]
IT'’’S JUST TOO MUCH.
GET A GOOD NIGHT'’’S SLEEP
AND EVERYTHING WILL
LOOK DIFFERENT TOMORROW.
ED, DO YOU KNOW THAT
WHEN YOU'’’RE A BLACK MAN,
IT DOESN'’’T MATTER
WHO YOU ARE OR WHAT YOU ARE,
THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN
IS ALL THAT MATTERS.
I DON'’’T KNOW HOW THEY
STOOD IT ALL THEIR LIVES.
WELL, THAT'’’S SIMPLE,
THEY HAVE NO CHOICE.
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME
SOMETHING VERY HONESTLY,
YOUR NEWSPAPER
AND WHAT YOU AND MARY
HAVE SACRIFICED...
IS IT WORTH IT?
WORTH IT?
WELL, LET ME LIST
THE ADVANTAGES.
YOU WILL NO LONGER BE
BOTHERED BY INVITATIONS.
[CHUCKLING]
AND PARTIES AND TELEPHONE
CALLS FROM FRIENDS
AND OTHER DISTRACTIONS.
YOUR OWN RELATIVES
WON'’’T KNOW YOU.
YOUR LAWN WILL BE
REGULARLY IMPROVED BY,
OH...HANDSOME DECORATIONS,
BED SHEET PARADES,
AND OTHER ATTRACTIONS.
YOUR WIFE AND KID
WILL HAVE TO GET USED
TO ANONYMOUS PHONE CALLS,
BOMB SCARES, HATE LETTERS.
YOU MIGHT GET
INTERVIEWED ON TV.
OR WIN A BROTHERHOOD AWARD
AND WIN A FREE TRIP TO NEW YORK.
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING--
IF YOU DID NOTHING.
IF YOU GLAD-HANDED EVERYBODY
AND TRIED LIKE HELL
NOT TO OFFEND ONE
SINGLE PREJUDICED,
BIGOTED IDIOT IN TOWN,
THE WAY I DID FOR YEARS,
LET ME ASK YOU...
COULD YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT?
WELL...I SLEEP LIKE A ROCK,
FRIEND...AND MY
CONSCIOUS IS HEALTHY.
DON'’’T WORRY, JOHN.
YOU GOT WHAT IT TAKES.
I'’’LL SEE YOU DOWN
AT THE BOWLING ALLEY.
SEE YA.
MR. WILSON?
YES?
MY NAME IS HORTON.
YOUR SECRETARY SAID
I COULD FIND YOU HERE.
I'’’M ANSWERING YOUR
AD FOR OFFICE HELP.
I THINK I HAVE
THE QUALIFICATIONS YOU WANT.
I CAN TYPE, DO
ALL KINDS OF OFFICE WORK.
CAN YOU WRITE
A LETTER WITH NO MISTAKES?
YES, SIR, I'’’M
A COLLEGE GRADUATE.
I WORKED FOR
A MAGAZINE IN TEXAS.
I CAN GET REFERENCES
IF YOU LIKE.
NEVER MIND.
CAN YOU MAKE UP
A PAYROLL?
YES, SIR, I CAN.
WELL, YOU CAN'’’T GET
ANY JOB LIKE THAT HERE.
BUT YOUR AD--I KNOW YOU'’’D
BE SATISFIED WITH MY WORK.
I'’’LL WORK FOR LESS.
THAT WOULDN'’’T
MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.
WELL, I PROMISE YOU
I'’’LL DO A GOOD JOB.
WE DON'’’T WANT YOU PEOPLE.
BUT YOU DO
HAVE COLORED HERE.
I'’’LL LET YOU
IN ON SOMETHING.
WE'’’RE GRADUALLY
WEEDING YOU PEOPLE OUT.
WE'’’RE TAKING IT SLOW,
BUT WE'’’RE DOING IT.
WHOSE GONNA DO
YOUR DIRTY WORK FOR YOU?
THEY'’’LL ALWAYS BE A FEW JO
BS A WHITE MAN WOULDN'’’T WANT.
THAT WAS WHAT YOU WERE
LOOKING FOR, WASN'’’T IT?
NO, SIR.
HOW ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO LIVE?
THAT'’’S THE WHOLE POINT
I HEAR THERE'’’S PLENTY
OF JOBS FOR YOU
WITH THE BLEEDING
HEARTS UP NORTH.
S.
DON'’’T COME AROUND HERE
ASKING FOR WHITE MEN'’’S JOB
LIKE I TOLD HER, NOW, IF
ALL THE COLORED FOR ONE DAY
STOPPED EVERYTHING,
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN?
YOU SHOULD HAVE
SEEN HER FACE.
WHY, WILLA,
THAT'’’S IMPOSSIBLE,
IT COULD NEVER BE.
I SAID, DON'’’T BE
TOO SURE, MRS. PETERSON,
IT JUST MIGHT HAPPEN.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT,
THIS NATION WOULD GO DOWN.
NOTHING COULD
GO ON, THAT'’’S SURE.
YOU KNOW WHO'’’S THE
BACKBONE OF THIS NATION?
YOU KNOW IT'’’S
THE COLORED PEOPLE.
BEFORE THERE
WAS THE WHITE MAN,
THERE WAS COLORED.
OH, IT'’’S RIGHT
IN THE BIBLE.
ALL YOU GOT
TO DO IS READ IT.
YOU DIDN'’’T BEAR ME,
I BORE YOU.
DID YOU REALLY TELL HER
THAT, MRS. TOWNSEND?
I SURE DID.
I TOLD HER
WE WAS HERE FIRST.
AND YOU KNOW, THERE
NEVER WAS A COLORED CHILD
THAT WAS PUNY AND SICKLY.
NEVER ONE.
AH, WE BETTER OFF
THAN THEY IS BECAUSE
ALL OUR CHILDREN
ARE STRONG AND HEALTHY.
AND WHY?
THERE'’’S ONLY ONE ANSWE
R AND YOU KNOW IT.
THE GOOD LORD
PROTECTED MY CHILDREN.
HAVE SOME MORE PIE.
NO, THANK YOU,
BUT IT WAS DELICIOUS.
OH, GOOD CLEAN HOME
COOKING. HA HA.
BETTER YOU GET
IN ALL THOSE FANCY
EATING PLACES, HUH?
YOU EVER NOTICE
IN THE WHITE MAN'’’S
EATIN'’’ PLACES
WHO'’’S IN THE KITCHEN?
YOU WANT GOOD FOOD,
THE MAN KNOW HOW TO GET IT.
OH, I'’’VE BEEN IN A WHITE
KITCHEN ALL MY LIFE.
STILL DEALING
WITH THEM NOW.
AND YOU KNOW, I FEEL KIND
OF SORRY FOR THEM SEEING
HOW GOOD THE GOOD LORD
IS TO HIS COLORED CHILDREN.
WELL, I DON'’’T FEEL
SORRY FOR THEM AT ALL.
NOT AT ALL. I THINK
THEY'’’RE CRUEL AND VICIOUS.
AND THEY SEEM TO
HAVE A MILLION WAYS
OF MAKING YOU
FEEL LIKE NOTHING.
CHILD, AIN'’’T YOU
USED TO IT YET IN ALL
YOUR YEARS OF LIVING?
JUST A CUP
OF COFFEE PLEASE.
OK.
THANK YOU.
YOU SEEM LIKE A SMART MAN.
DID YOU EVER THINK THAT IF
ALL US COLORED JUST ONE DAY
STOP, STOP EVERYTHING,
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN?
THIS NATION WOULD GO DOWN.
WOULDN'’’T GO ON,
FOR SURE.
OPERATOR, I'’’D LIKE TO CALL
LONG DISTANCE PLEASE.
YES, SHELBY TEXAS.
LISTEN...
COLLECT CALL...
YOU READ IN THE NEWSPAPERS
HOW THE ARMY'’’S TAKING ALL
THE BOYS FROM THE SOUTH?
AND MOST OF THE WHITE BOYS
CAN'’’T READ OR WRITE AND
THE COLORED MOSTLY KNOW HOW.
AND WHY? BECAUSE THE WHITE
MAN'’’S SO BUSY KEEPING
HIS CHILDREN BOSSY MIND,
THEY AIN'’’T GOT
TIME FOR STUDYING.
AND WHEN THEY DOES
GET AROUND TO STUDYING,
THEY DON'’’T KNOW HOW.
JUST SITTING
THERE BOSSING MUCH.
Woman: HELLO?
JOHN.
JOHN.
OPERATOR, I WANT TO CANCEL
THAT CALL TO TEXAS.
I'’’M SORRY, I'’’VE
CHANGED MY MIND.
AIN'’’T NONE OF THEM WOMEN
WORTH MOPING OVER.
YOU TRUST IN THE LORD, THEN
YOU WILL LIKE A HELPING HAND.
[INDISTINCT]
FASCINATING THEORIES, TOO.
I ENJOY EATING HERE.
YOU'’’VE EATEN
HERE BEFORE?
OH, YES, YES.
GOD, THIS TOWN,
IT GETS ME DOWN.
I'’’M FROM UP NORTH DOING
RESEARCH ON MY PhD.
THIS IDIOTIC SEGREGATION,
WHAT A NUISANCE.
HEY, WHAT DO YOU
DO HERE AT NIGHT
AFTER YOU'’’VE SEEN
THE ONE MOVIE IN TOWN, HUH?
N?
NOT MUCH.
WHAT'’’S YOUR RESEARCH O
THE URBANIZATION
OF RURAL POPULATIONS.
IT WILL BE
A CROSS-CULTURAL STUDY,
COMPARISON OF SOUTHERN WHITES,
SOUTHERN NEGROES,
AND PUERTO RICANS.
IF THAT MEANS
ANYTHING TO YA.
I MANAGED TO FOLLOW YOU.
MRS. TOWNSEND!
HEY, LISTEN,
I'’’D LIKE TO TALK
TO YOU SOME MORE.
WHY? I'’’M NOT
A RURAL NEGRO.
IN FACT, I'’’VE GOT
TO GET GOING.
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.
IT ISN'’’T EVERY DAY
I GET A CHANCE
TO TALK TO
AN INTELLIGENT MAN LIKE YOU.
I'’’M CHARLES MAYNARD,
BY THE WAY.
JOHN HORTON.
NOW, MRS. TOWNSEND, WHAT
DO I OWE YOU PLEASE?
THAT'’’LL BE A $1.75
HERE YOU ARE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BYE.
HERE YOU ARE. BYE.
LISTEN, I'’’VE GOT AN IDEA.
I'’’M STAYING AT A MOTEL
DOWN THE STREET.
WHY DON'’’T YOU JUST COME
ON OVER THERE FOR A WHILE?
WE CAN HAVE
A DRINK AND TALK.
I BET THERE'’’S A LOT
I CAN LEARN FROM YOU.
T.
WELL, MR. MAYNARD,
I DON'’’T KNOW ABOUT THA
CALL ME CHARLIE.
WELL, ALL RIGHT,
CHARLIE, ALL RIGHT.
COME ON, LET'’’S GO.
COME BACK AND SEE US.
HOW ABOUT ANOTHER, HUH?
NO, THANK YOU.
YOU'’’RE AN ODD ONE,
AREN'’’T YA?
DON'’’T YOU LIKE
YOUR LIQUOR?
USUALLY, YOU PEOPLE
DON'’’T HAVE THE SAME
INHIBITIONS THAT WE DO.
WE'’’RE ALL BASICALLY PURE.
YOU KNOW, WE TRY
AND GIVE OUR CHILDREN
A DECENT SET OF VALUES,
GOOD EDUCATION.
OUR MINISTERS PREACH SIN
AND HELL THE SAME AS YOURS.
OH, SURE, SURE, SURE.
STILL, I UNDERSTAND
YOU PEOPLE HAVE MORE
REALISTIC VIEWS
OF SEX THAN WE DO.
YOU DON'’’T GET
SO DAMN MANY CONFLICTS.
THAT'’’S A FACT.
THERE'’’S NO REAL
DIFFERENCE, MR. MAYNARD.
NO REAL DIFFERENCE AT ALL.
THANK YOU FOR THE DRINKS.
I GOT TO BE GOING.
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.
WE'’’RE JUST GETTING STARTED.
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, JOHN,
I HAVE A SCIENTIFIC INTEREST.
I'’’M TRYING TO WRITE
AN HONEST THESIS.
COME ON, SIT DOWN,
PLEASE. COME ON.
TELL ME, WILL YOU, WHAT
YOUR RESEARCH METHODS ARE?
DO YOU USE OPEN-END
QUESTIONS, SUBJECTIVE TESTS?
ARE YOU IN THE FIELD
OR SOMETHING?
I MANAGE TO READ
A BOOK NOW AND THEN.
AND YOU DON'’’T THINK
THERE'’’S ANY DIFFERENCE?
THE POINT IS, NEGROES REGARD
SEX AS A TOTAL EXPERIENCE.
ANYTHING THAT
MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD IS
MORALLY RIGHT FOR YOU.
I WISH
I COULD LIVE THAT WAY.
I CANNOT AGREE THAT
THERE IS ANY DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN OUR
MORALITY AND YOURS.
WELL, HOW CAN
YOU DEBATE THAT?
NOW, IF YOU'’’D READ
THE BERKLEY STUDY.
THAT'’’S ONE OF THE BOOKS
I MANAGED TO GET THROUGH.
WELL, THEN, WHAT ABOUT
THE LOW VALUE PLACED
ON VIRGINITY?
THE LARGE NUMBER
OF ILLEGITIMATE BIRTHS,
THE GENERAL INSTABILITY
OF THE NEGRO FAMILY.
THESE ARE ALL FACTS, JOHN.
THAT MAY BE, BUT I CONTEND
THAT IT'’’S DUE TO ENVIRONMENT
AND NOT TO
INHERENT DIFFERENCES.
IF YOU WILL JUST COMPARE
THE SEXUAL ATTITUDES
OF LOW-INCOME WHITES WITH
THOSE OF LOW-INCOME NEGROES,
I THINK YOU'’’LL FIND
A DEFINITE CORRELATION.
WELL, THAT'’’S EXACTLY
THE KIND OF COMPARISON
I'’’M INTERESTED IN.
THE TROUBLE IS
I USUALLY CAN'’’T FIND
ANY OF YOU
PEOPLE TO TALK TO.
HALF THE TIME
ALL THEY DO "YES, SIR"
YOU TO DEATH
AND THE REST OF THE TIME
THEY CAN'’’T EVEN GET OU
T A STRAIGHT SENTENCE.
THAT'’’S BECAUSE YOU
QUESTION LOW-INCOME GROUPS
AND IGNORANT SLOBS LIKE ME.
OH! HA HA! YOU JUST
GOT TO STICK AROUND AND
ANSWER MY QUESTIONS.
PROFESSOR,
YOU ARE A FINE--HEY,
HEY, HAVE A DRINK.
NO, THANK YOU,
I'’’VE HAD ENOUGH.
ALL RIGHT.
NOW, THE BERKLEY STUDY
DEFINITELY PROVES THAT THE NEGRO
HAS MORE FREQUENT SEX CONTACTS,
MORE FREQUENT ORGASMS.
I'’’VE READ IT,
I TOLD YOU.
WELL, THEN.
YOU CAN VERY EASILY
ARGUE ABOUT THE SAMPLING
TECHNIQUES.
YOU CAN QUESTION
THE VERACITY
OF THE INFORMERS.
ALL RIGHT, FORGET
ABOUT THE BERKLEY STUDY.
JUST TELL ME HOW YOU
LIKE TO DO IT, JOHN.
HOW OFTEN, WITH
THE SAME DAME OR WHAT, HUH?
YOU'’’VE HAD
TOO MUCH TO DRINK.
OH, COME ON.
THIS IS MAN TO MAN.
IT'’’S JUST BETWEEN US, JOHN.
I HAVE A SCIENTIFIC INTEREST.
FOR INSTANCE,
IT'’’S A SCIENTIFIC FACT
THAT THE NEGROES'’’ ORGANS
ARE LARGER, HUH?
THAT'’’S ABSOLUTE NONSENSE.
PROVE IT TO ME, JOHN.
HEY, WE'’’RE ABOUT THE SAME AGE.
COME ON.
OH, YOU FILTHY DRUNK.
YOU THINK YOU CAN SAY
ANYTHING TO A MAN
JUST BECAUSE
HIS SKIN IS BLACK.
YOU'’’RE SO SCIENTIFIC!
WAIT A MINUTE!
DON'’’T!
YOU'’’RE JUST SCUM!
OH! LET ME GO!
PLEASE!
[GASPS]
I'’’M NO QUEER.
HONEST, I'’’M NO QUEER.
OH, FATHER, MAY I TALK
TO YOU SOME MORE PLEASE?
COME WITH ME.
HAVE A SEAT.
FATHER...
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY
TO YOU MAY SOUND
VERY STRANGE.
AS I CONFESSED
TO YOU JUST NOW, I DID
TRY TO KILL A MAN.
IN PROVOCATION,
INFLUENCE OF DRINK,
BUT THERE'’’S MORE
TO IT, MUCH MORE.
DO YOU WISH TO
CONFESS AGAIN, MY SON?
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY
I DON'’’T THINK PROPERLY
BELONGS IN CONFESSION.
YOU SEE,
I'’’M A WHITE MAN.
I CHANGED THE COLOR OF
MY SKIN AND FOR 3 MONTHS
NOW I'’’VE BEEN TRAVELIN
G THROUGH THE SOUTH.
I'’’M A WRITER.
WELL, IF YOU
DON'’’T BELIEVE ME,
I CAN SHOW YOU
MY DRIVER'’’S LICENSE.
YOU WOULD NOT LIE TO ME.
NO.
IT'’’S JUST THAT IT'’’S SUCH
AN EXTRAORDINARY SITUATION
AND I'’’M NEVER SURE HOW
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO REACT.
EVER SINCE I STARTED,
SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO ME
THAT I HADN'’’T FORESEEN...
AND IT HORRIFIES ME.
IT'’’S AS THOUGH
I WAS NO LONGER MYSELF.
I LOOK LIKE A STRANGER,
I LIVE LIKE A STRANGER.
NOW, I'’’M BEGINNING TO
FEEL LIKE A STRANGER.
IT'’’S AS THOUGH I'’’VE
LOST MY IMMORTAL SOUL.
YOU CANNOT LOSE
YOUR IMMORTAL SOUL.
THE SOUL IS OF GOD
AND RETURNS TO GOD.
YOU ARE IN A STATE OF GRACE
HAVING MADE YOUR CONFESSION.
YOU MUST PRAY
FOR PEACE OF MIND.
WHAT YOU HAVE LOST
IS YOUR PRIDE OF SELF.
EVERYTHING I'’’VE DONE
I'’’VE DONE FOR THE SAKE
OF BROTHERHOOD.
HOW COULD
SELF ENTER INTO IT?
ON THIS JOURNEY,
YOUR GOAL WAS...
TO SEE HOW IT FELT TO BE
A NEGRO IN THE SOUTH.
FATHER, [INDISTINCT]
WORDS, "TO PREPARE A NEW
AGE OF THE WORLD.
MARTYRS TO THE LOVE
OF NEIGHBOR MAY
FIRST BE NECESSARY."
THOSE WORDS WERE
LIKE A COMMAND TO ME
WHEN I STARTED OUT.
BUT NOW...NOW I FIND
MYSELF ACTING LIKE
AN INFERIOR
COLORED MAN FILLED
WITH ANGER AND HATRED.
AN INFERIOR COLORED MAN?
YEAH.
THAT, TOO, HAS HAPPENED.
I'’’M FILLED
WITH PREJUDICE, FATHER.
IT'’’S LIKE A POISON.
I THOUGHT I'’’D PURGED
MYSELF, BUT I HAD NOT.
SON, ARE YOU SO
CERTAIN THIS SINGULAR ACT
IS REQUIRED OF YOU?
ALL OF US AT ONE TIME
OR ANOTHER HAVE HAD TO WRESTLE
WITH THIS QUESTION,
ESPECIALLY HERE IN THE SOUTH.
I HAVE WORKED
WITH BOTH RACES
IN THIS COMMUNITY
FOR SOME 30 YEARS.
IT'’’S TOUGH WORK.
I SOMETIMES WONDER IF IT
ADDS UP TO ANYTHING AT ALL.
YOU'’’RE RIGHT, FATHER.
IT WAS PRIOR TO SELF...
AND THE DESIRE
FOR THE SINGULAR ACT.
FOR THE BEST OF MOTIVES,
HOWEVER...
ONE MUST HAVE LARGE DOSES
OF FAITH AND PATIENCE
TO DO THE SMALL, ORDINARY
JOBS THAT MUST BE DONE.
WHEN YOU GO HOME, MY SON,
YOU WILL BE STRONGER
BECAUSE OF THE ORDEAL
YOU HAVE PASSED THROUGH.
I WILL REMEMBER YOU
IN MY PRAYERS.
THANK YOU, FATHER.
GOD BLESS YOU, MY SON.
[SEAGULLS CRYING]
YOU'’’RE STEPPING ON MY PORCH.
OH, I'’’M SORRY I THOUGH
T THAT WAS YOUR GARDEN
AND I COULD STAND
IN YOUR GARDEN.
THE GARDEN'’’S BACK HERE.
CAN'’’T YOU SEE?
OH. I CAN SEE NOW.
SAY, WOULD YOU LIKE TO
DECORATE YOUR CASTLE
WITH THESE?
OK. YOU HELP ME.
I SURE WILL.
Woman: LORETTA!
LORETTA, COME HERE!
LORETTA, COME HERE IMMEDIATELY!
I'’’M TALKING TO MY FRIEND.
YOU BETTER GO, LORETTA.
OH, ALL RIGHT.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, HONEY?
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'’’RE ALL RIGHT?
[SEAGULLS CRYING]
EXCUSE ME.
WHEN IS THE NEXT BUS
FOR MEDFORD, PLEASE?
ONE LEAVES IN 10 MINUTES.
ANOTHER AT 9:30.
I'’’D LIKE A ONE-WAY
TICKET, IF YOU WILL.
IT'’’LL BE A $1.60.
FINE.
I CAN'’’T CHANGE THAT.
WELL, I'’’M SORRY,
THAT'’’S ALL I HAVE.
I'’’D LIKE A TICKET
TO MEDFORD, PLEASE.
I CAN'’’T CHANGE
THAT BIG A BILL.
I TOLD YOU SO.
NOW, THERE MUST BE SOMEONE
IN THIS GREAT BIG BUS SYSTEM
WHO CAN CHANGE
A $10.00 BILL.
PERHAPS THE MANAGER.
[CHANGE CLINKS]
LADY, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'’’VE GOT?
WE CALL IT THE HATE STARE.
AND I MUST SAY YOU'’’VE GOT
THE BEST ONE I EVER DID SEE.
I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU.
MIND IF I SIT DOWN?
OH, SURE, GO AHEAD.
THANK YOU.
THIS IS A NICE PLACE.
NOBODY BOTHER YOU.
INTERSTATE COMMERCE.
OH, THE NAME'’’S NEWCOMB
FRANK NEWCOMB.
MY BOY THOMAS IS
STUDYING TO BE A TEACHER
OVER AT THE SCHOOL.
I DON'’’T KNOW IF
HE GONNA MAKE IT THOUGH
'’’CAUSE HE'’’S BEEN
IN JAIL TWICE FOR
HIS INTEGRATING WORK.
THE SHERIFF PUT THE DOGS
ON HIM RIGHT HERE IN TOWN.
THAT'’’S TERRIBLE.
JOHN HORTON.
IT'’’S A PLEASURE
TO KNOW YOU, MR. NEWCOMB.
YOU MUST BE
PROUD OF YOUR BOY.
OH, I SURE AM.
YOU GONNA BE
IN TOWN LONG, MR.
HORTON?
OH, 3 OR 4 DAYS, I GUESS.
HEY, YOU WOULDN'’’T KNOW OF
A PLACE THAT I COULD STAY?
WELL, THERE'’’S
A HOTEL IN TOWN.
OH. TERRIBLE PLACE.
IT'’’S FULL OF GAMBLING
AND WHORING.
COST YOU AN ARM
AND A LEG, TOO.
ARE YOU A NICE MAN,
MR. HORTON?
WELL, MY WIFE THINKS SO.
WELL...YOU CAN STAY
WITH ME IF YOU LIKE.
THAT IS, IF YOU DON'’’T
MIND SHARING A BED.
I WOULDN'’’T WANT
TO PUT YOU OUT.
OHH. I'’’M JUST
A GABBY OLD MAN.
I LIKE COMPANY.
COME ON.
[CHUCKLING]
I SEE YOU'’’VE
GOT A TYPEWRITER.
JOHN, YOU WANT
TO WRITE A LETTER?
HELP YOURSELF.
WELL, I'’’D APPRECIATE
USING IT LATER.
NOT TONIGHT.
SEE, MR. NEWCOMB,
I'’’M DOING A SERIES OF
ARTICLES FOR A MAGAZINE.
OH.
ARE YOU A REPORTER?
SORT OF.
I'’’D LIKE TO TALK
TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
IN THE DEMONSTRATIONS HERE
IN TOWN, DO A STORY ON THEM.
I WONDER IF YOU'’’D
INTRODUCE ME TO THEM.
WELL, I SUPPOSE SO.
OH, COME ON.
THERE'’’S PLENTY OF ROOM.
THANK YOU.
YOU EVER FIGURE HOW COME GOD
TELL US THAT WE GOT TO LOVE
THE WHITE MAN,
NO IFS, ANDS, OR BUTS ABOUT IT?
NOW, SUPPOSE WHEN WE STARTED
INTEGRATING IN THIS TOWN,
THEN WE DECIDED
TO FIGHT WITH THE MAN,
AND WENT OUT TO BUY A GUN...
WHY, NO COLORED MAN
IN THIS SECTION COULD BUY IT.
EVEN A BULLET FOR HUNTIN'’’,
MUCH LESS A GUN.
THE LORD KNOW
WHAT HE DOIN'’’.
AND THEN HE'’’D TELL
US, TO GET INTEGRATION,
WE GOT TO LOVE THAT MAN.
[SIGHS]
BESIDES...
IF WE WAS
TO HATE THE WHITE MAN...
THEN WE'’’D BE DRAGGED DOWN
TO HIS LEVEL...
AND OUR RACE...
WOULD BE RUINED FOR SURE.
AND THEN THE SHERIFF SAYS
TO THIS LITTLE COLORED BOY,
NIGGER, DON'’’T LET THE SUN
SHINE ON YOU IN THIS TOWN.
AND THAT LITTLE COLORED BOY
SPITS RIGHT IN HIS FACE.
HA HA! AND THEN--
AND THEN HE SAYS,
ALL WHO'’’S GONNA
DISPERSE, DISPERSE!
AND THEN REVEREND INGALL--
REVEREND INGALL STARTED--
OH, TELL HIM ABOUT
MRS. TOMKINS, PAUL.
OH, YEAH.
WELL, SHE'’’S
ABOUT 97 YEARS OLD,
AND SHE'’’S SPRY
AS A CHICKEN AND SHE--
AND SHE WALKED RIGHT UP
TO THE SHERIFF AND SHE SAYS,
IN THAT LITTLE SQUEAKY
WAY OF HERS, SHERIFF,
I WANT TO DISPERSE IN
THE WORSE WAY, BUT I CAN'’’T
FIGURE OUT WHICH WAY YOU
ALL WANTS ME TO DISPERSE
WITH ALL THEM POLICES
AND THEM DOGS AROUND.
AND THE SHERIFF SHOWED HER
WHICH WAY AND SHE THANKED
HIM VERY POLITELY
AND WALKED RIGHT UP TO
THE HEAD OF THE LINE.
RIGHT IN FRONT
OF REVEREND INGALLS.
HA! AND YOU KNOW,
SHE WAS THE FIRST ONE
THEY PUT ON THE
WAGON AND THE FIRST ONE
THEY LET OUT
'’’CAUSE THEY WAS
AFRAID SHE WAS GONNA
DIE ON '’’EM IN JAIL.
OH, SEDA TOMKINS
AIN'’’T GONNA NEVER DIE
UNTIL SHE SEES FREEDOM.
[TYPEWRITER CLACKING]
GOOD MORNING, TOM.
THAT'’’S NOT NECESSARY.
WELL, I'’’M A PRO.
I WORKED IN A SHOE SHINE
STAND A WHILE BACK.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE A REPORTER.

STUFF AND FACTUAL,
BUT, BELIEVE ME,
THAT'’’S ALL I COULD DO.
ONE SINGLE WHITE MAN
IN EACH COUNTY WILLING
TO GIVE UP HIS
LIFE FOR JUSTICE.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT A
DIFFERENCE THAT WOULD MAKE?
THE WHITE SOUTHERNER
HAS TO KNOW WHAT IT'’’S
LIKE TO BE A NEGRO.
REALLY KNOW.
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT IT'’’S LIKE, HUH?
AFTER 10 WEEKS OR 3 MONTHS
OR WHATEVER IT IS, YOU KNOW!
NO, I DON'’’T KNOW.
AND I CAN NEVER KNOW ANY
MORE THAN YOU CAN KNOW
WHAT IT'’’S LIKE
TO BE INSIDE MY SKIN.
TOM, THE POINT IS THAT
WE GOT TO KEEP TRYING.
MR. HORTON...THAT
BLACKNESS ON YOUR FACE,

YOU WIPE THAT BLACKNESS OFF...
THEY'’’LL TREAT YOU LIKE A MAN.
WE BLACK IN
A WHITE MAN'’’S COUNTRY.
THERE AIN'’’T NOTHIN'’’
WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.
IF YOU DON'’’T UNDERSTAND THAT,
YOU DON'’’T UNDERSTAND NOTHING.
I KNOW HOW TOM FEELS.
I KNOW HOW COME

TOM KNOW THOUGH THAT,
THAT AIN'’’T NO WAY TO TALK.
HE BEEN TAUGHT DIFFERENT.

WHAT WE WANT WE'’’LL GET
BY OUR OWN STRENGTH.
I'’’M DOING THIS FOR MYSELF.
I WANT THE SOUTH TO BE A FIT
PLACE FOR MY CHILDREN TO LIVE.
CAN'’’T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
THEY'’’LL BE AN

Do you have a reservation?
Welcome.
'Name: Junha Suh'
Profession?
Profession.
Lawyer.
I'm tired, too. Let's help each other out, okay?
It's true. He's really a lawyer.
You assholes... Listen!
Is your living room, huh? Who are you kidding?
Oh, still hard at work...
The Gyu-sik Hwang case has been dropped.
-What was that all about?
-The bastard perjured himself.
Well, there's an endless list of bastards we'd like to beat up.
But did you go to beat him up?
You look terrible.
Here's the case summary for CEO Choi of the Taejin Group. Courthouse 514.
-Hey, did you eat yet?
-Yes.
This is the Ji-man Lee, biker case.
Courthouse 302.
And the settlement?
He's bringing it over today.
-lf we've got everything, shall we go?
-Sure.
Defendant, please stand.
Do you have anything to say?
I'm deeply remorseful for my crime.
Forgive me this once. I won't do things like this again and work hard.
Sentencing will be in 3 weeks, on Sept. 22nd at 2 PM. Next.
Case no. 3215.
Case no. 3215, defendant ll-man Choi, not in custody.
Defendant ll-man Choi.
Where is your client?
Well...he's not here yet.
-What do you want to do?
-We'll postpone.
Next court date in three weeks.
Sept. 22nd, 3 PM. Next.
Case no. 1 817.
Lawyer Suh.
I told you before, those sneakers...
It's not a big problem but considering it's a courtroom...
Let's pay attention to our attire.
What time is it now? Didn't I tell you to wear your school uniform?
Why are you hitting me? I'm not the one.
You're not?
You all look the same to me.
Can't tell one brat from another.
And the settlement?
Here.
But do I really have to wear this?
What are you good for?
You have to look decent for the judge at least. Get changed and go in.
I've got damn egg on my face.
He should've had his secretary call at least.
What the hell is this?
You can't even make sure the client shows up.
-Hey? Aren't you coming?
-I have one more case.
Another court-appointed one?
Last spring, you entered a model airplane contest and won the bronze.
You also entered a writing contest and your book review almost won.
But since it was an erotic novel, you were disqualified.
-People felt bad, correct?
-Yes.
You didn't plan on stealing the motorcycle.
You just wanted to ride it and then return it, correct?
Yes.
You're very sorry about this and can swear never to speed again, correct?
Now answer in a loud voice.
-Yes!
-Nothing further.
This is a settlement the victim agreed upon on Aug. 31st.
Defendant, please stand.
Do you have anything to say?
First, I'm very sorry to have caused trouble in this quiet society.
I'll live quietly from now on.
Sentencing will be held on
Sept. 27th, at 1 0 AM. Next.
Defendant, wait. You're suspended right now, aren't you?
Yes.
Do you always wear your school uniform?
No-no...
Then who told you to wear it?
I just...wore it.
Do you know that lying before the court is perjury?
Uh...um, my lawyer told me to.
When did I tell him to wear his school uniform?
As long as we win, why does it matter?
Oh, I forgot to tell you, a court-appointed case came in last night.
It's in the same case batch as the
Taejin Group so that must be why.
What's the case?
An appeal for a murder case.
It got the death penalty.
Might not be a bad idea to skip this one. Plus, it's an open-n-shut case.
Present!
What? You call them students?
You saw him in his school uniform.
That was like a sausage stuffed with pasta.
Wow, for a court-appointed case, the reward's pretty good.
I'm Shin-young Lee's court appointed lawyer for her appeal.
Lawyer visiting.
She won't see you.
Excuse me?
-2234, she refuses visitation.
-What's the reason?
No clue. She probably won't see you in the future.
The first lawyer couldn't meet with her either.
-You have a witness today?
-ln-suk Hong. -ln-suk Hong?
-Whose bag is this?
-Lawyer Kang's.
So he got his clerk to bring it over.
He speaks slow but acts fast.
Got be quick in one way f you want to eat.
Case no. 1 627.
Case no. 1 627, Defendant Shin-young Lee.
Prosecution, begin your case.
On Feb. 6, 2000, the defendant injected her husband, Jong-hoon Sung, with drugs to render him helpless.
With a scalpel, the murder weapon, she cut him in 4 places, hitting arteries and veins.
Arrested on the scene, the court sentenced her to death on June 13th.
Proceed.
Her prints on the murder weapon, the diazepam found in the victim's body, no evidence of intrusion, and pre-meditation,
The scientific evidence is clear.
Given that the defendant remained silent throughout the investigation and the first trial,
I have no further questions.
Defense, cross examination.
You stood before this court on Feb.
6th for the murder of Jong-hoon Sung, correct?
First, about the pre-meditation the prosecution is claiming...
Your honor...
I don't want...this trial.
-I want it to stop.
-Defendant!
You don't have the right to refuse this trial.
-Why not?
-Shin-young Lee.
Stop...this trial.
Shin-young Lee.
-I request a postponement.
-I said, enough!
We'll take a short recess.
I'll see both councils in my chambers.
I never asked for another trial.
Just give me the death penalty.
Let me go! Let go!
Let me just die.
Why are you doing this to me? et go!
Han-soo, take a picture of the tub.
Careful, careful...
And the murder weapon?
A scalpel was found on the bathroom floor.
Now, you remember where you cut him first, right?
Do it just the way you did it.
-Shin-young Lee cannot see anyone.
-Excuse me?
She's been put into solitary.
-When will she get out?
-I don't know.
Where are you two going, stuck gether like a pair of socks?
The verdict for Lawyer Choi's first case is in.
So you're going to the courthouse?
Yes.
No, no, no. A lawyer should never go for the verdict.
What do you mean?
There's nothing for a lawyer to do.
Also, if you lose, they'll hang you by your collar.
And they'll tear you apart, asking for their money back.
Even so, isn't it our duty to explain the verdict to our client?
I'm not telling you this for nothing.
I'll see you later.
This is the research application
I told you about.
You've made the right choice.
Wrap up the Taejin case real nice, study abroad for about two years...
Man, I might end up working for you!
-When do I leave?
-ln November.
You have about a month or two.
I'd start getting ready.
Hello? Jun-ha Suh.
She's claustrophobic.
We found her during the morning round.
She's been moved to the hospital.
Is Shin-young Lee...
What are you doing?
-Let go! Let me go!
-Call the doctor, quick!
-Let go!
-Why are you doing this!
I wanna die...really...
-Excuse me.
-Please wait outside.
Oh, they must've been beaten bad.
Did you...go with them?
How strange...
All she needs to do is to wait.
And they'll kill her anyway.
What's her big rush?
Some people would stick to a lawyer's shadow like a magnet to bail them out.
She barely has a chance even if she did that.
You know what?
"l want to die..." sounds more desperate than "l want to live..."
This is the hotel where
CEO Choi is. Go see him.
Everyone has a secret or two in their closet.
He's not the nicest guy but you know...
The paperwork looks good.
It should. When you get to my age, you pretty much have life figured out.
Law...it's a funny thing.
The punishment fits the crime? No.
You get as much as the laws you've broken.
What are you going to do about the unpaid wages?
Dogs can't help but chase after cats.
When a company goes bankrupt, it is the labor unions that bark for money.
They're all the same.
Is that so?
Don't be rash. Sit!
There. Let's talk it over.
There are three types of people in this world.
Those who make money like madmen and spend graciously.
Those who make money like madmen and spend like the dogs they are.
And there are those who make money like madmen but spend like bastards.
Like you, you bastard.
What happened?
CEO Choi gave us the boot.
Why?
Lawyer Suh must've thrown a fit.
You have proof? Show me the holes and I'll drop him!
That's not what I'm talking about!
Give me a name of someone who pays that much and isn't a thief!
Apologize and then leave the case!
What's with the look?
What's really up with you?
What if this affects your research candidacy?
Lie low this once and do the case.
It could've done wonders for your career.
Luckily, the arteries are fine.
She can be moved back to the prison tomorrow.
Who're you?
I'm Jun-ha Suh, lawyer for the Shin-young Lee case.
Was it 3 years ago she came last...
Since then, I never called.
When she came that time, her husband was furious and dragged her away.
Excuse me? Dragged?
It was obvious. The scales were so tipped against her in the marriage.
My first just had her baby...
Shin-young's things are still here.
Oh, I just fed the little sucker...
The victim, Jong-hoon Sung's parents died in a car accident last fall.
Shin-young Lee lost her mother at 12.
She was left all alone.
No siblings for both. Until 19,
Lee lived with her aunt in Choonchun.
She then worked as a nurse's aid at a clinic in Choonchun for 3 years.
There, she met her husband.
I mean, the deceased husband.
Can you uncuff her?
Are your wounds alright?
I'm fine.
How are you doing?
Shall we begin?
I...
Let me introduce myself. I'm your court-appointed attorney, Jun-ha Suh.
I never asked for your help.
I'm appointed by the court, not by your request.
And if you don't like me, you can ask or someone else. Alright?
The records say that you stabbed him in the neck and chest during a fight...
Do I have to repeat this again?
I know it's hard but it's the first time for me.
Was there anything you wanted to say during the investigation or the trial?
No.
Nothing?
Nothing.
-You're satisfied with the verdict?
-Yes.
Fine. Let's say you did it. Even so, not everyone gets the death penalty.
Depending on us, you can avoid death.
Even drop your sentence to 1 5 years.
I don't want that.
Even if you don't want it right now, you must accept my help.
I never asked for your help.
If we're done, I'll go now.
And, thank you for the coffee.
After putting on make-up, you changed, correct
I object to the time of murder, the murder wounds, and method of murder that the court accepted at the first trial.
-You are a security guard, correct?
-Yes.
At the trial, you testified there was no evidence of outside intruders.
What are your working hours?
Usually from midnight to 8 AM.
And on the day of the murder?
When discovered, did the defendant ask for your help?
No.
If an intruder killed her husband, wouldn't she ask for your help?
-Objection! Asks for speculation.
-Nothing further.
-What is your profession?
-I am a neurosurgeon.
You worked with the deceased, correct?
Yes.
I asked you to re-examine the autopsy reports.
There were four cuts on the body, including arteries and veins.
-Any special characteristics?
-All four cuts were at vital points.
The defendant is weaker than the victim and had no criminal record.
What are the odds of her finding and stabbing those places?
Well, I'm not a forensic expert but as a neurosurgeon, it's highly unlikely.
What about a nurse's aid in general surgery?
Probably better than the average.
This is a copy of Shin-young Lee's work record as a nurse's aid.
She worked at Gun-min Hospital from
March, 1992 to November, 1995.
Your records say that you sold the defendant sedatives on Jan. 30th.
Is that correct?
Yes.
What kind of sedatives?
Diazepam.
What happens if one takes three or four tablets?
One would lose consciousness.
Becoming completely helpless, correct?
Yes.
Is it the defendant who bought the sedatives?
Yes.
As evidence, I present the defendant's medical record of an abortion performed on Feb. 4th, the day before the murder.
This is not a trial on the private life of the defendant!
This is crucial evidence in proving the defendant's pre-meditation.
Continue.
Would she want a baby of the husband she hated enough to kill?
In the cruelest way, she killed the baby in the day, the husband at night.
That is all.
Do you have any questions for the defendant?
Ms. Shin-young Lee.
Lawyer Suh, refer to her as the defendant.
Defendant...
Page 235 of the investigation report states that you killed your husband with a scalpel after drugging him at your home on Feb. 6th.
You then changed your clothes and put on make-up to run away when you were arrested at the scene.
Is this true?
Is this correct?
Please re-examine the police video of the crime scene.
The clothes she wore during the crime were not found among the evidence collected or written in the report.
I'll ask you again.
You never murdered Jong-hoon Sung.
Answer please, Ms. Shin-young Lee.
Objection.
The defendant has already admitted to her crime by remaining silent.
Her absent clothes prove her careful planning to cover up her crime.
If a corpse disappeared, would you say that is also a cover-up?
If you've killed someone, would you hide the corpse or your clothes?
As revealed, the scalpel, diazepam, and her confession.
The court needs no more evidence to prove her guilt.
Now, now, what is this?
Calm down, both of you.
Prosecutor. Weren't the seized clothes the ones she wore during the murder?
This case will be adjourned until two weeks from today. Next.
Case no. 321 5.
Case no. 3215, ll-man Choi, not in custody.
Don't get too excited.
It's only a court-appointed case.
Did you kill him?
Did you?
Tell me if you did.
Is everything they've said true?
What's wrong? Why do you want to die?
Why do you...want to know that?
As far as I know, no one kills someone to die.
If I tell you, will you leave me alone and the trial?
No.
I can't do that.
My duty is to do whatever it takes to save your life.
I want to help you.
No one can help me. Not even you.
I'll try.
To some, just being alive is painful.
When you're alive...you remember.
You said you'd help me, right?
Then...just leave me alone.
What's the occasion?
Inviting me to a place like this.
I'd like to get you drunk today.
You sure you're not the one who wants to get wasted?
How come I've never seen you drunk?
I do everything in doses.
I drink, I earn,
I gain weight only so and so much.
Not like someone I know.
-You must be swamped.
-No.
You know what they say.
"You bring it on yourself."
Let me ask one favor before I get too drunk.
Will you find all of Lee's medical records?
I guess there are no freebies.
What?
This drink must be too fancy for me.
Is this water or liquor, I'm not sure.
Yes?
Are you up? You need to come.
There is something odd in Shin-young
Lee's medical records.
She wasn't just hurt, it was a miscarriage caused by physical abuse.
-Physical abuse? -Yes.
It seems her motive just got stronger.
Congratulations!
Hey, congrats!
Mr. Suh. Congratulations.
You don't know yet?
The list for the research candidates is posted.
-Lawyer Suh, congratulations.
-Oh, thank you.
"Jun-ha Suh, Yale Law School"
Wow, you're finally going.
Congrats.
How about some coffee?
Um...can I push the schedule back a little?
It's not at our convenience.
Don't make a big deal. Just go.
Go for M&A. The firm seems to be eyeing a take-over or a merger.
Try being in my shoes. Keep this up and it'll be hard for me to keep you on.
Ambition, justice, that's all good.
Believing truth and justice always go hand in hand is a noble but silly idea.
The law doesn't always reveal the truth.
If you can't reveal the truth in front of the law, it's all an excuse.
The orientation for research candidates is in two days. Be realistic.
I just came by.
I didn't come to ask you anything so don't worry.
Actually...
I don't know why I'm here myself but I had nowhere else to go.
I must seem crazy, huh?
So this is how you do it.
Do you...always wear sneakers?
Why?
I saw you wearing them in the courtroom, too.
You did?
-My father.
-Your father?
My father was a farmer all his life.
When he heard I became a lawyer, he brought me a new pair of sneakers.
So I asked him why.
He said a lawyer is a person who listens to the less fortunate.
So since the world is full of them,
I should be doing a lot of running.
I've worn sneakers from then on.
Oh, whatever I wear is up to me.
The bigger reason is, don't they look cool?
If l...gave up your case, would you miss me?
If you're doing this because you don't like me, you can get someone else.
About the last time...I'm sorry.
Should I stay?
It's almost time for evening check.
I'll be going.
Don't... don't work too hard for me.
Don't keep making me want to live.
I'll see you again.
Man, I'm really tired from the night shift. Calling a pro in for this.
So it was simple?
The door knobs are just on backwards.
What a wacky house.
Come here! Do you wanna die? Get in!
Do as I say! I told you not to think!
-Please, honey...
-Get inside!
I solemnly swear to tell nothing but the truth according to my conscience.
If I lie, I accept the penalty for perjury.
Proceed.
Did Shin-young Lee often visit you?
Once in awhile. But never after her husband dragged her away.
When was that?
About 3 years ago, a day before my sister's death anniversary.
April 1 5, 1 997.
April 1 6, 1 997. It was a natural miscarriage due to an external shock.
Her condition was so serious
I transferred her to surgery.
What kind of external shock?
She said she fell down stairs.
But her injury was inconsistent with that.
-Did you meet with her husband then?
-Ultimately no.
So I asked but she said he was busy because he was a doctor.
He didn't even show up when his wife lost his baby by falling down stairs.
Later, I understand you performed an abortion for her. What was the reason?
The mother didn't know she was pregnant and had taken sedatives.
What kind of sedatives?
Diazepam.
Thank you.
Did you confirm she took the sedatives?
My patient told me.
You performed the abortion without even confirming it?
After her miscarriage, she suffered from severe insomnia.
She started taking the sedatives
3 years ago at my recommendation.
You've treated Shin-young Lee, correct?
Yes. Suffering from claustrophobia in solitary, they brought her in.
How does one develop claustrophobia?
It's a fear of being locked up.
Just a shut door makes them believe that their oxygen is disappearing.
Will you explain why one develops such symptoms?
It can be genetic or acquired.
If you lock up a normal person, for instance, can confinement be a cause?
Of course.
Have you heard of claustrophobia?
Yes.
Did Shin-young Lee ever show signs of it?
No. In fact, she enjoyed doing things in her room by herself.
These are pictures of the murder scene the home where the defendant and her dead husband lived for 6 years.
It seems just like other townhouses but look closely at the door knobs.
Except for the library, the knobs are all backwards.
They lock from the outside. Inside, one can only open it with a key.
Jong-hoon! Open the door, please!
Jong-hoon!
Confined in her home from the day she married till the incident, the defendant was regularly abused by her husband.
The bedroom where the defendant was found is also the same.
These are telephone bills of the defendant and her deceased husband.
For 3 years from April '97, all outgoing calls were restricted with only basic charges.
The defendant could not ask for outside help even if she wanted to.
And the bloodstained clothes she wore were never found in the house.
That is all.
Start your closing.
Given that the defendant won't claim her innocence and it cannot be proven scientifically it is just conjecture based on her lawyer's presumption.
It cannot be a basis for a judgement.
The defendant has rejected making any statement during the trial.
She shows no remorse.
Considering her meticulous planning and callous method of murder, we ask that the death penalty of the first trial be upheld.
Defense, your closing.
The evidence presented towards my client's innocence is circumstantial.
However, so is the evidence towards her guilt.
Thus the best standard to judge this case is the great principal protected by the constitution,
"innocent until proven guilty."
There is no conclusive evidence of guilt or innocence in this case.
Are you going to convict because there's no decisive proof of innocence or vote not guilty because there's no conclusive evidence of guilt?
I ask the court.
That is all.
There is suspicion surrounding the defendant regarding the murder of
Jong-hoon Sung but that cannot be the deciding factor of guilt.
In accordance with the Criminal Code,
Article 325, my ruling is as follows.
I overturn the first verdict.
Defendant Shin-young Lee, not guilty.
Come here! Come here!
Let go, let go!
I'm sorry, I was wrong...
Shin-young, you love me, right? You do, right?
Don't leave me! Alright? I love you...
Don't leave me! You can never leave me!
How's the witness hunting going for the Min-gi Choi case?
We're looking into street peddlers who were at the scene.
The medical records are on their way.
I heard you won. Wow, the firm's looking good thanks to you.
But won't you regret it?
Giving up Yale and all...
Anyway, good job.
It's time you did money cases like you do court-appointed ones.
And throw those ragged sneakers out, will ya?
Shin-young Lee hasn't called, huh?
Sure, it's different before and after taking a dump. Still, it's a bit much.
Delivery!
What kind of messenger service company can't find the right address?
An ox-cart would've been faster.
Huh?
Huh?
Sorry I'm late.
You? What brought you here?
I told you I'd live quietly without disturbing society.
Well, I've got to run.
Present, Part ll.
Take care!
Hello? I bought a picture. What about you...
Oh, a friend of mine opened a new office.
That's why...
Are you doing okay?
How have you been?
Still no answer.
Today...it's my first time out. Outside.
It's my first time, too.
Meeting you outside, Shin-young.
Shall we go out?
What do you think?
Nice, huh? Yes.
This is actually a pretty well-known place.
-Do you come here often?
-No. This is my first time, too.
It's cozy, like my old home.
You mean the one in Choonchun?
No.
When I was younger.
The house where I lived with my mom and dad.
I don't remember it that well but I think it was like this.
It was a single room.
There was a large closet with a mirror and a paper flower my mom cut out on a cracked window.
Did you also have a black-n-white
TV with legs?
A dinner table that was also a desk?
It sounds like we lived in the same house
Still, after school, I'd run straight home.
Even though it was a small, shabby house.
Do you remember coming by when you had no place to go?
You still remember that?
That suddenly reminded me of my childhood.
Running home so hard I was out of breath.
I wish I still had a place like that to run to...
I had fun today.
I'll see you again.
Do you know you always say that?
"I'll see you again."
Do...I?
Get home safe.
Shin-young!
Go...go on in.
I...don't want to go into this house.
This is Jun-ha Suh.
It's me? What the hell are you doing?
You missed the meeting!
Where are you right now?
This is what I've been wanting to do most.
Now, what shall we do first?
A friend asked me to hold his popsicle while he went to the bathroom.
It was a very hot day and
I really wanted to eat the popsicle.
The ice is melting,
I'm dying to eat it, ugh, I was going crazy.
Finally, I couldn't take it so I licked only the ice dripping down my hand.
When he saw me holding an empty stick, he went crazy, saying I ate it all.
I swear I only ate what was dripping down my hand.
That night, my mom whacked me good and I cried all night at the injustice.
I decided, to become a lawyer when I grew up.
To help people who are treated unfairly like me.
I was young.
Anyway, I became a lawyer.
I must be the only one on earth to become a lawyer because of a popsicle.
Come in.
It's like a miracle.
That I'm here...
That I'm laughing right now...
I can't believe all of this is true...
When one dies, they say you make a stop before going to heaven.
There, you select one memory from your life to take with you.
Since hearing that, I'd be troubled every time I thought about it.
What if I had no memory to take with me?
Thank you for...for this time.
Um, is this okay for you?
I'll go outside and see if anyone is coming.
Will you...stay with me?
Shin-young.
Why can't you leave that house?
Were you really so afraid you couldn't leave?
When I left, the bus I was on stopped at a bus stop.
I saw many people buzzing around.
Where were they going...
Sure.
People can go and leave.
But not everyone can.
If you have nowhere to return... you cannot leave.
He says he saw Shin-young Lee at dawn that day.
-Who is he?
-A kid who delivers milk.
Stay at my place for now.
That's okay.
Stay with me until you find...
I can't...
Even if I ask...?
Um, I'm just gonna change.
I'm done.
Sorry. I'm late for a meeting.
There's probably nothing to eat.
There's a supermarket down the street.
Make do for now.
I'll buy some groceries tonight on my way in.
Hello.
What's this?
The color of dung, right?
What's up with you now?
What do you mean?
Did you hit the lotto?
Why are you so happy?
Am l?
You're acting really strange today.
By the way, do you know where
Shin-young Lee is right now?
Why?
A final appeal was filed by the prosecution.
She wasn't at her address so they called us.
-When?
-Just now.
And the grounds for the appeal?
Burnt on an open-n-shut case, not good for his career, he's probably pissed.
Or he's got some conclusive evidence.
Sent it to the lab. I need it now.
She might run. Put a man on her.
Got it.
Jun-ha Suh.
I poked around the prosecution.
Seems airtight.
They found her clothes.
All rise.
Sit, please.
The rulings are as followed.
2000, case no. 1632, assault defendant Soon-il Lee.
Appeal denied.
2000, case no. 1238, murder defendant Shin-young Lee.
Verdict overturned.
Send this case to the
Seoul Higher Court.
Did you get the results from the crime lab?
It is Jong-hoon Sung's blood.
Do you still believe she is innocent?
Or do you want to believe it?
A case is just a case.
Listen to the excuses and you lose objectivity.
You seemed to have made a mistake this time.
Well, then...
What time was that?
A little before 3 AM.
She was holding a bag.
A big one like when you go on a trip.
Do you see that person in the courtroom?
Yes.
Currently, her only inheritance from Jong-hoon Sung's death is the house.
But in only 6 months, the defendant will inherit one million dollars.
Sung's parents died in a car crash last fall in the U.S.
According to their insurance policy everything goes to their son.
But he was cruelly sacrificed by the meticulous crime of the defendant.
The insurance money will all go to the defendant.
Defendant, you don't deny knowing this, do you?
I present the insurance policy as evidence.
Mr. Suh! Stop! Stop!
Stop! He's crazy!
'Case Report: Passport Fraud'
You can't come here...
Iet's meet at about 1 1.
Printman left this scene ages ago.
Why do you want him?
I need a passport made...
Where you gonna use it?
I just need one, that's all.
Don't move!
He's a lawyer. You a pig?
No, I'm not.
Bastard, you think you can trap me?
-No, that's not it...
-The hell it isn't, you dick!
It's not...!
I need a passport, you assholes!
Is this...really the only way?
How can I stop a crazy dog?
There's a ship at dawn on Friday.
I'll see you later.
Oh, I almost forgot.
If you get caught, you don't know me.
Put your belt on.
Stop the car.
What are you doing?
Are you insane?
Don't do this, Jun-ha!
Stop!
Stop the car!
Get closer.
Hey, you bastards, get out of the way!
-Why are you cursing? That's mean.
-What did you say?
Move! Get out of the way!
Are we here?
Why the hell are you doing this?
They'll be looking for this car right about now.
Wait here a little and then move by taxi,by yourself.
Tomorrow, lnchon harbor. Go to Japan for now
Are you crazy?
Just listen.
Don't say anything.
Just...do what I tell you, please.
This is the last thing I can do for you.
Don't kid yourself.
There is nothing between us.
I know.
I know.
Look.
I...killed him.
It doesn't matter if you did or not!
So please just go!
Go and be alive somewhere! That's all I ask!
Stop it now.
Stop?
Why? Because you want to die?
You wanted to live so badly to kill him! Now you want to die?
Go.
Please go.
Wait for me. And I'll find you again.
My dead husband, he had attempted suicide before.
Three times.
The first time was when he was an intern.
The second time was when
I miscarried because of him.
What? Don't!
Let me go! Leave me alone! Alone!
And the last time was that day.
When I got pregnant again,
I thought that could be my last chance.
To get away from him.
So I got an abortion and then told him.
-Come here! Come here!
-Let me go! Let go!
Open the door! Open it!
It was much easier than I thought.
You're...not gonna leaving one inch from here.
I was afraid of making another me.
Give me a ticket.
Where to, ma'am?
I knew then. What that meant...
To have no place to go.
I realized I was tamed that way.
My mind went blank.
I just wanted to die.
But now...I want to live.
Arrogantly enough, I want to live.
From the beginning again...
A good life...
That's right.
You can.
You can live a good life.
And now, don't...ever cry alone again.
Aren't you going to the trial?
I think it'd be best to go, to check the mood out and establish an alibi...
Morning court begins. Dec. 13, 2000.
Case no. 2317.
Case no. 2317, Shin-young Lee, not in custody.
Your honor!
Didn't you get a notice?
The defendant requested a change of lawyers.
Defendant, sit.
Prosecution, do you have any questions?
The defendant has remained silent throughout all the trials.
I ask you one last time.
Did you kill your husband with a scalpel?
-Yes...
-Your honor!
-Have you felt any remorse?
-No.
Your honor! This is not true!
I have something to say!
Lawyer Suh! You don't represent her anymore.
Interfere one more time and I'll have you removed.
Defendant! Do you admit to pre-meditating your husband's murder?
Yes.
Nothing further.
Shin-young Lee. Why are you doing this?
As her former lawyer, I have something to say.
I don't know why the defendant is saying this but it's not true.
I'll get re-appointed and argue this.
Ask for a postponement, now!
You call yourself a lawyer?
What do you know about this case?
Shin-young Lee!
Your closing remarks.
We ask for the original sentence, the death penalty.
Defense, your argument.
I hand in this statement instead.
We ask for leniency.
Open the door.
Open the door!
Please listen to me once. Open this door!
Shin-young.
Do you hear me?
If you do, answer me.
I get it.
I won't come to you anymore.
I'll pretend to be a stranger, like you want.
I won't bother you anymore.
So just stay with me till the end.
Open the door!
Why?
Why are you doing this?
Don't cry alone like that...
You're a fool...a fool...
Cry with me.
Defendant Shin-young Lee, this is your verdict.
Defendant Shin-young Lee, the death penalty.
Next. Case no. 1348, defendant Kyung-hwan Shin.
The hot summer-like days that visit at the end of autumn.
The time that visits everyone but not all remember.
Only to those who wish for a hot summer day before the winter, is it a miracle given to them by the Gods.
Remembering lndian Summer...
Iike I remember that day.
To remember...
...because it is not the end yet.
Come on, Daddy!
Let's go play on the beach.
Just going to take my shoes off, okay?
Yeah, it's cold, huh?
It's going to be a big castle.
Let me know if you strike oil, okay?
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?
I've been waiting here forever.
Oh, Dad.
The train was on time, you're always early.
- Are you starting already?
- Why? You can’t take it?
Come on, let’s go home.
You alright, honey?
You know there's things you can tell me.
I’m not as bad at communication and... so on and so forth as you might think.
I've lived in the world.
I'm not pregnant.
No. No, I wasn't saying that.
Yeah you were.
Are you seeing someone?
Yeah, I am.
Someone with a name?
- Nah, you wouldn't like him.
- How do you know that?
How do you know
I wouldn't like him?
I wish you had someone.
Who says I don’t have a honey stashed away somewhere?
You're my girl.
Yeah, well, I'm not really sure how to cook it.
You finally got a vegetable and
I don’t know if I can eat it.
You alright? You've been to the doctor, right?
When was the last time you went?
- I have a physical every year.
- That's right. They make you.
Careful. So how did you get time off from work?
You don’t even know what I do.
Of course I know what you do.
Dad. I'm a glorified intern.
I can get off when I want.
I wanted to come home.
I'm glad you did.
Maybe you'll tell me what's bothering you.
I'm just tired, you know.
I think I got a bug.
Yeah? Want to lay down?
Go upstairs, lay down.
I got your room all ready for you.
I know you do, Dad.
Ginger-ale. That will settle your stomach. I'll get some.
I always keep some ginger-ale on hand.
Honey, honey.
You alright?
- Dad...
- Yeah?
Oh my god I have to go to a doctor!
Dad, I got to tell you something
I should have told you!
I got you.
CRAVEN!
Oh Jesus!
You're my girl.
I... I know...
Through this holy anointment... love and mercy... with... with the grace... may the... may the...
About five nine, five ten.
Thinks he was white from what he could see through the eyes of the ski mask.
Yelled out one word, "Craven", and then he fired.
Jesus Christ.
Then he ran.
Didn't pursue.
You want some water or coffee or something?
You want something stronger?
I know somewhere in there is a bottle of Crown Royal with dust all over it.
You're going to put the first foot forward, Tommy,
I don’t care if it’s now.
I'll sit with you, okay?
Get out.
Get out of here.
He's not a basket case. Get out.
- Somebody make some coffee.
- I want a glass of ginger ale.
Get him a ginger ale.
We'll get him, Tommy.
You know how we react to thing like this.
Officer involved.
"Office involved". We ought to do that for everybody, right?
"Officer involved". Who the fuck do you think you are?
If you want to get philosophical,
I'll get philosophical.
- Want to get cleaned up?
- No, I'm alright.
I want you to come stay with Carol and me.
No.
- You can't stay here.
- It's where I live.
- If you won't come with me...
- Just tell everybody to just get out of here, just finish what they got to do and go.
This is someone armed and dangerous...
What do you think I am?
Can everybody get out?
I'd like them to go, can they just go finish what they do and go?
Get out.
Get out!
Craven's phone. Hello?
Are you alright?
Dad, are you alright?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Whose my little girl?
M.
Whose one of those sweethearts?
M.
...shooting last night, the daughter of a Boston
Police Detective leads our news. Emma Craven, 24,
an MIT graduate, was killed in front of her home in
Roslindale by a man thought to be targeting her father..
Cathy, from what I understand, police don't have much to
go on right now.
Lisa, there is still a lot of unanswered question when it
comes to this case.
24 year old Emma Craven
was gunned down outside of this Roslindale home on the
porch just behind me. Sources tell me the suspect in this case...
Turn that shit off.
- You alright?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
None of your neighbors saw anything.
And the rain hasn't left much for forensics.
We need to go through your cases, Tommy.
You must have an instinct on this. Something.
Not off the top of my head, no.
They want to see you upstairs first, anyway.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
This is off-subject, but this is my daughters phone.
I need a list of all the contacts,
I got to talk to her friends,
- associates, whatever...
- Yeah yeah.
Janet can do all that.
Don't worry about it.
Blocked incomings too.
Tom.
Sorry for your loss. Anything you need from me and Mary.
And let us know about the arrangements.
It'll be in the Globe and the Herald.
I haven't been down to, you know, the...
Thank you.
Bill Whitehouse is running things.
He has every resource this department possesses.
This is a cop thing.
Officer involved.
So, will you take a leave of absence?
No.
We can't have you on this investigation. It's a rule.
Well, since it's me that's got to figure out who would want to kill me, for reasons only
I would know about, then
I'd rather get paid for it.
So the rules don't apply.
- He's right, isn’t he?
- I think he is, yeah.
I have to make a statement to the media. Is there anything you want in there? You want to stand with me?
- No, thank you.
- They want to see you.
I don't want any part of it.
Alright.
I'm not going to sit in the
Murder Room. No point to it.
There's no physical evidence.
If we got the gun or something.
Jesus, I can't think.
It'll come to me.
It'll come to me but it's not going to come to me here.
I've got to drive around.
I have to think.
You do what you need to do.
You keep me informed.
I'll punch you in.
I got to go. The Coroner wants to ID the body.
- Are you up to it?
- Yeah.
I want my case files brought up.
Nothing this year makes any sense to me at all.
Tommy.
I'll have them sent to your house.
Sure.
Cause of death: injuries arising from gunshot wounds.
Massive hemorrhage. Heart seizures due to shock.
Tom, this is very difficult.
You've done this before, but it's not the same...
Let's get it over with.
Is this your daughter,
Emma Charlotte Craven?
Yes, it is.
Leave her alone.
Let me have some scissors.
- What was that Tom?
- Scissors. I need some scissors.
Don't cry.
I'm not.
I don’t know if
I can make it.
You have to.
Alright.
You're wasting two guys here at my house, Bill.
If you want them in the neighborhood, then have them going door to door.
Someone's trying to kill you Tom. They're staying.
I got nothing. Nothing.
I don't have enemies.
I never lived life or said what I thought enough to have enemies.
Listen, you know
I understand.
I'm not stuck in a personal conversation with you, Bill.
Don't get nervous.
And tell the two uniforms in the cruiser to stop pissing in the bushes. They can come into the house.
This is your beach.
Hey Daddy.
Come on in.
Come on, Daddy!
Okay, sweetheart,
I'll be right there.
Go on.
"NORTHMOOR"
"Weapons Query"
"Searching..."
"David Burnham"
Tom!
You ready for this?
Ski mask found in a hedge five doors from you.
We got hair. Caucasian.
It's in for DNA.
- Keep me posted.
- Where are you going?
Mr. Burnham?
Mr. Burnham, yeah?
Yeah.
Settle down. Alright?
I'm not going to hurt you.
I see you know my daughter.
Are you her boyfriend?
Alright. Okay.
I'm Emma’s father.
I'm going to let you go now.
You're going to be alright.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
Okay, be nice. Okay?
Jesus.
I'm sorry but you're going to get the fuck out of here now.
Give me a minute, alright?
I want to ask you some questions.
Why not answer the door like everybody else?
What the hell are you so scared of?
Is this your handgun?
How did my daughter get a god damned handgun?
Did you give it to her?
Is this yours?
I gave it to her.
Alright.
Why?
I didn't notice a shotgun in your list of weapons.
- Do you own one?
- Do you think that I...?
Your pistol.
You licensed it in Vermont, it's illegal in Massachusetts.
I tell the local police barracks you opened the door with it that's an automatic year in jail.
Not that I don’t have you by the balls already for trying to stick me in the doorway.
- You'd be lying.
- I don't care.
I know you.
You're her dad.
And you never came to visit her. Didn't even bother.
Yeah, well... you worked with her.
And I need to know what kind of trouble she was in.
I can't talk about that.
There's security structures.
Clearance to what we do.
I understand you won't help me.
But I'm confused you won’t help Emma.
She's dead, man. There's no way to help Emma.
There are probably two fucking guys out there watching and listening to us right fucking now
Now, I'm sorry, but you need to get the fuck out of here now.
Please.
Or I'm dead.
There's something
I need to give you.
Yeah? Sure, go ahead.
Here's the keys to her place.
And her personal things.
Thanks.
I'm going to leave you alone now until you realize you got to talk to me.
Alright?
Yeah.
I know you're a good guy otherwise Emma wouldn't have nothing to do with you.
Here's my card. It's got my cell on it, okay?
Call.
You were right,
I don’t like him.
Why did you have a gun, honey?
Jesus.
Is there something I could do for you, Millroy?
What do you do usually, Jedburgh?
If someone has a national security problem... they dial a number in
And then I decide what happens next.
What's your problem?
You're a consultant in security.
I'm merely consulting.
So consult.
There's a company called Northmoor.
They own a number of defense department contracts.
It's not an agency front, if that's what you think.
- It's a real private company.
- That is unusual.
They have private security.
Autonomous security.
I'm autonomous myself.
These are the facts:
One of their secure facilities was penetrated.
Three people died making their escape.
A fourth, an employee who may have been involved has been killed.
- By Northmoor security?
- I didn't say that.
No one would.
Fact is, we don't know.
She was shot dead five nights ago.
Her father is a
Boston Detective.
Boston police are working on the assumption that her father was the target.
And what assumption are we working on?
That he wasn't.
- Who killed her?
- That's not the issue at this point.
National security is the issue.
I know your function, Jedburgh.
This has to be cleaned up.
Whatever it takes.
Yes.
Are you absolutely sure you want me to look into this?
Cause you have to be absolutely sure.
- She was killed in Boston.
- Yeah.
But this isn't a part of that.
You think it's a funeral robbery?
Yeah.
Look..
I don't want this mixed up with the other business.
I don't need the trouble, alright?
Do me a solid in
Boston sometime.
Thanks.
Hello?
Hello. My name is
Tom Craven.
Your number was in my daughters phone records.
I'm Emma's father.
I'm a policeman.
I just want to know what you were to Emma.
Find out what happened.
It says in the papers what happened.
Someone tried to kill you and they got her.
Is that what you think happened?
I run a shop.
A luggage shop.
I want to keep running a shop.
I'd like to talk to you in person.
- Would you do that?
- About Northmoor?
Yeah, sure. About anything you want to talk about.
How do I know you're you?
When you meet me, you will know that guy can't be anyone else but Emma's father.
Will you help me?
I'm out of state,
I'm at my grandmothers.
I have your number,
I'll call you.
I'm here to see
John Bennett.
Detective Craven.
Jack Bennett.
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.
Can I say how shocked we all were to hear of Emma's death.
She was a valued member of our team.
I can't say I knew her very well personally, but she is well thought of.
She is missed.
Thank you.
In the Sixties, this hill was excavated.
The site for Nike nuclear missiles.
Miles of tunnels and launch chambers.
- I'm sure Emma told you.
- She never talked about work.
So Northmoor bought this from the federal government?
- Well, we lease it.
- For money?
- Coffee?
- I'll have a ginger ale.
Certainly.
Annie, get Detective Craven a ginger ale, would you?
- Of course.
- Please.
You have interesting friends.
Yes.
This facility, R&D in general, earns a great deal of money to Massachusetts. As reflected in the tax breaks.
How may I help you?
I supposed I want to know what my daughter did here.
In what sense?
She didn't tell you about our work?
She was following your security protocols.
And what are they in your understanding?
I don’t understand anything.
She never talked about work.
Right.
Well you'll understand that most of what we do here is classified. Almost everything we do.
What she did, despite her qualifications, your daughter was a trainee.
Of course, she was a full employee and there's a... benefit package I suppose you should see Personnel about.
I'm not interested in that just yet.
All our people are very well insured.
I bet they are.
Well, what we do here...
Norhtmoor is essentially a research facility.
We have a mandate from government to develop a safe and clean energy source based on fusion technology.
- Very green.
- And weapons?
Do you make them?
Well, If we did, it would be classified.
I can tell you, since you are a policeman and have access to this information anyway, that
Northmoor is an important part of the nation’s nuclear stockpile and maintenance program.
We ensure that the nations nuclear stockpile remains ready for the presidents order.
- Not weapons, raw materials.
- Emma was a part of this?
God no. As an intern, she didn't have any direct involvement whatsoever. She worked on the research floor.
We all very very much regret Emma's death.
It must be especially painful for you.
In the circumstances.
You mean that she was shot instead of me.
As a parent I can only guess at your pain, I think.
Though I'm sure I cannot imagine its full dimensions.
I've taken up enough of your time.
I'd like to talk to her friends if any.
Yes, of course. I'll see what
I can do. I'll tell Personnel.
Give you a list. Of contact numbers and so forth.
Can I ask you a question?
What does it feel like?
- David.
- You ready for this?
- I'm ready for anything.
- We have a DNA match.
Oh, really?
Give me the skinny.
You got no buzz of this guy? Nothing?
This guy was a professional.
This guy was a hit man.
What's the matter? You were looking at something.
Tell me what you're looking at.
It says in the evidence log the hair you found was 2,5 inches.
So he cut his hair.
Not as recently as a week ago.
- So what are you saying?
- I'm not saying anything.
Hair can stick to a hat for a long time. Years.
Decades.
Why would a pro blow off two barrels with a shotgun instead of saving one for his target?
Creeping up on a bereaved man at a murder scene is not very bright.
Mr. Craven, we have things to talk about.
Like your name and what you're doing here?
Like who shot your daughter.
You know who shot my daughter?
If I was looking for a man who might have shot your daughter, and I had a limited imagination, of which I do not,
I might have looked at the poor bastard you found today.
A known killer.
An unusually well known killer. Makes you think.
- What are you burning?
- None of your business.
Yeah, go ahead.
- Cigar?
- Not celebrating just now.
I know you don't smoke.
I saw your DARPA file.
That's my way of telling you you've got a DARPA file.
Are you going to tell me what that is?
Defense Advance Research
Project Agency.
Their slogan is:
"Scienta est Potentia"
And I know you know Latin.
Sto sursum. You know what that means, yeah?
- Stand the fuck up.
- Please do so.
Well it seems like you're no one in particular.
Just some English guy, standing on my lawn, with a District of Columbia drivers license.
Thank you.
- Is Northmoor part of DARPA?
- Well, that's hard to tell.
Why are you here?
Your daughter was flagged as a possible terrorist threat to
United States of America.
I said "flagged",
I didn't say she was.
It's funny the Boston Police
Department didn't come up
- with that one.
- Funny if they had.
What the fuck are you burning out there?
Fucking Christ.
My English friend Mr. Davenport, about 6 feet tall, 220 pounds, is enjoying a cigar.
Did he put it out?
You said my daughter was a terrorist.
I didn't. But someone did.
Who are you, Mr. Jedburgh?
I'm a friend of the corps.
And I'm a bit fucking cold out here.
Pills, pills, pills.
Not like when we were kids.
When it was pills, pills, pills in a very different context.
You're not much of a partier, are you Craven?
Do you believe in fun?
What, do you mean recently?
What's your interest in my daughter’s death?
I don't like the look of it.
Tell me what you think.
Do you recognize?
Should I?
They broke into a US classified nuclear research facility, then drowned in the Connecticut river making their escape.
Now I know that sounds like bollocks. But it's not.
Northmoor isn't federal.
I checked.
So if you're saying my daughter was involved with these people the most you can get her for is trespassing.
Her apartment was tossed.
Her computer was stolen.
And do the police know that you know that?
No.
You're a smart fucker.
What does Northmoor do?
What have they done?
The people who drowned belonged to "Night Flower".
Tree huggers. Militants.
New Age fuckups.
Sometimes they blow shit up.
Infrequently, and not very well.
You can look them up.
The organization itself, not the dead guys.
They are classified.
She wasn't an activist. Not the type. My daughter wasn't a joiner.
She was more like me.
If she did anything, whatever she did, she did it alone.
There's a point where anyone can become an activist.
I mean you see something so wrong, you have to act.
Even if it means the end of you.
Let’s just say she was involved.
Her companions died.
Then she came home.
She didn't say anything.
She meant to, she wanted to, but she didn't make it.
I'm going to advise my department of one, which is me, to let you continue your investigation, even if you sometimes burn the evidence in your backyard.
And you, an officer of the corps.
I'm not going to arrest anyone.
I never do.
Will you try to stop me?
It depends.
See you around.
I do sometimes like that feel like Diogenes.
You know the guy who walked around with a lamp.
Looking for an honest man.
How did it turn out?
Well, for him?
I don't remember.
But you and I have done pretty good.
Bonne chance.
I thought you were going to wait until I was a nice guy.
As a career move man, I seriously need to be seen telling you to fuck off.
You have no idea, you don't understand.
Go home! Go home!
There's nothing you can do to me.
There are times when you don’t have a choice what kind of fucking guy you are.
You understand that because you're doing it right now.
May I?
Drinking the good stuff because your job is going so well?
Is this an intervention?
If it is I'd like to call a few people that don't whack me around because
I’m afraid for my life.
I assumed you'd be some kind of scientist.
Didn't think your daughter would go for a grease monkey?
Something like that. Yeah.
If you want to beat yourself up.
And what if I said she said
I reminded her of you?
Except drinking.
Something to do with the absence of bullshit and no patience for
Broadway musicals.
You're looking at me like I'm crazy.
Somebody shot my girlfriend, have you factored that in?
What do you know about Night Flower?
- Politics don't interest me.
- What did interest you?
Emma.
Look. I'm under contract.
I have a five year contract.
I'm surveilled. I'm going to loose my fucking job if I talk to you no matter who's dead.
How did my daughter get people through the security in a classified nuclear
R&D facility?
There's a rumor she had help.
- You?
- No.
I passed the polygraph at work.
What happened?
Come on, level with me here, I'm not a cop.
Now it's just you and me.
What happened?
You got somewhere else we can talk?
You didn't pass the polygraph, they just told you you did.
Emma was writing to
Senator Pine.
And at some point she went to this grease ball loco.
A lawyer to see about getting out of her...
What was the name of the lawyer?
- Sampson... Sanderman.
- Sanderman.
Anyway, said nobody could help her.
Whistleblowers always sound like psychos.
And I didn't get back to her.
So she helped out these
Night Flower assholes.
She got them in through the cooling tunnels.
She didn't go in herself.
But she was there.
How was Emma exposed to radiation?
She wasn't.
That's what I’m saying, she didn't go into the tunnels, they were exposed, but she couldn't have been exposed, she wasn't in the tunnels.
What happened to the people that went in?
There's a protocol.
It's Bennett. He's insane.
In case of a breach, they release irradiated steam.
Now I can't prove this, and you can't prove it, these are clever, clever fuckers, right?
You're a cop. You've got to help me.
Yeah. Sure. Yeah,
I will help you.
Just come with me.
Tell me the truth.
We'll get you deposed by a lawyer.
No. I'm sorry, no.
I like you, you're Emma's dad.
But you have to go.
Alright. You can always change your mind.
In the meantime, here, this is yours.
It's loaded.
That's illegal in
Massachusetts.
Everything is illegal in Massachusetts.
What does it feel like?
Hmm?
- Good evening, Senator.
- Good evening, glad to be here.
Senator, two days ago you gave a speech in which you
criticized your colleague Senator
Stafford, for his position
- We all have positions.
- But Senator...
I think the American people are asking, with good reason,
whether the price they've paid for their security is too high.
With respect, that's an answer one would expect, but how
does it jibe, Senator, with your support for secret
research facilities in
Massachusetts?
I'm curious about what you just asked of me.
If you're asking...
...about this administrations failed policies...
Senator, what can you tell me about Northmoor?
I'm not familiar with the business practices of...
Their parent company is one of your biggest donors.
All I can say about my donors is that they are
completely vetted and above board.
Senator, there is a serious and growing petition movement
to ban military research and development in Massachusetts.
I understand that. But people have to realize the importance
of R&D of every kind to
Massachusetts economy.
Now, to answer your questions about some other stuff...
I fully agree with his desires to expand...
I never had kids.
Maybe it's better not to have had one than to see one die.
No.
It's worth everything to have one.
Public drinking is illegal in Massachusetts.
Everything is illegal in Massachusetts.
Payback for the tea party.
You've ever had wine before?
Not with any pleasure.
Besides, with you, I think I'd have to switch glasses when you weren't looking.
My daughter was irradiated.
I don’t know how exactly, but I think it was our friends at Northmoor.
Later she was gunned down in my home.
And I want to know what you would think about that.
I had a source that said the
Nightflower people were intentionally exposed to radiation while in the tunnels, but that source is dead now.
He wasn't a bad guy.
No.
Now you know better than anyone cases like these are never solved.
Simply too complicated, too much hard work.
There is a lot going on out there in this world.
You just never can connect "A" to "B".
How do you know that?
Because I'm usually the guy that stops you connecting
"A" to "B".
It's part of what I do.
If I was an employee at Northmoor, and I wanted to blow the whistle on something... what would I be blowing the whistle on?
Let's take a walk and we can talk about it.
I'm not walking into the dark with you.
You're a wise man.
- Are you on my side?
- That's hard to tell.
Do you know the Scott
Fitzgerald thing about an artist who's a man with opposing ideas in his head, and he believe in them both simultaneously?
Heard of it. Yeah.
Well, that's sort of the beginning of it.
So what's that like? Not being anyone in particular.
I don't know what it means to have lost a daughter.
But I know what it means never to have had one.
Yeah.
Got nobody left to bury you.
Yeah.
Oh and by the way...
Thanks for not killing me.
Detective Craven. How do you feel about a suspect being identified?
You're later than everybody else.
Is that because you have a lousy boss?
I'm so sorry for you.
I'm sorry I have to be here.
It's alright, take it easy.
You got a business card or something?
Thanks.
Look, go on home, honey.
It's too late to be out here.
I'll call you, okay?
Mr. Sanderman?
I'm sorry, I didn’t mean to... I interrupted?
- No.
- I'm Tomas Craven.
Detective Tomas Craven,
Boston Police Department.
I know who you are.
- I'm sorry for your troubles.
- Thank you.
I understand my daughter was a client of yours?
Yes.
I mean no, we had a consultation, she never formally became my client.
Oh.
It says in her phone calendar that you and she had dinner on the
18th of last month.
Yeah, I asked her on a date, yes.
- Well how did it go?
- Fine. Fine.
She was a nice girl.
Smart as a...
- Sorry, I have to go.
- I'll come with you.
Can I ask you what this is about?
She came to your office.
She wanted to blow the whistle on something.
You know where that's from, right?
When the cops used to blow their whistles.
I can't talk about that.
I don't want you to talk about that.
But then later that night you invited her out for dinner.
Gee, you're really nervous, Mr. Sanderman.
You're about two seconds away from telling me how inappropriate all this is.
Let me say right off the bat,
I knew you couldn't represent her in a non-disclosure contract, but you probably suggested some further discussion on the matter over a nice plate of spaghetti and meatballs.
I think you had two agendas.
One, you wanted sex with her.
Hey I'm not passing judgment here okay, and two, Mr. Sanderman, you wanted to know more about what potential security breach she represented.
I have to get to a deposition in Springfield.
You represent Northmoor in local matters.
My daughter came to you, but you're Northmoors attorney.
This is a highly irregular convers...
...because senator Pine has put your name before two different governors for District Court Judge.
So you were about to say something?
I don't have anything to say and you are out of your depth and far from your jurisdiction.
You won't talk to me? I'm going to the Global and the Herald.
I'll tell them my daughter came to talk to you about Northmoor.
That you were Northmoors attorney and failed to tell her.
And then you'd be right in the middle of a big ass story saying how my daughter was the target and not me.
Is that where you want to be?
On what evidence would you say that?
I'll forge your fucking diary. I don't care.
Getting you in trouble is good enough for me.
Listen, asshole, this is not about police, okay?
This isn't about police and arrest and all that nice shit, this is about me knowing what
I have to know and the fact that you got to tell me.
Now I want to see the Senator.
See the Senator? Who the fuck do you think you are?
I'm the guy with nothing to lose that doesn't give a shit.
You tell him that. And fasten your fucking seatbelt.
Look, Daddy.
Lots of ABCs
Hi.
I want to go to her apartment.
I want to see her things.
That's not a good idea right now.
I'm sorry.
I'm so scared.
Look. I would take you for a cup of coffee some day, but we have to just talk now.
I'd like to ask you things about her. Personal things maybe
I never knew, but there's no time now...
Look, honey, I can't take this, okay?
I... talk to me, okay?
Talk to me.
- I introduced her to them.
- Introduced her to who, honey?
Nightflower.
Fuck, you know.
Corporations this, corporations that.
Just keep it straight, okay?
They had a little shack up the river.
Nightflower.
- I'm so afraid.
- Who are you afraid of?
They came to my house.
These guys in black suits, asking about Emma,
I lied my ass off!
What were they doing in
Northmoor that Emma wanted to expose?
Bennett’s the motherfucker.
Alright? It's Bennett.
That's all she wanted to say at first. That he was insane.
She realized he was completely fucking insane.
Okay, whether he was this, that or whatever,
What were they doing at Northmoor?
Why did Emma go to
Nightflower?
Because she couldn't go to the papers because of the contract.
The Senator wouldn't help. You are not hearing this from me.
Alright, you are not.
I run a luggage store.
I got a three year old.
I'm not hearing this from you.
What did they do at Northmoor that Emma wanted to expose?
She had this for you.
In case...
I never wanted...
I'm just a person.
You know, I'm just a fucking person.
Okay. I know.
Go back to your baby, okay?
I never saw you.
Alright? Go on.
I got to tell you something else first.
What?
She thought they poisoned her.
You know...
I always liked this town.
When she moved out here...
She said it reminded her of Paris in the Twenties.
We have a very traditional home in Boston, and... maybe it wasn't what she wanted out of life, you know?
What was the name of her contact in Nightflower?
Tell me that and we're done.
No, I'm done now.
In her phone records it was a guy called Robinson.
Is that the guy?
Yeah.
Now I'm done.
We've stabilized her.
She's in a coma, although we weren't able to save her leg.
She has a child, is there anybody who could...
Her parents just arrived.
Thanks.
Go ahead. I'll keep you posted.
Thanks.
My name is Emma
Charlotte Craven.
I work at Northmoor,
Massachusetts,
as a research assistant.
I know that I am violating the security conditions
of my workplace, and I know I am committing a crime.
But I'm doing this because I've exhausted every legal avenue
that is available to me, and no one would listen.
So, now I have to do what's right.
Northmoor is breaking the law.
They are making nuclear weapons.
But these are not US nuclear weapons,
they are weapons designed to foreign specification
and built with foreign materials.
So, obviously, if these bombs were ever used,
they would be traced back to another country,
and not the US.
I've stolen documents, images, blueprints.
But we need proof of the weapons themselves,
so I'm showing a team of people how to get into
the Northmoor facility to video the evidence.
I'm recoding all this because I'm very scared.
I'm under constant surveillance.
My phone is tapped and I'm being followed.
So chances are that if you're watching this I'm already dead.
I...
I love you, dad.
Fuck
If another contractor asks to run his own security,
What should I say?
I suppose that would be up to you.
This is called a containment situation. I wonder why, really.
The problem is that there are things uncontained and some of them will never get back in the box.
You're scared about
Craven. Very wisely so.
But here is the damage control analysis:
Apart from Craven, three sets of parents have lost their kids.
Now you have an employee who tries to run over a single mother, only to be shot in the head by the same cop that you previously bereaved.
I don't know what you're talking about, and surely you're not saying it.
Do you know what the thing is about the dead, Bennett?
They have got lovers, friends, relatives, a billion loose ends.
Let’s start at the beginning of this debacle.
Nightflower is a pack of paranoid anti-corporate freaks.
You think three of their people drowned is going to read as an accident?
It was an accident.
And the man involved in the other incident was a Bosnian, who as far as the paperwork is considered is live and well in London, at this very moment.
You can do my job, it seems
I can also do yours.
What you're doing is not my job.
Isn't it?
Look, even if the drownings were accidental, the Nightflower bodies were recovered by a radiation team and disposed of.
- By your people, not mine.
- You told my office they were contaminated terrorists, not that they were American citizens that you had contaminated.
One of them is the only child of a mother with multiple sclerosis.
When she's on TV, saying:
"The last thing I knew, they were breaking into Northmoor", do you know what I’m saying?
Do you understand what you have done?
What's worse, me doing it, or you covering it up?
I'm just a private individual, a citizen, a man.
You on the other hand are the US government.
What I am is the guy whose only fuckup was letting you have your own security fiefdom.
Whatever they say, there was never a break.
Northmoor has never had a security breach,
Northmoor has never had an accident and Northmoor does not make weapons.
Least of all things supposed in certain contingencies best known to you to look like jihadist dirty bombs.
I wouldn't worry about it more.
"Fuck you, it's classified", still works as far as I’m concerned.
Are you even here,
Mr. Bennett?
Are we even talking?
I'm at my house in Virginia.
I've got food poisoning.
Where are you?
Oh, I'm not here.
Is Robinson keeping his part of the bargain?
- Mr. Robinson?
- Yes.
- Mr. Allison Robinson Jr?
- Yes.
Could you remove the glasses please, Sir?
My daughter was Emma Craven.
She wasn't killed in your amphibious little operation against the corporate Satan.
She was killed later!
On my front porch!
Come here!
I want to know why you, with your concerns for the planet and the human race stayed silent about the drowning deaths of your people.
Why is that?
People with families.
All of them had kids.
And one of them was my daughter.
I'm not going to hit you again.
And she's not here because of you. You son of a bitch!
Now you got a serious situation here Mr. Robinson.
See they know who you are, and you're not dead.
You're not dead, shot, hurt, poisoned, nothing.
Now I figure that's because you cut a deal.
You're going to cut another deal with me.
You're going to tell me everything.
- Come on, you scum.
- No!
I need to know something about the properties of the substance you gave
Emma Craven.
I would rather not discuss it in those terms.
Is it something she could have encountered in her work?
Any exposure, if there were an exposure, would be consistent with a documentable, procedural failure on her part.
Is it something that could have remained in her effects and been transferred to her father without much collateral contamination?
Do you mean could it have poisoned her father as well?
Yes.
What, in your opinion, would be the consequences if
Craven opens his mouth?
It's unsurviveable.
So be it, then.
Do you see a soul in there?
I beg your pardon?
You can button your shirt.
You know, as we discussed yesterday, there will be some erratic behavior.
And I regret to say this probably means you will have less time.
I know what it means.
I've been having aural hallucinations.
My father's voice calling my name as I start to sleep.
Bastard's been dead for forty years and suddenly he's yelling at me again.
- I come awake.
- You're not sleeping?
No, I'm not sleeping, I start to sleep, then I jolt awake.
There's something about the darkness.
- I don't like it.
- I'm not a counselor.
I know you want to banter with me. I don't do that.
- I can only give you the facts.
- We all know what the facts are.
We live a while, and then we die sooner than we planned.
Standard procedure with the Senator.
Yeah, I get it.
You know you didn't really let the side stand with you.
You got a lot of brothers out there.
Yeah, I know. But I like a private funeral.
Senator gets in his moods.
Not too good today.
That's too bad. I was jumping for joy.
Are you hungry? We have some sandwiches, a cup of tea?
No thank you, Sir.
Well, it's always a pleasure to meet a combat veteran.
You left as a master sergeant of a heavy weapons platoon.
Yes, Sir.
- How did you do that at 20?
- Everybody else was dead.
Did you have trouble adjusting when you came home?
- No.
- Really?
No. People talk about trauma and so forth.
I figure you come out of combat the way you went in.
I know that's not a very kind thing to say, but that's my observation.
And I know there's a lot of big bucks in this post traumatic stress thing. But combat is pretty much like anything else.
It helps put perspective on things when you're scared shitless.
What is the nature of our appointment, Detective Craven?
Well I was hoping that you could tell me that.
Why am I supposed to tell you what you want to see me about?
Well, because you're seeing me in less than 48 hours after
I talked to your attorney.
Your daughter came to me with allegations about Northmoor.
- She sent me a letter.
- What did the letter contain?
It touched on national security matters that are classified.
- What happened to the letter?
- That is also classified.
But protocol would be to turn it over to the committee that does oversight on the area your daughters letter touched upon.
Prompting an investigation on my daughter.
Opening up a DARPA file on her.
Treating her like a terrorist?
I'm not involved in security matters.
I did write your daughter, advising her she might be in breach of security.
Oh. So you didn't help her?
I'm glad to see you, Detective.
As both a veteran and as a police officer of your many years of service, but I have to tell you that your daughter, and we have to say this despite her terrible accident, was in violation of... almost everything of which she could be in violation.
- What did she allege?
- That's classified.
You know, Detective, a very important part of Massachusetts economy is research and development...
Senator. I think you're in a position regarding Northmoor, where you had better decide if you're hanging on the cross or banging in the nails.
Here.
These deaths are the result of a conspiracy by one of your major campaign contributors.
Why do you include your daughter?
Her death was an accident.
No. She was poisoned with cesium by Mr. Bennett.
I think I'm scaring you Senator.
There's probably not too much upside to scaring a Senator, except to provide some perspective.
I'm going to go now, but I'm going to leave you these pictures
I want you to call everybody involved, everybody concerned, and tell them I know everything
I need to know to throw a real box of Tarantulas into this situation.
- If you have info...
- Shut up!
I'm not interested in talking any more shit.
You investigate this at a national level.
You do that, maybe you'll come out of this alright.
I don't know.
I don't think you knew that the people you are in business with killed my daughter.
But now that you do know... what are you going to do about it?
Good afternoon, Senator.
Get out of the vehicle.
What the fuck do you think you just did?
You just rear-ended an unmarked cruiser, and I made an observation that you are armed.
Through smoked glass and our coats?
Yeah, I'm funny that way.
Get out of the car, now.
Or you're going to make a move for something on the inside of your jackets, you understand me?
Get out of the car.
Alright. On your knees, hands on your heads.
- What have you got, Tom?
- These guys are armed.
They were following me.
Rear-ended my car.
Got some ID then?
Thanks.
Not in law enforcement.
Imagine that.
What are you?
You don't think this is going to get straightened out?
Not for a while.
These fuckers got automatic weapons.
You just made a serious mistake.
Did you shoot my daughter?
I'm the supposed target of a killer. So you here, following me armed, with no credentials in the city of Boston, you're out of your fucking mind.
Welcome to hell.
A strange new twist in the Emma Craven case,
a suspect has been identified as her murderer,
but new developments today involving her father
Two men have been arrested in Boston. Police say
the men were taken into custody after their car
crashed into the back of an unmarked police car,
driven by Boston Police
Detective Tomas Craven,
the father of Emma Craven.
This all happened on
Marlinton Street...
- Bennett.
- We need to abort right now.
We can't risk killing
Tom Craven yet.
It's too late.
It's already been done.
You want to try?
Hold your hair back, your mother will kill me if I get it all messed up again.
There you go.
Perfect. Now a razor. Here you go. Don't cut yourself.
- Comb?
- That will work.
Now watch.
Painless.
Wash it off.
One more.
Can I come in, Tom?
- You alright?
- Yeah.
Do you remember when the trooper out at the airport busted Whitey? He got demoted and transferred.
He knew what was going on.
But he couldn't prove it.
And nobody wanted to know about it.
And finally he shot himself, remember that?
I don't think you'd shoot yourself.
But what's coming is worse than that.
It isn't what it is, Tommy.
It is never what it is.
It is what it can be made to look like.
There's a DA in Hampshire
County, going to charge you with the death of your daughters boyfriend.
He doesn't have a case.
But that doesn't matter.
It'll be five years of people thinking you did it.
You'll go broke, you'll lose the house.
And they go after your pension.
If you win the case there'll be a civil suite by that point you won't be able to afford a lawyer.
What are they offering you?
I got kids, Tommy.
I don't.
But even if you did, right?
- Even if you did.
- Yup. Even if I did.
You know, Bill. No one expects you to be perfect.
But there's a few basic things you got to get right.
Always do the best you can by your family, go to work every day, always speak your mind.
Never hurt anyone that doesn't deserve it.
Never take anything from the bad guys.
It's all. It's not much to ask.
Hello, Craven.
I need your car.
Not yet.
Go ahead.
Hold on.
I'll call you back.
Derek?
Derek?
Shit.
You're all fucked up, Craven.
You're all done.
Sit down.
Lie down.
Be dead.
Fuck.
- Say "Craven".
- Fuck you.
- You fuck.
- "Craven". Say it.
- Craven.
- Louder!
- Craven!
- LOUDER!
CRAVEN!
I'm sorry you had to see that, honey.
Deep down...
You know you deserve this.
We've got a cop of almost
30 years spotless service and there's not one person, on our side, who can explain his instability without lying, who has executed the director of a nuclear research facility where his daughter worked.
Okay. Ideas?
Your scenario is this.
He was accidently poisoned by his daughter.
- But he blamed Bennett.
- How do we know that?
Testimony of an altercation at
Northmoor when he was there.
Testimony from the Senator.
I can easily testify that he was unstable. He came to my house.
That's right. He made wild allegations. He was armed.
You know, you were very lucky to live.
That's true.
That's very true.
Now the real story here gentlemen, is:
"United States Senator escapes assassination."
- That's right.
- That's the lead story.
That will wipe the rest of it right out of the media.
Anyone who looks at the rest of this is going to see that something happened.
But no one is going to be able to figure it out.
That's your objective.
To make it so convoluted that anyone can have a theory.
- But no one’s got the facts.
- That's quite good, Jedburgh.
Senator, I've been making things unintelligible for 30 years.
And by the way, its
Captain Jedburgh to you.
Captain. Of what?
Very little he can tell you about.
Right. Well. Seems we have a good starting point.
What's the prognosis on Craven?
- Well, you know he's terminal.
- We're all terminal, Millroy.
Even middle management.
But how fast is he being terminal?
- He's incapable of speech.
- Thank God for that.
I understand you had a chance to terminate Detective Craven and did not do so.
You come to me. I look at things. I decide.
Jedburgh, we've got to get the Senator out to the press.
I've decided what this country is.
What?
People, who deserve better.
We all appreciate Captain Jedburgh.
Yet we would have not got to this extremity had he done what the situation clearly dictated.
Senator, I don’t think you really understand what side of this situation you're on.
Well, I think we've had a successful meeting...
I... am a United
States Senator.
By what standards?
- You got a family?
- Yeah.
- Kids?
- Yeah.
Hey, what are you doing?
Bomb suit for Major Anand, sir...
He won't wear it.
But sir... I mean...
Keep watching.
What is it, Dewan?
I can't figure it out, sir, it looks like a radio control servo with a switch, but I can't locate the receiver and the x-ray hasn't shown up anything either.
You rest, I'll take a look.
OK, sir.
Sir, is this the same Major Samar Anand, who has the record for the maximum number of bombs defused?
Yup, 97 bombs, this is the 98th, and he goes into the lap of each bomb just like this, without any protection, as if it's not a bomb, but the arms of his girlfriend.
Sir, is that why they call him 'the man who cannot die'?
Yes, 'The Man Who Cannot Die'
All of us have to die one day and so will he, until today I've never seen the fear of death in his eyes
I can't understand the kind of fate he's had written for him.
They had hidden the receiver within the RDX and covered it with lead, that's why the X-ray couldn't catch it
Singh, open up the market.
Okay sir.
Amaanullah, sir, open the market.
Your eyes, impish and mischievous.
Your laughter's nonchalant insolence.
Your hair unfurled their waves undone.
Never shall I forget.
Until I breathe this life,
Until I breathe this life.
Your hand that abandoned mine.
Your shadow that turned away it's gaze.
Your look that never looked back.
Never shall I forgive.
Until I breathe this life,
Until I breathe this life.
Your unabashed dancing in the rain.
Your silly sulkings at all things small.
Your innocent childlike mischief.
Always I will love.
Until I breathe this life,
Until I breathe this life.
Your false vows and promises.
Your burning scorching dreams.
Your cruel ruthless prayers.
Always I will hate.
Until I breathe this life,
Until I breathe this life.
In the name of God...
Oh shit!
The water is freezing...
Help!
Soldier!
Water... col... cold... freezing... please help please... please... what if I had died?
Couldn't you have come earlier?
You're a soldier... you'll... have taken some oath haven't you... to save lives of fellow Indians?
I was in such a dangerous situation...
I could have died...
Arsehole!
Nice!
Oh God!
Akira!
I can't believe you actually did it!
Just pay up guys!
I'm going bankrupt because of you, this is the fifth dare in 3 weeks, for once can you not complete a dare?
Stop being such a wuss, Sam, two more days and you all will be in the London discovery office and I will be stuck in Delhi, and then you will miss me and you'll be like
I wish I had given Akira all my money, after all she got paid shit as an intern
I won't miss you.
Alright, you lot listen up, stop whatever it is you are doing, it's my day off, so I don't want to see any of your ugly faces today, but tomorrow morning I want your boney arses, back here at 7 o'clock sharp.
Aye, aye, Captain
Catherine!
Piss off, Akira.
Did you think about taking me with you to London?
Yes I did and the answer is no, so get out of my face.
Bitch!
Oh, God, man...
Arjun, I told you it's over between us man, stop calling me...
Arjun, it's only a 6-month relationship, why are you getting so hyper?
You still love me but now I don't, simple, come on, get over it, we'll talk later!
Samar Anand...
In a way, I had already lived twenty-five years, but my life, actually began on this day,
The first day of my story, the first time I saw snow fall, the first time I saw an angel glide across the snow.
Did You have to make the snow fall right now, couldn't You have waited 10 minutes more?
Such an expensive dress, it got wet.
Anyway, my results are out,
I topped the university.
Dad is very happy.
Thank You, and yes, like I promised You, no more chocolates from today... never, I promise.
Okay, now listen carefully, today our work is very important.
There's a music ceremony at Bina aunty's and Mrs Sanger wants to hook me up with her wall street banker son.
Please, please, please make sure that he doesn't fancy me,
I will also fully try to make sure but,
You know how Indian boys behave stupid, when they're around me and in any case,
I am not going to marry an Indian boy,
'remember me telling You this?
Please don't get me married to any Indian boy, they are all very brown.
Please find me a nice handsome white boy, please, please, please.
But You have to make sure that
Dad doesn't like that banker, because You know...
I can never fight with Dad.
So please, please, please don't let this happen and I promise that...
I promise, I will stop wearing fur coats from today, and You know how much I love fur.
Okay?
Deal?
Please take care of this.
Thanks.
Wow, sir Jesus, what specimens You have to bear, very hard work, sir,
God bless You, sir.
Hey Samar, what you doing man?
You were supposed to be finished by lunch time.
No worry, Jack Sir,
I finish twenty minutes fully clean, shaving and shining.
I'm picking you up in half an hour, make sure it's done.
Done, done, okay, ta-ta, see you, bye bye, from the ground in this country grows snow, grows white white snow.
Come on Zain, it's morning, get up.
London's opened her arms and is calling you.
Come on, get up, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
Oh man
London is upset with me, my friend, it does not give me even a half day of work.
It's rubbish that she has her arms open for me.
Oh London, do something for me, it seems I might have to return to Lahore.
Oh man, Kapoor uncle, was asking for the rent, he was saying we have to vacate the flat today.
You relax and eat your eggs,
I'll handle Uncle.
Sure?
Yes, for sure.
You're too good.
- God bless.
- Bye, we'll meet again.
Rascal... has again left money for the whole week,
What does this crazy wanderer seek?
Where is my home?
He asks every passer-by.
Wanders with a smile... and a tear.
Wanders aimless from street to street.
Belonging to all.
Yet none to call my own.
Wanders aimless from street to street.

Dipped in rainbow colours, with voice of a nightingale.
With steps radiating sunlight, with palanquin of cooling shade.
Dipped in rainbow colours, with voice of a nightingale.
With steps radiating sunlight, with palanquin of cooling shade.
Seeking the moon amidst dark clouds.
Listening for the mute wind's song.
This friend of mine is everywhere.
Unseen to the eye, fragrant to the smell.
What does this crazy wanderer seek?
Where is my home?
He asks every passer-by.
What does this crazy wanderer seek?
With the beloved, no union, nor separation.
Prisoner of love, never unchained.
Your promise of appearing in a dream.
Keeps sleep far from my eyes.
The breath I take quickens.
My pulse becomes fainter still.

Excellent, Samar.
And something waiting... special, see...
Samar, you got my foie gras?
Your - fodegrass? You ask, I get.
Thank you, Samar, you always come through for me.
Look, if you ever get tired of this,
I have a job waiting for you in one of my restaurants,
Thank you, sir,
Fodegrass.
Ladies and gentleman, the newly engaged couple Roger and my beautiful daughter Meera.
Hey, aren't you that guy who sings that Challa song?
Yes, same to same, ma'am.
What are you doing here?
Madam, in your London it is very difficult to earn pounds, it is not possible to buy food with one job, so double shift.
So, sir Jesus did not listen to you?
What?
That day in the church, you told sir Jesus, to make that boy not like you, but today it is your arrangement...
Engagement.
Yes, yes, same.
How do you know all this?
That day outside the church,
I'm cleaning snow.
Listening to others' confessions is not a good thing, and for your information on that day it did not work out with that boy, so sir Jesus did listen to me like always
I have known Roger for many years, he's a really nice guy, and I am very happy.
It does not look like it.
What the f...?
It's the biggest day of my life today, and I am very, very happy, got it?
Not got, because when that nice guy, was making you wear the ring, you were not looking into his eyes, you were looking at everyone else... and now, you've left your own engagement celebration, and are sitting here alone, why?... and why are you trying to explain your decision to a stranger?
Go... got it.
Come on Meera uncle's going nuts looking for you.
Will... I found her.
What the f...
The new logo will reflect the ideals and images of both chains, a total of 25 new supermarkets will be opened in six new towns and the whole merger and expansion will take six months.
Thank you.
Well done. Roger, you've thought about everything
I think it's time for me to think about my retirement,
I am turning 50, best time to retire,
When is your Golden Jubilee?
Meera, we should plan a big party.
Don't worry, I've been planning this party for more than a year now, it's going to be the most special party for the most special father.
Yes, and after that my daughter will get married and then, from a very special father
I'll turn into a very lonely father.
But that will only happen if I leave you alone, after our marriage
Roger will stay with us.
When did this happen?
Just now, just a small little clause I've added in the contract and it's non negotiable.
Sorry Roger, she's gone on me, a very stubborn business woman, you will have to deal with it
I am trying, I am trying.
Here, 500 pounds, for an hour of your time every day, for one month.
Who do I have to kill?
You'll have to teach me how to sing.
Why do you want to learn how to sing from me?
My Dad's from Jalandhar, and he's always wished that I could speak Punjabi, but I was never able to learn it.
It's his 50th birthday next month and I want to surprise him by singing a Punjabi song, like the kind that you sing, so will you teach me?
That way 500 pounds will turn my life around, but if I take these then
I may also completely turn around.
I'll explain.
My mother has taught me, never take money for teaching someone, so now you understanding my problem?
So in that case teach me without taking money.
Madam, I only look like, but I am not that big a fool, not dumbo.
Fine.
Okay, one minute, one second, can we do a deal?
I teach you beautiful Punjabi song and return gift you teach me good gentleman's English this is now fair and handsome deal ma'am, in one month you singing like the Nightingale Lata Mangeshkar, for your father's birthday and I speak fit-fat constipation with the white in full tip-top English.
Conversation.
Same to same.
Done, done, London let's do it.
Done, done, London.
Sorry.
Please make sure my Punjabi rocks,
I wish that day to be Dad's happiest day.
Please help me and I promise...
I promise...
I will never smoke again... ever.
O good... good morning.
Salmon, salmon... salmon!
Salmon... salmon!
SALMON!
Steak for the lady and
Salmon for the gentleman, enjoy.
Meera.
Meera listen, I was joking...
Excuse me sir you haven't paid.
Meera I don't have money.
Sirsa is the name of my village, in Punjab.
My father and forefathers all served in the army, but in some war or other they gave their lives fighting.
When it was my time my mother refused to let me join, she somehow saved up money and sent me here.
She had this unsaid faith in me and felt that I'd do well here.
She says that I can win people's love and those who can win love will never lose.
Solid maternal instant.
Instinct.
Instant.
Okay, what eves...
Come, please come, bon appetite.
Come, come in,
Bon appetite...
Do you come here every Friday?
Yes!
Just here?
No, there's a Bangladeshi orphanage that I go to on Mondays.
And...
On Wednesdays
I go to a women's shelter.
And...
A senior citizens' home on Sundays.
And...
That's it.
That's it...
Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, they're all wasted, very bad.
Mother Teresa gave up her whole life, oye, explain something to this girl.
Oye, fatty, how much will you eat, start a diet, come all, free food for everyone.
How much you give is how much you get,
I've learnt this in life, but if everybody keeps asking for more and no one gives back, then how will anything be shared?
To get something you have to lose something.
So that's why you keep making deals with sir Jesus.
Not deals... prayers that I make earnestly, and that's why your sir Jesus has agreed to everything I've told him.
Okay, so tell Him to teach you how to sing.
Don't worry,
I've already spoken to Him.
Really...
Sir Jesus knows Punjabi too?
No friends, do not call me Heer
I am Sahiban now.
Let any Mirza come on a horse...
This is so not fair,
I've managed to improve your English so much and you're not able to teach me even one song.
You've already learnt how to sing, you're also speaking perfect Punjabi, the tune is also fine.
What's the problem then?
The problem is that there is no joy when you sing, only fear, you're scared this white woman will be disturbed.
Scared that these guys playing football, will think you've runaway from some poor Indian village.
Come on, if you can't sing in front of two or three strangers, how will you sing to a hundred people at the party?
Oh f... off!
Now this you enjoyed doing.
Miss Meera Thapar, the girl you are when you act dignified, you're not, you're that girl who sneaks out to smoke a cigarette, and keeps cussing this what the f...?
What the f...? word.
I am not that girl
I need your phone please, excuse me, one second.
Hello Maria, Samar this side, yes I want you to bring a friend of mine to the tunnel tonight ok, she will call you... and Maria... she is a little shy type so make her like you, little sexy, un dos tres, ok bye
Maria works in the restaurant with me and every Sunday night all of us party together.
You have the number in your phone, call her after six.
And no one knows you there... so forjust one night listen to your heart.
Why are you doing this?
Because I want to show you who you really are.
Un dos tres...
Come on babe.
Hey Maria!
Oh hi.
What's up?
I'll will be right back.
Go get her tiger!
Hey Maria!
Hi...
I'll be right back.
Hello...
I'm Raj, you are?
Tina...
Italian?
Indian.
You don't look Indian at all.
And you look completely Indian.
Why?
You don't like Indian men?
They're very boring,
I like a bit of danger in a man.
So then this place is like a buffet for you, and in any case since you've come they're all just waiting for your cue.
Take your pick
I don't see anybody here, somebody who'd walk side by side with me, who'd look into my eyes and steal my heart.
Best of luck, Indian girl.
Raj...
You give up too easily
I wasn't even trying.
Why, you don't like me?
I like you, but at the moment you're looking for something else.
When you get tired you'll come back here.
And if I don't?
You'll come because for someone who'd walk by your side, for someone who'd look into your eyes, for someone who'd steal your heart, there's no one else here.
Come on Meera, you've got to see this.
Love is all. Love is sweet.
Welcome to the world of love.
Love is all. Love is sweet.
Welcome to the world of love.
Come, look me in the eye.
My heart is on fire.
Come, just a little closer.
Welcome to the world of love.
Love is all.
Love is sweet.
Love is all. Love is sweet.
Welcome to the world of love.
Burning with love is bliss.
Let your breath mingle with mine.
Tonight is our night of love.
Tomorrow it belongs to another.
Let's toss the moon like a coin.
See what lands, your face or my life.
Love is all.
Love is sweet.
Love is all. Love is sweet.
Welcome to the world of love.
Come, look me in the eye.
My heart is on fire.
Come, just a little closer.
Welcome to the world of love.
Love is all.
Love is sweet.
Love is an unstoppable river.
Float on its waves and see.
Step lightly on a cloud.
Your feet will find no ground.
The heart is without borders.
No lines can divide it.
Love is all.
Love is sweet.
Love is all. Love is sweet.
Welcome to the world of love.
Come, look me in the eye.
My heart is on fire.
Come, just a little closer.
Welcome to the world of love.
Love is all.
Love is sweet.
Love is all.
Love is sweet.
I've had the best time of my life, Samar, thank you so much, thank you, thank you, thank you.
You know you're actually this bad ass girl, how you were born into such a fancy family, I can't understand.
If I'm that bad, don't be friends with me.
Who wants to be friends?
Now that I have fallen for you, what do I do about that?
I'm not joking,
I have really fallen in... love.
It's this bad ass behaviour of yours, hiding behind this well behaved suave person, that's trapped me.
Samar...
Yes, I know... you're getting married to that English guy, and now our contract is also over so there's no reason to meet.
So no tension, your train's come, you go your way and I go mine, the end.
This train terminates at Stanmore.
Meera...
If I kiss you... will you slap me?
I don't think you will slap me.
You didn't slap me, you didn't slap me.
O friends, do not call me Heer
I am Sahiban now.
Let any Mirza come on a horse... and abduct me.
O friends, do not call me Heer
I am Sahiban now.
Let any Mirza come on a horse...
I am just like him. He's just like me.
His laughter is like the morning sunlight.
Soothing darkness falls when he closes his eyes
I am just like him. He's just like me.
His laughter is like the morning sunlight.
Soothing darkness falls when he closes his eyes

O friends, do not call me Heer
I am Sahiban now.

Good evening, Meera.
I'm famished.
You want to eat?
Chum va fa.
So, Miss Meera Thapar, so you've also fallen in love.
You couldn't live without me for more than two days, right?
Let's do the done done London deal
I am going to get married... to Roger, because that's what my father wants.
He's always given me everything I've ever wanted.
This is the first time he's asked something of me,
I can't say no to him.
My mother left my father and ran away with someone else,
I was twelve then.
My father has taken care of me by himself.
He has always fulfilled my wishes, we're the only family we have, there's no one else...
I haven't told this to anyone before now, not even Roger.
I'm telling you this because you have to help me.
Both of us, have to make a promise in front of Him, that we'll remain just friends and will never cross this line and if we break this promise,
He can punish us in any way He chooses
I can't be friends with you, Meera, but don't worry
I will never cross any line, and for that I don't need to make any kind of promise to God.
This isn't for you, Samar, this is for me, so that I don't make any mistake, so that I may not grow weak, so that I may not cross the line.
Please Samar, for me.
Walk by my side leaving a space between us.
Put your heart or hand there
I walk in the shade cast by your shadow.
Walk by my side leaving a space between us.
Put your heart or hand there
I walk in the shade cast by your shadow
I am just like him. He's just like me.
O friends, do not call me Heer
I am Sahiban now.
Let any Mirza come on a horse... and abduct me.
O friends, do not call me Heer
I am Sahiban now.
Let any Mirza come on a horse...
- Good morning ma'am.
- Good morning.
Here is a parcel for you.
My dearest Meera,
I read about your marriage in a magazine and couldn't help myself.
It's been so many years and not one day has gone by, when I haven't thought of you, but I promised your father that I would never contact you.
For all your birthdays.
I'd buy a gift, and write a long letter addressed to you and then put them both away in the cupboard, but this time I couldn't stop myself.
Every mother has a dream to dress her daughter in her wedding sari herself, but I know that...
I lost this right many years ago.
The wedding sari that I wore and came to your father's house,
I've kept very carefully for this day.
If you think it is okay, wear it,
I will feel like I am also a part of your wedding
I know that you hate me, but I pray to God everyday, hoping that one day you'll forgive me.
Lots and lots of love and lots of happiness, your mother, Pooja.
Punjab, as English say,
Bob Dylan was from there,
Babbar Singh Dhillon, Bob became Bub.
So now what do you want to do?
I don't know.
Meera doesn't know, but Tina knows what to do.
Should we go?
What are you doing?
The same thing you're doing.
Aren't you taking it a little too easy today?
These days you are so busy
I don't get a chance to spend time with you.
Even with you so close to me you're still not with me, awaiting your return
I can't see the end of the day.
Stop this boring poetry of yours, Imran.
- It's annoying.
- Okay.
Hey Miss P! Miss P!
Where is the fire, Henry?
Someone's waiting for you at the porch, Miss P.
For me?
I've no appointments today.
It's those people from the restaurant
I told them to come and sample the wines.
So why are they asking for me?
Because they're very boring, like you
I told them I'm mostly out and they should meet you.
It's not funny, Imran.
Listen
I love you
I know.
What's so hehehe, kiddo, you never said I love you to a girl before?
My baby...
I was 19 years old, when I married your father and came from India.
Until then I had learnt, that a girl goes from her father's home to her husband's, and that becomes her new life.
Your father was a very nice man, but I could never love him, and for a long time I didn't feel like anything was missing.
He was busy with his business and
I was busy bringing up my daughter, and then one day
I met Imran... and that's when... you fell in love.
Yes, I fell in love.
You were four then that's why I stopped myself... but when you turned twelve
I gave up and I went away with Imran.
By then I understood one thing, if you aren't happy yourself, you can never keep others happy... never.
You know...
When I told Imran
I do not want another child other than you, he smiled and said that we didn't need to get married, that he didn't need a piece of paper or the consent of a priest, to be with me for life.
He's crazy... just like me, that's probably why we can't survive without each other.
For all these years
I've only hated you.
But the fault was also mine...
No... it wasn't your fault.
A 12-year-old girl could not understand this, but a 21-year-old girl can, that what you did... was absolutely right
I missed you mama,
I missed you so much.
Oh, do you know, since, childhood I've wished someone would give me a doll like this?
Thank you, Pooja, thank you very much,
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.
Should I take you for a bike ride?
Come on, let's go.
Thank you, you've given mama so much love
I should actually thank you, it's been many years, that I've been clowning about, to make up for your absence, but now I can retire.
Now Pooja will never stop smiling.
Thank you for coming my child, thank you.
Can I ask you one thing?
Mama told me you waited eight years for her, without any promises.
How were you so sure that... you would be together one day?
Every love has its time.
That time was not ours, but that doesn't mean it wasn't love
I had faith in my love.
If God can bow down in the face of love, how does time stand a chance?
It had to change, thank you darling, thank you.
- Cheers Imran.
- Bye
I love you
I know.
Coffee
I love you,
I love you Samar,
I love you.
You're crossing the line, Meera
I love you.
As my breath mingles with yours
I can breathe again.
As my breath mingles with yours
I can breathe again.
The fragrance of your body touches my soul.
If you come near.
How long can I control my senses?
Let them fly if they will.
When has the heart walked the straight and narrow?
Let it wander if it will.
Lost in thoughts of you.
Solitude pleases me.
As my breath mingles with yours,
I can breathe again.
If the sweet night is spent by your side.
The dawn will break with light and air.
Since my eyes caught sight of you.
They brim over with you alone.
Touch me again and tell me... what did you wish for?
As my breath mingles with yours
I can breathe again.
The fragrance of your body touches my soul.
If you come near
I can breathe again.
If you come near.
Wish Charlotte a happy birthday for me, with a kiss
I am going to speak with papa today, he'll agree, won't he?
He'll agree, if he doesn't, call me.
I'll convince him with a kiss.
I'm leaving now, or because of your papa I'll loose my job.
Listen, what about mine...
Meera!!
I love you.
Samar!!
Madam!
Madam you cannot go through.
Just give me one minute... please, just give me one minute... just give me one minute... you don't understand...
You cannot come through here.
Stay here please.
Please, please, please... please God!
Please, please, please... please don't do this, please let him be okay, don't punish him for my mistake,
You keep him alive, don't let anything happen to him and I promise,
I promise I will never meet him, please God! Let him be okay
I promise... I promise...
Please bring him back and I promise You
I will never meet him again, after this I will never meet him, please, please, please, God
I will leave him forever.
Sir.
Please, bring him back...
Okay clear. Shock!
Shit ya, I still can't get through Meera's phone.
For four days she hasn't called, nor did she come to the hospital.
Do you think her father's upset with her, did you find out from her store?
Yes, the guard was saying that she hasn't come there either,
I don't know what the scene is.
Son of a... learn to make a simple cup of tea.
My friend, adjust for one more week, after that neither will I be here, nor my tea.
Why, you've got a job at
Buckingham Palace, as a guard?
No, ya, I am going back to Lahore.
Nothing is going to happen for me in London.
Till when will I live off your money and keep looking for a job?
And now Meera is also coming... so I called my mother and told her your son is useless... he's coming back.
Oh deal with it, what to do?
Kapoor Uncle, come in, think of it as your home, oh shucks.
Meera!
Shucks...
I'll... get that tea, that sugar,
I'll get something. Hello Meera.
- Bye.
- Bye.
So papa didn't agree?
I didn't speak with him.
So what were you doing all these days?
I was praying.
To sir Jesus?
Was it fulfilled?
Of course,
What did you ask for?
Your life.
And in return, what did you give up?
You!
What do you mean?
I prayed that He, by any means, keep you alive and in return, the one thing that is most precious to me,
I will leave that, forever.
You've gone mad?
Samar, please, it's been very difficult for me to come here to you
I realize that you think all this is rubbish, you won't understand, but this is my belief, that you were punished for my faults, that if I remain with you, your life... now no one can break this belief, neither you nor God
I have come here only to tell you that I am marrying Roger.
I've come to ask you for one thing... that if possible, leave this city, and go away somewhere far, please... for my sake.
You won't say anything?
Congratulations...
Done, done London.
- Samar, I'm sorry...
- Don't...
Don't...
What's this?
Call your mother and tell her that her son is not useless, that he's not coming back and also tell her that her other son is going back to India.
Ask her to pray for him
I am leaving all my money for you and going.
Now make something big out of it,
I'll come back one day to take my share.
I'll really miss that tea of yours, your friend, Samar, bye.
This isn't right, it's all wrong, completely wrong, the war between you and me has begun.
You stole my love from me...
I'll steal her belief from You.
She believes if I am not with her
I will live...
So from now on,
I will embrace death every day, let's see... till how long You keep me alive.
Thank you...
Samar Anand.
If you're Samar that means, there's also a Meera.
Why didn't you go back?
Didn't you meet Meera ever again?
Look soldier, I shouldn't actually involve myself in this, but I am already involved now.
You don't know me,
I'm a hardcore, kinda girl
I never cry and all, but your love story made me fully sentimental.
Look, I'm this 21 year old, from this instant make out, instant breakup generation.
First we have sex and then we think if it was love or not with these fundamentals of love there's solid confusion.
Soldier, all I want to know is, is there such kind of love?
What I mean is, if it's happened to you it could happen to anybody, maybe even me?
So tell me now, was all this true or just a story you wrote to pass time?
What's your name?
Akira!
From Japan?
Delhi.
You're cool... consider this a story and let it go you'll remain cool...
Arjun... do you love me?
Can you wait ten years for me?
No?
Then you don't stand a chance!
Put the phone down!
I give you this, soldier, if it's love it better be this way!
At least let me make a mock presentation, you're not going to regret this, please let me do it.
No! No! Akira, I can't allow it.
Please, Catherine, it's the chance of a lifetime.
No! It's too dangerous, you don't have enough experience, so just forget it.
C'mon you lot, get a move on, it's a wrap, we've got a flight to catch.
Please, Catherine, this is my dream since I was a kid... to work for Discovery Channel... travel, make films, features... please let me do it.
Alright, two weeks, that's it!
And you'll be on your own, you'll have to do the camera and the sound by yourself, and I'm making no promises
I get the first look at the footage and I get to decide if it's good enough for the channel.
Thank you!
Get off me, you mad woman!
I'll speak to General Natarajan
London! Iraq!
Afghanistan!
Drug wars in Mexico!
The whole frigging world...
Here comes Akira!
General Natarajan called himself.
This documentary will benefit the Indian Army a lot.
You know how difficult it is to recruit soldiers for the Bomb Squad.
So I felt that by hearing about stories of your bravery, by seeing you working, these youngsters will be motivated and want to become like you and it's only a matter of two weeks,
I appreciate your support on this.
Sir.
Akira Rai, Discovery Channel, reporting for duty, sir.
Is this stolen or for real?
It's a 100% authentic soldier, now for two weeks, wherever you go, I go.
How many more have come to die with you?
Just me, One Woman Crew.
C'mon eat...
Hello, I'm Captain Kamal Singh
Singh!
And I'm Captain Jagdeep Dewan.
Dewan!
Lieutenant Hari Krishnan, madam.
You can stop this formality of calling me madam,
I'm Akira, short and sweet Akira.
Hello, Akira!
Now that's perfect.
Now look, for the next two weeks
I am going to trouble you a lot, so for speaking excessively, for eating excessively, and for abusing uncontrollably,
I ask you'll to forgive me now
I have one question,
I just hope that you aren't as grumpy as your boss.
No, no, not at all, we are very jolly guys.
Then I am afraid we are going to have a lot of fun, guys.
By the way, where do I dump this stuff?
I will show you, I will show you.
Make sure the distance is maintained,
Miss Akira Rai.
Akira Rai reporting for duty, sir.
This action-packed army life is really exciting.
You will always remain behind this barricade, and 350 metres behind me.
If you break any rule you'll be sent back to the barracks, any doubts?
Can I listen to music on my lpod?
Is that a yes or no?
Oh man
Daisy Chain...
Yes sir.
Safe to disable cap.
Yes sir, I've checked it
I think there might be another switch Dewan.
Quite possible.
In sequence.
Cut cap.
Go in sequence.
Okay sir.
Where is this going?
No idea sir.
Let me check this.
Lowering seat.
Okay sir.
There's a switch Dewan.
Be careful sir.
Akira!!
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?
What did you think was going on, some film shoot, or some kind of adventure trip, that you'll go home and show off to your friends?
We are dealing with bloody bombs here.
Today, because of you, the lives of my entire team was compromised.
I'm sorry
350 metres I said.
Now you will not come with us, you'll go back from here.
No, soldier, I am not going back,
I am coming with you.
The road ahead is dangerous, you will not be able to manage.
Soldier, this is my life's one and only chance,
I'll cope with anything.
Please, I am sorry.
Akira!
Look, you're an okay girl, you're brave too, but this is not possible for untrained girls or boys.
Listen to me and... forget this story.
If I asked you to forget Meera, will you forget her?
There is always this one passion, that a person has for you it's Meera, for me my passion is your story,
I'm not going!
Sorry.
Oh Krishnan! Where is sir going?
Sir always goes for some quiet time after defusing a bomb.
Quiet!
O Akira, never mess around with a lion that's sleeping.
O Singhe, I haven't come here to shoot birds,
I've come here to shoot the Lion.
And this Lion I will shoot for sure.
- Dewan.
- Yes.
Keep the chicken cooking,
I'll be back in a bit.
What does this crazy wanderer seek?
Where is my home?
He asks every passer-by.
Wanders with a smile... and a tear.
Wanders aimless from street to street.
Belonging to all.
Yet none to call my own.
Wanders aimless from street to street.
What does this crazy wanderer seek?
Where is my home?
He asks every passer-by.
What does this crazy wanderer seek?
You play around with bombs in the day, and sing romantic songs by night.
How is it possible not to fall in love with you?
You wait, in two weeks you will sing
Punjabi songs for Akira, this is my challenge, good night, sexy.
What the...
Sorry... ball.
Afzal.
Oh shucks, the camera broke.
No ya, Akira, now this will not work, and we won't get these parts even in Jammu, this can be fixed only in Delhi.
I'm sorry, Akira I'm... I'm...
Hey it's okay,
Krishnan, it's not your fault.
After seeing my Messi like kick, anybody would have dropped the camera, and in any case where was
Discovery Channel going to take me?
It was just a one-off chance
I was taking.
Okay good night.
Soldier,
Akira's entertainment was only till here, tomorrow morning it's about-turn, back to Delhi, finally you get rid of me, at least now give me one sexy smile.
Fine then, remain grumpy.
Oye, Akira, at least eat your food.
No ya, Singhe, I'm not hungry.
Both of you'll eat.
No sir.
Fine don't eat.
Akira! Smile...
And now we have.
Discovery Channel's Oscar-winning film-maker miss Akira Rai, a few words for your fans...
Hey! How is it fixed?
Samar did it, he's an electronics genius, he worked all night on it.
Where's that genius?
Why are you so complicated?
Neither can one fully hate you nor love you.
Actually I've understood now, after seeing me in my swimsuit, you've changed your mind, now I've started looking hot to you, right?
Don't give me such intense looks, soldier, it fills me with this weird kind of sensation.
Stop talking rubbish or
I'll break the camera again.
First tell me... why did you stay up all night and fix my camera?
You spoke about passion.
When someone is passionate about something and doesn't get it, he spends a lifetime going mad chasing it.
There's one mad man standing in front of you, there is no place here for another mad person, so pick your camera, fulfill your passion and leave.
Try as hard as you can, you won't save me from going mad.
Towards me, more towards me.
Nice, nice.
A little bit, a little bit.
Let me see the device.
Yup.
Exactly!
What's happened, Dewan?
Sir, it's bang in the centre of the bridge.
Any timer?
Yes, sir, and the wires go to the dynamite through the relay.
They're wrapped around cans filled with Anfo.
Ya.
Oye Kurusawa, come fulfill your passion.
Wow great!
You're not scared?
I'm hanging here with
'The man who cannot die', literally!
There's no chance of being scared, your destiny is working on a strike rate of 100%, boss.
In our line of work destiny betrays you just once.
Don't worry, today's not that day,
'cause I have no plans of dying so quickly
I have to make many more documentaries and show them in every country in the world,
I have to have sex with guys with different accents.
Did you grow up reading the Kama Sutra?
Is this all you think of?
Soldier, at my age, this is all we think of.
When I grow older like you,
I'll start thinking of love, being a good citizen, the ways of God, okay?
Okay.
By the way, soldier, do you plan on being in love with Meera all your life, or is there a chance for someone else in between?
There's a mind blowing offer, do you want to hear it?
Is there a choice?
No.
Make me your girlfriend.
Why?
I'm young... I'm entertaining...
I'm sexy, you've already checked my body out, actually I'm like a jackpot for you it's a limited offer... think about it.
Soldier, soldier, listen...
I never ask God for anything, so by making promises and all and leaving you is out of the question
I made you laugh, you're mine now.
Away I go, carried on wings of passion.
Drinking droplets of time.
My heart has flown from its cage.
Falling in love with myself.
Embracing life with open arms.
Away I go, carried on wings of passion.
My heart has flown from its cage.
Falling in love with myself.
Embracing life with open arms.
Clasping the moment in your fingertips like a butterfly.
As it takes wing it leaves traces of colour.
The moment moves on, leaving its colour behind, Akira
I clasp another moment as it takes flight.
Embracing life with open arms.
Away I go, carried on wings of passion.
My heart has flown from its cage.
Falling in love with myself.
Embracing life with open arms.
So Major Samar Anand, the last question of our trip, why haven't you worn a bomb suit till now?
Bomb suits are meant to protect you from danger, to protect you from getting hurt, or being wounded, but more than bombs it's life, that hurts you, at every corner there's betrayal, some pain... so if we don't wear bomb suits to save us from the dangers of life, what's the point of wearing it to save us from death?
Every day, life kills us a little, a bomb will kill us just once.
Okay soldier, that's a wrap, the end of my film and your torture.
Are you checking me out?
I was thinking how wrong I was about you.
I'd thought that you wouldn't last more than two days with us, but you turned to be really tough boss.
Have you ever asked me anything about myself?
All you gave were intense angry looks.
I'm a national level swimmer, a state level tennis player,
I can run a kilometer in four minutes,
I'm a deep sea diver, basically I'm Super Girl, make me do anything.
So, there's nothing that you can't do?
There's one thing.
What?
I couldn't make you fall for me.
There, you've started again.
I'm in love with you, Samar.
Totally, completely, madly,
Akira has fallen flat in love with you.
There's no need to say anything,
I know you're not at all interested, and it's... it's totally cool.
Until now, boys have always run after me,
I've never run after anybody, but you're this special piece, ya.
In my generation
I'll never find a lover like you, and now that I've met you,
I can't love someone lesser than you, so basically, I'm screwed, boss.
You deliver dialogues just like me, just... don't end up falling in love like me... because if your laughter, this mischief, this abusive language, stops, this world will surely lose something.
Where do these come from?
Krishnan!
See you, Akira.
Dewan!
Bye Singhe.
Take care, Akira.
Don't worry, I'm not going to cry.
Ya ya, I know, you're super girl.
That I am.
Take care of yourself, don't die or anything like that ours is going to be a deadly love story.
You're not going to change.
There's no chance
I don't want these friendly hugs, if you want to kiss me, then do that.
This was a kiss?
That's how the army's taught us.
You wait, let me come back, and show you how to kiss for real.
Really?
I'll see you...
Come on, we have to reach Baramullah in one hour control your emotions otherwise the bomb will be out of control.
So if we don't wear bomb suits to save us from the dangers of life, what's the point of wearing it to save us from death?
Every day, life kills us a little, a bomb will kill us just once.
You made the bitch cry!
I love it!
I'm going to make sure they run this.
Get off me you stupid girl before I change my mind.
We are going to title it
'The Man Who Cannot Die'
I want it to be the lead for the September issue, so Akira, put him on a flight and get him to London as soon as possible, the big boys will want to authenticate his story.
Does he have to come here for that?
I mean, can't we just do this there?
For a story done by a rookie, no, just get him here.
He won't come!
Why the hell not?
He just won't.
Listen girl, I don't run this company but I do know that if he doesn't get his arse over here, your story stays in the edit room, you've got 24 hours to get back to me.
In the name of God!
Soldier, they've flipped it after seeing your story, they want to make it the cover story for the September issue and sign me for a starting salary of 25 thousand quid and a three-3 year contract.
Okay congratulations, super girl you made me famous before I died.
But soldier... there's a small... problem.
What problem can you have?
The problem is that this story, this contract, all this, will happen only if you come to London.
This is my first story and I'm new, so it's their system it can't be changed.
It's only for one day, soldier, in twenty-four hours you'll be back in India, I promise
I know it's not easy for you, but my life is at stake here, my career will get at least a 5 year kick start, please soldier, for me!
I can't come!
Sorry Akira!
It's okay.
What an arsehole!
He's not an arsehole, John.
So what's his problem then?
He's just... messed up, it's a long story.
Are you heading back?
Ya, I mean, it's been a week since Catherine's been trying to convince the bosses, but... it's not working, so I guess I'm back to Delhi's belly.
What an arsehole!
Hello?
How many offices do these
Discovery Channel guys have?
I am standing at a cross road,
I can't understand where to go.
Where are you?
I am standing somewhere near the Discovery Channel office, all the buildings look the same.
You, you wait right there, I'm coming.
He... is... here!
I told you he is not an arsehole.
Sorry.
Thank you soldier, thank you,
Thank you soldier, it's a big deal that you've come to London, I know this, but that you've come here for me is the biggest thing in my life.
Don't get sentimental,
I haven't come for you,
I've come to set you here, permanently, so that I'm free from you for forever.
No chance, soldier, so far this story has been one-sided, now it looks like there's going to be a twist in the story.
Akira!!
Move, move.
Samar, Samar, can you hear me,
Samar... are you a doctor?
Can someone please call a doctor?
Can someone please call an ambulance?
Samar, Samar, Samar, what do I do?
Samar!
Excuse me, sorry he's asking for you.
Where's Meera?
It's okay, Samar.
Can you call Meera please... the other nurse said she is waiting outside for me...
Will you call her... will you call her please.
Nurse... will you please call Meera?
You said she is waiting for me...
I... I need to see her now...
Why aren't you going to him?
I need to see her.
I'm not Meera!
What's wrong!
Why aren't you calling Meera?
Go get Dr. Khan.
Is she okay?
Has something happened to her?
Why aren't you saying something?
Please, I...
Call Meera please
I need to see Meera.
Good morning, Samar!
I'm Dr. Zoya Ali Khan,
Last night I operated on you, how are you feeling now?
Full name?
Samar Anand.
Age?
28 years.
What year are we in, Samar?
Has Samar been in an accident or gone through serious trauma before this?
10 years ago there was an accident... here in London... after that he's come back to London for the first time.
That explains it,
Samar is suffering from retrograde amnesia he has regressed ten years, his memory, is stuck in the year 2002 the trauma of this accident has regressed his memory to the previous accident, he remembers everything up until the previous accident, but after that he remembers nothing.
But he'll... become okay, won't he?
In cases like these, it's impossible to say, some patients get their memory back in a day and for some... never!
So... now?
Firstly we will have to bring in the people he knew when he is with the people he trusts, his shock and trauma will both lessen and then we might be able to bring him back.
These are some names, addresses and numbers, Samar has given,
I don't know if these are still valid, but if you find as many as possible, it will help... and yes, the most important is this girl,
Meera!
Samar's been asking for her, since yesterday.
Aye soldier, why so much drama, just to forget me?
But now you listen, do what you want,
Akira won't let you forget her.
Honey, honey look into the camera.
You look beautiful.
Hi daddy.
Hi...
Meera!
Yes!
I need to talk to you...
I'm sorry I... can't seem to place you.
No... ya... we've never met...
I'm Akira...
I just need a few minutes.
You know I'm extremely late for a meeting,
I'm really sorry, but would you mind making an appointment with my assistant...
I'm really sorry!
It's about Samar!
I know how difficult this is for you... you have a family... a husband... a daughter... but beside you, there's no one else who can do this.
Samar keeps asking for you, he only wants to see you.
The doctor feels if he see's you just once, meets you, he might be able to hear the truth... just come once, Meera... please... for Samar...
Meera, you'll have to handle Samar very carefully, his mental state is very delicate, any kind of shock or bad news could permanently damage his system and then bringing him back may be impossible and Meera, just remember... you are the bridge that joins Samar to the outside world.
Are you ready?
Shall we do this?
Great!
I'll just check on him and call you.
Thank you!
Seeing you makes me feel.
A departed dream returns to me.
Passing through that century-long night.
A burst of morning returns to me.
Keeping awake, crossing miles.
The dream held me by the hand.
Breath held for many years
I can breathe again.
As my breath mingles with yours
I can breathe again.
Samar, what's the last thing you remember before the accident?
Meera...
Meera is dressed in a sexy pink dress... her hair is open... she's smiling... watching me do stunts on my bike, and then suddenly a car slams into me and then...
Black!
Full black!
Samar, the accident you are talking about happened ten years ago and we're not in 2002, we are in the year 2012.
What!
Meera... this?
Samar!
Just listen to her.
Let me explain,
Samar because of the head injury you have amnesia,
Retrograde amnesia and it is very common with head injuries so please don't worry, with time you will remember everything, and you will become absolutely okay
I know you have a lot of questions that you want answers for.
Meera is with you and whenever you need me
I'm right outside, okay?
I'll see you
I don't understand, Meera...
10 years...
10 years!!
Samar It's ok... its ok...
We've been together for 10 years?
How long have we been married?
Five years
I want to remember everything... everyday, every second
I've spent with you...
I want to remember everything...
I... I want to remember everything...
No, ya Meera, no more... you've already done so much and to ask you for more of your time, to do all this drama
I don't feel right you have a family, a husband, a daughter.
Akira...
I'm not married.
And nor do I have any daughter...
I made a promise to leave Samar, not to get married...
Roger is an old friend and has always remained a friend.
He is divorced so... every year I help him arrange his daughter's birthday
I can't bear to see Samar like this, and I want to do whatever I can, but before that, it was necessary for me to tell you this
I love Samar, Akira, always have, always will, but I can never be his.
Now after knowing all this, what needs to be done... is up to you.
Samar was right,
I should have left his love story as just a story and forgotten about it
I was cool...
I would've remained cool, but I got trapped in his love so much, now I can't let it go.
Come... let's get him back and then beat him up together,
A nice bottle of Chilean Red?
Definitely, ya sure...
Is everything alright sir?
Yes very well thank you.
Okay,
All okay ma'am?
Thank you
Maria, Mrs. Smith has been waiting for 45 minutes.
If she's asked for
Maria's special of the day then she will have to wait for it to be special, now leave me alone.
Superb, here's getting married to a white...
Meera...
Zain, if you can't do this feel free to say so, we realize that we're probably asking for a bit too much.
Too much?
No, Akira, you're asking for too little.
This restaurant, my house all of it is Samar's
I started all this with the money that he gave me, otherwise how would this
Lahori have done all this?
He told me that he'd come one day to take his share but not like this...
You'll don't worry,
Maria and I will shift into our old Wembley flat.
The restaurant, the house is all Samar's from now, just tell me when are you bringing him.
Tomorrow...
So as Samar used to say, done, done, London...
Done, done, London...
Thank you, Zain.
Oh never mind.
What are you looking at?
London... we're growing older but this city is getting younger.
What were you saying... we have our own restaurant?
Yes, sir! Samar's Kitchen, it's amongst the top
10 restaurants in London.
I'd never imagined, that we'd have our own restaurant, a bungalow, a car...
Accidently God's been too kind.
I think that's why He's making things even now.
Oye, He is letting you rest for a while, nothing else.
Don't get too emotional or we'll meet with another accident.
Everything else I can understand.
One thing I can't understand, is how did you hook Maria?
PPK... Pakistani Pathan's charisma.
So now Lahore's famous because of you.
Here you go, we've come home.
Meera, here, take care of your prized possession,
I will come with Maria tomorrow... bye.
Now you've left Sir Jesus and you're making deals with Shree Krishna...
So what should I do, if you meet with one accident after another?
I'll have to, keep all the Gods happy.
No more accident's, I promise okay.
Come, my wife, show me my home.
We live alone in such a big house, or is there someone else on rent here?
Did we win a lottery?
How is sir Jesus doing?
How are the deals coming along?
I've stopped making deals and vows.
Now I don't ask for anything of anybody.
Wow, how did this happen?
I got you, so there is no need to ask for anything else.
You love me that much?
What?
Doctor Khan has said, for a couple of days no...
Oh man.
But I've got injured on my head, and Dr Khan is a neurologist, not a sexologist
I think she's a lesbian...
Meera!
Come here.
Have you become more beautiful than before?
Why does it feel like
I am meeting you after so many years?
Touching you after so many years.
No, no, no, stay here, just stay here.
Dr Khan's allowed this much, hasn't she?
Dr Khan...
Dr Khan has become Changez Khan, give me her telephone number, being a woman, she doesn't have the heart of a mother
I can't do this any more.
Please, Meera... just a few more days...
Dr Khan is saying that
Samar is recovering very well, his mental condition is very stable and that very soon something may trigger his memory
I can't go on, Akira, doctor, please you...
I understand...
I do.
Ideally I wanted to take this step after two weeks... but maybe this is the right time...
Akira, you will meet Samar, maybe seeing you will trigger his memory immediately.
Yes, this is slightly risky but at this point it is our best chance
I think it's time... for Major Samar Anand... to meet Akira!
Zain, I don't want to do this interview, you're unnecessarily forcing me.
Samar, it's not just any interview, these are the Discovery Channel guys, they're covering the success story of 10 Indians in London, imagine how good marketing it is for our restaurant.
What marketing!
Instead make me wear a bikini and put its photo outside the restaurant?
Hey, that is also a good idea.
You're excited uh Pathan, PPK.
Hey that's my Bluetooth.
Here, we've come.
Why have you stopped here?
The channel guys want to start off, from the first place you worked in London.
Now go quickly, theirjournalist is waiting at the entrance for you, and I have to go to the restaurant, okay.
Bye.
For one who can't remember anything, what interview will she take of his.
Samar Anand!
Hi, I'm Akira Rai, Discovery Channel.
Have... have we met before?
No! I don't think so.
I'm sorry, my memory is on a long break so these days every face looks familiar to me.
It's okay, Samar,
I know about your condition don't worry, I won't trouble you much.
No, no, no, please trouble me, maybe that might help trigger some lost memory.
Okay then, get ready for the trouble.
Make up okay?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Let's go?
Over here,
I use to clean snow, for 4 pounds per hour for Jack sir... this is a very special place for me Akira... right?
Not because this was my first job, but because this is where I saw Meera for the first time... right there.
In the middle of white snow, like a fairy dressed in red, glide across the snow.
It took one second and
I fell flat for her... you haven't seen my wife, hmm?
She's the world's most beautiful woman,
I have no idea how she fell for a clown like me.
Oh wow, this is my favourite bike,
I had this, I bought it second-hand from a friend.
May I ride it, please?
Thank You, you're also coming?
Come on
I was a manager in this restaurant, this whole restaurant.
Samar!
How are you?
This is Akira,
Amit I found work in Bollywood.
- Really!
- Ya.
No!
Thank you.
If it wasn't for Frank sir, I would probably have gone back to Punjab and join the army like my father and forefathers
I never told my mother but bombs and guns really scare me
Frank Sir, he saved me, thank you, Frank sir.
Samar was my favourite... he could charm anyone...
Salmon, my favourite.
Enjoy.
He just enjoyed making people happy.
Okay Akira, I worked double shift here.
These are my friends,
- Hi guys.
- Hi
- Hello.
This is Gabbar, this is Sambha, this is me... and this is Basanti!
What is wrong with you?
What does this crazy wanderer seek?
Where is my home?
He asks every passer-by.
Wanders with a smile... and a tear.
Wanders aimless from street to street.
Belonging to all
I wrote this song for Meera... and see my fate... it was an evening just like this,
I was singing... and when I opened my eyes.
Meera was standing in front of me.
For who my heart sung this song, it reached out and found her heart.
Isn't it a made-for-each-other love story?
Come on guys.
O dude cool good to see you.
A note for you.
What does this crazy wanderer seek?
Today I met Samar Anand, a man who I had never met before, the Samar that
I know is like... a ghost, a shadow, that's not alive.
Samar lives only to love you, without you there's no breath in his life.
You know!
I was thinking the whole day that if we were in his life together the same time, what would happen, and even in my dreams,
I was miles behind you.
You don't know me,
I've been a topper all my life, an honour student, a gold medalist in every sport...
I dump my boyfriends every three months, before they leave me, because I can't handle rejection.
So now before Samar recovers and lectures me on friendship and all,
I am getting out of this love... it'll take time but then I'll be okay,
So I've come to tell you that, if it's because of me that you're stopping yourself, then you're wasting time, because I've never existed in Samar's love story.
His love story's always had Meera and will only have Meera in it
I wasn't stopping myself because of you, Akira.
It is because of Samar
I'm stopping myself.
Everyday I want to break my promise and fall into his arms, but what if something happens to him?
It is this if that scares me and why I stop myself.
Everyday I pray for his life and every day I die a little.
Now this... God, prayers, promises and all,
I don't understand...
I really don't pray much... but before going there's one tip I'm giving you...
You left him so that he stays alive, but now if you're not with him he is as good as dead maybe your God's trying to tell you,
Hey Meera, enough is enough, now go and live a little.
See you.
Ya, Zain.
Samar, our new restaurant's site is in front of
Marble Arch Station, okay?
Okay, you get there,
I'll catch the train and come.
Okay come quick.
Ladies and gents we need to evacuate this station come this way,
Everybody come on this way start moving up this way.
Everybody up this way - Due to a reported bomb aboard the train, all passengers are requested to leave the station immediately, by the nearest available exit.
Please obey the instructions of the security personnel.
Due to a reported bomb... bomb... bomb.
Three minutes copy.
Mister you can't be here, there's a bomb on board you need to evacuate now.
Ten pounds symtex, possibly with shrapnel, not motion sensitive, remote detonator
Charlie... this guy might just know what he's talking about let him through.
Tango Victor 191 control.
The bomb has now been defused,
I repeat the bomb has now been defused.
Thank you so much.
What's your name Sir?
I'm Major Samar Anand!
Indian Army!
Bomb Disposal Squad.
Samar, what are you doing?
Why have you called me here?
For all the moments that
I have lost in the past, today I have come to steal back one moment, today I'm going to, once again, marry you.
Will you marry me, Meera?
Stop it, Samar, we can't just get married like this.
Why, why can't we?
You'd said this is how we got married, no celebrations, just you and me... so let's just do it again... for me.
Come on, I'll start.
I'm sorry, what I said last time or how
I don't remember, but all I will say this time is that I love Meera a lot and I promise that I will forever.
Stop it, Samar.
This is not a joke!
Wow, this is amazing, you've made our marriage a joke and lied about it and I can't even play a small little prank?
Memory is such a funny thing... we spend a whole lifetime trying to forget something but we can't and then if we try to remember some thing small we're unable to.
You know, Meera, everyday in the army I use to think, why is it that He keeps me alive?
Today I figured that out...
He wasn't fully satisfied with what He had done to me.
He first tears me away from your life,
He says go... go live without her.
So I go and everyday...
I live in the arms of
Death hoping to defeat God.
But out there also He kept winning,
He didn't let me die... and then one day, like magic,
He brings you back into my life,
He brings back all my lost memories,
He makes me fly again and then in a flash he slams me back onto the ground.
He wakes me up from my dreams and tells me, your life is exactly how it is,
Meera is still Mine, she will never be yours, because even till today, the promise she made to Me, is greater than the promise she made to you, there's this simple little thing you don't seem to understand, more than you, she's in love with Me.
If you'd at least left me for another person,
I would've felt pity and forgiven him.
But... how do I feel pity for God?
I'm going back,
I spent 10 years without you.
By loving you every single day,
I can live for another 100 years.
Either... either He kills me, or then accepts defeat and sends you to me.
Samar...
Your passport, ticket... immigration form,
I'll fill it for you... but the immigration is there...
My memory is back now, remember?
I wish I could delete you from my memory
I was such a heartless carefree bitch and now see what you've made me.
Akira, the thing is,
God and me don't get along too well, but while dying I believe
He listens even to His enemies, so when my time comes,
I'll ask Him for another life, to love you!
This time around I was born in the wrong generation,
I became a bit old fashioned, no?
But I promise next time.
I'll come as a modern lover like you, and ours will be a full on
English style love story.
Very good soldier, you've made me into a complete romantic and you're turning modern.
If you want to come, come back exactly like this, from head to toe,
Akira will never have a shortage of boyfriends in any life.
Don't become like me...
Too late soldier.
Too late.
Inform the other vehicles only after I give the "All Clear" signal.
Alright. Over and out.
We are safe.
Okay, sir.
- Krishnan.
- Yes, sir.
Same again...
Everything's become so common these days
I suggest... that you support the bridge.
Okay, sir.
Am I going to die today?
You didn't bear these 10 years all by yourself Samar,
I've been dying everyday along with you... it's taken me 10 years to understand a simple thing, that He didn't keep you alive to be without me,
He kept you alive to be with me.
Couldn't you have understood this a little sooner... just a little.
You knew this from the beginning, that I take a little more time to understand things, and someone had told me that every love has it's time, that time, was not ours, but this, is our time.
Sir we've located another lED.
Wait for some more time,
I'll finish a bit of work and come back.
And listen!
Don't pray for anything just love me... because there's no bomb, or God, that can keep me from coming back to you
I know.
Samar Anand, The Man Who Cannot Die!
He has defused 107 bombs without a scratch on his body.
He's right now as we speak defusing his 108th.
This is not a story of courage, its not a story of... miracles!
Its just a simple story of love, undying love that a man had for a woman, unflinching love that a woman had for a man, and unending faith that God had on their love
I got into this story thinking that this was my big ticket to Discovery channel,
I'm going to discover a story of courage, bravery, danger, miracles.
But I ended up discovering love.
Love that breaks you, but still keeps you together, love that creates distances, but still brings you closer, love that is true, and forever... and I learnt that, if you have the power to love like that, then God makes sure that your love finds its way.
All you have to do is just hang in there and wait... wait for your time.
As we speak right now.
Samar is defusing his 108th bomb, his last one, its his last not because he's suddenly scared of dying, it's his last, because it's his time to live now, his wait is finally over... his time has come... his time to love!
Will you marry me?
Yes...
This is not a story of courage!
It's not a story of miracles!
It's just a simple story of love!
RUSSIAN ARK
I open my eyes and I see nothing,
I only remember there was some accident,
Everyone ran for safety as best they could,
I just can't remember what happened to me,
How strange, Where am I?
Marie, I must tell you something.
Judging by the clothes, this must be the 1800s,
Where are they rushing to?
What if we are denied entry?
I've never been so frightened!
Don't forget, the girl in white is mine.
Where are you all going?
It's cold! CIose the doors!
Quickly!
Move ahead!
I went Iooking for the right way to go.
Those officers don't know the way,
Can it be that I'm invisible?
Or have I simply gone unnoticed?
Can it be? Has all this been staged for me?
Am I expected to play a role?
What kind of play is this?
Let's hope it's not a tragedy,
What does it all mean?
-Where should we go?
-Maybe here?
No, it's there.
That man in black,,,, He wanders about, too,
He nods to me but goes away,
Pardon me for speaking before we've been properly introduced.
What city is this?
What city? Well, everyone speaks Russian,
I so hoped this was Chambord during the Directoire period.
-What Ianguage are we speaking?
-Russian,
Russian?
How strange! I never knew Russian before.
What are they doing in there?
Shall we enter?
-Where? There?
-Yes, something is going on,
No, I have to find out what on earth I am doing here.
These wanderings about, this knowing Russian....
I want to Ieave.
Your curiosity is not amusing.
Could all this be theatre?
Farewell!
Our paths must part.
Farewell.
You have answered all my questions.
-Farewell then,
-Where does this door Iead to?
What a pity,
We will never meet again,
He was obviously a foreigner,
Why would he be so rude otherwise?
It's best,,, not to get involved in this,
Let's not disturb them,
In any case, it's much too late,
Sir, sir! I'm here,
My Russian cicerone! Do you know the way?
-Yes, let's go together,
-This is your country.
Yes, but not my century,
How did I come to be here?
I think I saw Peter the Great,
I hear delight in your voice.
Was it interesting?
Yes, very interesting,
Really,
In Asia, tyrants are adored.
The more terrible the tyrant, the more his memory is cherished.
AIexander the Great, Timur... and your Peter the Great.
You're wrong about Peter,
He taught Russians to enjoy themselves,
A spiral staircase.
Where has everyone disappeared to?
I see. But why?
What's so interesting up there?
You'll see,,,
Peter ordered his son's execution.
The same man who taught the people to enjoy Iife. How funny!
I thought you knew where we were going,
He built a European city over a swamp.
He introduced order of the most primitive kind.
-Where are they going?
-But the city is still European!
To a party. But why the back staircase?
They were taught to have fun,
So they go to parties,
And the officer and the Iady?
-At the party,
-Where are they?
They've gone to the underworld.
Down, down, down!
And they are no more.
Be careful. The stairs are steep and dark.
Thank you, I can see,
Do you see where we are?
No, I don't know yet,
Sir, be careful!
Don't betray our presence,
No need to remind me.
Do not forget I brought you here.
Please don't get involved in anything,
And you, do not get too close to the actors.
Bend towards me. You are beautiful.
-Do you remember?
-Yes.
Good.
-Why are you pushing me?
-Don't scratch me!
-Why is she pushing me?
-You are pushing, too.
What an impressive orchestra!
They must be Europeans!
No, they're Russian musicians,
No, Europeans!
Italians!
They're Russians, for God's sake!
So?
I say it's good.
Very good!
I need to piss!
I can't hold it in anymore!
No, no, don't, don't....
Ah! Yes, yes.
Sir, sir!
Don't yell!
-Where are you?
-Here. It's only Catherine the Great.
Follow me!
I Iove the 18th century.
A time of genius and manners.
I would have to agree with you,
-Never contradict me.
-Very well,
Where's the Empress? Gone!
Russia is Iike a theatre. A theatre.
Careful!
I think I know where we are.
How pretentious they are!
Don't Iag behind, sir.
I'm not, I think we're speaking too loudly,
No matter. They're completely deaf.
I'm careful. I won't touch anyone.
Theatre.... What actors!
And those costumes!
Thank you, sirs. Thank you.
They can't see me.
This seems Iike the Vatican.
Is that where we are?
Those reliefs are painted, are they not?
What naturalism!
Weren't those decorations inspired by Raphael's sketches?
Raphael, yes,
Better than the Vatican,
This is Saint Petersburg,
So they're copies?
Your authorities don't trust your own artists.
Russians are so talented at copying!
Why?
Because you don't have ideas of your own.
Your authorities don't want you to have them.
In fact, they are as Iazy as all the rest of you.
Lazy!
There was a painting gallery here.
-On the upper floor,
-With 111 Italian paintings.
-But not the best masters.
-Not the best,
The tsars were mainly Russophiles,
But sometimes even they dreamed of Italy,
Wasn't the Hermitage created to satisfy those dreams?
-Raphael isn't for you.
-Not for us,
-For Italy.
-Italy,
-It's warm there!
-Warm,
What beauty!
The small Italian gallery....
Who are these people?
Of which milieu are they?
Do you see that vase?
Yes! Empire style is everywhere.
-And those Voronikhine lamps,
-Lamps....
Empire, Empire, Empire!
I have no enthusiasm for it.
That style is too silly.
Don't forget it was born under Bonaparte.
Then it became fashionable here... to the point of becoming the national style... to the detriment of its originality.
We battled Napoleon, not the Empire style,
Who are they? Who are these people?
Petersburgers, of when the city was no longer a capital,
It's better that way.
A capital city should be... an ancient city Iike Moscow. Not a Chimera.
-Who are these people?
-Should I introduce you?
-Only if it's not impolite.
-No, they are friends,
Oleg Konstantinovich, medical professor,
Lev Mikhailovich, actor,
Shouldn't they rise?
My European friend, he is visiting Russia,
-My pleasure.
-He's European,
Medicine is a fine profession.
I haven't spoken for years.
Aside from my new accomplice.
Such a Iong time.... What is that odour?
Odour?
A curious odour.
Have you been in Saint Petersburg Iong?
Yes, for one hour.
-And you came straight here?
-I had my reasons.
You must Iove art!
Are you interested in beauty or just its representation?
No, Marquis. We're here to rest.
"Marquis"?
How do you rest?
Today, we've come together.
It smells of formaldehyde.
Formaldehyde,
Marquis, I'II show you a splendid painting.
These men are emitting a very strange odour.
Marquis, Iook at
The Birth of John the Baptist.
The Marquis smells of formaldehyde.
Is he alive?
No, it's you.
I know this painting.
I saw it on my Iast visit here.
It comes from Paris, from the Crozat collection.
Catherine II acquired it in 1772.
One of the earliest pieces of the Hermitage collection.
Such information is for specialists.
For us, detail is more interesting.
Look closely here.
A chicken and a cat are in the foreground.
They are symbolic figures.
The chicken represents greed, avarice... the cat, cynicism and cruelty.
Cynicism and cruelty,,,, The cat,,,,
They are both calmed by the birth of John.
How interesting.
Why is he dressed Iike that?
CIeopatra, for example....
What do you know of her?
Massimo Stanzione....
CIeopatra is on the same wall... as The Circumcision of Christ by the pious Lodovico Cardi.
-What bothers you?
-Bothers me?
Right next to Saint Cecilia?
Can you imagine!
By Carlo Dolci!
And next to Eastern Still Life!
-Why does that bother you?
-Don't argue, OIeg.
As a Catholic, that shocks me.
What do you think of Wagner?
Who is Wagner?
OIeg, he doesn't know Wagner!
Wagner is that child who behaved badly... with my best friend, Meyerbeer.
I have never Iistened to Wagner.
-Broaden your horizons!
-That doctor is so insistent!
-But I'm not sick!
-We wish you much success.
Sir, why are they badly dressed?
My friends, how could I think,,, that you would get along so badly?
I'll tell you one day,
I'm in a strange situation,
Why quarrel with everyone?
If you do, we will never discover why we are here,
Such clothing kills a man's creative essence!
Why do you find it necessary to embrace European culture?
For what reason?
Why borrow also Europe's mistakes?
My God! What is all this?
Mother!
Canova!
What an elevated approach to art!
What feel for the material!
How wonderful!
He is a true heir to the masters of antiquity!
Canova almost married my mother.
Was your mother a sculptress?
Yes. In Rome.
In Rome? Your mother, a sculptress,,,,
In this Canova collection, there are even sculptures... that Tsar AIexander bought from the wife....
Of Napoleon?
Yes.
It was 1815, I was at the Congress of Vienna.
What were you doing there?
-I was a diplomat.
-A diplomat?
This collection was the object of a harsh dispute.
Look where we are now!
Is this a dream?
Maybe, maybe.
I don't know about you, but I'm wide awake!
It's amazing how well I speak Russian!
Yes, quite well,
Who was that small man?
Wasn't that Pushkin?
-Good day.
-Good day.
Is that your great poet? Your beloved one?
I read him in French. Nothing special.
Sir,
My God, how touchy you are!
Pardon me!
I'm sorry if I've offended your nationalist sympathy.
What is that, nationalist sympathy?
What's that there?
-Please,,,,
-Who is that?
Please don't rush,
AII alone, without an escort?
It would be wiser not to talk to that lady,
Don't bother her,
Let's move along,
Excuse me, madam, have you Iost your guide?
Thank you for your concern.
I know everything here.
Of course. Do you work here?
Not at all. I'm here to admire the works of the old masters.
Would you accompany me into the next salon?
To see the FIemish masters?
With pleasure. Your slender fingers see all.
-140 paces, straight ahead.
-140, is that so?
How many are Ieft?
Watch your step.
-One cannot be so intrusive, I told you.
-It's not the right time for this.
It's all your fault.
-You are compromising me!
-Oh, don't.
How dare you! Quiet!
-We're here.
-Yes.
Can we go closer to that painting?
Would you Iike me to tell you about it?
The Virgin with Partridges by van Dyck.
Catherine II acquired it.
Tell me about this painting.
PIease, tell me.
See the calm and serenity around the Madonna and Joseph.
-Joseph, yes.
-God protects them.
There is no doubt about his unseen presence.
The apple tree represents Iife.
Sunflowers stand for piety.
On the upper right, partridges symbolise frivolity.
-They're flying away.
-Partridges....
Angels dance and play.
So many other symbols that we can only guess about.
Sir, leave her, She's an angel,
Why have you gone quiet?
The partridges, the children, the Madonna....
Thank you, madam. Thank you.
I highly value your opinion on the works of van Dyck.
You'II definitely be interested in another painting.
Be very careful!
A Rubens.
Sir, do not disturb me!
The Feast in the House of Simon the Pharisee.
The Pharisee....
I don't see it.
Where is it?
Thirty-six, thirty-five....
No, that painting isn't here.
Not part of the Tsar's collection.
Yes, it's here.
That particular Rubens is not here!
Yes, it was from Lord Walpole's collection...
Iike The Virgin with Partridges.
But that Rubens isn't on exhibit.
But it's here.
-Where are you?
-What a wonderful scent!
The scent of oils....
Sir, let's leave here now,
No, Iet's stay a while.
What wonderful paintings!
What are those men counting?
You were right. I found it.
Let's take a closer Iook.
There it is.
We're almost there.
Face the painting directly.
There it is.
Yes, there it is.
-Something to say about Rubens?
-Van Dyck.
Rubens considered van Dyck to be his best pupil.
You know, there was a time when all these paintings... were placed much higher and much closer to one another.
The Tsar himself supervised how they were hung. Did you know this?
-Who are you?
-I'm a sailor.
-Insignias.
-Yes, the Navy.
The Tsar visited his collection every morning.
He personally saved all this... during the fire.
-Which fire?
-In 18....
So you are asking me?
Enough, Iet's go.
It's time for me to go.
May I accompany you?
What a pity.
I must ask you to Ieave.
The museum is closing.
PIease see yourself to the exit.
Quiet. CIose the door.
The museum is closing.
-How was my scene?
-I wasn't impressed,
I was joking.
Joking,,,,
-Do you hear music?
-I hear something.
Russian music makes me break out in hives.
That has nothing to do with the music,
Why do you look at me like that?
-Rags.... A dog....
-Rags,,,, A dog,,,,
-Eternal people....
-Eternal people,,,,
Live and go on Iiving.
-You'II outlive them all.
-Eternal people,,,,
What are you doing? Eavesdropping?
Are you interested in painting?
What nice Iittle hands!
Stay away from me!
Amen. Amen.
-Beautiful, isn't it?
-Absolutely.
-Are you Catholic?
-No, I'm not Catholic.
Why do you ask?
It seemed to me that you were deep in thought... while admiring the images of the founders of our church.
I don't know. I wasn't thinking about that.
You were not....
Do you know that those are the apostles Peter and Paul?
Yes, that's what I heard.
That's what you heard. And so?
I Iooked at them because I Iike them.
You Iike them....
-One day, all men...
-AII men....
-...will become Iike them.
-Really?
How can you know what will become of people... if you don't know the Scriptures?
Why aren't you saying anything?
Look at their hands.
The hands are beautiful. And so?
How can you know what will become of people... if you don't know the Scriptures?
For you, they're just two dusty old men.
-Just flesh.
-They're covered with dust... from their Iong road to appear in this painting.
-What happened?
-They are good and wise.
How can you know their character... if you have not read the Gospels?
How can you know all that?
Sir, why are you frightening him?
He was already afraid,
He's not afraid.
These people are never afraid.
Leave him alone,
Better to appreciate the scent of the paintings,
-It smells good.
-Very good,
You need not fear.
So strange to hear those words.
Now I understand. We're in the gallery.
Yes...
I understand.
We're in the Tsar's gallery... near the portrait of a medieval fanatic.
Where have we wandered to?
That music was good, after all.
Who was the composer?
-Glinka,
-Who is he? A German?
A Russian,
No, he's German.
AII composers are German.
All composers are German?
EI Greco.
Very nice.
Looks Iike a Rembrandt.
EI Greco.... Dust from the roads.
What dust from the roads?
Nice, very nice.
-Something you don't like?
-Not at all.
-It's nice, very nice.
-Nice,,,,
More flesh.... Very nice.
These are nice paintings.
Nice paintings,,,,
They're getting better and better.
There's an angel,
Pardon me for addressing you without an introduction.
To whom was that directed?
Do tell.
-I'm speaking to the painting.
-You are speaking to the painting?
How interesting!
-I must speak my mind.
-Speak your mind?
And so you talk to the painting.
Would you Iike to try?
Must I try? Very well.
-Like that.
-Like this?
Now, Iike this.
Now a turn.
Sometimes I prefer speaking to myself.
This painting and I... we have a secret.
Really?
-Yes.
-Now it's over.
That's all, gentlemen. Good-bye!
Where are you going, madam?
She's offended. She has Ieft.
Hi!
Good-bye!
Farewell, gentleman!
How charming!
She's offended. But so charming!
Where has she gone?
Marble... a white stone... very white.
Rather cold, isn't it?
When you first came here, it must have been disastrous,
That was just after the fire,
I have been here before, but it's as if I have not.
What Iuxury!
What is that?
It's under the Convention that everything was devastated.
You don't know
20th-century Russian history,
Our Convention lasted 80 years,
A real revolution,,,, Very sad,
What kind of system is there now?
A republic?
I don't know,
I have never believed that a republic was suitable... for a country as Iarge as Russia.
You Europeans are democrats who mourn the monarchy,
-You are French, is that it?
-Who are you?
Excuse us, we're Iost.
-PIease be on your way.
-Let us Iive! Let us Iive!
-Remaining here is forbidden!
-Help us, please.
Who forbids it? What is forbidden?
What Ianguage! Everything is forbidden!
It's better not to argue,
We're going, we're going.
I know where we can hide,
I suddenly feel afraid.
I don't Iike military uniforms.
-Not that door, sir!
-But I Iike it.
-Such a beautiful door!
-No, not that one!
Why is it so cold?
I told you not to enter,
What cold! Frames.... But where are....
Where are the canvases?
Let's go back, I beg you,
-Who's there?
-It's me.
-Why have you come here?
-I don't know. I simply entered.
-Come closer.
-I'm coming.
Maybe you need help, kind sir.
Who is the "kind sir"?
Me.... You....
Not here, not there.
There is no one.
Only coffins and corpses. Come and see.
-I'm coming.
-That's my coffin.
-Your coffin?
-Yes, I made it myself.
Why that strange tone, kind sir?
Why coffins in the Hermitage?
"Kind sir"!
-It's my coffin.
-Yes, it is yours.
-He Iooks well-fed!
-But where are the corpses?
Why do you ask "where"?
Don't step on the corpses.
He Iooks well-fed!
You stepped on the corpses!
-What happened?
-The war,
Which war? Against whom?
-Against Germany,
-What is Germany?
The unified state of the Germans,
In the 20th century,
Russia was at war with Germany,
The Germans surrounded the city,
But the city did not surrender,
More than 1 million dead,
-More than 1 million?
-Yes,
That's a high price to pay. Very high.
Saint Petersburg and the Hermitage paid dearly.
In Russia, it is said that freedom knows no price,
A very high price.
But maybe not.
But it has already been paid,
I was wrong, by the way... when I criticised your tsars... for all this beauty and opulence.
Even if they all were... tyrants.
Quieter, please,
But it is beautiful, isn't it?
What do you see? Who is it?
Maybe Catherine II, but I'm not certain,
Nothing could be less certain,
That's enough! Lisa, take away the children.
Don't go too near to her.
If it is Catherine, she has a sixth sense....
Like this.
Lower, Iower!
That will be all.
The candles, the candles.
It's stuffy in here.
-There.
-No, I won't Iet you.
That's it.
But it's cold outside.
That's it.
Sir!
Where are you?
I hear your footsteps. Where are you?
Mortals must not chase royalty.
You won't catch up anyway.
I hear your footsteps.
I hear them.
Sir, what are you doing? It's cold!
-Come this way.
-Yes, it's cold,
-She disappeared,
-I know.
-She disappeared again,
-Move aside.
-Do you know where to go?
-Help us. Come.
Let us through. We are allowed.
Where is the door? Where is it?
Greetings!
Don't be shy. Come. We will not stay Iong.
Thank you very much.
A new hairstyle is necessary.
What beautiful hair you have! Those curls!
Tea! Would you Iike tea?
I don't either, but they insist.
Where is the tea?
We're in a hurry. Where is it?
-I know I'm beautiful.
-Too beautiful.
What do you want me to say?
-Come on!
-I have nothing to say!
What is that?
-Did you write this book?
-Not me. He did.
Neither he nor I. But he will dedicate it.
Follow me.
Sir, what are you looking at?
Shall we continue?
What do I see? Nothing for the moment.
Some people are obviously waiting for something.
Let's proceed with caution.
These madmen could eat you.
They liked your hair,
Of course, good writers always have beautiful hair.
-Be more careful and quiet now.
-I'm following you,
-CIose the door quickly.
-It's done,
When I was Iast received here at the Winter Palace... it was being renovated after the terrible fire.
-The parquet doesn't creak.
-It doesn't creak,,,,
-The ambassador of Persia!
-Excuse us for being Iate.
Sir, Iet's go.
The ambassador of His Highness the Shah...
Prince Khozrev-Mirza... the son of the future Shah, with his entourage.
-Do you know what is happening?
-Not yet,
We are witnesses.
Nicholas I received an apology from the Persian emissaries... regarding the murder of Russian diplomats.
Griboedov was one, I think.
How interesting.
Are you able to see?
What uniforms!
Luxury, empire... power....
Look over there. Higher.
Can you see?
Yes, I see now!
One must not trust this world. You are right.
Beware, court officials are cunning.
Some of them are mediums.
They could sense your presence.
Thank you for your advice,
We Gemini are curious by nature,
I'II move ahead.
Maybe I'II meet old acquaintances.
Good luck, I'll find you later,
Mighty Sovereign Emperor!
The peaceful nature of Persia and the sacred union that exists... among His Majesty and the Shah were both upset by evil.
Under its power, a frenzied Tehran crowd... committed unheard-of acts of evil.
The resulting victim was the Russian mission.
The honest heart of Fetkh-AIi-Shah... was horrified by the idea that a handful of wrongdoers... might destroy our peace and union.
His Majesty the Shah has sent me, his grandson... to request that you, Sovereign... erase from memory this event.
Let the world know that, despite this terrible event... two wise monarchs, with their infinite wisdom... speak openly and vanquish all suspicion.
With the greatest joy, I stand before you...
Your Imperial Majesty.
I carry out my grandfather's will... that we strengthen peace... between our two peoples.
His Imperial Majesty... commands me to assure Your Excellence... of his pleasure at hearing your explanation... as well as the righteous plea... of your sovereign.
I've been observing you. Who Iet you enter?
-You have no business here.
-That's correct.
Then you must Ieave at once.
Off you go, sir! Away!
-I had no intention of staying.
-Away!
This ceremony will continue for a few more hours still.
As a former diplomat, I'm aware of that.
A terrible boredom will set in. Terrible!
Leave me alone!
-And what is that?
-What did you say?
I adore Iuxury and regal splendour.
Stasov wasn't a bad architect.
He Ioved discipline, but Ieft space for breathing.
We cannot stay here,
The ceremony will finish,
Then they will all come in,
My God!
Sèvres porcelain, my weakness!
-Beautiful,
-Yes, yes!
-Inimitable!
-Beautiful,
This is the cameo service?
Yes, it is.
Not so close, please.
What gold!
Sir, it's awkward setting the table with you here.
You can admire it Iater when you are seated.
PIease do go away.
What pure tones!
The blue and gold are enchanting.
And the wine-sediment colour!
AIways such marvellous cooks here in the Winter Palace.
Do you recall the taste of food?
No, I have forgotten.
You've forgotten,,,,
Visit the other salons while waiting for the dinner bell.
-That blue!
-PIease, sir.
There's dancing. Come on.
Let's Ieave here.
-We're being chased away,
-Chased away....
It's so dark here,
Heavens!
I see you have never seen a tsar... nor grand princes in all their magnificence.
-Monarchy is not eternal,
-As if I didn't know....
Don't I have the right to dream a Iittle?
We are free, you and I, Dream away,
There's someone here, Do you hear voices?
Sir, don't you hear them?
No, I don't hear anything.
Look, someone is moving there,
Where?
Mr. Orbeli, I don't understand.
What has upset you so?
You and my father know:.
No insect can harm this throne.
-It's made of silver and treated oak.
-It's not the throne.
I'm very worried.
See that velour from Lyons.
It's completely worn out.
-We'II restore it. Be patient.
-You don't have the time.
You're right, Boris.
We don't have time either.
You won't ever see him again.
Speak!
He's your son.
What difficulty are they having?
They seem uncomfortable with each other,
What do you expect?
You descend from the heavens... and no Ionger know how to behave.
Your son is Hermitage director.
Like you and I before him.
The wars ahead.... Terrible wars.
But we managed to preserve all this through the catastrophes.
I can't hear anymore.
And you?
Yes, I hear, But not very clearly,
What are they saying?
The elder Piotrovsky is asking,,, whether the director's telephone is still under surveillance,
His son tells him, "Forget that,
"I would prefer telling you about the Hermitage cats,
"They are still here,,,, "
There are so many people that I wasn't able to help.
Ten years have passed.
You know what I'm referring to.
But everyone speaks well of you.
Your books are still in print.
Those of Mr. Orbeli, too.
That's particularly admirable.
The dead weep with joy when their books are reprinted.
Especially 37 years Iater, Mikhail.
Is something still troubling you?
Is it the authorities?
They want acorns from oak trees.
They are not interested in knowing how to nurture the tree of culture.
But it will be their doom if the tree falls.
Then there will be nothing Ieft.
Can't they understand that?
Mr. Orbeli, what awaits us?
-I'm coming!
-Speak!
-Listen, Mikhail....
-Let him go.
You're completely alone.
They won't tell him anything.
I know, ask me!
I am asking you,,,,
Everyone can see the future... but no one remembers the past.
Look how handsome they are!
Such fine young men!
Beautiful uniforms, even if I don't Iike the military.
You didn't answer my question,
Nothing, you know nothing,
Sir! Wait!
He doesn't hear me,
I must apologise,
They said other things,
I could hardly hear them,
I made it all up, about Orbeli,,,,
About Piotrovsky, too,
-Only God can judge you.
-I made it all up,
We are free, you and I. You said it yourself!
Please, don't run,
Run! I can't keep up with you.
Little birds.
Children!
Anastasia, where are you going?
They are... so Iight!
You're always watching me.
I have a bad feeling.
Don't be alarmed.
Pray. And I shall pray for you.
Did you hear that?
-Did you hear shots?
-Calm down. God is with you.
I think someone is following us.
Calm down, AIexandra.
If only AIexis could run....
Doctors are good for nothing.
There is no hope.
It's my fault.
Children!
Children, behave yourselves!
Sorry, excuse us.
Come here, Anastasia. Where were you?
I Iooked for you all morning.
We were playing.
Let's go.
Where is AIexis?
-Thank you, I can manage.
-Of course.
-Are you in pain?
-I'm fine, Mother.
Move your chair forward.
You are Iate for tea.
Forgive me.
What do you think? Shall we forgive her?
Anastasia won't do it again.
It Iooks Iike it's not your fault.
Good-bye.
FIy away, my Iittle angels!
And here's their cage.
They're all here, of course.
There haven't been so many guests for a Iong time.
Good evening.
Look at that strange fellow.
But,,, where has my European gone?
Where is he?
There he is!
He doesn't see me,
I should go up to him,
Otherwise he will be offended,
Sir! He can't hear me,
But I'll see him later,
Wouldn't it be nice to jump about Iike that?
You know...
Aristarkh Konstantinovich is being sent to Africa.
What a tiger! He could eat anyone!
Your mother has trained the servants well.
Don't be shy! You are doing very well.
The most important for the mazurka is....
You are doing great.
Thank you.
Saint Petersburg has the best balls in Europe.
Everyone is so easygoing.
Like one big family.
There must be over 3,000 people.
Maybe Iess.
I've forgotten everything!
I dance so poorly! I've forgotten everything!
But it's all coming back to me!
Good, very good!
Bravo! More! More!
Where were you? I lost you,
I'm here.
I lost you,
Lost,,,,
I'm sad,
Let's go,
To where?
Where? Forward,
Forward,,,,
What will we find over there?
Over there? I don't know,
I'm staying.
Farewell, Europe,
It's over,
You might say I grew up here.
But I'm not quite myself.
It's as if I were in someone else's house.
Listen up! Look here!
Poor man, your Iady has gone away!
-FIown away Iike a bird!
-Gone....
In a flash!
Shall we dine together?
I'II wait downstairs. Bring up the coach.
Have our coats brought up.
And don't Iose them!
When we return to Kursk, we must organise a ball.
Just before Lent, for example.
I think we should invite your nephew as well as Varenka. Let him see.
Nathalie!
It feels Iike we're floating.
It seems all this is but a dream.
But you have found her!
Nothing has happened!
Custine!
Let me pass!
Sir, sir,,,,
It's a pity you're not here with me,
You would understand everything,
Look,
The sea is all around,
We are destined to sail forever,
To live forever,

Lord,
don't You ever tire of me,
a sinner whose ass has been plucked 100,000 times?
Dear God, never let me give up!
Keep alive in me forever
this dirty desire for love,
this throb that saves me from death,
this hellish hope that makes my heart beat faster,
this lamentable longing for young flesh!
I'm an old bitch,
Dear God of Infinite Goodness!
- Shit!
- What's wrong?
I have to go.
Not to see that old lady again?
Yes!
Bastard!
Not at all!
Bastard!
My respects, Milady!
You're late.
The chef needed me.
You smell of a female in heat, not dishwater nor stuffed crab!
- Feel good?
- Yes.
Did you have time to go soft?
Barely.
Very touching.
- Shall we go?
- Going, going, gone! For 500 francs!
- You slept well?
- Of course not!
Waiting youth or old age asleep a rendez-vous with death will keep.
You're not old!
You're the sweetest tiger
I've ever known.
Now tell me how you skewered that chick at the hotel.
But I swear...
Please! No false modesty!
The details, Lambert!
I want all the details.
Here you are! You startled me.
Need say it again?
You'll catch your death in that dress in the water.
Notice anything?
Your solitaire?
I feel naked without it, old cock.
- Stolen?
- Yes!
- Any suspects?
- A certainty!
Who?
The beachboy!
His hands are oilier than a girl's butt getting a tan.
He slipped it right off!
Quite an accomplishment, my lovely!
Shall we file the charges?
Of course not, my love.
- Shall I dry you off?
- No I must be what I am.
You're going to the Mazuriers like that?
And why not?
THE OLD LADY
WHO WALKED IN THE SEA
Is that cherub yours?
Sorry!
Maybe I'm being indiscreet.
Not at all! He's Muruel's boy.
I'm divorced.
Pompilius Senaresco is a photographic genius.
You are, my sweet.
Your portraits are marvelous!
Don't be falsely modest.
We couldn't resist taking some surreptitious shots of the boy.
Yes, I think I did a good job.
Especially on the telephoto portraits.
Look!
Do you know the ne plus ultra in photo development?
Of course not, lambkin.
It's almost culinary!
A drop of vinegar in the final rinse water.
I beg your pardon for this little indiscretion.
I can't resist beauty.
Love's beautiful.
They're very good.
- May I keep them?
- Yes, I have more.
I trust you'll store them in a safe place.
I bet the little man's father was white, Muriel.
He's hardly dark at all.
Isn't your wife a Mitron-Lasauge?
And you have a private mansion on Belgian Boulevard in Lyon, near Gilt-Head Park?
Imagine Marie-Thérèse's chaste cheeks upon seeing such moments of happiness.
You know my wife?
Who doesn't know the chosen few with such a fortune?
- You had to be...
- Have been!
...quite clever to marry her.
He resembles you, Mazurier.
He must be a mimic.
What do you want?
I recall a Transylvanian prince who resembled his presumed papa like 2 peas in a pod but was a 1st-class bastard.
Help me up, my precious Pompilius.
It is time that we will go.
- Should go.
- Yes.
What've I done?
I'm sick of being alone on an island.
Alone? Stop it!
I'm sure lots of girls come to see you, eh?
- Do you know Paris?
- I live there.
I miss Paris.
That's all you have to say?
I'm sick of blue.
Blue sky... blue sea...
Your blue dress.
I want a gray rainy street.
I'll cheer you up!
I don't want you.
Go on! Get out!
Me, Tarzan! You, cow!
Shit! Goddamn shit!
- I'll give it back.
- If you please...
Your bathing suit had no pockets.
Where did you hide my ring?
In you mouth?
Elsewhere would be shocking.
Got scissors?
Upstairs.
And get a chair too.
Your scalp.
This is not revenge but esthetics.
That ponytail didn't suit you.
We must go now, my dear.
Nor does this silly stone.
You're a pretty cute guy, Lambert.
Why doll yourself up like a broad?
Open my bag, Pompilius.
Thank you.
Your new look suits you much better.
See?
- Right, darling?
- Ravishing!
You felt blue?
Sort of...
Because of my ring, I hope.
Maybe.
It was my 1st time.
Anyway, Milady,
I'd have given it back to you.
My dearest, it'll be rush hour in the dining room!
Don't be so impatient, you old has-been.
I'm rich and old but I'm still very active.
I have no one in the world but this old friend, who's an ex-lover and is still my accomplice.
Would you like to be my dauphin?
- Your dauphin?
- Be with me, warm me with your presence.
The Antilles are nice for a week but if you stay, you'll cry every day like today.
Would you like to give it a try and come with us?
Speak up, lad!
Do you want to be her dauphin?
At first Pompilius will be jealous and sulk but he'll soon get used to you and you'll be close friends.
Don't you like adventure?
I do but all this is so unexpected!
What's unexpected is the salt of life!
Trust in my experience, my boy.
We'll be 3 for dinner tonight.
Care for a drink while we wait for the boy?
No, thank you.
My little blossom, you're an old sow in heat.
An incorrigible slut.
Your faded fig flutters at the sight of a young man.
That could be laughable but it makes me cry.
Stop in front of a mirror and out of charity for what's left look at yourself. A lank old mare ready for the slaughterhouse.
Seeing you... ties such knots in my stomach.
I wonder if I'll be able to dine.
If you don't wish to dine, grimy glaucous old geezer, screw you!
A starched shirt and creased pants are all that keep you upright.
You don't want to be loved any longer?
You really want to be hated?
Don't worry, droopy Dick, you're on the right path!
If that fossil fondler moves into the house... I'll move out!
He'll move in.
Do you expect that young hood to dance and diddle on your dried-up belly, Grandma?
The poor boy.
He'll think he's penetrating a mummy.
- Bastard!
- Old hag!
You're nothing but an old wreck in a Rolls.
And you're Death, Princess, covered with jewels and made-up like a carnival whore.
Beat it or I'll fork your balls!
How classy.
'Evening!
- Just the 2 of us?
- Yes.
Pompilius has gone to sulk for a while.
While waiting for our old diplomat parked in the back lot
I'll explain to you the essentials to our activity.
How sweet. Flowers!
I got the message.
I was explaining to our young protégé how our enterprise operates.
Here's your 1st mission.
See the couple that just come in over there?
Yes.
His name's Mazurier.
He's our client.
Go see him and tell him to meet us later for a drink at the Beach Comber near the golf club, while his girlfriend goes to see if the little boy's asleep.
Shall I go now?
Of course.
Queen of my days, have you gone insane?
With tears this fop returned to you what he'd stolen only hours earlier.
The frisky fool will brag about our exploits to the 1st doe who gives him her rump.
Fear not, my friend.
I know what I'm doing!
Lord, maybe this old fart is right
and my sudden passion is carrying me away.
Let this kid be on the up and up, Lord,
and don't let him shaft us.
Amen.
What a magical land. A simple storm becomes a cataclysm.
Lambert, get a towel for Mr. Mazurier.
No, never mind.
Here, this will warm your blood.
Sit down.
Is the brat asleep?
Years, hours ago.
I'm overwhelmed. I think
I shocked you this afternoon talking like a crazy old lady.
I thought... He'll think it's blackmail!
- Never!
- Good. We'd have been distressed...
That's enough.
It seems you're an associate of Shellingbrook Labs in London and
Blawatz Labs in Basel?
And no training? Bravo!
$8.634.000 in a numbered account at the Brieggers Bank in Bern according to you last bank statement.
I'm speechless.
Pompilius, my old love wreck,
Our friend Mazurier seems to be upset.
Prove our good faith.
Felis qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas.
Yes, Pompilius is polygamous...
- Polyglot!
- It's Serbo-Croatian.
It's Latin!
Who told you?
My powerful organization.
They told me about your phony billing with France, England and
Switzerland.
Congratulations!
How much?
Our commission comes to what amount, wrinkly old man?
One-and-a-half million Swiss francs.
- You're dreaming!
- Quite rarely.
It's a reasonable sum.
Too reasonable!
What'll the Finance Minister think about your file?
You'll get jail and a big, fine pal.
Payable to our Zurich bank account.
A neutral country.
What proves you won't back?
We never pluck the same pigeon twice.
It's immoral.
- 4 million.
- Never!
Four!
We got 4 million!
Listen, asshole!
Henceforth, you'll do as I say, no more than I say, when I say it and the way I say it!
I'm in command here!
Never hit too hard.
That's the sacrosanct rule if you want them to forget you.
Say you understand what I said, little man.
Say you want to stay with me.
Yes, I really want to stay with you.
French Riviera
If we sell all our racehorses,
Pompom darling, we'll get how much?
My beloved, neither of us has ever had any racehorses.
I fear the sun has disorganized you brain cells, unless it's due to your doubly respectable age.
- Kiss me, Pompilius darling!
- My sweet...
You were dying to, eh?
Slept well, Pompilius?
Your poodle has talent.
He's already... high society.
You'll have to abstain, Lambert.
Yes, but I thrive on idleness, Milady.
Does this mean you have a project, marvel of my life?
What I like, debris of love, is that you always know how to read between my words.
The Maharaja Boulipuram invites you to the 20th birthday of his daughter
Scheherazade on June 16th at 3:00 p.m.
Semi-formal attire...
Are we going?
No question of missing it.
We'll have to get you a suit.
Me? But I'm not invited.
When I'm asked, I take whatever
I want. Is that clear?
Bring! I take a thing, one brings a person.
You old clown.
Lambert is my thing.
Pompilius darling, take the boy's measurements, call London and tell the tailor to at once make a 2-piece navy-blue suit with no padding.
My lovely, is your project for the party at the king of flying carpets?
Of course, you old ruin!
Enlighten me.
Baby imbecile, if you read the papers, you'd know, the Maharaja Boulipuram is giving his daughter Scheherazade a diadem of diamonds and 3 emeralds worth $5.000.000!
Angel, don't you have enough diamonds?
Enough?
Enough is an adjective for retirees,
Lord Asshole!
During the party on June 16th we'll lay our hands on this marvel.
You're planning a raid, my gentle one.
You and I usually use more finesse.
A raid?
You've flipped your lid.
With cops in the crappers, thugs behind each flower-pot and mutts to bite your buns if you run in the garden, you call that a raid?
Cops, crappers, mutts... and buns... That's quite a lot indeed.
I have to shake him up once in a while.
The maharaja's daughter is a lumpy sausage who uses olive oil on her hair.
The idea of that divine diadem on her greasy skull is absolutely unbearable.
You'll come with us, dear Lambert, and swipe the treasure.
- How?
- It's up to you.
Pompilius will give you a plan of the palace and the party schedule.
It can be done. You lifted my ring without me noticing it, golden boy.
Please! Spare us this.
Lord, You must be riding high with all this harmony.
This marvelous landscape.
That naked little devil, my old fogey
and soon that broad's diadem.
It's too much, Lord.
A blue sea that's so green.
A blue sky that's so white.
It's as beautiful as an orgasm.
Love of my life, what will happen if Lambert fouls up?
Shut up, pus-filled raven, dime-store diplomat!
Lovely!
Naked as a babe. Not a wrinkle.
How horrible.
The kid'll succeed!
You starched grubworm.
I think I keep you on only because of your outfits, fancy verbs and the way you drink tea.
Boulipuram: A Family's Future
How much is this magazine, Miss?
Madam.
It's free.
That publication is not sold.
Are you Italian?
No, Dutch.
That's surprising.
You forget we occupied Indonesia for 3 centuries.
And are you from here?
Carmel, he doesn't need you for washing car.
Come help me dress and don't leave flowers lying about.
Charlie, we'll leave in 5 minutes.
It took a bit longer.
You found it?
Was she pretty?
When you stop for a quick one, my dear Lambert,
2 basic rules must be observed.
Never wear white trousers and close your fly after putting your bird back in its nest.
Was it worth it?
For what I did, yes.
You really need a fix.
A female can tell.
But don't get involved with whores with hot pants who end up getting a hold on you.
In our profession, a quick romp, yes; an affair, no!
Don't worry, Milady, I satisfied my glands and I'm not nostalgic.
Your speech is improving,
I'm delighted.
I feel good with you, Milady.
We have so much to say to each other, dear boy.
We're going to have fun.
I'll sew a secret pocket into your suit to hide my stolen present.
I know the conceits of this world and conquering them amuses me.
Better to cry in a Rolls than in the subway.
Never forget that, my darling.
I'd love for us to be more familiar but it'd kill the old geezer.
Go ahead and we'll see.
Now arriving from Paris,
Air France Flight 411, Gate G.
You don't mind? I can get a cab.
A promise is a promise.
I'll get my suitcase.
Give me that.
That too. Get in!
- I never rode in such a carriage.
- Get in.
We've chatted since Paris but
I don't know your name.
- Noémie.
- Charming.
I'm Pompilius. I'm Rumanian.
Not many Rolls there.
So I came here.
Are you a tennis champion?
A script-girl in TV.
I love tennis. I'd love to be seeded.
Seeded?
Candy?
What kind?
Thai Special.
Trying to drug me?
You have admirable knees.
They're usually a woman's weak spot.
I've known gorgeous creatures, movie stars with knobby knees.
Yours positively fascinate me.
My kingdom for this knee!
She's not even wearing her damn diadem.
What do we do?
Find us a quiet spot where
Pompilius and I can flirt.
Then you'll go about your business.
My exquisite dearest,
I'm saddened by a grim foreboding.
Something tells me your chicken will try to pull this heist and get nabbed.
Something tells me you're an old fart becoming more and more stupid.
Well, the old fart would rather not spend his last years in prison, my gorgeous one!
Why would you go to prison, my rancid human wreck?
It's me who ordered the manufacture of the phony diadem, my tender but tired trollop!
But who'll know?
The cops'll know!
They'll question him!
He'll go to jail and confess all!
Even add to it, if necessary!
Lord,
this doctored-up old debris is right.
Lambert, my golden-haired cherub, my totally tanned love,
my pretty-prick-for-the-others,
Lambert's too sensitive.
The little man is pure
Bohemian crystal.
2 slaps on his kisser and he'll tell all, the son of a bitch.
I sent Pompilius to tell you to cancel everything.
I'm too fond of you.
I don't want to lose you.
It's too late.
What?
It's in the pocket!
Shall we go?
No, that would be foolish!
You've really taken the wind out of my sails.
I could've looked forever.
The little lad scared silly is cowering in Grandma's petticoats.
Close your clammy trap, you rotting old ramrod!
You're at a maharaja's, my dear!
Well, it's in the bag.
The kid not only has balls, he's gifted.
My poor boy...
Now you've taken the plunge.
Maharaja Boulipuram is going to give his daughter her present.
We can't miss this.
So there you are, my poor girl, with you damn rocks known the world over.
You can't wear them nor sell them.
Having them is a joy in itself, you decrepit drone!
And how do you plant to keep this marvel?
Never mind, toothless comb!
No hiding place is truly safe.
That's the problem.
I still have some secrets.
Put your decalcified bones to bed, dear Pompilius.
You look like a melting wax-dummy.
I'm in the way?
Almost.
Noémie.
How to say it?
If you could loan me your youth like that young Apollo loans his to my old witch.
I promised.
My little man.
Tonight I'm going to tell you a secret that even old jerk-off Pompilius doesn't know.
I've decided you'll be my heir.
Move those clothes.
Your lucky number?
2017? It's the number of lovers I've  had.
Open it.
Soon it'll all be yours.
It's enormous.
Probably...I never counted it.
All gifts. Not thefts.
My lovers were among the greats of the world.
Not paupers.
You'll be very rich, lovely louse of my heart.
Why haven't you invested it?
The Frenchman waving his savings account book.
Grab that.
This?
- What is it?
- Preserved youth, my boy.
I was 17.
Here I'm 23.
And 42.
You seem far away.
No further than these pictures, Milady.
Here...
Which age do you prefer?
Now.
Liar.
I swear.
Your face is as beautiful as all 3.
I adore you.
I adore you.
My late-comer...
My last love.
I have an idea... that's insane.
So crazy that I don't dare to tell you.
Go ahead.
I'd like you to sleep with me.
I said sleep not screw.
Understand?
You who understand everything?
What a bitch!
Egotist!
You take everything but never give a thing, eh?
A con job's one thing but sharing your bed...
I need to think it over.
What a nice surprise.
Delighted to see you again, Miss.
I had the pleasure of traveling with this lady on the flight back from Paris.
Enjoying your holiday?
It's a dream. Excuse me.
My tennis lesson.
Thanks for the ride in the Rolls.
How I love his flesh, Lord.
I didn't sleep a wink last night.
I lay curled up on the edge of the bed
so as not to scare him.
What a temptation to find his young cock and
make it hard in my hand, Lord, not meaning to offend You.
Are you going to shower here or at home?
Here.
Than way, I'll come home clean.
Pompilius.
I must compliment you, you're making progress.
You used to strut in front of little hairdressers or drugstore whores.
Now you've moved into a higher category.
I can meet anyone I please without it indicating any sort of depravity.
I really don't give a damn and I haven't for ages.
I know I don't interest you since you're gone back to the nursery, Grandma.
Shut up!
Can't you stop your childishness for 5 minutes?
See you later, my sweet!
No, wait.
These are the ladies' showers.
We were interrupted.
I was surprised you knew Pompilius.
What an odd name!
What an old character.
He pulled his Rolls routine on you?
His Rolls routine?
He thinks his car's a private alcove where he invites young girls he meets.
Isn't he a bit old?
I'd never think you gave in but did he try?
He was a bit fast.
But there's always a means of dissuasion.
I'll buy you a drink and you can drive me home.
Do you have a permission?
I'll grab my things.
- I see.
- What?
Auntie!
Shit is gonna hit the fan.
Is Milady in her room?
You shouldn't call her that.
The word suits you like mittens on a belly dancer.
What should I call her?
Granny?
One moment.
Do you like Miss Noémie?
- She's charming.
- Charming!
An adjective that on your lips sounds obscene.
Is that all?
No. My dear Lambert, I like you a lot.
I hide it but I do like you.
You should go away with Noémie.
Far away.
My dear Lambert, you're not Pompilius and Lady M. is no longer the one who's aged with me.
Never try to make zircons pass as diamonds nor be satisfied with crumbs.
I don't know what zircons are.
And yet your whole life is made of them.
You see, my dear young man, one can't cheat all the time.
For example, put a scrub-rag on the shoulders of a princess and she'll always look like a princess.
Put a mink on a fishwife and she'll always look like a fishwife.
There. You really can talk like other people.
If you try.
I did it in your honor.
When I'm with you, I can't help seeing an ordinary figure with some striped beach-mats on his shoulder and a hangar next door.
- It's funny.
- Very.
Don't you think Napoleon would've looked like a schmuck with this on his head, emperor or not?
Where were you?
In the garden.
And earlier?
At the tennis court.
For a shower?
I'll come home clean!
I went out.
With Pompilius' young heifer?
Who interests you, of course.
So what?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you.
Forgive me, I was in a bad mood.
I'll show you a bad mood, cock-brain!
Princes crawled at my feet and
I've kicked their faces in with my spike-heels, asshole!
A bull breeder in love with me blew his brains out!
Just who do you think you are, you masturbating boy-scout?
I slapped one of London's biggest gangster!
When he walked in a room the toughest tough guys shit their pants!
I peed in the couscous of an emir who had served himself ahead of me, schmuck!
You nutless little gnat!
You dare to let yourself be in a bad mood!
You're all pansies! Asses!
Don't touch me!
Help me up!
Shit-head!
With a butt like a sick rat!
Sponge-faces for cleaning crappers.
Encephalitic jerk-off! Moron! Bitch!
We must get a doctor!
There's no decent doctor in this hick town.
A compress...
Shove it up your ass, schmuck!
Go away!
You've upset her enough!
Stay!
Go to the dining room, Mr Pompilius!
It's time for chow.
Beware of your striped beach-mats!
They show! Even with a tuxedo!
A quick romp, yes; an affair, no!
That tennis whore is a trouble-maker.
Believe me!
I know a bitch when I see one.
But if you really want to screw her, bring her here to your room.
- Here?
- Why not?
Promise?
Now go join the old crab in the dining room.
You need to eat, you devil.
A Rumanian proverb:
if the head is empty, the belly needs filling.
Eat, my boy.
Don't let it get you down.
If you knew the number of canes she's broken on young backs like yours, you wouldn't feel so concerned.
But you shouldn't stay here.
You'll ruin your life.
You don't have what it takes to share in this fairy tale.
If that old hag starts yelling at me and if you stop talking to me my life here will cease to be pure magic.
Lord, what's got into You, dammit!
It's lousy of You to let this happen.
Don't I suffer enough from my arthritic hip?
What've I done to You? Last night was my prayer too slapdash?
And that idiot who absolutely has to wet his wick.
And with whom, Lord?
That floosey gives me goose flesh!
She might nab him from me.
No, not that! Oh God, please make sure she's a lousy lay!
Amen.
Charlie, I'm hungry.
I'll eat in my room... Chicken?
No, I don't like white meat.
A thigh!
Thanks.
This is really beautiful.
Yes, but we're never here in the winter.
So we have to redo the ceilings every time.
Charlie.
Excuse me a moment.
I'll take her to my room and screw her. 
It'll be like a poem dedicated to you.
Give this to Milady.
I'll show you my room.
- So you sleep here.
- Yes.
That's pretty. 14th century?
Maybe but I don't give a damn.
Take off your panties.
You skirt's sexy. Keep it on.
- Perverted?
- Sensual. Are you shocked?
- Not at all.
- Panties off!
2nd and final order.
I'll take her to my room and screw her. 
It'll be like a poem dedicated to you.
My poor Lambert.
Right now you're wallowing in poetry.
I hate the both of you.
I hate the idea of your odors blending together
while I stink with age and oncoming death.
Mama, I'm not hungry any more.
Please! May I!?
Dear Pompilius, wait until you see this!
It's worth its weight in peanuts!
So now you spy on your guests?
Not really! I admire them.
- Isnt't he nice?
- Too much so!
Spite is gnawing at you.
Spite?
My poor dear, as you can imagine, after my Paris trip I dined on her marvelous youth.
Dined? Almighty God, with what silverware?
Forgive me, but your Casanova is a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am.
There, for example!
Might I ask what he's doing with his hands while his tongue is busy?
He's holding the whore's hands!
My poor dear, you shouldn't give your cherub pussies to munch on!
Give him a cake, Madam! A cake.
What're you doing, reprobate?
I'm sorry to leave your pulpy face in the claws of that hopeless humper.
Unfortunately, I have no other choice.
I've never spoken of money because.... you've always fulfilled my happiness.
But I'm going to have to exist a bit longer without you, but a bit longer.
I'm certain you will be generous.
I wish you a still longer life and a beautiful death for ending it!
Farewell, my poor beauty!
Papa Emil!
Who is it?
Lambert.
Shit, I'm talking nonsense!
Lord, protect me!
Come in.
Did you eat?
Not much. It's no fun dining alone in this big house.
Tomorrow I'll be back to my normal self.
Good.
Any news of Pompilius?
None.
He can drop dead!
It's what I pray for.
You're cruel, Milady.
One must be in order to reign.
I've decided we'll leave soon.
- To go where?
- Paris.
A deal?
The deal of the century! My last!
The coronation of all my schemes of a lifetime!
We're going to nab the dough from an ice delivery.
Why don't you pull out, Milady?
You're rich now.
You're shitting your pants, darling.
I'm trying to be lucid for us both.
I'm not Clyde and you're far from being Bonnie.
You dream of back-flips but can't even get on a bar-stool.
You smell like a faded hide, Lady McThing.
You stink from the inside out.
That's worse!
Put him on.
How are you, Your Excellency!
Of course.
Of course.
I'll be glad to see him.
Indeed, Your Excellency.
And thank you for the reception.
Yes, it was... grandiose.
See you, Your Excellency.
It was that schmuck Boulipuram.
He's after the diadem.
He knows!
Pompom's slipping.
The gaga old fool must have bargained down the price of the copy of the diadem.
His age is showing.
You had fun with Noémie the other day?
Peeping through keyholes?
Invite your partner to lunch.
Lambert, you asked your bimbo to lunch?
Yes? Then go to get her!
Do as I say!
My divine one!
My rarest!
My fabulous one and only!
Close the door, dammit!
My turtledove with ashen feathers!
I can't abandon you!
Abandon you... far from what has caused me only remorse, love of my soul!
Respect our past and spare me your tears and declarations!
But you're killing me, Madam!
Get out of my bathroom, you dry-balled diplomat!
An old lady in her bath is doubly naked.
Far from abandoning or leaving you, Madam.
I shall stay and share your water!
I'll have run the entire gamut with you, Pompom!
My love song, do you recall our walk?
Our evening on Lake Como?
The month following our encounter?
I've heard that a detective hired by Boulipuram is hanging around?
We've done nothing to be ashamed of.
Tell me, did you buy the phony diadem at a hardware store?
I trust you've carefully hidden the object of the theft because your protégé is far from being an Arsène Lupin.
Of course, it's Lambert's fault!
You'll be pleased, Pompom.
My chicken is bringing your eternal youth to lunch.
My flower!
My sweet!
My white foam.
I love you!
I'm completely drunk.
Alcohol gives your youth a new sparkle whereas it deadens old age in a confounding fashion.
- How beautiful.
- It's crap!
Where'd you find that little frock?
A thrift shop.
I thought so. It's ravishing.
For her who is in video,
I have a cassette to show you.
A documentary you'll find very interesting.
Charlie!
Coffee in the living room, please.
Allow me...
Thank you, Pompom.
Lambert, put that in the player.
What did you put in the champagne?
Thai Special?
Candy?
Is this truly decent, beloved?
Lambert!
Never mind Pompilius.
Go sit by Noémie.
Beloved!
He's becoming a Puritan, this white-clad death mask!
Do you think Noémie is a goody-goody right out of Sacred Lamb Convent?
Let's show them we don't give a damn!
That's fine, children.
Pretend we're not here.
Lord, how I'd like to be in her place
and feel that big lout's hands all over me!
Lord, I must be dreaming!
What's got into him?
He has his ramrod out!
He'll bang her like a commando!
Lambert!
Moderately! You're not a rabbit and Noémie's not a bunny.
A woman should me readied, my dear, and then savored.
Pompilius, show Lambert how.
She's not an icecream cone.
She's a Stradivarius!
Well played, it will produce melodious sounds.
Allow me...
You'll see, the old fossil knows what he's talking about.
Bravo, Pompilius!
The King!
Scram, you bitch!
Feel proud?
You're as good at making love as I am on a trampoline!
You should do as Lambert said. Scram!
You and your old guy make me puke!
If you leave this madwoman, call me.
Here... I think I love you.
Here...
She's not your aunt, eh?
The devil has no family.
Evelyn Stern... from Rome.
I'd like to see Lady Mackenshett.
I'll call her.
Have him wait on the terrace while
Charlie does the living room.
Mr Evelyn Stern from Rome.
Maharaja Boulipuram told me to expect you.
Sorry to made you wait but my arthritis is quite painful.
I'd like to see you in private, if I may.
I hide nothing from my nephew who is like a son to me.
And yet I must renew my request, Madam.
How mysterious!
In fact this concerns the young man this concerns the young man whom you claim is your nephew.
What about him?
His Excellency no doubt told you
I'm a private detective.
His Excellency surely mentioned the tactless act of which he was a victim concerning the diadem.
This fork after causing an electrical short-circuit was left in a flower-pot, very carelessly, I must say.
How exciting!
Your trade reminds me of a childhood game...
Hide-the-Button... I believe.
It bears the fingerprints of some servants and those of your pseudo-nephew.
Why do you pretend Lambert is not my nephew?
Because you barely know him.
You met in Guadeloupe where he worked as a beachboy for a hotel.
Would you like some coffee, tea or hot chocolate?
No, thank you.
Where did you find my nephew's fingerprints?
I took them from a bottle of water at the tennis court.
I understand everything.
You've been deluded by the charm of a young man with an angelic face.
I fear, it's not that, Mr Stern.
Meaning?
How I'd have preferred that it would have been dear Lambert!
A companion for over 20 years!
A man of such culture!
Such elegance.
Who?
Pompilius Senaresco, of course!
For years he's been only a friend for me.
But what a friend!
Attentive! Generous!
But for a time now, a kleptomaniac.
Recently... at a friend's home he pocketed a gold snuff-box.
The diadem! My God!
- What a disgrace!
- Madam, I'm...
Yes! During the reception he took Lambert's plate and fork saying he'd return them to the buffet table.
They'll arrest him?
I don't think the Maharaja is fond of scandal.
If the diadem were returned, he'd forget everything.
Search his room. He's in the garden.
But...
I've no right to do that!
You have my permission!
This is my house!
Shame weighs upon me, Mr Stern.
Lord, did You appreciate the lady's expertise?
When this asshole digs up the diadem
he'll take it to the Maharaja and pocket the reward.
My Lambert's honor will be saved
and old prick-head'll never know he was the scapegoat.
Is that Dago jerking off?
No, Du Schmuck! There's nothing under the mattress!
Lord, do You remember where
I stashed the rocks?
You weren't paying attention?
I forgive You!
I'll think of the hiding place real hard.
We'll see if the telepathy works.
Lord, this guy's circuits're jammed!
At last, Lord!
Sherlock Holmes is getting hot!
The logs, cock cream!
The logs!
What's this?
My dear Pompilius, your kleptomania is becoming more and more alarming.
For some time I've noticed you weren't quite right, old boy, but this tops it all!
Take it. It's real.
This sort of prank could cost you dearly, Sir!
Given your condition,
His Highness will not take you to court. It's a miracle!
Theft has become part of my life ever since women no longer turn around as I pass by.
Go put that on the head of whomever you wish, your boss or your daughter and keep the phony one for your wife.
Perhaps Mr Senaresco should see a doctor?
My respects.
Bravo, Pompom! Magnificent!
What you've done, Madam, is unforgivable!
But I'll explain!
You'll understand!
Dinner is served, Madam.
Thank you.
Lambert, go call our dear kleptomaniac.
Pompilius! Pompilius!
Shit.
Pompilius, dinner is served!
Shit!
The best of educations end up going sour.
What's wrong?
He's jealous of you, as usual.
Pour.
Thank you.
What a clown!
Take him down!
Carmel! Get the suitcases!
Lambert and I are leaving!
Milady had the dead man's room emptied
and sold the Rumaninan's things to a local 2nd-hand dealer.
No memory of Pompilius was left in the house.
On the flight to Paris, Milady cried.
Lambert was vaguely jealous
because he felt alien to her tears.
I hope you didn't leave our keys down south.
- What keys?
- To the apartment.
What apartment?
Marco, don't act the fool!
I don't like it.
What's wrong with you?
Who's Marco?
I'm not Marco, I'm Lambert!
We're in a Paris hotel and there's no apartment!
Lambert love, pass me the phone.
Thank you.
Sylvio... it's me.
I've arrived. Things are underway.
Repeat it!
The code!
Yes, fine. I'm in love!
His age? 25! And he loves me!
- You love me?
- Yes.
Confirmation. Ciao, Sylvio!
So what's up?
In 2 days a shady man'll be here to pick up some rather dirty money.
It's our duty to pocket that big pack of money.
Lambert love... you're the handsomest man
I've never known.
No, Milady.
I'm the last.
You should get some rest.
I'll get some Parisian air.
I knew you'd come back.
We came back.
Still got your old lady?
She brought me.
She's really got you hooked.
Hooked? There's no fisherman, Noémie, and above all, no fish.
It really makes me feel sad.
I was a beachboy in a plastic world and I discovered love.
- Love?
- True love.
What if I stripped naked right now?
No, I won't risk it.
I already hear her calling you.
Did you have a nice walk?
Is Pompilius with you?
Milady love, listen to me.
I'm listening.
Pompilius is dead, remember?
Naturally! Of course!
So why did you ask if he was with me?
You're crazy!
I swear, you just asked me that.
I was thinking about him.
I'm sure of it!
I guess...
We need to sleep to be in shape, right?
Good idea!
If you sleep with me like before...
Of course!
What are you doing, Milady?
Don't you see? I'm arranging flowers.
I'm going to sell them.
I used to be a florist.
My father was an Italian immigrant.
We had a shop in Nice.
My mother abandoned us, so I began working for him very early.
I thought you were an orphan.
Who told you that?
Pompilius... I guess.
It doesn't surprise me - he makes no sense these days.
Maybe you could tell me your name?
I'm Genevieve.
However you want it.
Anonymity has its charm too...
That's Paris! I'm Lambert!
You're going gaga, old gal!
Don't cry! Try to see! I'm Lambert!
You found me in Guadeloupe.
I helped you walk in the sea for your arthritis!
Now we're in Paris to pull off a big job! Remember?
And Marco?
Marco?
You can't go gaga like some grandma!
Not you, Milady!
Come on, you're going to have a bath! Move!
Pompom? Where's Pompom?
What if your Sylvio made this up and the moustachoed man doesn't exist?
Don't start it again!
You'll bore me to death.
There's 20% risk in what you're proposing.
Damn pansy!
It's them.
- Where?
- Over there. I'm sure of it.
Moustache! This is our man!
Forgive me, Lord,
-...for I have lied.
- Milady!
Actually, my father was a notary in Rome.
I was the only daughter among
5 children.
2 of my brothers died in the war, and 2 died by the law.
Wait!
I think I've peed.
Go get Pompilius, he knows.
Don't move, Milady, and don't call him.
I can take care of you myself.
What time is it?
- Half past noon.
- Still?
We only spent 15 minutes at the restaurant.
Don't forget about our business at 3 o'clock.
Take it.
What's that?
A stimulant.
It's good for your neurons.
I'll nap for just an hour then you'll wake me, my love.
Afterwards, we'll grab the rocks and get out of there.
OK
I'm scared to death, Milady, but I'll do it alone.
Because I love you... and only you.
I want no one to hurt you.
Why're you here?
I brought the champagne.
I didn't order it. Get out!
You're room 2502?
Just who are you?
It's OK this time but no more solos!
- I promise!
- I like to have fun too!
You know,
I said I'd tell you the whole truth and I dreamt about it earlier.
- I was 14...
- Say no more, Milady.
I don't want to know the truth.
You're a fairy tale... Mine!
There's no room for truth in a fairy tale.
Allright!
I'll handle the bags, you dress and we'll go home.
I'd like a porter for Lady
Mackenshett's suite, please.
Since we're  telling all, Lord, let me confess to You.
Lambert is the only man
I've wanted in Your bitch of a planet.
I love him, Lord.
Oh, Lord, to be his once.
Just once!
Men! Lord, I don't know what made
You create such a breed!
I've done my best to bust the balls of all of them
except for my Lambert whom I love.
I'd like to lop off all their ducks
and build a Himalayan wall of cocks!
Promise me You're not a man, Lord,
so that when the day comes
I can sit on Your right hand without puckering my buns.
Pompilius?
Yes, I must put some roses on Pompilius' grave.
I wonder what my little Lambert's cock tastes like.
Lambert, how's the sea today?
Chillier than yesterday.
These daily walks do me a lot of good.
I'm pleased, Milady.
My hip barely aches any more.
I wonder if, by immersing myself up to my neck, it would make my breasts firm again?
Possibly.
- Shall we go home?
- No!
We're going to Calais.
Calais?
By the hovercraft we'll met a man named Blaise wearing a yellow jacket.
He'll give us a plan.
We'll leave for London early that evening.
To do what?
I have an impregnable plan for heisting the Crown Jewels.
That hot ice was an appetizer!
Did you think I'd quit after a job you stole from me?
Little schmuck!
- Now for a foreign news summary in English.
Four suspects were arrested today by the Athens police but there is no confirmation yet that the arrests were made in connection to the scalpel murders.
The third victim of this terrifying series of surgical slayings was discovered last night.
The Greek Prime Minister announced...
♪ And in the middle of the night ♪
♪ I know she'll make me feel alright ♪
♪ And in the middle of desire ♪
♪ You know she makes my heart a fire ♪
♪ She takes the sun ♪
- [Man] I'm applying for this job, Mr. McKinnon, because A,
I believe I'm fully qualified and B, because I don't wanna go back to the States right away.
You see, sir, working in the Middle East for five years was sort of a divorce from reality and civilization for me.
To find myself plugged into the Madison Avenue scene might upset my balance.
This is what I really need, a decompression chamber where one half of the brain thinks western while the other half can think in terms of five centuries ago.
On the other hand, I'm an excellent account executive, but I know a lot about copy.
I speak English, French, Italian, I work hard for my money.
Anything else you need to know is in my resume.
- Just exactly, the camera goes all the way there, okay?
Spread out.
James?
- Now, on business matters, I'm proud to inform you that I managed to get everything ready on time, and in return, you promise not to ask how much we're spending.
Do you absolutely, definitely, honestly swear not to ask?
- Yeah.
- Good, I'll start the shooting now.
Alright, you guys, let's get the show on the road!
Action!
- [Man] No.
It can't be.
Not Mary Anne.
Not my Mary Anne.
- [Employee] I personally like the new four-color brochures, but the client thinks different.
He said though that he'll be happy with them if you're happy.
What do you think?
- Well, I don't know, Olympic Holidays is bringin'
100,000 people into this country every summer.
You can do better than this.
That's it for today.
It has to grab you.
- Mr. Ratcliff, this is for you.
- Great, thank you.
Did you arrange payment for the girls, Claire?
Claire?
Claire!
- No, I didn't.
It's the sixth day of the bank strike.
- It's also the eighth day of the bus strike.
Second week of the taxi strike.
Third month of gas rationing.
32nd year of my life on this planet, so what?
- So, happy birthday!
Do you want me to sing?
- Buy me a Cartier watch instead.
- Do you wanna come over tonight and celebrate?
- Who else is invited? - Just you.
- I don't know, Claire.
You probably just want me for my body.
- I don't know, Jonathon, you're probably right!
- In that case, I'll come. - Good.
Be there at nine.

- Not tonight, Harry, I've got a headache.
- [Jonathon] I promise you, we'll always be together.
- [Mary Anne] I love you, Jonathon.
- [Jonathon] I love you, Mary Anne.
No!
Mary Anne!
No!
- [Mary Anne] Help me, Jonathon, help!
- [Jonathon] You get your hands off her, let me go!
- [Mary Anne] Help me, Jonathon, help!
- [Jonathon] No, Mary Anne, Marry Anne!
- [Man] It's not your fault, son.
They were four, they were older, stronger.
- [Jonathon] I wanna see her.
- [Man] I won't let you, Jon.
In a few months.
A few years, maybe.
When it's safe for her to see you again.
- what-- - Shh.
Don't move.
I think someone's watching us.
- Oh, god.
- You're gonna be alright.
It's me, Claire.
- What's... what's--
- Shh.
Take it easy.
You're in a hospital.
You took a real bad fall and they, uh, they found you unconscious, but you're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.
- Are you sure, absolutely nothing?
- No.
Everything's black.
Just black. - Alright, let's try again.
- I've been away from the office for an entire week, Claire.
- Screw the office.
- While you're at it, why don't you include the tests and the doctors?
- I know you feel horrible about this.
- Confused is more like it.
- They're confused, too.
They have absolutely no idea why you're blind.
They act like you're-- - Claire.
This bed is killing me, I wanna go home.
- Tomorrow, they said.
- No more tests?
- That's what they said, I don't trust them, they... we'll give this a few days, and then I'm taking you back home.
I'd feel safer in New York.
- Look, Ma, no eyes.
- You're doing fine, in a couple of days, you'll be cruising around here just like you used to.
- Easy for you to say.
- You'll be alright.
- Sure.
I'll be dandy.
She never got over it, her family committed her,
I never even saw her again.
Until a couple of days ago.
At least, I think it's her.
I can't tell.
You know what the hardest part was?
I couldn't help her.
I just couldn't.
- I'm not giving you up, Jon.
- I don't want you to.
But this is something that I just, I have to do.
For me.
You, you're mad, aren't you? (dark music)
- No.
I'm hurt.
And I'm scared and I'm too god damn stupid to cover it up.
- You know somethin', it's pretty damn dark in here.
I'm not gonna take it.
Mm-hm.
You know what I'm gonna do today?
I'm gonna go out.
If thousands of other blind people can do it, I can do it.
- Oh, one!
A two!
A three!
A four!
- Hello?
- [Man] Hello.
- Where are you?
Over there? - No, over here.
- No, here!
- Here.
- Look, I don't want any trouble, just show me back to the--
- Sure!
But it'll cost you.
- Show us some money and we might show you the way home!
- Hey, don't point that fucking stick at me, man.
- [Man] Silly boy.
- Or I might just bust your head in!
(thud) - Now what you made him do.
You've annoyed him!
Oh, lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely!
- (laughs) A blind man shouldn't have so much money.
Alright, I'm gonna tell you where the exit is, so you can get out of here and give the police a good description of the arseholes who kicked the shit out of you.
The exit is this way. (train approaches)
- Come on, come on, let's go!
- If you'd like to give us any more, you can find us here any night between the hours of 11 and 12, okay?
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Excuse me, is there a doctor in the house?
- You're not going out alone again.
- Says who? - Says me.
That little stunt you pulled last night was suicide.
I'm not gonna let you kill yourself.
Even if your condition is permanent, blind is better than dead, for Christ sake.
- That's a matter of opinion.
- What happened last night, Jon?
- I told you.
I fell down.
- I want the truth.
- Come on, Jon.
Talk to me.
You talk to your god damn plants, why can't you talk to me?
- Plants don't talk back.
- [Employee] Hi, Jon, it's Brian from the office.
I just called to say that the US embassy has no record of
Rachel Boyet or Mary Anne Perry.
If you can, give me some details, I could try them again.
Call me when you feel like it, eh?
Bye.
- Thanks. - You're welcome.
For what?
- For coming with me.
- Hey, why didn't you bring a drink for me?
- [Model] I only have two hands.
- You want a sip? - Yeah, I do.
- Here's your coffee.
- Thanks for the ride, pal.
- Cut the crap.
- Heavy slang for a proper Brit.
What did you come up with?
- Well, it seems Barnard and the others run a pretty tight outfit.
The Hedra Society is definitely a temple for high-tech devotees.
- And Steiger?
- Two-time Nobel Prize winner.
Top-notch brain surgeon and a good husband.
- Meaning?
- Meaning I pulled a few social strings here and there and got through to his wife, Stephanie.
- And?
- Steiger will see you on Sunday.
- I checked your medical tests from the hospital, worked up by highly qualified physicians.
Everything's negative.
You should not be blind.
Your optic nerve doesn't appear to be damaged.
The sheathing's intact.
Everything appears to be functional, and should be.
Except for the possibility of blindness induced by trauma.
- So, if there's no clinical case, there's no cure, right?
- Well, that depends.
If, for example, I were dealing with someone who was recently blinded and whose optic nerve were irreversibly damaged, I might just possibly be able to help him.
Alright, this demonstration will give you an idea of the principals involved.
Some 20 years ago, a young amateur in the united States found a way for deaf people to hear music.
What he did, using electrodes, he connected some secondary auditory nerves of a deaf subject to a sound source.
Now, the music we're about to play will not be audible, but will come directly from that tape deck to the electrodes on your arm.
Uh, Andrew, would you mind?
You're not hearing things, the music you just experienced was transmitted directly through your nervous system to the auditory center of your brain.
In other words, we bypassed your ears.
Well, this basic concept.
I've devised a method to do the same thing with sight, and this is what I've come up with.
- A tape recorder?
- Not quite.
This little unit, which for obvious reasons is concealed in a plain commercial case, is a mass of printed circuits and computer electronics.
- What does it do?
- Well, put simply, it combines a sonar device with a visual synthesizer.
- That's not quite simple enough.
- Alright, it's like the sonar used in submarines or even some self-focusing cameras.
An electronic signal is sent out from a source.
Now, as soon as it hits an object, it bounces back to the source again.
This little unit does essentially the same thing.
It sends out a constant inaudible signal.
Now, when that signal hits any objects near around you, it bounces off them and returns to the unit again.
And that signal is then fed into a computer chip which measures the size and the distance of those objects.
That information is then transmitted directly to the visual synthesizer which processes it instantly.
And it relays the image directly to the sight center of your brain, it's more or less like looking through the eyes of a computer.
- Unbelievable.
- We have a problem, however.
It's never been tested on a human subject.
- I'd like to try.
- I want you to be very sure, because once I perform the operation, it will destroy any chance whatsoever of you ever regaining your eyesight again.
Can you make this decision?
I'll use the laser to cut an 0.3 millimeter hole in the skull.
I will then implant the positive electrode plate.
Um, are we ready?
- [Nurse] Ready, doctor.
- I wanna emphasize again, Jon, that CompuVision is still only in its experimental stage.
There's no way that we can imply that it even replaces normal sight.
First I'll teach you how to use the main unit, which is actually three units in one.
The forward button activates the unit.
It takes a couple of seconds for the initial feed of information, then the computer takes over.
The rewind button activates a cassette inside the unit.
All signals you receive can be recorded and played back.
In other words, you'll be able to keep a visual record of what you see and re-examine it at a later time.
Finally, the volume control, which activates an advanced and very powerful sound amplifier.
Now, the positive contact between this unit, your nervous system and your brain, is made via the minute platinum-electrode plate which we implanted in your skull.
Now, I'm gonna turn the unit to its ready position, and I want you to let me know how you feel.
Good.
Now, as I turn the unit to its on position, you'll begin to see outlines forming a computerized grid giving you the exact layout of this room.
Your journey begins, Jon Ratcliff.
Good luck.
I trust that you now have a complete view of the room.
Ah.
I forgot to mention something.
One of the limitations of this first model is its sensitivity to fast head movement.
The headset, which sends out sonar signals, takes the place of your eyes.
Now, turn slowly and give the unit time to adjust to the field of vision.
And be careful around windows.
The sonar will not penetrate glass, no matter how transparent.
Remember, a window is still a solid surface to the sonar.
There's one more limitation.
You won't be able to see precise details.
Generally, you'll see people and things in outline form only.
Um...
Of course, you won't be able to read, either.
But if you get close enough, you'll be able to see faces, or anything else that's three-dimensional.
- That's good enough for me, doctor.
- You must also remember that prolonged use of the unit is not recommended.
We're dealing here with an electrical stimulation of the brain which could prove damaging if overdone.
I would suggest an initial trial period of no more than two hours and then, only in 15 minute blocks of time.
Otherwise, you could experience synapse dysfunction.
- Meaning?
- Petit mal seizures, blackouts, even collapse.
See what tolerance you develop, we'll play it by ear.
Varies from brain to brain.
- You're the boss.
- I don't think so.
- Hello.
- So, why didn't you tell me?
- I wasn't sure how you'd react.
- I wouldn't have said anything.
- There are times when I think you are the ideal companion.
- How about when you're sober?
- My condition doesn't matter.
I've always known when you were faking it.
Like right now?
- What're you talking about?
- You're worried.
Hey.
I can't see your face well enough to prove it.
But I know you're trying to hide your concern.
Don't fret, Claire, I know what I'm doing, believe me.
- Eat, your fish is getting cold.
- Okay, let's see.
The computer unit feeds electronic signals to my brain, right?
Right.
The game feeds electronic signals to the TV screens also, right?
So, if I'm correct, I should be able to feed the game directly into my clever little brain.
- well, what a night that was.
Ta-da!
Not bad for the money, eh?
What do you think?
- It's great.
- Bye.
Hi, Lisa.
Yeah.
Terrible.
Listen, I can't go tonight.
I'm gonna take a sleeping pill and go right to bed.
Just really hard.
The usual.
Started on me right away.
Yeah.
Listen, can I tell you about it tomorrow?
It's been a really long day.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, you too.
Bye.
- Time to say goodnight.

Don't come back again.
- Hello?
- [Claire] Jon?
- Yeah. - It's me, Where've you been?
I've been calling all night, didn't you get my messages?
- I just walked in, sorry.
- Where were you?
- Out.
On business.
- What were you doing?
- I paid some bills that were due.
I even opened a new account.
- I just don't see what good it would do to go to the police, I don't have anything to tell them.
- You've got the tape.
- Which I can only play back up here.
- Maybe you can get some detail from the tape.
Maybe give the cops a lead.
- Have you ever dealt with the local police?
- Come on, Jon.
If that tape can help stop this maniac, use it.
What you know may save somebody's life.
Oh, and Jon, if you do find anything, don't play detective.
Let the police handle it.
- Come on!
- [High-Pitched Voice] Right there, right there.
- [woman] That's the hotel, that's the hotel.
That's the hotel, that's hotel.
- Well, I'll be damned.
This tape is for Dr. Steiger, in case I can't tell him myself.
This is only a precaution, doctor, because I don't know how far I can go experimenting with this unit.
And by the way, I think it's a fantastic machine.
Alright, down to business.
The other night, I was walking on the streets and
I heard someone scream inside a building.
There had been a murder.
I just replayed my CompuVision tape.
I think that the killer was driving a car with a bad engine.
It made a distinct sound, real noisy.
That's not much in itself, except I'm positive I've heard, maybe even seen that car before, the problem is,
I can't remember where or when.
It must be buried in my subconscious or something.
Anyway, the point is, I overdosed the other day when I connected my ComputVision unit directly into a video game machine.
I went into some kind of seizure.
Collapsed for quite a few hours.
When I started coming to, I had a strange experience.
Something I had forgotten about years ago.
I saw myself at four years old, on a day I fell and twisted my ankle.
What if the video game acted as some kind of trigger on subconscious memories?
What if the overdose brought them back to my conscious mind?
I don't know how dangerous this thing can be, Doctor Steiger but I'm going to try.
Somebody's life could depend on me remembering where I heard that car.
This recorder is voice-activated, Doctor Steiger, so it'll record every sound I make.
If I do make any more sounds after this.
I'm not here right now, I'll probably be out all day.
At the sound of the insufferable beep, please leave your name and number, I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
I just called to remind you that I'm going to that cocktail party for a while.
Oh, I don't want to, but I have to.
So, when I get to your place, I expect to find you in bed, ready and very willing.
- It worked, Dr. Steiger.
I saw the car, a taxi cab and the killer.
Not his face, but I saw him with surgical gloves.
He even had...
Jesus.
Rachel.
Come on.
Come on!

- (chuckles) Dave.
You scared me.
- Be careful, you'll choke me.
- How was your day at the hospital?
- Terrible, how about yours?
- [Rachel] Okay, I made my thousand bucks.
Anything exciting on your end? - No, I didn't operate today.
Had meetings all day long with administration, real drag.
- [Rachel] (chuckles) well, you can forget the hospital now.

- [Jon] Games?
You mean like putting on surgical gloves and cutting people up?
You mean those kinds of games?
- I'm coming out, David!
- Don't move, Rachel, you're safe over there.
- Who is that? - It doesn't matter.
Just stay where you are.
This maniac has a scalpel in his hand.
He was gonna use that on you. - He's lying, Rachel.
- Am I?
Listen to me, Rachel.
Good ol' Dr. David isn't a doctor.
Maybe he had some fantasy about being one when he was a kid, but it never worked out.
Know what David really does, Rachel?
He drives a taxi, not a real taxi.
He just drives it to pick up his victims.
He's sick, Rachel.
He wants to hurt you.
- I'm gonna cut you in half, you son of a bitch.
- [Jon] well, go ahead, doctor, try.
But you've gotta find me first.
The master switch is next to the entrance.
Go for it.
- David!
What the hell's going on?
- [Jon] Feel more comfortable in the light, Dave?
I thought so.
I thought I'd make it easy for you.
You have to find me, Dave.
I've seen you kill.
I know all about you.
You can come out now, Rachel.
It's all over.
- Who are you?
What's going on?
- [Jon] Call the police, they'll do the rest.
- The rest of what?
Who the hell are you?
- Just a friend.
Hey.
Hi, gorgeous outline.
- [Claire] Thank god you're okay.
- [Jon] why are you breathing so hard?
- Because I ran all the way!
- [Jon] The problem with you is you worry too much, hm?
- What happened?
- The girl is alright.
- And you?
- I'm okay.
I'll tell you about it.
Now that it's over, I can tell you all about it.
Can you drive us back?

Lois, I've been thinking.
Me too.
What about?
You first.
Okay.
Sometimes...
...you think you're immortal.
You start to think that the people around you are too.
It just takes a second to realize how wrong you are...
...about everything.
Come on. Give me a break.
You wanna go back?
If the earth opened up at my feet,
I wouldn't move until I'd said this:
Lois...
...will you marry me?
Who's asking? Clark...
...or Superman?
It's the new glasses, isn't it?
They just don't work as well as the old ones did.
Okay.
I guess the first question is, how long have you known?
Really.
I would've thought it would have been
"How did I figure it out?"
That's kind of neck and neck with
"How mad are you?"
- Let's save that one for last.
- Okay.
Here.
Thanks.
So...
...how long have I known?
Since yesterday.
How did I figure it out?
When you did this:
You've touched me before.
Both of you.
But I guess almost dying sort of heightened everything, all my senses.
Sort of like putting on a pair of glasses.
It's stopped.
So how mad are you?
- I'm not mad.
- Excuse me?
I'm not mad at all.
- This is not really a time to hold back.
- I'm not.
I'm sorry, I was talking to Lois Lane.
I know she was here a second ago and I know she wouldn't react...
I'm hurt.
I'm really, really hurt.
Which is gonna be worse than mad, isn't it?
Okay, Lois, okay.
I've been rehearsing this for months.
Let's see if I can get it right.
I know this is a shock...
...and I wanted to be the one to tell you...
...so that you could understand how hard this has been for me...
...how I've carried this secret by myself...
...and how long
I have wanted to tell you.
But when I decided to become Superman, I...
Became a target.
And so anybody close to you became a target...
...and it just got more complicated when you realized you loved me.
Which was about two minutes after I met you.
- Don't try and score points.
- Sorry.
Look, I get it. I really do.
It's logical. It's even thoughtful.
It's just, when you get right down to it...
...you made me believe that you were two different people...
...and you did that by lying.
And that makes me feel like
I don't know you...
...and that really hurts me, and you know what?
- I am mad. I'm really mad.
- Okay.
I'm really, really mad. Clark, I'm furious.
- Go ahead, Lois. Get it out, okay?
- Help!
Please, somebody, help me!
- Go.
- Help!
- Please!
- Go.
Help me!
Drop that knife.
Let him go.
No! Superman, they saved me.
I was walking home and this guy jumped me and these two came out of nowhere.
- If it wasn't for them, I...
- Hello, Superman.
We're members of the Church Group.
The Church Group?
- As in Bill Church?
- As in Intergang?
Mr. Church wants Metropolis to be a better place to live...
...and he's committed his fortune to that end.
Situation green. Continue patrols.
Thank you. All clear.
So you're some sort of vigilante group?
Church's private storm troopers?
Well, that's against the law.
If you check with the police, you'll find we're operating under their purview.
Let's get this man into custody.
Sir, come with us.
The police will need your statement.
Superman, thanks for trying to help.
Well, gotta give Church and his son some credit.
They love Metropolis and they never stop trying to take it over.
I should take a look around the city, just to make sure everything's all right.
But I don't wanna fly off with you mad.
I'm not mad. Okay, I am.
It's all right, I just...
It was easier talking to Clark.
- You still are.
- That's just it. I don't know anymore.
Well, let me prove it to you.
No.
I mean, I can't yet.
I just... I need time to think.
Clark, you understand?
Sure.
- No, so you're not upset...?
- I asked, you answered.
Well, I'm the one who was lied to.
Don't get petulant with me.
Okay, I see.
So it's okay for you to get mad...
...but I shouldn't feel anything when you say...?
All I'm saying is it's too much too fast.
Right, I get it.
No, I don't think you do.
No, I do get it, Lois. It's fine.
Now I really...
I should, you know, check the city.
That is so unfair.
You know I can't fly.
Dad?
Son, it's so good to see you.
How was Tokyo?
Well, that little territory spat with the yakuza's all settled...
...stores are going up, the foreign minister took the bribe.
- How are you feeling?
- The doctors say I'm doing great.
A new heart, a new man.
That's my motto these days.
Billy, I've got so much to tell you,
I don't know where to start.
What are you doing to your office?
Well, that's part of what
I wanna tell you.
- Hunky!
- Mindy!
Oh, no.
Billy, I want you to meet your new stepmom.
- Step...
- Hello, Billy.
Your dad's told me so much about you.
Well, that certainly gives you the advantage, Mindy.
Son, I know what you're thinking:
"The man's gone soft since the heart attack...
...married his pretty nurse, and now he's a few grapes shy of a bunch."
But I wanna tell you,
I've never seen things clearer.
I've never felt with more absolute fervor my true destiny.
I'm guessing I'll need a drink.
We're criminals.
Greedy, opportunistic vermin preying on innocent people.
- And?
- I can't do it anymore.
What, so you wanna retire?
I want to dismantle Intergang.
I wanna pull the plug on this whole stinking operation...
...and I wanna use our resources to make the world a better place.
- You're serious?
- Totally.
Between the jet lag and the airplane food, I think I'm taking this pretty well.
I've earmarked $500 million to establish the Church Group.
Four thousand men and women patrolling Metropolis...
...with the singular purpose of making this the safest place on earth.
You shell out some pretty good drugs in that hospital, don't you, Min?
What?
Exactly.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hi.
So I called you last night.
A couple times.
Yeah, I was...
- Anything happen?
- No, it was pretty quiet.
I wanted to keep an eye on that Church Group.
- There sure are a lot of those guys.
- Yeah.
I was doing some research on them.
- Here.
- Thanks.
Look, last night we both got pretty emotional.
It's understandable, I guess.
It's just, I feel a lot clearer today and...
Great. Me too.
Look at this. Completely legitimate?
Funded entirely by Church.
Look at this board that he's assembled.
A former governor, a vice president, a general.
- Yeah, it's got a nice, polite exterior.
- Let's see what's under the surface.
Clark.
You know what? Can you go this alone a little bit longer? I hear a siren.
But...
Of course, it's now becoming a well-known fact...
...that our streets are dramatically safer from crime.
But the Church Group doesn't stop there.
They've taken it upon themselves to offer free auto assistance...
...safety checks of homes, businesses, and all manner of public transportation...
...management of busy intersections, teaching kids about community service...
...taxis for the elderly and the infirm...
...even going so far as to guarantee food freshness...
...in restaurants and grocery stores.
Polls indicate citizens have never felt safer.
Mindy? What is it?
Oh, Billy.
Nothing, nothing.
Is Dad okay?
Hey, hey, hey, what is it?
Well...
...I know we don't know each other real well...
...and there's no reason why you should trust me...
- Well, I...
- I think your father's very sick.
- Sick? How?
- Well, he's going crazy.
He keeps talking about his new mission, and the way he's spending money...
- Yeah, I've seen the reports.
- He bought half a museum in London...
...because he wanted to be surrounded by beauty.
If this keeps up, there won't be anything left for us.
Well, the thought had occurred to me. I...
Well, I'm just his wife.
I don't understand all this business.
But I really think it'd be best for everybody if maybe he...
- Yes?
- ...retired?
And I ran things the way they should be?
Well, he's not just gonna step down.
I know.
I'll do anything you say, Billy.
Anything?
Wait a minute.
You're married to my father.
This is great.
Please, please tell me you're working on a story full of mayhem and scandal.
No such luck.
Boy, tomorrow's lead's gonna read,
"Girl Scout Jamboree Big Success."
If this keeps up, we're gonna have a one-page city section.
Hey, hold up, Chief.
Why does news always have to be bad?
- Why can't we report the good things?
- Jimmy, you've been sniffing Linotype.
This is a newspaper.
It's either catastrophe or atrophy.
I know the Churches are up to something, I just can't get a fix on it.
I called Bobby Bigmouth but I haven't heard back.
Maybe it'd help if I set up an interview with my old golfing buddy, Bill Church.
See if you and Clark can find a skunk in the rose garden, so to speak.
Speaking of Clark, you know, I haven't seen him around here too much lately.
Is...? Is he okay?
Well, professionally speaking, of course.
Yeah, we're just both trying to get our facts straight...
...so we can figure out what's going on, make some decisions.
About the story.
- Right. Absolutely.
- Yeah. Yeah.
The story.
It has to make you wonder:
With all the good work being done by the Church Group...
...what's left for Superman to do these days?
You're out!
Oh, man, are you blind?
That's the fifth lousy call today.
Come on, that's not a very sportsmanlike attitude.
This was a lot better before we had some umpire that we never asked for.
The bats and the balls are mine and I'm out of here.
- You tell him. Come on.
- Boo, Superman.
Hey, come on, guys. Hey.
Come on, guys, let's go play at another field.
- Come on, you guys.
- Man.
- That's kind of silly, now. Let's play ball.
- Let's go.
Come on, you guys. I'm Superman.
- Guys.
- You stink.
With just a few hundred million, we can have all of this beauty.
The bargain of the century.
I mean, what have I been doing with money all these years?
Hoarding, investing. It's ridiculous.
Preposterous.
I'm glad you've come around, son.
Well, I had a nice, long talk with the newest Mrs. Church.
Say, Dad, can I tempt you?
Well, if it's all right with the nurse.
Okay.
She can be very persuasive.
Don't I know it.
Honey bun, the man with the Rodin wanted to see you about the bill.
Isn't she wonderful?
- I have a kind of a thought.
- Yeah, me too.
But this thought's business.
Your dad keeps talking about having this fundraiser.
And so maybe it could be at a museum...
...and maybe the museum could be full of really important people and art.
And then maybe it could, I don't know, blow up, which would maybe...
Which would make the cops think Dad did it...
...to increase the value of his own burgeoning collection?
You expect me to frame my own father...
...for the murder of hundreds of innocent people?
I love it.
The whole thing is just so Greek.
Off he goes to a nice cozy jail.
Of course, he'd have to turn the business over to... us.
I hadn't thought of that part.
That's good. That's really good.
Yeah, now all we need is a good explosives man.
So been pretty busy?
Yeah, pretty busy.
Doing what, exactly?
It's been pretty slow around here, action-wise.
Well...
You wouldn't be using your other identity...
...to avoid talking to me, would you?
Look, Lois, there are certain things about me being Superman...
...that you're just gonna have to get used to.
Really? Like the urgent need to umpire a kids' baseball game for two hours?
That was a very tense situation...
...because the kids were yelling.
They had bats and stuff...
Clark, what is wrong?
Why won't you talk to me?
What is there to talk about, Lois?
- I asked you to marry me, you said no.
- I didn't say "never."
You found out something that you don't like.
That's not true, I didn't say that.
I cannot change who I am and I can't change what I've done...
Lois, Clark. Wonderful to see you.
Come. There's something you've got to see. Come.
And every Cost Mart is going to have a display of the world's great art...
...so people can shop for bargains...
...and experience the beauty of culture at the same time.
- Must be costing you a fortune.
- One thing I've learned from my wife:
You don't ask the price when the reward is joy.
- Right, pookie?
- Right, hunky.
Mr. Church, given the allegations that you're involved with Intergang... one thing I've found is that when you're married to someone you love...
...it's like nothing else in the world.
It's life-altering. It's soul-changing.
It's the summit of all human desire...
...and when you finally achieve it, it's as if mind and body finally merge...
...and you're set free.
Totally.
- Cookie? They're low-fat.
- Thanks, no.
- Back to the Intergang allegations...
- Hey, you guys a thing?
Excuse me?
You going out? You seem like a thing.
Not a very happy thing, but...
Look, hunky, she's blushing.
Clark, do you realize what just happened?
We were sent to investigate...
...and we spent the whole time wallowing. We wallowed.
I hate wallowers, and that's what we've turned into:
A couple of sighing, slack-jawed, self-pitying wallowers.
For whatever it's worth,
I x-rayed underneath the store.
I found evidence of machinery being dismantled.
- So Church could be telling the truth.
- Are you kidding?
Next you're gonna be telling me you bought that lovey-dovey spew.
I hope being married does change your life...
...make you look at things in a new way.
Don't you think a part of that change is communication...
...getting things in the open?
I did get things out in the open, starting with "Will you marry me?"
No, I got things out in the open, starting with, "You are Superman."
A little louder, I don't think they heard you in Gotham City.
Speaking of which, when were you planning on telling me? The honeymoon?
Our first anniversary? When the kids started flying around the house?
First, I needed to know that you would marry me.
Not Superman, not his powers.
Just me, Clark.
I needed to know that, okay?
- Then I was gonna tell you everything.
- Well, I guess we'll never know, will we?
I guess we won't.
- Are you coming?
- No, I think I'll just:
- Fine.
- Fine.
It's like...
...we both, like, all of a sudden, aren't even sure that we like each other.
You have to remember, she has a lot to think about.
Yeah, you both do. You're taking some big steps, it's bound to be scary.
- I guess.
- Honey, you sound so sad.
How are things in Metropolis? Still slow?
Well, today I spent two hours polishing my boots, an hour ironing my S...
...saved a runaway hamster from a cat...
You make the reservations, I'll pack.
- Tightened my glasses.
Pretty exciting?
Pickles and mustard?
All you got is pickles and mustard?
What kind of person lives like this?
If my mother saw this, she'd put a curse on you.
- We can order takeout.
- Wait a minute.
You don't have any crackers? No nuts?
- Ice?
- Come on. What am I, a beverage?
No, it's all right. It's okay.
I've been feeling lately that this food obsession of mine...
...is masking a deeper emotional trauma.
Bobby, really?
No, actually, I'm trying to talk myself out of eating your chair.
Anyway, about your query.
I got a tip the Church boys reached out to Joe Arlo.
I know that name.
He's an explosives expert out of Atlanta.
- His nickname...
- Joe the Blow, used to work for the CIA.
Hey, you're quick.
Anyway, look, he just flew in, that's where he's staying. Good luck.
- Thanks.
- I'm not just doing this for you.
Hey, if this town remains crime-free...
...I'm looking at having to live on three meals an hour.
No, I think it'll be smoother if I'm partner-free tonight.
Housekeeping.
We have a problem.
- The reporter...
- Is on to Joe the Blow.
If she links him to that museum...
Well, I know I'm kind of new at all this business talk...
...but is it a big problem killing her?
She's kind of tight with Superman.
It makes it complicated.
- Unless...
- Yes?
...you came up with some kind of really brilliant way of keeping him busy...
...like getting him out of town...
...by causing some kind of big disaster someplace else.
- Hi, Clark.
- Hi, Marsh. Can I get a cap, please?
...is becoming ever more serious...
...as the reactor is continuing to emit deadly radioactive gas.
Authorities in Philadelphia don't know how many workers are still trapped...
...or how long their oxygen will last.
I'll be right back.
Don't move, Lois, and don't step off of the mat.
Do you like to exercise?
You look like you're in pretty good shape.
Do a lot of jumping jacks, do you?
Well, start now.
Stay on the mat and keep the beat.
The rules are simple.
Stop and die. Slow down and die.
Okay, Lois...
...let's feel the burn.
Come on, Lois, faster.
You see, you gotta double your speed every 10 minutes...
...or Mr. Bomb gets very upset.
Superman.
Superman! Help!
That's it. Go, girl.
Think of what a great looking corpse you'll make.
Want some water?
Just kidding.
Super... Superman.
I can't...
Superman, help.
Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.
Break a sweat yet, Lois?
No pain, no gain.
Keep those knees up, girl.
Can't... no...
Bye. Bye.
Are you all right?
Fine. Thanks.
- What is it?
- What is what?
Come on, Lois, I know that look.
I'm not giving you any look.
Exactly. It's your not-giving-me-any-look look.
Well, since you asked, what took you an hour?
A nuclear reactor was melting down in Philadelphia. What's your point?
I just think maybe you're taking my jeopardy a little for granted these days.
- What?
- You know, I can understand.
It's not the same new, sizzling romance.
I don't look at you like a cheerleader.
Maybe you see me differently too.
I'm just good old Lois, get to me whenever.
That's ridiculous.
Well, just food for thought.
Anyway, if you're not too busy...
...maybe we should try and find the guy who did this.
All things considered,
I'd rather be in Philadelphia.
This is going to be the greatest party ever.
Great art, great food, lots of money raised for the Church Group.
And everyone is going to love the new you as much as I do, hunky.
As much as we do, Dad.
Look. Balloons.
You know, I wanna go buy them all and give them to the children.
He's losing brain cells by the second.
Well, as crazy as he is, he can still read a paper.
- If Lois Lane publishes what she knows...
- No, she still doesn't know anything...
...except she's about to get an invitation to a party she won't be able to resist.
And what about Superman?
We plan just a little better for him this time.
So we went back to the hotel, but Joe the Blow was gone.
In fact, according to the computer register, he was never there.
- So we don't have clue one.
- Well, we have clue half.
I went into his toolbox and I found a diagram of the Museum of Art.
And then this morning,
Clark and I both got one...
Me too. Bill Church, Sr.
This Saturday, at the museum.
So the only connection I can see is that Bill Church, Sr...
...just started buying Picassos like they were comic books.
I'll tell you what.
We... we're all going to the party.
But we are going with the Metropolis Bomb Squad.
Martha.
I know it's rude to stop by without calling first...
...and even ruder to stick my nose in where it doesn't belong, but I...
Clark told you.
Everything?
Come on in.
Son, I never told you this before...
...but your mother turned me down the first time I asked her to marry me.
What?
You're kidding.
Actually, the first two times.
Well, what did you do?
I sulked, dove into my work.
Unfortunately, it was winter...
...so I looked pretty silly plowing up all those fields in the snow.
Anyway, around springtime,
I finally realized...
...that getting married wasn't just about my feelings.
Your mom was young, she was scared.
She knew that she loved me.
But was it a lifetime kind of love?
- She needed...
- Time.
You know, time to think it over...
...to get to know him for who he really is.
I mean, that's not unreasonable.
Not at all.
But you need to understand that Clark has always been alone.
When he was 13 and just beginning to be really strong, really, really strong...
...he made the decision on his own never to tell anybody.
He said he wanted to fit in.
But, of course, he couldn't. Not really.
It broke my heart, watching him having to hide so many things...
...afraid he was always gonna be alone.
You know I love him.
Then tell him. And make him tell you.
You can get through everything else.
God, I turned Jonathan down four times before we finally made it down the aisle.
- Really?
- Yes. I thought he was crazy.
Every time I turned him down, he'd go out and plow another field of snow.
This is so nice.
Almost 30 years.
You're the first woman I've ever been able to talk to about my boy.
The bomb's all set?
In a few minutes, this museum is going to be...
...the world's most expensive pile of ashes.
Billy, I promise we'll visit your dad in prison every Sunday.
Every other Sunday would be fine.
He wasn't much of a father.
Hi.
Hi.
- You looking into things?
- Yeah.
So that's what you've been doing when you pulled your glasses down.
I thought you had astigmatism.
- Look, I had something I wanted to say.
- Me too.
The bomb squad boys are in the museum.
They're making a clean sweep.
They're dressed as guards.
They're gonna be out of here in a few minutes.
Get ready for an exclusive.
Olsen! Where's your camera?
Anyway, I guess we should try and find the bomb...
...catch the bad guys, blah, blah, blah, and we can get out of here and talk.
Good plan.
What?
Just found a job for Superman.
Superman, this is the prerecorded voice of your friendly neighborhood bomber.
I'm at a frequency only you can hear to let you know...
...that your singularly dense molecular structure has triggered my autosensors...
...and if you move a millimeter:
Clark, what's wrong?
Lois, I can't move or I'll set off the bomb.
Enjoying the party? Pardon me.
Don't even think about getting to the bomb before it goes off.
As fast as you are, you'll never make it.
The bomb is underneath the table.
But the sensors are locked onto me.
I can't move.
- I have an idea.
- Wait, Lois, don't... Lois!
I lost something very personal.
Excuse me, Dad.
I wonder if you could spare five minutes.
- I've got a surprise for you.
- What kind of surprise?
Well, a little something I bought. I'd like us to donate to the museum together.
Oh, son.
It's being delivered to the store, so I thought we could bring it back.
Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you in the car.
- Sure.
- That's an excellent suggestion.
Bye, pookie. Don't be long.
The bomb is set to go off at 4:00.
Cops will get that anonymous tip from you...
...come get Dad at Cost Mart, and then...
And then a little family reunion at your place.
Clark, if you can hear me, say my name.
Loud enough so I can hear you.
Lois.
- I didn't hear you.
- Lois!
Okay, what I'm looking at appears to be some sort of computer clock...
...and it's wired to this real big canister of what I can only assume is...
Let's not dwell on that.
Do I want to detach the wires?
If I'm right, say "Lois."
- If I'm wrong, say "Lane."
- Lois.
Okay, there's a red wire and a blue wire and a green wire.
- What happened, son, you lose her?
- No, Chief.
- I think I should detach the red wire.
- Lane.
- The blue?
- Lane.
Oh, boy.
Things so bad between you two...
...you gotta resort to calling her Lane?
- So it's the green?
- Lois.
That's better. Now, you know, Clark...
...I kind of took a private vow to steer clear of you two, but, well...
- Should I detach it from the clock?
- Lane.
Clark, please.
Will you stop playing around?
- The explosive?
- Lois.
Got it.
What the sam hill's going on here?
Kent, you gotta figure out how you're gonna treat her...
...and you gotta be consistent.
Now... now, go find her.
Bad boy.
Oh, Lord, this is worse than I thought.
- You okay?
- Yeah. Little shaky.
- You did great.
- We did great.
Billy, this is beautiful. It's gonna look wonderful in the museum.
Well, in about two minutes, it'll sure stand out.
I think I'm gonna cry.
Don't cry, Dad.
I'll visit every other Sunday.
What? What is this?
- Be gentle.
- I'm in recovery.
No, no. Wait.
This is some kind of mistake.
Yeah, a mistake, right.
We got a tip linking you to him.
And that bomb in the museum.
Bomb? What's going on?
Mindy. It was Mindy, that double-crossing, two-timing...
Billy, don't talk about your mother like that.
Boys...
...it doesn't look very good for father and son...
...which means...
...there's a new boss in town.
So get ready for some changes.
"Churches Arrested, Bomber Confesses."
Now, these are what I call headlines.
And the fall of Intergang.
I'm not so sure about that one.
I miss all those guys in the black suits helping everybody.
I wonder what they're gonna do, now they're all fired.
Very good question.
Here's my very good answer.
Give me your wallets.
I don't think so. You should turn around.
Look, I'm willing to admit this was a bad career move.
I didn't really think it out.
Well, the nicest thing about jail...
...there's plenty of time to ponder those life choices.
Come on.
- Lois, can I speak with you?
- Sure.
There's something I'd like to show you.
- You cold?
- A little.
Here.
It's so beautiful.
I used to come up here a lot by myself and just drift.
Not part of the stars, not part of the Earth...
...not really knowing where I fit in, until I met you.
- Oh, Clark.
- Lois, I'll wait for you.
I'll wait for you as long as you need.
I want you to know I love you.
And you're not alone anymore.

The Khan of Bukistan is pleased that you have taken a fancy to his daughter Tarji.
So am I.
She is only a girl.
Yes, isn't she?
My, she's a wonderful girl.
I didn't know they still made them like this.
In Bukistan we are old fashioned.
Women are wives and mothers, as Allah intended them to be.
They are not taxi cab drivers and wrestlers.
Yes, I see what you mean.
I do not understand your country.
In America machines do everything.
Hm, not quite.
American ingenuity will find a way.
And when it does do not try and sell it to us.
It is the custom for the princess to dance for an honored guest.
That's a delightful custom, by all means.
The princess would be sensational in America.
There are many suitors for the princess Tarji's hand.
But the Khan has found them unworthy of her.
I don't wonder.
It's a pity.
Our women have been taught from birth the perfect art.
How to make a man happy.
The princess Tarji would be the ideal wife.
Every secret and every skill of five thousand years have been imparted to her every day and night of her life.
You see before you a woman who's entire being is dedicated to but one desire.
The desire to bring to her husband the gift of complete happiness.
A pity you cannot stay.
Yes, isn't it?
But I'm getting married next week.
Well, then, of course you cannot stay.
No, sir, I...
Oh, you speak English!
Well, I'm glad, because there's something
I'd like to add to that deal we made...
Now I see.
Thank you very much.
Please thank the princess for me.
And tell the Khan how grateful I am for his hospitality.
Shall we have the pleasure of seeing you again?
No, I'm afraid not.
My plane leaves first thing in the morning.
But do tell Tarji that I shall think of her often and remember the time we spent together.
If I were free, I...
His excellency is pleased to present you with this remembrance of your visit here.
Oh, thank you. That's very thoughtful of you, sir.
Uh... that's very thoughtful of him.
And please accept this from the princess as a token of her friendship.
Oh, Tarji... thank you, dear.
Katan!
I won't forget you.
She's asking you for a remembrance.
She admires your tie.
Oh, well, of course.
Darling.
She speaks English like a native, doesn't she?
Well, goodbye.
Your name, please.
Clemson Reade.
Under the "R"s.
Thank you.
Hello, it's nice to see you again, Mr. Reade.
Thank you, Evelyn.
May I park this stuff here?
Certainly. I'll tell Miss Effington you're here.
Don't do that. I want to surprise her.
Effie!
Clem!
Effie!
Oh, Clem, this is Mr. Portman, Mr. Whitley,
Mr. Bexton...
Mr. Reade, my fiancé.
Mr. Reade.
I must say I'm delighted to meet you.
Mustn't I?
I think that about covers everything.
You'll each get a copy of the report and the Secretary of State will take action on it next week.
Thank you.
Thank you, Miss Effington.
Good day, gentlemen.
Darling!
Dearest!
Welcome home, darling.
You can say that again.
Now then, tell me all about your trip.
Everything?
Everything.
Oh, well, Effie, it was the most amazing...
Sorry, dear.
Yes, Mac.
When is the revised report going out?
It's ready now, but I think it would be better to condense it first.
All right. But don't let them lose any time on it.
Is Kramer going to take it himself?
Yes, he's leaving on the 15th.
Be sure he doesn't go in cold.
Give him the background on the situation.
Right, he's being briefed on it.
What about Camfrid?
I'm keeping after him, but I'll check on it again this afternoon.
Thank you.
Well, that sounds just wonderful, darling.
What else did you do?
What else did I...
Oh, I'm sorry.
Effington... Yes, I'm ready.
It's Aberdan.
Oh!
Hello!
Hello, Givney.
Yes, we received it. It's an interesting idea, but we don't think it's practical.
It might cause a great deal of trouble.
Hm... well you can trust Mr. You-know-who but you've got to be careful of the other one.
Hmm...
Exactly.
Well, my suggestion is that you let them make the first proposal and tell them you're awaiting instructions on it.
What? Oh, nonsense.
Don't let them rush you.
Right. You'll get an answer on it within 48 hours.
Goodbye.
I'm sorry, darling. The oil situation is a little tense right now but I am glad you had such a successful trip.
I hope I haven't bored you with any of it.
Oh, no. You know I'm interested in everything you do.
I'll bet that's for you.
You win.
Effington.
Your mother?
Effie, why don't we go somewhere and be alone?
Oh, I'd love to, darling, but there isn't a chance.
I'm scheduled for a meeting at the Consulate in 15 minutes...
Things haven't changed much, have they?
It's just the oil crisis, dear.
There are so many plans to discuss.
We had some plans of our own, remember?
Oh, I certainly do.
All right. We'll discuss them at dinner tonight.
We are having dinner together.
Of course!
I've just talked to Givney again.
Here, take a look at Kaempfert's report.
This thing is really snowballing.
Now, what I think we should...
How are you, Reade?
Fine.
Have a nice trip?
Effie will tell you all about it.
Tonight.
This just arrived.
Oh, thank goodness, Annie.
How's everything in the kitchen?
Oh, everything's fine.
Fine, stop worrying, sir.
I'll give you plenty of time between courses.
Thank you.
Well, Brutus, how do you like it, huh?
Soft music, flowers, candlelight, huh?
Wait till you see this.
We,, do you approve?
Good.
Well, here we go.
Sorry I'm late, darling.
Darling.
What a day I've had.
You could have fooled me.
Oh, hello, Brutus.
Oh, isn't that a new hat?
Yes, do you like it?
Oh, it's very pretty.
It's awfully dark in here, dear.
There, that's better.
Fix me a drink, will you, darling?
Champagne coming up.
Make it a Scotch and water, would you, Clem?
Yes, dear, yes.
No ice, just a lemon and easy on the water.
Well, here we are, dear.
Well, darling, here's to...
...us.
I'm so glad you're back.
Oh, darling, I'm glad to be back.
I can assure you.
Hello, Annie.
Good evening, Miss Effington.
Dinner in ten minutes.
What...
Ten minutes?
What's the matter?
I have to go and make the salad dressing.
O know how you love it.
Excuse me, dear, I'll only be a minute.
Everything under control in the kitchen?
Oh, yes, wait until you taste it.
Is that a new bow tie?
Yes, do you like it?
Hmm, I do.
I always like your bow ties.
Now, that's better.
This is the first time I've relaxed in three weeks.
Good.
Honestly we never dreamed there'd be this much fuss about the oil leases.
First Iraq, then Iran, and now Bukistan is in the act.
Thank heavens I'm a woman. A man couldn't take it.
Never, my darling.
A week from tomorrow you can forget about everything except us.
I've been thinking about that, Clem.
Oh, so have I.
Now, I can't make up my mind where we ought to spend our honeymoon.
Bermuda, Honolulu, the farm in Vermont, or shall we just throw the key away?
Clem...
What?
I'm afraid we'll have to postpone the wedding till after the oil deal is signed.
What?
I don't see any other way, truly I don't.
There are so many things to get done.
Meetings, conferences, reports, and all of them so urgent.
So is our wedding.
But I mean really urgent.
Oh, for God's...
I mean, we can wait. The Middle East can't.
We can get married any time.
Can we?
Look, darling, I want us to be together just as much as you do.
But I can't let MacBride down.
He's counting on me.
Of course not.
Perhaps we could work in the wedding somehow.
You know, between phone calls.
Now just a minute. Don't you think you're being a little selfish?
You mean for wanting to get married?
No, for putting your own happiness before the welfare of the United States.
Oh, Effie, if I thought the welfare of the United States depended upon your answering a telephone...
Oh, so that's it.
You think what I'm doing is like belonging to a garden club or having a hot game of Mahjong with the girls.
No, no, I didn't say that.
You didn't have to.
You just can't believe that anything I'm doing can be important enough to really matter.
Oh, please, let's not get into that again.
We are in it, and we might as well have it out.
Come over here.
Here's Bukistan.
I know, I've been there.
Here's the United States.
I've been there too.
We have just one thing in common. Oil.
Every plan we've make for peace or war depends on that oil.
Is that so?
I don't have to tell you what happened in Iran.
Half the free world had to learn to pronounce the name Mosaddegh.
I still can't pronounce it.
The same thing is happening again... only this time there'll be a lot of new names to learn.
And the only way we can get that oil is to get those names on the dotted line.
Really?
And that's why this deal is so important.
And I'm in charge, Clem, whether you like it or not, I am in charge.
Yes, yes...
And if that's the Julliard Matron's Needlepoint Society,
I'll leave my hat.
Don't remember what you were going to say until I get back. Be a good girl.
Sorry to break in on you, Reade, but your phone's out of order.
I've been calling all evening.
We had a cable from Marley.
Givney's walked out. The pot's really boiling.
Givney's walked out?
Givney walked.
It must have been over his ears.
He can outweigh a pyramid.
I hate to be upsetting your evening, but this is so hot the words are just jumping off the papers.
Here, let me see it.
I'm afraid this is going to postpone your honeymoon.
Don't worry about it.
You see, we were right about this cookie.
Yes, but Glenson's weaker than we thought.
Dinner is ready.
Oh, start without me, Clem, I'll be right there.
No, no, no...
I don't believe you heard Annie.
Dinner is ready.
Pull up a chair, Mac.
I've eaten already.
I will have a little coffee, though.
I wish you'd go over that fourth paragraph.
Hm-hmm.
Right in here, now.
You see...
We'll have to change our tactics, I can see that.
We'll have to take part IV and put it under the heading of Administration and Supply.
Pass the salt, please.
There are still a few things to be worked out, but I'm sure you can handle them.
Pass the pepper, please.
Now, under this heading here, uh...
Contract Negotiations, part III
Bread.
I don't use butter.
You know, Bukistan may turn out to be the key to this whole thing.
If they fall in line, the rest will follow.
Right now we have to get to Haroun.
First things first.
Right.
Right... right!
Now hear this and hear it good.
This is only going to take a minute but it may be the most important minute in our lives.
You can put it under the heading of Clem and Effie,
Basic Principles, Part I.
Perhaps I'd better...
No, I want you to hear it, too.
I'm in love with you, not the State Department.
I didn't...
I'm not through.
Now, if a woman can run a home and still find time to have a career, that's fine.
But first things first.
Clem...
No, just a minute.
We haven't been able to make a definite plan since we met.
We went to Vermont for two weeks.
Yes, yes, that's right.
To her grandfather's farm.
For two wonderful relaxing weeks in glorious Vermont.
It's heavenly there in September.
We spent one day there.
She had to leave to take care of a crisis in the Sahara.
Some of the sand was missing.
Well, you stayed on.
Yes, with grandfather.
It wasn't the same thing.
No, no...
No, no, I don't like this idea, we can work in the wedding somehow...
Or if we can't leave on our honeymoon together
I can start without you...
I don't like that.
Perhaps we're both looking for different things.
And if we are, it's best to find it out now and call it quits.
Clem, I can't just toss this all over, it's too important.
Well, now we know what's important, don't we?
Oh, I wish you'd understand.
I think I've understood all along.
I've just been kidding myself.
I want a full-time wife and you want a part-time husband, it's as simple as that.
Look, you two. You'll both think differently about this in the morning.
No, Mac, I'm afraid this is morning.
It's time to go back counting sand.
Oh, I didn't mean that. What you're doing is important.
But not as important as cooking your breakfast.
Right.
Well you don't need me for that.
You can buy it for a dollar an hour.
We've been emancipated, Mr. Reade.
Have you ever heard of Susan B. Anthony?
Can she cook?
It just so happens she got women the right to vote.
Oh, now, really. You're not going to give me that
Amelia Bloom and Harriet Beecher Stowe routine.
What's wrong with them?
They were probably lousy housekeepers.
Come on, Mac.
Thanks for the coffee.
Hello, gentlemen.
Hello, again.
Sorry I'm late.
Ken, you're just in time.
We were just discussing Rogers and the Fuller account.
That was a beautiful job.
Nothing to it.
Rogers got unlucky, I got lucky.
Yeah, I'll say.
He did that account for over 15 years.
I'd like to see the look on his face when he found out he'd lost it.
Ten days ago on that Russell account we... we put the canteloupes in the oven because the ice cubes fell off the little boy's scooter.
Hm? Oh, that's fine, Charlie, just fine.
What's fine?
Charlie, tell me something.
How long have you been married?
Seventeen years, why?
What's your wife like?
Well, May's like...
You fellows know May. What's she like?
Well, she's nice, a little bossy.
Yeah... plays lousy bridge.
Yeah, that's what she's like.
Jean and I haven't had a quarrel in 10 years.
Whenever we're in the same room long enough.
I make it a practice to take May little presents every now and then.
It's something I picked up from her first husband.
He told me about it in court.
It does help keep her quiet.
Of course I think you fellows are all wrong.
Take it from the veteran with the service stripes.
No, no, let's hear what the newlywed has to say.
Go ahead, shoot.
Well, I've only been married a year, but
I think you can make a marriage anything you want it to be.
Of course the trick is to find a girl like Louise.
When I go home at night
I know she's there waiting for me.
It's got feeling.
It doesn't matter what we do, we always have fun.
Sometimes we'll take a walk somewhere, or maybe go to a movie.
Maybe we'll just stay home in front of the fire and read.
It's great.
And then sometimes, when we're in the mood, we three of us go to a nightclub.
The three of you?
Why, yes.
My mother-in-law lives with us.
Now wait a minute, fellows.
We shouldn't talk like this in front of Clem.
He's gonna be a bridegroom next week.
No, I'm not.
Effie and I called the whole thing off last night.
Oh, I'm sorry, Clem. I'm really sorry.
Why are you sorry?
You just got finished showing me how lucky I am.
There isn't one of you can look me straight in the eye and tell me you're happily married.
You've had to make a million compromises.
Why do we always have to cater to women?
We put them on pedestals, we make up cockeyed rules about the weaker sex.
You get into an elevator with one of the weaker sex and you take off our hat in some kind of pagan tribute.
Twenty minutes later the same delicate female is driving a taxicab through traffic and cursing like a muleskinner.
We keep treating them like flowers and they keep outliving us.
Right now they control 70% of the wealth of this country and are they satisfied?
No, they want to control the country.
They're Ambassadors, they're in the senate, they're even in the State Department.
That fight with Effie must have been a lulu.
No, I'm glad it happened.
We were all wrong for each other.
We both saw that last night.
Most people are afraid to face such problems.
They get married, find out they don't belong together then they have to get a divorce.
You took a shortcut.
There must be a girl somewhere who thinks it's a wonderful career just to have a home and babies, whose only thought is to make her husband happy.
That kind of girl went out with the cavemen.
Only if they had money.
Clem!
Clem?
What's the matter?
Suppose there were a girl like that.
Suppose I had found a girl who was trained from the day she was born to be a dream wife. What would you say?
I'd say she got a  friend.
It was right under my nose and I couldn't see it.
I said no.
You sound like a schoolboy in love.
Miss Temple. Take a cable.
Princess Tarji Suleimani, Bukistan.
Oh!
May I come in?
Would it make any difference if I said no?
No.
Before you get any ideas I think you should know
I'm here on official business.
Did you send a cable this afternoon?
Yes, yes I did.
But I hardly think that concerns the State Department.
I'm afraid it does.
It was addressed to the Princess of Bukistan.
Now look. Your beloved State Department can butt into almost anything they like, but this time my love life does not concern them.
That cable is a personal matter.
Every cable that goes out of here to Bukistan has to clear through the State Department.
And I don't think your idea of a joke is very funny.
What joke?
You know perfectly well.
This cable reads like a proposal of marriage to the princess.
That's exactly what it is.
Are you serious?
Are you asking as a woman or a member of the State Department?
I thought you went over there to work.
As a woman.
My interest in this is purely political.
We happen to have a very tense oil situation over there at the moment and a joke like this may be misconstrued.
I don't consider a proposal of marriage a joke.
You're really serious.
What's the matter with that?
You hardly know the girl.
I know her well enough to want to spend the rest of my life with her.
By that time I should know her even better.
Clem, if this is a rebound thing, I...
It isn't.
Well, you don't know what you'll be letting yourself in for.
It's not like marrying an American girl.
I hope not.
Now tell me, is there any law against my marrying Tarji?
Of course not.
Good.
Then I intend to.
You can tell that to your State Department.
All right.
Would you like to give the cable to me?
No, I would not.
Besides, I've already sent the cable.
Why would I want to give it to you?
I have it here. They referred it back to our office.
They did?
If you would like to dictate another one,
I'll see that it's sent out.
Oh, for heaven's...
Oh, well, all right, in that case, uh...
Dear Miss... no.
Dear Princess
Darling.
Though I have known you but a few short weeks,
I find that I cannot forget you. Stop.
I have never felt this way about any girl before.
I mean, I've never felt this way about any girl from Bukistan before.
Uh.... never mind. Start again.
Darling, Though I have known you but a few short weeks,
I find that I cannot forget you.
Yes, that's all right. Stop.
Would appreciate your marrying me at once.
Please advise, yours truly, Clem Reade.
Did you get that?
No...
May I make a suggestion?
What is it?
Well, first of all, I wouldn't send it to her,
I'd send it to her father.
I don't want to marry her father...
It's a custom.
Secondly, there are certain lingual and formal amenities to be observed.
I'll see that it's properly reworded.
Thanks.
I know a little more about the East than you do, Clem.
She's an important princess.
Don't be surprised if you don't get an answer.
Thanks, I won't.
Good night, Clem.
Good night.
It's been three weeks!
Oh, that's it.
I can't understand why I haven't heard.
These things take time.
Well, gentlemen, get this.
The entire order from Bukistan has been cancelled.
They can't have cancelled it!
They've been offended.
It's the cable you sent.
I didn't send it, Effie did.
Effie! That double crosser!
Miss Temple.
Get me Miss Effington at the State Department.
Yes, sir.
I got a delivery for Clemson Reade.
Where will I put it?
This is his office. Bring it in.
Here?
Yes.
Okay, lady. Anything you say.
Why, why... How do I know why?
All I know is that 20 minutes ago we got this cable.
Reade's proposal of marriage has been accepted.
You confirmed it, didn't you?
Yes, yes.
I still don't see what's so terrible about it.
Then I 'll tell you.
All this deal needs is one little match to blow it sky high.
And this could be that match.
Oh, the khan seems friendly enough at present... but all his future son-in-law has to do is to whistle to a pretty blonde and we're dead.
Well, what can we do?
There's only one thing we can do.
We've got to see to it that this is the happiest courtship since Romeo and Juliet.
Nothing must go wrong.
Because if they pfft!, it'll be a pfft! all around the world.
We need someone to make sure that nothing does go wrong.
Someone who knows the Bukistanian language,
Bukistanian customs and diplomatic protocol.
And, if possible, Mr. Clemson Reade himself.
Oh, no, wait a minute, Mac, I...
Have you reached Miss Effington yet?
She what?
Well, keep try...
What are these goats doing here?
The lady said to bring them in.
Oh, oh... I've been trying to get a hold of you.
What did you say in that cable to Tarji?
She's obviously turned me down.
What do you think this is?
It's your dowry.
My dowry?
Yes.
Oh, that's wonderful.
What are all these things?
It's a Bukistanian custom to give the bridegroom a dowry.
It may be goats, or sheep, or even camels.
Well, then, why did they cancel the order?
They probably consider it "forpeit".
For what?
Forpeit. Another custom.
Bad manners to deal in business till after the wedding.
Well, I have a thousand and one problems.
I have to get plane reservations... hotel accommodations, she'll probably be here in a month or two.
What are you doing Saturday morning?
Nothing, why?
Drop by at the airport. Your bride is arriving.
Uh... fine.
I wonder how many people the princess will bring in her party...
Saturday?
Effie!
Effie!
Look Mommy, look at the funny man.
Don't point, darling. It's rude.
What is it?
He's probably some kind of nut.
Maybe he's making a movie.
I bet he's advertising some kind of cigarette.
No, that's an authentic costume.
I wonder how many wives he has.
I'll bet he's from India.
Arabia.
Huh-huh, Afghanistan.
Schenectady!
Let go!
What are you doing here?
I work here.
We are the official reception committee.
What are you made up for?
The student prince?
I wouldn't expect you to understand.
I'm just showing a little consideration for my fiancée.
I want her to feel at home.
Why didn't you tell me?
You didn't ask me.
Tarji!
Darling!
Next time let's just shake hands.
Katan, katan!
Now, you've had your turn.
Now it's hers.
I'm sorry, Reade, but we'd like to get on with this. Go ahead.
I'm sorry.
That's very nice. I couldn't have said it better myself.
Now, if you'll all excuse me,
I'd like to be alone with my fiancée.
Reade, there's a little matter of protocol to be observed.
We've made a few plans for the princess.
Well, it happens I've made some plans of my own.
Now, Reade, don't give us any trouble.
This girl is a princess.
The way she is treated happens to be very important at this time.
Is that clear?
No!
Good. We'll escort her to the hotel.
But...
Oh, wait!
I thought we'd never be alone.
May we quote you on that?
Here he is! Mr. Reade, when are you and the princess getting married?
How does it feel to be marrying to a rich princess?
When you marry her, will you be a prince?
Where did you meet Tarji?
If you don't mind, this is a personal matter.
Are you kidding? We got 10 million readers who want to hear about this.
Do you have any immediate plans?
Yes, I'm going up.
I was afraid you were lost, Reade.
I want to give you our schedule.
Tomorrow night is the official banquet.
Saturday we've arranged lunching... and Monday... I'll see that you get a list of the other activities.
Now look! If Washington thinks they're going to turn this into a three-ring circus, they're crazy.
I'll marry whomever I please and I don't need any help from you.
Now I'd appreciate it if you'd all get out and leave us alone.
What's she saying?
Well, she said something about a hot dog.
Shall I have some sent up?
Yes... no!
Reade wants to handle everything.
Let him arrange it. Come on.
Oh, yes, of course, your friends.
How do you do?
Which one speaks English?
You mean none of you speaks English?
Darling?
Oh, I have a feeling I should have taught you more.
Darling.
Oh, now that won't do at all.
Just put the rest of the luggage in there.
I wonder if you could help me.
I'm at your service, sir.
Do you happen to speak Bukistanian?
I majored in French.
Spanish.
You mean none of them speaks English?
No, unfortunately.
It shouldn't be too difficult.
One can communicate without words.
See, she's trying to tell me something.
Yes, darling, you go ahead, I'm listening.
It's too hot in here?
Palm trees?
Goodbye, Arthur...
No, it's something else.
Oh, I am an angel.
Skyscraper?
He hasn't done anything yet.
There's something.
Oh, yes, this is good.
A woman! Woman,
No, smaller than that.
Girl?
Pretty, pretty girl, eh?
A pretty girl is like a melody.
Yes... a pretty girl...
Does this fellow...
I think he's doing something new.
He's eating. He's eating something.
Chewing... food. Food?
No, no. Meat!
Sounds like... Sounds like meat.
Mate.
How can he do a word that sounds like another word if he doesn't know the other word?
I don't care. I think I'm on the track of something.
I something, something, mate.
Something, something, pretty girl.
I've got it!
What?
I brought you a mate, now you find pretty girl for me.
For him?
Sure, that's what he's been saying.
Probably some kind of a custom.
Naturally, it's absolutely against the rules of the hotel.
I know, I know...
Who's winning?
Oh, Effie. You're a lifesaver.
Would you help me?
Now, he wants me to provide a girl for him.
Would you explain that...
What they're trying to tell you is
The Princess Tarji has heard so much about them she would very much like to have an American hot dog.
Well, I guess you'll be running along.
Yes, yes.
I'll see to it that the princess gets a frankfurter.
Why don't you run along and give them a chance to get moved in?
I haven't had a chance to be with Tarji yet.
You can be with her tonight.
Yes, dear. We'll spend the evening alone, just the two of us together.
She won't have any trouble understanding me tonight.
Ta-ta, dear.
Katan!
There he goes katanning again.
Goodbye, dear.
Oh, badibani.
Good evening, Mr. Reade.
I just want you to know... that I have my entire staff alerted for anything, anything at all.
Any little special services that the princess may require.
After all, strangers in a foreign land, you know.
That's very kind of you, but I don't think it will be necessary.
They're no different from any of us.
They live just like you and me.
Yes.
Good night.
Now, what are you doing here?
I think you'd better sit down.
Why, has something happened to Tarji?
No, and we don't want anything to happen to her.
That's why I'm here.
And what does that mean?
You're not going to like this any more than I do but there's nothing we can do about it.
About what?
I have been assigned to take care of you and Tarji.
You've been what?
That's ridiculous. That's utter nonsense.
If I need a nursemaid, I'll send for one.
Now, why don't you just get your briefcase and your horn book and run on down to the office and solve all the little international problems
This happens to be one of the little international problems.
At least it could, be and I'm here to see that it isn't.
Oh, no, you're not. And if you think
I'm going to let you interfere...
I'm not going to interfere. I'm going to help you.
This is just as important to us as it is to you.
You can look upon me as a stick of furniture.
No. Absolutely not. No, no...
Oh, Tarji.
Tarji, did you hear what she said?
She thinks that...
That... uh...
Can I tell her something for you?
Yes, yes you can.
Tell her that she looks like a beautiful flower.
Katan, katan!
Stop that. It's all right now.
We're engaged.
Oh, please. Will you explain to him?
Oh, he knows it better than you do.
Until the wedding you can't embrace her, or kiss her, or anything.
After the wedding she becomes your property.
You make me sound like a landlord.
Certainly a little kiss.
As far as they're concerned there's no such thing as a little kiss.
You'll just have to control yourself till after the wedding.
Then will you please explain to him that all that's been arranged for next Tuesday.
What's the matter?
He says the date of the wedding has already been set according to astronomical calculations.
For when?
Three months from today.
Three months? Why, that's ridiculous!
It won't do you any good to argue with him.
Tell him I refuse to wait three months.
There was nothing about the three months in the arrangements.
I don't believe in long engagements.
My whole family feels the same way.
My grandfather and my grandmother were married the same day they met.
Good enough for them.
Three months! Do you realize that's ninety days?
Do you know how many hours that is?
Neither do I, but it must be an awful lot.
Three months. I won't stand for it.
Three months. That's the end.
Three...
Oh, I don't know.
Three months of this might not be too bad.
While I searched the book of love... a wise voice whispered happy is he... happy is he who holds in his house a love... a love more lovely than the moon... and dreams... dreams of a lifetime longer than a year.
Did she say that?
Omar Khayyam said it.
My love for you called you to me across half the world.
I'm so sorry. I didn't hear that.
My love for you... I mean her, of course.
Yes.
Has called you... I mean...
I understand who's who.
Well, then, tell her yourself.
What did you tell her?
I said you wished to cut your tongue out because you could not speak your love for her in her own language.
That's very good!
Comfy?
Yeah, hm-hmm.
After we're married, ask her how many er...
How many what?
Never mind. I'll wait until she learns English.
I'll ask her that myself, thank you.
Bukistanians believe in large families, if that answers your question.
Now wait a minute, just...
Tarji, darling...
Now listen, listen...
Table... table...
Table.
That's very... Oh, this is going to be a cinch.
I don't think I'll need you for the moment.
Would you mind going over to the corner, relaxing?
That's a good girl.
Go somewhere, thank you.
Good, Tarji. Humm...
Couch... couch.
Couch.
Yes, darling, couch.
Yes, yes...
Couch.
Uhm... Oh, ashtray, see?
Ashtray.
Ashtray see.
Ashtray...
No, no, not the "see", dear, just the...
Never mind. We'll get to that later.
Fruit.
Fruit.
Fruit.
Prune.
Prune.
Well, hmm...
Prune.
Prune.
That's better, but uh...
Pruuuune,
Pruuuune...
Katan!
Katan!
You big silly ox!
Here, catch.
Now how long can a man stand this?
In three months I'll be a nervous wreck.
What does he think he is, the Iron Curtain?
He is until you're married.
You tell him we're in America now.
There are certain customs that...
What were you saying?
Uh, what was I saying? What, what?
Something about customs.
Oh, oh!
Well, there are certain customs that are sacred.
And I'm not the man to violate them.
I should say not.
If they want to separate their boys and girls, then I say separate them.
What are three months?
Why, they go by like that.
Clem!
Do you know the mark of a mature man?
Patience. The ability to wait for what he wants.
That is the key to the situation.
Well, I think I'll be running along.
Give everybody a chance to get a good night's sleep.
I think that's a very good idea.
Yes, would you do me a favor?
Would you please tell Tarji that I'll see her very soon.
She says her heart will be unable to wait.
May I drop you at your house?
No, thanks. I think I'll get a cab.
Well, good night all.
Darling.
Darling, I'm back.
Oh, I wish I could speak with you in your language.
There's so much I want to tell you.
But all you need to know now is that I love you.
It won't be easy to be patient but I want you to know that I'll wait as long as necessary.
And that I'll want you more each day.
Darling, it seems I've waited all my life for you.
And in just a little while we...
And in just a little while...
Badabani.
Katan, katan!
Shhh! You'll wake everyone up!
Mr. Reade!
I'm certainly not going to stay in such a noisy hotel.
You may go in now, Mr. Reade.
With our deepest regrets and sincere assurance to your excellency that there will not be a repetition of last night's er...
Last night's unfortunate incident.
Good. How does the whole thing sound?
Fine, I'll send it by special cable.
Good morning, Romeo.
Yes, yes, yes...
You sent for me?
Yes, sit down, Reade.
Now you look here. I'm a citizen...
And there are a few things that I've got to make clear to you, citizen.
The State Department has enough troubles without worrying about your love life.
As far as I'm concerned you can have a harem.
But when your irresponsible actions jeopardize the functions of this Office then I'm going to crack down.
You were warned about this sort of thing, Reade.
You're making a mountain out of a mole hill.
And you were told to keep away from that mole hill until after you were married.
Tarji is my fiancée. If I want to kiss her, what do you expect me to do?
Telephone the Secretary of State?
Now look, Reade. I don't care to have the State Department put in the position of playing Peeping Tom.
But for the next three months you're going to behave like Whistler's Mother.
You stick to protocol and we will not have any more trouble.
Whistler's Mother?
Just remember what I told you. Don't get too friendly.
Thank you. I'll remember.
Good!
You forgot to give me the key.
I haven't any... key.
I beg your pardon.
I'll show myself out.
Did you explain the facts of life to him?
He knows them. That's our problem.
Now that he understands, maybe...
My dear Effie, you know all about countries, but there are a few things you've got to learn about men.
You are moving in with the princess tonight.
Oh, Mr. Reade.
Good evening.
I've been waiting to talk to you.
Really? Anything wrong?
Yes.
It's about that bearded gentleman.
You mean our friend the skyscraper.
He's been trying to buy our chambermaids.
He has?
Yes, he's been offering them physicians in the Khan's harem.
I hope he hasn't offended them.
Offended them?
Six of the girls have already accepted.
Well, I'll speak to Miss Effington about that.
Good evening, Tarji.
Oh, she shouldn't do that.
You're telling me.
Oh, yes, it's the lady from the translation bureau.
Why don't you run along and see a French movie or something?
This is better than a French movie.
There's a good chance I may not need you anymore.
What's the matter, what...
What are you trying to say?
"Nonmoki"... you know...
Oh, you mean "Monkomi Bukistani sabeh"
Here, Katan, kattatch.
That fellow catches everything, except pneumonia.
Now that you're here you might as well make yourself useful.
Tell Tarji that she looks enchanting tonight.
And don't spare the adjectives.
Yeah... here we go again.
This is the life.
You'd have been a smash in the Middle Ages.
Yes, yes, yes.
Tell Tarji I've been longing to see her all day.
And put a little feeling into it.
What did she say?
She said there is no moon until you walk into her presence.
Oh, isn't that nice.
Is there any answer, Moon Man?
Tarji, now that we're alone...
I want you to know how sorry I am about the key last night.
Key?
Yes, dear, the key.
You see, I'm afraid it was one of those unfortunate things...
Key.
No, no, darling... you don't understand. You keep this.
See?
No, I can't take the key.
Key.
Tarji, you mustn't do this.
Clem.
I'd love to, but we need oil.
I mean, we'll have plenty of time to be together.
Right now, a little thing like a key seems important...
Key.
But, but...
Oh, Tarji...
I'm sorry about the interruption.
One of the dancing girls discovered the telephone and she won't get off it.
She probably thinks she's an American woman.
Shall I translate that for Tarji?
No, no, let's wait for something funnier.
Well, it's been a hard day...
You're not going already?
Do you mind?
MacBride neglected to tell me my bedtime... but I'm sure the State Department won't object if I retire early.
May I drop you?
No, thanks, I'm going to stick around for a while.
Tell Tarji that until I see her again the birds will have no song.
Oh, brother.
Now, look!
All right, all right, the birds will have no song.
Well, good night.
Oh, Moon Man...
Hm?
You forgot your shoes.
Darling.
Darling, I'm back, I'm back!
You see, nothing can ever keep us apart.
Not the State Department, nor protocol, nor Effie.
Especially Effie.
We will be rid of them soon and your little moon man will be all yours.
Oh, it seems I've waited all my life for you.
I never loved anyone before I met you, dear.
I'm afraid I must go now so there won't be any trouble.
But just one kiss before I leave...
Oh, there you are!
I've been looking everywhere for you.
I know, I can go in now.
Oh, you're not MacBride, he's taller.
Where's he?
On the phone trying to explain you to Washington.
I know you won't believe this, but I only went back there to give her a good night kiss.
I didn't expect to start a riot.
Look at that?
Where'd you get the key?
I found it.
At least you're a chivalrous liar.
Tarji told me she gave you the key.
She thought you were asking for it.
I was asking for it, all right.
I wish I could explain Tarji to you, Clem.
Her only concern is to please you.
That's the way she was brought up.
Any whim of yours is law to her.
That's a terrible power to hold over anybody.
No one will ever hold that power over you, will they, Effie?
We're not discussing me.
Oh, well, citizen.
Hi.
You're becoming quite a problem.
Oh, not really, I'm just a normal, high-spirited
American boy.
We're going to see if we can control those high spirits.
I don't know why I have to feel like Benedict Arnold every time I want to kiss the girl I'm going to marry.
The American people have stood for inflation and high taxes but let Washington try to control everything and you'll have a revolution.
Well, I'll remember.
Miss Effington tells me that you're not entirely to blame for last night.
She did?
She came up with a very excellent suggestion.
We've just cabled to Bukistan... for permission to have the wedding right away.
Well, now we're getting somewhere.
I thought it would serve the best interests of everyone.
I never doubted it.
Now, there's to be a reception for Tarji tonight at the Bukistanian Consulate.
You're welcome to invite your friends.
Oh, really, you're too kind.
Technically you'll be on Bukistanian soil this evening so you'll be expected to behave accordingly.
You can always count on me.
I'll be there to explain their customs to you.
I had a feeling you'd be there.
Have you had a chance to look at that?
Well, I'll see you at the party tonight, is that right?
We'll need their approval on this.
We'll meet over there, huh?
This pertains to Raffidat.
Yeah, well, Raffidat.
Where is she?
You'll meet her.
Here, put my gloves in your pocket.
But, darling, I'm already carrying your compact.
Do as I tell you.
There she is.
Good evening, Clem.
Hello, Eff.
Good evening, Tarji.
Hey, did you see that?
I certainly did.
Tell her that she looks like a goddess.
Why don't you say those things to me?
I think you know everyone here.
Would you introduce them, please?
Oh, thank heavens, I'm so thirsty I could die.
Don't! You mustn't touch that.
The drinks are just for the men.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I explained it to Clem this afternoon.
This is the Bukistanian Consulate and there are certain strict customs which we are expected to observe.
Well, I never!
Thank you, Tarji.
Now, gentlemen, help yourselves.
Well, very nice, thank you.
Well, to the ladies.
I never heard of such a thing.
When in Rome, Jean...
Don't you dare enjoy that.
No, darling.
What else can't the Bukistanian women do?
Oh, they can do everything. And do it better.
How do you know?
Uh...
Thank you, Tarji.
That means dinner is served.
Good, I'm starved.
Wait!
Would you walk three paces behind your husbands, please?
Well, these fellows really live, eh?
I'm sorry. This table is for the men.
Do you mean to say I can't eat with my husband?
In Bukistan the women do not eat with the men.
They eat separately at their own table.
The women will eat over there.
How far did you say it is to Bukistan?
Clem, I've never seen anything like Tarji.
I thought you were exaggerating.
She's incredible.
If I ever treated May that way, she'd shoot me.
Clem, how did you train her to light your cigarette?
I didn't train her.
She's not a trick dog.
All she cares about is whether I'm happy.
It's a natural instinct.
Some instinct.
Tell us about some of her other instincts.
You haven't seen anything yet.
I can't wait.
Hey, delicious, what is it?
Goat meat.
Oh, dear. You know, I'm getting tired of all this.
All these crowds all the time.
Nothing but people.
What exactly did you have in mind?
Anything.
I'd just like to be alone with Tarji sometime.
Just alone with her.
We could go walking somewhere.
We might even go walking in the park.
If you're planning on disappearing with her, forget it.
Effie!
When you're out with Tarji there are certain protocol that must be observed.
Of course.
And we will observe it.
Together.
Ughh.
Tomorrow we can go for a nice walk in the park.
Now, lie down, Bonzo. It's feeding time.
Oh, for heaven's sakes. Will you tell her she's in America now? She can't go on like this.
But this is what you wanted, isn't it?
Certainly not. She's like Brutus.
Darling, you eat with me.
We eat together.
Ashtray?
Oh...
Explain it to her, will you?
It's going to be pretty difficult.
I'm doing 3000 years of history, but I'll try.
Just tell her that now... now...
She adores me.
Good morning, sir, or madam, or a small child...
...as the case may be.
As the case may be. That's very good, Tarji. Go on.
In the morning I have breakfast with my brother...
John.
Hm-hmm.
Why Clem angry?
Angry?
Yes, he not do like me anymore.
Ah, it isn't that, Tarji. In America it's different.
Women walk with their husbands and eat with them.
American women are proud. They fought for their freedom and they've become a part of history.
Women like Harriet Beecher Stowe and Amelia Bloomer.
Bloomer?
Yes, Bloomer.
Bloomer.
Tell me, Bloomer.
Well...
Clara Barton started American Red Cross.
Yes... Now what has that to do with any...
Good night.
Badabani.
It's been quite an evening.
Wee!
Wee!
Darling, fetch me a drink.
No ice, a twitch of lemon and easy on the water.
No, no, you've had enough.
Put her to bed. I'll see her tomorrow.
Oh, my goodness. She's high as a kite.
Flown by Benjamin Franklin, a man.
Good night, Mrs. Frankenstein.
For me?
Thank you.
Hey, you!
That's okay, I'll take care of her.
Hey, wait a minute.
You forgot to pay for your drink back there.
Pay?
Sure, you don't get anything for nothing, you know.
But that's all right. I took care of it myself.
You ate very friendlike.
I was hoping you'd look at it that way.
I wouldn't want you to think I was one of those fresh guys.
Fresh? What is fresh?
That's what I always say.
What is fresh?
What's the matter whether you introduce yourself or somebody else does it for you.
My name's George Seegley. What's yours?
Tarji.
You live around here, honey?
I live in big hotel.
Oh.
See?
You certainly do.
Are you free tonight?
Of course. I am free woman all the time.
What do you mean you told her she could go out?
I don't like the idea of her roaming around the streets all by herself.
She just went for a little walk.
Now, what could possibly happen?
She's not a child, Clem.
She can take care of herself.
I don't like it. She's changed.
And it's all your fault.
It's time someone freed her.
Oh, look, Pygmalion.
Pygmalion was a man.
Don't tempt me.
Oh, don't you understand, Clem?
She's like a kid with a new television set.
She's learned a new word, freedom.
And now she's just fiddling with all the knobs.
After you're married she'll settle down and be everything you want her to be.
After we're married?
By that time I'll be in a wheelchair.
Have you heard from the Khan about our wedding yet?
We've been notified to expect an answer today.
And while we're at it I think there are one or two things
I'd better explain to you about the wedding ceremony.
And what happens afterwards.
Isn't anything sacred?
Everything. That's what I want to talk to you about.
Evelyn, I'll have to cancel my 3 o'clock appointment.
And tell Gregorovitch I won't need him.
Who's Gregorovitch?
He's a spy.
Oh!
Now, let's begin at the beginning.
The wedding ceremony itself lasts for three days.
And it's called the "huffi".
I don't care what it's called.
And then what happens?
Well, the ceremony consists of feasting, dancing and incantations.
Since Tarji is a princess, the honeymoon will last eight weeks.
It's called the "broukha".
Don't wear bow ties.
Now, during the "broukha"...
Wait a minute... what's that? What did you say?
I said during the broukha...
No, about the bow ties.
Oh, don't wear them.
You mean to say there's some kind of Bukistanian law about bow ties?
No, it's just that you don't look very good in them, that's all.
Now, during the broukha...
Whoa, wait a minute...
You always said you liked me in bow ties.
You always wore them what could I say?
Well, that's a fine thing.
May I explain the broukha?
Never mind the broukha.
What else?
What else what?
What else didn't you like about me?
I think it's rather pointless to reminisce about our likes and dislikes when we were engaged.
No, I'd like to hear it.
Oh, it's nothing important, just little things.
Like your salad dressing.
Why, you loved my salad dressing.
Well, didn't you?
If every woman told the man she's going to marry what she really thinks, this would be a nation of old maids.
I wouldn't mind if your criticism was justified.
Perhaps I should have told you about your hats.
It so happens that my salad dressing...
What about my hats?
Nothing. It happens that my salad dressing...
What about my hats?
Well, if you really want to know, they're the most ridiculous hats I've ever seen.
They all look like crackerjack prizes.
But did I complain? No...
You used to compliment me on my hats.
Isn't that what you wanted me to do?
Not if it wasn't sincere.
We shouldn't even discuss it now.
It seems to me we ought to get back to the broukha.
What else?
What else what?
Since my hats were so ridiculous I'm sure there were other things you found equally ridiculous.
All right, now that you're asking, your perfume.
It happens to be very good perfume.
What do you call it? Protocol Number 5?
How dare you?
You always used to ask me to put it on.
What was I going to do?
Ask you to take it off?
What else?
Your lipstick. I always got smeared.
If you knew how to kiss.
Now wait a minute!
The first time I kissed you you told me it was like an earthquake.
Did I?
Oh, I see, It was like my salad dressing.
It was pleasant.
Hm... pleasant.
Let's see.
No earthquake.
Hm... forget I did it.
That won't be difficult.
Hmm... give my regards to Gregorovitch.
Mr. MacBride has asked me to give you this.
It's just arrived.
The Khan has agreed to hold the wedding next week when we sign the oil agreement.
Thanks, Pat.
Evelyn, get out Givney's report for me and have Ben call me on Monday.
Then get me Francis Gordon in Washington...
Earthquake! It's an...
Oh, no!
Did you feel s shaking?
No, sir. Maybe it's a vibration from the service elevator.
It gets pretty strong sometimes.
Oh...
Well...
Thank you.
Would you like some more ice?
Oh, no, don't trouble.
It's no trouble at all.
Well, I think I'll recite a little poetry tonight.
What will it be?
Anything that pleases you.
How about Keats? He's always good.
A thing of beauty is a joy forever.
Its loveliness increases...
It's not very romantic, is it?
I like it.
I learned new thing today.
That's fine! Tell Clem.
I open charges account.
I go in many stores. They are very nice.
Macy, Gimble, Sak.
One store much fun. Many games.
Games?
Yes.
You put money in and you win sandwich, soup, coffee.
I win all time.
That's the automat.
Automat.
Yes...
Doorbell. I go.
Hiya, honey! I bet you thought
I wasn't gonna make it, didn't you?
Hello, George. Come in.
Oh, a double date. I'm mighty glad to meet you.
My name is George Seegley.
Really?
George my friend. Very fresh.
Is that so?
I think there must be some mistake.
I'll get it.
Oh, man, this is crazy!
I'll get to you later. Where's the doll?
Doll!
Who is he?
Louis.
I happen to have a date with this young lady.
Yeah, well so do I.
Wait a minute. Nobody has a date with this lady.
I have a date with this lady.
This dame does the land office business.
Where did you meet her?
If it's any of your concern, I met her in Bukistan.
Tarji, I think you should explain things to these gentlemen.
Now why don't you just run along, huh, fellows?
Look, bud, why don't you go out and get a girl of your own?
Yeah, and that goes for you, too.
Go away!
Who do you think you're cutting in on?
Tarji!
Dicky!
Get your coat, honey. We're going dancing.
Who's he?
He promised to teach Tarji jitterbug.
What am I supposed to do?
Why don't you join the marines?
Sorry, I must have the wrong... Tarji!
Scotty!
What is this, a convention?
Hey, you don't have any shoes on.
I know!
Tarji, where did you meet all these people?
I bought her an orange drink.
We went walking in the park.
I bought her a banana split.
I met her in the movies.
With Lana Turner.
How did you find time to go to the automat?
I beg your pardon, but I...
Oh, Tarji!
Uncle Clarence.
Uncle Clarence?
We were just leaving, Unc.
Look, I met her first, fellows, so if you all don't mind running along.
Are you kidding?
Come on, Tarji, we're going dancing.
Imagine! I'm taking her to a nightclub.
I'll toss you all out.
Gentlemen!
Come on, honey.
Now wait a minute!
Nobody is taking no one nowhere.
I don't believe we've met.
I'll attend to you in a minute.
Now listen, my friend.
Butt out, chum!
Who are you pushing?
You, chum!
Oh, big fight!
Clem, be careful!
Ouch! What did you do that for?
That's my shoe!
You wait till I find my shoe!
Oh, look out!
I'll come back and do the room later.
Stop it! Stop it!
Hello!
Oh, hello.
They're not even registered.
Hello, this is Bob. Signal red! Signal red!
Never mind that! Help me find my other shoe.
What? Where are you going?
Wait...
There is a young lady to see you.
I do not need any.
Do I?
No, Your Excellency.
Who is she?
Effington?
Send her in.
She dares to face me after what she's done to the princess.
We shall see.
Your Excellency.
Never mind that.
You are the American friend of my daughter.
I have that honor.
The one who has filled her mind with your Western nonsense.
Why are you here?
I am from the State Department.
Indeed?
Your country is foolish to allow women to meddle in government.
The coach of State cannot be driven from the back seat.
That is excellent. Make a note of it.
Excellent!
I came to speak about the princess Tarji and Mr. Reade, Your Excellency.
Their marriage means very much.
There will be no marriage.
If Tour Excellency will listen, I...
We can read!
The princess involved in a public scandal.
It's a disgrace.
In the rest of the world women know their place.
In your country women have forgotten to be women.
American women are not mothers. They're fathers.
I will not let my daughter become a father.
Oh, she isn't going to be... I mean.
I shall see to it.
She will not remain in this country and be blinded to what a woman should be.
One sees with the heart, not the eyes.
You speak Bukistanian.
I speak all the important languages, Your Excellency.
And what you say is true of some American women.
But that is because we need guidance.
The guidance of men who are wise and strong.
Men who can make women what they were meant to be.
As it is written...
One of my own quotations.
I know.
Araq!
A native wine made from rice.
I have good news, Your Excellency.
The princess has returned.
She can wait.
The araq is pleasing to you?
Oh, yes.
Good.
To the bride and groom.
You American women.
Yes, that's Effie, all right.
Always there when you need her.
Remarkable girl.
You know, I remember one summer...
Oh, dear me, he was in a hurry, wasn't he?
The Khan cannot see me tonight.
He does not wish to be disturbed until morning.
Oh, never mind, dear...
Morning?
What's wrong?
Well, Effie's in there!
They won't let you go in.
Let them try to stop me.
Katan! Katan!
Oh, please...
Effie! Effie! I'm here, I'm...
Are you all right?
Does he always enter a room like that?
Forgive him. He was eager to see you,
Your Excellency.
Yes, Your Excellency, I was eager to see you.
You are welcome, my son. You may join us.
Thank you, sir.
How are you doing?
I have him eating out of my hand.
Sweet meat?
Oh, I see...
Why are you doing all that?
I'm trying to make His Excellency comfortable.
You do want your future father-in-law to be comfortable, don't you?
My future...
Oh, yes, of course...
Oh, well, that isn't necessary!
What's that?
Araq.
Araq?
It's a wine made from rice.
Hmm... thank you.
Tastes like milk.
Sweet meat
Forgive me for leaving you, but duty calls.
Next time I'll leave them at home.
I will see you tomorrow at the wedding.
Congratulations.
Effie, I want to tell you how...
Skip it. Courtesy of the State Department.
We're going to have lots of oil.
That's why I'm celebrating.
Everybody's happy.
Don't you think you've had enough?
Of course not! It's just rice.
A little old rice never hurt anybody.
In China they live on rice.
Why don't you get some sleep?
What for? Complete waste of time.
Old Effie mustn't waste time.
Old Effie's a machine.
You didn't think I knew you thought
I was a machine, did you?
A little rice?
Uh, no, thank you.
Sure, click, click, push, pull, that's Effie.
You know, that isn't even my right name.
Do you want to know what my right name is?
Priscilla. Priscilla Effington.
I know.
Priscilla.
Isn't that a pretty name.
Say it.
Priscilla.
You want to know something?
Priscilla twisted the khan around her little finger.
Oh, hmm...
Oh, yes, thank you.
You want to know how?
It's a secret, but I'll tell you.
Shoot.
I can be a woman, too.
I know...
See?
Oh, no, a woman's work is never done.
Gotta wash him, dress him, feed him, and burp him.
Oh, now, stop it.
No, I'm just warming up.
Don't you think it's time to go to bed?
The night is filled with muted sounds.
The air is still, but in the hush the whispers of a thousand lovers... you and I together here to dream a thousand wonders the night is still, we kiss... and in my heart a thousand thunders
Thanksgiving, three years ago.
That was the night that we met at that silly State dinner.
It wasn't silly. Not until you got up to make a speech and started reciting poetry.
I couldn't help it. I couldn't take my eyes off you.
You mean my hat.
I love your hats.
You were wearing a sweet kind of airplane hat... with gumdrops hanging down.
Oh, darling...
Oh, you better get some sleep.
You should be rested for your broukha tomorrow.
Priscilla...
And don't call me Priscilla.
Tarji!
Clem not love Tarji.
Clem love my friend, Effie.
Well, uh... Tarji, you mustn't blame her.
It's all over between Effie and me, but uh...
Well, you see... once upon a time...
Bedtime story?
Yeah... yeah.
Bedtime story.
My friend Effie make you very happy.
You know, I didn't plan it this way, I just...
I not have to marry you now.
I free!
I beg your pardon?
Effie teach me. Woman not have to obey man she does not love.
You're amazing, Tarji!
Well, all right. Now go and tell your father right away.
Wait. I tell him I free woman.
I tell him I no love Clem.
You forget our wedding is in the morning.
You come to wedding tomorrow, I not arrive.
I jilt you.
You will? That's perfect.
I don't know how to thank you, Tarji.
I very happy. You be my friend.
Oh, indeed I will, always.
You're going to make someone a very lucky man.
Then, uh, I'll see you at the wedding.
I mean, I won't see you at the wedding.
Goodbye, dear, dear Tarji.
Or rather, badibani.
Badibani.
Right!
Father, welcome to America.
I must talk to you right away.
I have so much to tell...
Any minute now you're gonna be the happiest man in the world.
You don't know how right you are.
What have you got to be so happy about?
You're getting married.
Sure you feel all right?
Never felt better in my life.
I wonder what's keeping Effie.
Effie?
I mean Tarji.
Oh, there's a girl in a million.
She's gonna make some man a wonderful wife.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, hello, Mac! Any terrible news?
Huh?
I mean, what's new?
Nothing. What's new with you?
Nothing.
That's interesting.
We must have another nice chat  sometime, huh?
You know, there's nothing like a wedding.
I wonder why bridegrooms are always supposed to be so nervous.
What is there to be nervous about?
The ceremony...
Oh, Effie... Priscilla.
Effie.
I've got to see you. What are you doing tonight?
No wonder I'm the happiest man in the world.
Clem, whatever it is you're taking, don't take any more.
Oh, you should have seen Tarji last night.
She was magnificent.
There was fire in her eyes when she...
Tarji!
Who did you expect?
What is she doing here?
Maybe she came to get married.
No, no, she promised.
My son.
No, I'm not, sir. I mean...
The ceremony can start immediately.
I have long looked forward to this happy day.
Your Excellency will be pleased to know that the Bukistanian ceremony will come first... then the American ceremony, and then we can sign the agreement.
We are pleased.
But, sir, didn't Tarji tell you?
Tell me what?
Here we go. I know how anxious you must be.
No, Tarji!
Come on!
No, I tell you, I won't go through with this.
It never fails, they all go the same way.
I tell you, I love her!
That's why you're here!
Come on, everybody's watching.
Double crosser! Coward!
I thought you were a free woman.
What about Amelia Bloomer?
Doesn't she mean anything to you?
Well, what can you expect from a woman?
You're weak, helpless and nothing but trouble.
And that goes for all of you.
Harriet Beecher Stowe.
She wrote about slaves didn't she?
Well, it sure take one to know one.
She great woman. She write Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Susan B. Anthony.
Susan B, Anthony fight for women's vote.
And that not all. Carrie Country.
Carrie Nation!
Carrie Nation.
Silence!
I will not silence! I free woman!
I not love Clem.
She jilted me! She jilted me!
Do not worry, my son, she will marry you.
I'm not worth bothering about, I...
What have you done now, what's wrong?
Nothing's wrong. The wedding's off.
You do not wish to marry my daughter?
Of course he does.
It's just a little nervous breakdown, Your Excellency.
You keep out of this.
In Bukistan we do not use our women for political tricks.
Come.
What about the oil agreement?
It will be as you say.
It will be signed after the wedding.
And there will be no wedding.
Well spoken, Your Excellency.
You are wise not to be deceived by this man.
And you should be proud that your daughter has inherited your wisdom.
You are using psychology.
No, Your Excellency, truth.
The daughter of the Khan is not merchandise to be sent on approval to a man with the judgment of a camel.
That is truth.
Oh, absolutely.
I know how easy it is to be deceived by this man.
I myself was engaged to him.
You?
I admit it. With shame.
He would have made the princess as unhappy as he made me.
He was unsatisfactory.
Completely. He was conceited, and selfish and unbearable.
Surely the Khan will not allow a man like this to stand in the way... of signing an oil agreement that will benefit your country.
That is true. You are a remarkable woman,
Miss Effington.
He will not stand in the way.
I knew you would understand.
I do.
You must love him very much.
What was that again?
Clem, I've got so much to tell you.
You mean you've forgotten something?
I'm a selfish monster, I'm foolish, arrogant...
In other words, you're just an average man.
Oh, Clem, make an earthquake for me.
It's just an expression she uses.
Don't talk like that. They'll get the wrong idea.
Come here. I owe you a bloukha.

The Khan of Bukistan is pleased that you have taken a fancy to his daughter Tarji.
So am I.
She is only a girl.
Yes, isn't she?
My, she's a wonderful girl.
I didn't know they still made them like this.
In Bukistan we are old fashioned.
Women are wives and mothers, as Allah intended them to be.
They are not taxi cab drivers and wrestlers.
Yes, I see what you mean.
I do not understand your country.
In America machines do everything.
Hm, not quite.
American ingenuity will find a way.
And when it does do not try and sell it to us.
It is the custom for the princess to dance for an honored guest.
That's a delightful custom, by all means.
The princess would be sensational in America.
There are many suitors for the princess Tarji's hand.
But the Khan has found them unworthy of her.
I don't wonder.
It's a pity.
Our women have been taught from birth the perfect art.
How to make a man happy.
The princess Tarji would be the ideal wife.
Every secret and every skill of five thousand years have been imparted to her every day and night of her life.
You see before you a woman who's entire being is dedicated to but one desire.
The desire to bring to her husband the gift of complete happiness.
A pity you cannot stay.
Yes, isn't it?
But I'm getting married next week.
Well, then, of course you cannot stay.
No, sir, I...
Oh, you speak English!
Well, I'm glad, because there's something
I'd like to add to that deal we made...
Now I see.
Thank you very much.
Please thank the princess for me.
And tell the Khan how grateful I am for his hospitality.
Shall we have the pleasure of seeing you again?
No, I'm afraid not.
My plane leaves first thing in the morning.
But do tell Tarji that I shall think of her often and remember the time we spent together.
If I were free, I...
His excellency is pleased to present you with this remembrance of your visit here.
Oh, thank you. That's very thoughtful of you, sir.
Uh... that's very thoughtful of him.
And please accept this from the princess as a token of her friendship.
Oh, Tarji... thank you, dear.
Katan!
I won't forget you.
She's asking you for a remembrance.
She admires your tie.
Oh, well, of course.
Darling.
She speaks English like a native, doesn't she?
Well, goodbye.
Your name, please.
Clemson Reade.
Under the "R"s.
Thank you.
Hello, it's nice to see you again, Mr. Reade.
Thank you, Evelyn.
May I park this stuff here?
Certainly. I'll tell Miss Effington you're here.
Don't do that. I want to surprise her.
Effie!
Clem!
Effie!
Oh, Clem, this is Mr. Portman, Mr. Whitley,
Mr. Bexton...
Mr. Reade, my fiancé.
Mr. Reade.
I must say I'm delighted to meet you.
Mustn't I?
I think that about covers everything.
You'll each get a copy of the report and the Secretary of State will take action on it next week.
Thank you.
Thank you, Miss Effington.
Good day, gentlemen.
Darling!
Dearest!
Welcome home, darling.
You can say that again.
Now then, tell me all about your trip.
Everything?
Everything.
Oh, well, Effie, it was the most amazing...
Sorry, dear.
Yes, Mac.
When is the revised report going out?
It's ready now, but I think it would be better to condense it first.
All right. But don't let them lose any time on it.
Is Kramer going to take it himself?
Yes, he's leaving on the 15th.
Be sure he doesn't go in cold.
Give him the background on the situation.
Right, he's being briefed on it.
What about Camfrid?
I'm keeping after him, but I'll check on it again this afternoon.
Thank you.
Well, that sounds just wonderful, darling.
What else did you do?
What else did I...
Oh, I'm sorry.
Effington... Yes, I'm ready.
It's Aberdan.
Oh!
Hello!
Hello, Givney.
Yes, we received it. It's an interesting idea, but we don't think it's practical.
It might cause a great deal of trouble.
Hm... well you can trust Mr. You-know-who but you've got to be careful of the other one.
Hmm...
Exactly.
Well, my suggestion is that you let them make the first proposal and tell them you're awaiting instructions on it.
What? Oh, nonsense.
Don't let them rush you.
Right. You'll get an answer on it within 48 hours.
Goodbye.
I'm sorry, darling. The oil situation is a little tense right now but I am glad you had such a successful trip.
I hope I haven't bored you with any of it.
Oh, no. You know I'm interested in everything you do.
I'll bet that's for you.
You win.
Effington.
Your mother?
Effie, why don't we go somewhere and be alone?
Oh, I'd love to, darling, but there isn't a chance.
I'm scheduled for a meeting at the Consulate in 15 minutes...
Things haven't changed much, have they?
It's just the oil crisis, dear.
There are so many plans to discuss.
We had some plans of our own, remember?
Oh, I certainly do.
All right. We'll discuss them at dinner tonight.
We are having dinner together.
Of course!
I've just talked to Givney again.
Here, take a look at Kaempfert's report.
This thing is really snowballing.
Now, what I think we should...
How are you, Reade?
Fine.
Have a nice trip?
Effie will tell you all about it.
Tonight.
This just arrived.
Oh, thank goodness, Annie.
How's everything in the kitchen?
Oh, everything's fine.
Fine, stop worrying, sir.
I'll give you plenty of time between courses.
Thank you.
Well, Brutus, how do you like it, huh?
Soft music, flowers, candlelight, huh?
Wait till you see this.
We,, do you approve?
Good.
Well, here we go.
Sorry I'm late, darling.
Darling.
What a day I've had.
You could have fooled me.
Oh, hello, Brutus.
Oh, isn't that a new hat?
Yes, do you like it?
Oh, it's very pretty.
It's awfully dark in here, dear.
There, that's better.
Fix me a drink, will you, darling?
Champagne coming up.
Make it a Scotch and water, would you, Clem?
Yes, dear, yes.
No ice, just a lemon and easy on the water.
Well, here we are, dear.
Well, darling, here's to...
...us.
I'm so glad you're back.
Oh, darling, I'm glad to be back.
I can assure you.
Hello, Annie.
Good evening, Miss Effington.
Dinner in ten minutes.
What...
Ten minutes?
What's the matter?
I have to go and make the salad dressing.
O know how you love it.
Excuse me, dear, I'll only be a minute.
Everything under control in the kitchen?
Oh, yes, wait until you taste it.
Is that a new bow tie?
Yes, do you like it?
Hmm, I do.
I always like your bow ties.
Now, that's better.
This is the first time I've relaxed in three weeks.
Good.
Honestly we never dreamed there'd be this much fuss about the oil leases.
First Iraq, then Iran, and now Bukistan is in the act.
Thank heavens I'm a woman. A man couldn't take it.
Never, my darling.
A week from tomorrow you can forget about everything except us.
I've been thinking about that, Clem.
Oh, so have I.
Now, I can't make up my mind where we ought to spend our honeymoon.
Bermuda, Honolulu, the farm in Vermont, or shall we just throw the key away?
Clem...
What?
I'm afraid we'll have to postpone the wedding till after the oil deal is signed.
What?
I don't see any other way, truly I don't.
There are so many things to get done.
Meetings, conferences, reports, and all of them so urgent.
So is our wedding.
But I mean really urgent.
Oh, for God's...
I mean, we can wait. The Middle East can't.
We can get married any time.
Can we?
Look, darling, I want us to be together just as much as you do.
But I can't let MacBride down.
He's counting on me.
Of course not.
Perhaps we could work in the wedding somehow.
You know, between phone calls.
Now just a minute. Don't you think you're being a little selfish?
You mean for wanting to get married?
No, for putting your own happiness before the welfare of the United States.
Oh, Effie, if I thought the welfare of the United States depended upon your answering a telephone...
Oh, so that's it.
You think what I'm doing is like belonging to a garden club or having a hot game of Mahjong with the girls.
No, no, I didn't say that.
You didn't have to.
You just can't believe that anything I'm doing can be important enough to really matter.
Oh, please, let's not get into that again.
We are in it, and we might as well have it out.
Come over here.
Here's Bukistan.
I know, I've been there.
Here's the United States.
I've been there too.
We have just one thing in common. Oil.
Every plan we've make for peace or war depends on that oil.
Is that so?
I don't have to tell you what happened in Iran.
Half the free world had to learn to pronounce the name Mosaddegh.
I still can't pronounce it.
The same thing is happening again... only this time there'll be a lot of new names to learn.
And the only way we can get that oil is to get those names on the dotted line.
Really?
And that's why this deal is so important.
And I'm in charge, Clem, whether you like it or not, I am in charge.
Yes, yes...
And if that's the Julliard Matron's Needlepoint Society,
I'll leave my hat.
Don't remember what you were going to say until I get back. Be a good girl.
Sorry to break in on you, Reade, but your phone's out of order.
I've been calling all evening.
We had a cable from Marley.
Givney's walked out. The pot's really boiling.
Givney's walked out?
Givney walked.
It must have been over his ears.
He can outweigh a pyramid.
I hate to be upsetting your evening, but this is so hot the words are just jumping off the papers.
Here, let me see it.
I'm afraid this is going to postpone your honeymoon.
Don't worry about it.
You see, we were right about this cookie.
Yes, but Glenson's weaker than we thought.
Dinner is ready.
Oh, start without me, Clem, I'll be right there.
No, no, no...
I don't believe you heard Annie.
Dinner is ready.
Pull up a chair, Mac.
I've eaten already.
I will have a little coffee, though.
I wish you'd go over that fourth paragraph.
Hm-hmm.
Right in here, now.
You see...
We'll have to change our tactics, I can see that.
We'll have to take part IV and put it under the heading of Administration and Supply.
Pass the salt, please.
There are still a few things to be worked out, but I'm sure you can handle them.
Pass the pepper, please.
Now, under this heading here, uh...
Contract Negotiations, part III
Bread.
I don't use butter.
You know, Bukistan may turn out to be the key to this whole thing.
If they fall in line, the rest will follow.
Right now we have to get to Haroun.
First things first.
Right.
Right... right!
Now hear this and hear it good.
This is only going to take a minute but it may be the most important minute in our lives.
You can put it under the heading of Clem and Effie,
Basic Principles, Part I.
Perhaps I'd better...
No, I want you to hear it, too.
I'm in love with you, not the State Department.
I didn't...
I'm not through.
Now, if a woman can run a home and still find time to have a career, that's fine.
But first things first.
Clem...
No, just a minute.
We haven't been able to make a definite plan since we met.
We went to Vermont for two weeks.
Yes, yes, that's right.
To her grandfather's farm.
For two wonderful relaxing weeks in glorious Vermont.
It's heavenly there in September.
We spent one day there.
She had to leave to take care of a crisis in the Sahara.
Some of the sand was missing.
Well, you stayed on.
Yes, with grandfather.
It wasn't the same thing.
No, no...
No, no, I don't like this idea, we can work in the wedding somehow...
Or if we can't leave on our honeymoon together
I can start without you...
I don't like that.
Perhaps we're both looking for different things.
And if we are, it's best to find it out now and call it quits.
Clem, I can't just toss this all over, it's too important.
Well, now we know what's important, don't we?
Oh, I wish you'd understand.
I think I've understood all along.
I've just been kidding myself.
I want a full-time wife and you want a part-time husband, it's as simple as that.
Look, you two. You'll both think differently about this in the morning.
No, Mac, I'm afraid this is morning.
It's time to go back counting sand.
Oh, I didn't mean that. What you're doing is important.
But not as important as cooking your breakfast.
Right.
Well you don't need me for that.
You can buy it for a dollar an hour.
We've been emancipated, Mr. Reade.
Have you ever heard of Susan B. Anthony?
Can she cook?
It just so happens she got women the right to vote.
Oh, now, really. You're not going to give me that
Amelia Bloom and Harriet Beecher Stowe routine.
What's wrong with them?
They were probably lousy housekeepers.
Come on, Mac.
Thanks for the coffee.
Hello, gentlemen.
Hello, again.
Sorry I'm late.
Ken, you're just in time.
We were just discussing Rogers and the Fuller account.
That was a beautiful job.
Nothing to it.
Rogers got unlucky, I got lucky.
Yeah, I'll say.
He did that account for over 15 years.
I'd like to see the look on his face when he found out he'd lost it.
Ten days ago on that Russell account we... we put the canteloupes in the oven because the ice cubes fell off the little boy's scooter.
Hm? Oh, that's fine, Charlie, just fine.
What's fine?
Charlie, tell me something.
How long have you been married?
Seventeen years, why?
What's your wife like?
Well, May's like...
You fellows know May. What's she like?
Well, she's nice, a little bossy.
Yeah... plays lousy bridge.
Yeah, that's what she's like.
Jean and I haven't had a quarrel in 10 years.
Whenever we're in the same room long enough.
I make it a practice to take May little presents every now and then.
It's something I picked up from her first husband.
He told me about it in court.
It does help keep her quiet.
Of course I think you fellows are all wrong.
Take it from the veteran with the service stripes.
No, no, let's hear what the newlywed has to say.
Go ahead, shoot.
Well, I've only been married a year, but
I think you can make a marriage anything you want it to be.
Of course the trick is to find a girl like Louise.
When I go home at night
I know she's there waiting for me.
It's got feeling.
It doesn't matter what we do, we always have fun.
Sometimes we'll take a walk somewhere, or maybe go to a movie.
Maybe we'll just stay home in front of the fire and read.
It's great.
And then sometimes, when we're in the mood, we three of us go to a nightclub.
The three of you?
Why, yes.
My mother-in-law lives with us.
Now wait a minute, fellows.
We shouldn't talk like this in front of Clem.
He's gonna be a bridegroom next week.
No, I'm not.
Effie and I called the whole thing off last night.
Oh, I'm sorry, Clem. I'm really sorry.
Why are you sorry?
You just got finished showing me how lucky I am.
There isn't one of you can look me straight in the eye and tell me you're happily married.
You've had to make a million compromises.
Why do we always have to cater to women?
We put them on pedestals, we make up cockeyed rules about the weaker sex.
You get into an elevator with one of the weaker sex and you take off our hat in some kind of pagan tribute.
Twenty minutes later the same delicate female is driving a taxicab through traffic and cursing like a muleskinner.
We keep treating them like flowers and they keep outliving us.
Right now they control 70% of the wealth of this country and are they satisfied?
No, they want to control the country.
They're Ambassadors, they're in the senate, they're even in the State Department.
That fight with Effie must have been a lulu.
No, I'm glad it happened.
We were all wrong for each other.
We both saw that last night.
Most people are afraid to face such problems.
They get married, find out they don't belong together then they have to get a divorce.
You took a shortcut.
There must be a girl somewhere who thinks it's a wonderful career just to have a home and babies, whose only thought is to make her husband happy.
That kind of girl went out with the cavemen.
Only if they had money.
Clem!
Clem?
What's the matter?
Suppose there were a girl like that.
Suppose I had found a girl who was trained from the day she was born to be a dream wife. What would you say?
I'd say she got a  friend.
It was right under my nose and I couldn't see it.
I said no.
You sound like a schoolboy in love.
Miss Temple. Take a cable.
Princess Tarji Suleimani, Bukistan.
Oh!
May I come in?
Would it make any difference if I said no?
No.
Before you get any ideas I think you should know
I'm here on official business.
Did you send a cable this afternoon?
Yes, yes I did.
But I hardly think that concerns the State Department.
I'm afraid it does.
It was addressed to the Princess of Bukistan.
Now look. Your beloved State Department can butt into almost anything they like, but this time my love life does not concern them.
That cable is a personal matter.
Every cable that goes out of here to Bukistan has to clear through the State Department.
And I don't think your idea of a joke is very funny.
What joke?
You know perfectly well.
This cable reads like a proposal of marriage to the princess.
That's exactly what it is.
Are you serious?
Are you asking as a woman or a member of the State Department?
I thought you went over there to work.
As a woman.
My interest in this is purely political.
We happen to have a very tense oil situation over there at the moment and a joke like this may be misconstrued.
I don't consider a proposal of marriage a joke.
You're really serious.
What's the matter with that?
You hardly know the girl.
I know her well enough to want to spend the rest of my life with her.
By that time I should know her even better.
Clem, if this is a rebound thing, I...
It isn't.
Well, you don't know what you'll be letting yourself in for.
It's not like marrying an American girl.
I hope not.
Now tell me, is there any law against my marrying Tarji?
Of course not.
Good.
Then I intend to.
You can tell that to your State Department.
All right.
Would you like to give the cable to me?
No, I would not.
Besides, I've already sent the cable.
Why would I want to give it to you?
I have it here. They referred it back to our office.
They did?
If you would like to dictate another one,
I'll see that it's sent out.
Oh, for heaven's...
Oh, well, all right, in that case, uh...
Dear Miss... no.
Dear Princess
Darling.
Though I have known you but a few short weeks,
I find that I cannot forget you. Stop.
I have never felt this way about any girl before.
I mean, I've never felt this way about any girl from Bukistan before.
Uh.... never mind. Start again.
Darling, Though I have known you but a few short weeks,
I find that I cannot forget you.
Yes, that's all right. Stop.
Would appreciate your marrying me at once.
Please advise, yours truly, Clem Reade.
Did you get that?
No...
May I make a suggestion?
What is it?
Well, first of all, I wouldn't send it to her,
I'd send it to her father.
I don't want to marry her father...
It's a custom.
Secondly, there are certain lingual and formal amenities to be observed.
I'll see that it's properly reworded.
Thanks.
I know a little more about the East than you do, Clem.
She's an important princess.
Don't be surprised if you don't get an answer.
Thanks, I won't.
Good night, Clem.
Good night.
It's been three weeks!
Oh, that's it.
I can't understand why I haven't heard.
These things take time.
Well, gentlemen, get this.
The entire order from Bukistan has been cancelled.
They can't have cancelled it!
They've been offended.
It's the cable you sent.
I didn't send it, Effie did.
Effie! That double crosser!
Miss Temple.
Get me Miss Effington at the State Department.
Yes, sir.
I got a delivery for Clemson Reade.
Where will I put it?
This is his office. Bring it in.
Here?
Yes.
Okay, lady. Anything you say.
Why, why... How do I know why?
All I know is that 20 minutes ago we got this cable.
Reade's proposal of marriage has been accepted.
You confirmed it, didn't you?
Yes, yes.
I still don't see what's so terrible about it.
Then I 'll tell you.
All this deal needs is one little match to blow it sky high.
And this could be that match.
Oh, the khan seems friendly enough at present... but all his future son-in-law has to do is to whistle to a pretty blonde and we're dead.
Well, what can we do?
There's only one thing we can do.
We've got to see to it that this is the happiest courtship since Romeo and Juliet.
Nothing must go wrong.
Because if they pfft!, it'll be a pfft! all around the world.
We need someone to make sure that nothing does go wrong.
Someone who knows the Bukistanian language,
Bukistanian customs and diplomatic protocol.
And, if possible, Mr. Clemson Reade himself.
Oh, no, wait a minute, Mac, I...
Have you reached Miss Effington yet?
She what?
Well, keep try...
What are these goats doing here?
The lady said to bring them in.
Oh, oh... I've been trying to get a hold of you.
What did you say in that cable to Tarji?
She's obviously turned me down.
What do you think this is?
It's your dowry.
My dowry?
Yes.
Oh, that's wonderful.
What are all these things?
It's a Bukistanian custom to give the bridegroom a dowry.
It may be goats, or sheep, or even camels.
Well, then, why did they cancel the order?
They probably consider it "forpeit".
For what?
Forpeit. Another custom.
Bad manners to deal in business till after the wedding.
Well, I have a thousand and one problems.
I have to get plane reservations... hotel accommodations, she'll probably be here in a month or two.
What are you doing Saturday morning?
Nothing, why?
Drop by at the airport. Your bride is arriving.
Uh... fine.
I wonder how many people the princess will bring in her party...
Saturday?
Effie!
Effie!
Look Mommy, look at the funny man.
Don't point, darling. It's rude.
What is it?
He's probably some kind of nut.
Maybe he's making a movie.
I bet he's advertising some kind of cigarette.
No, that's an authentic costume.
I wonder how many wives he has.
I'll bet he's from India.
Arabia.
Huh-huh, Afghanistan.
Schenectady!
Let go!
What are you doing here?
I work here.
We are the official reception committee.
What are you made up for?
The student prince?
I wouldn't expect you to understand.
I'm just showing a little consideration for my fiancée.
I want her to feel at home.
Why didn't you tell me?
You didn't ask me.
Tarji!
Darling!
Next time let's just shake hands.
Katan, katan!
Now, you've had your turn.
Now it's hers.
I'm sorry, Reade, but we'd like to get on with this. Go ahead.
I'm sorry.
That's very nice. I couldn't have said it better myself.
Now, if you'll all excuse me,
I'd like to be alone with my fiancée.
Reade, there's a little matter of protocol to be observed.
We've made a few plans for the princess.
Well, it happens I've made some plans of my own.
Now, Reade, don't give us any trouble.
This girl is a princess.
The way she is treated happens to be very important at this time.
Is that clear?
No!
Good. We'll escort her to the hotel.
But...
Oh, wait!
I thought we'd never be alone.
May we quote you on that?
Here he is! Mr. Reade, when are you and the princess getting married?
How does it feel to be marrying to a rich princess?
When you marry her, will you be a prince?
Where did you meet Tarji?
If you don't mind, this is a personal matter.
Are you kidding? We got 10 million readers who want to hear about this.
Do you have any immediate plans?
Yes, I'm going up.
I was afraid you were lost, Reade.
I want to give you our schedule.
Tomorrow night is the official banquet.
Saturday we've arranged lunching... and Monday... I'll see that you get a list of the other activities.
Now look! If Washington thinks they're going to turn this into a three-ring circus, they're crazy.
I'll marry whomever I please and I don't need any help from you.
Now I'd appreciate it if you'd all get out and leave us alone.
What's she saying?
Well, she said something about a hot dog.
Shall I have some sent up?
Yes... no!
Reade wants to handle everything.
Let him arrange it. Come on.
Oh, yes, of course, your friends.
How do you do?
Which one speaks English?
You mean none of you speaks English?
Darling?
Oh, I have a feeling I should have taught you more.
Darling.
Oh, now that won't do at all.
Just put the rest of the luggage in there.
I wonder if you could help me.
I'm at your service, sir.
Do you happen to speak Bukistanian?
I majored in French.
Spanish.
You mean none of them speaks English?
No, unfortunately.
It shouldn't be too difficult.
One can communicate without words.
See, she's trying to tell me something.
Yes, darling, you go ahead, I'm listening.
It's too hot in here?
Palm trees?
Goodbye, Arthur...
No, it's something else.
Oh, I am an angel.
Skyscraper?
He hasn't done anything yet.
There's something.
Oh, yes, this is good.
A woman! Woman,
No, smaller than that.
Girl?
Pretty, pretty girl, eh?
A pretty girl is like a melody.
Yes... a pretty girl...
Does this fellow...
I think he's doing something new.
He's eating. He's eating something.
Chewing... food. Food?
No, no. Meat!
Sounds like... Sounds like meat.
Mate.
How can he do a word that sounds like another word if he doesn't know the other word?
I don't care. I think I'm on the track of something.
I something, something, mate.
Something, something, pretty girl.
I've got it!
What?
I brought you a mate, now you find pretty girl for me.
For him?
Sure, that's what he's been saying.
Probably some kind of a custom.
Naturally, it's absolutely against the rules of the hotel.
I know, I know...
Who's winning?
Oh, Effie. You're a lifesaver.
Would you help me?
Now, he wants me to provide a girl for him.
Would you explain that...
What they're trying to tell you is
The Princess Tarji has heard so much about them she would very much like to have an American hot dog.
Well, I guess you'll be running along.
Yes, yes.
I'll see to it that the princess gets a frankfurter.
Why don't you run along and give them a chance to get moved in?
I haven't had a chance to be with Tarji yet.
You can be with her tonight.
Yes, dear. We'll spend the evening alone, just the two of us together.
She won't have any trouble understanding me tonight.
Ta-ta, dear.
Katan!
There he goes katanning again.
Goodbye, dear.
Oh, badibani.
Good evening, Mr. Reade.
I just want you to know... that I have my entire staff alerted for anything, anything at all.
Any little special services that the princess may require.
After all, strangers in a foreign land, you know.
That's very kind of you, but I don't think it will be necessary.
They're no different from any of us.
They live just like you and me.
Yes.
Good night.
Now, what are you doing here?
I think you'd better sit down.
Why, has something happened to Tarji?
No, and we don't want anything to happen to her.
That's why I'm here.
And what does that mean?
You're not going to like this any more than I do but there's nothing we can do about it.
About what?
I have been assigned to take care of you and Tarji.
You've been what?
That's ridiculous. That's utter nonsense.
If I need a nursemaid, I'll send for one.
Now, why don't you just get your briefcase and your horn book and run on down to the office and solve all the little international problems
This happens to be one of the little international problems.
At least it could, be and I'm here to see that it isn't.
Oh, no, you're not. And if you think
I'm going to let you interfere...
I'm not going to interfere. I'm going to help you.
This is just as important to us as it is to you.
You can look upon me as a stick of furniture.
No. Absolutely not. No, no...
Oh, Tarji.
Tarji, did you hear what she said?
She thinks that...
That... uh...
Can I tell her something for you?
Yes, yes you can.
Tell her that she looks like a beautiful flower.
Katan, katan!
Stop that. It's all right now.
We're engaged.
Oh, please. Will you explain to him?
Oh, he knows it better than you do.
Until the wedding you can't embrace her, or kiss her, or anything.
After the wedding she becomes your property.
You make me sound like a landlord.
Certainly a little kiss.
As far as they're concerned there's no such thing as a little kiss.
You'll just have to control yourself till after the wedding.
Then will you please explain to him that all that's been arranged for next Tuesday.
What's the matter?
He says the date of the wedding has already been set according to astronomical calculations.
For when?
Three months from today.
Three months? Why, that's ridiculous!
It won't do you any good to argue with him.
Tell him I refuse to wait three months.
There was nothing about the three months in the arrangements.
I don't believe in long engagements.
My whole family feels the same way.
My grandfather and my grandmother were married the same day they met.
Good enough for them.
Three months! Do you realize that's ninety days?
Do you know how many hours that is?
Neither do I, but it must be an awful lot.
Three months. I won't stand for it.
Three months. That's the end.
Three...
Oh, I don't know.
Three months of this might not be too bad.
While I searched the book of love... a wise voice whispered happy is he... happy is he who holds in his house a love... a love more lovely than the moon... and dreams... dreams of a lifetime longer than a year.
Did she say that?
Omar Khayyam said it.
My love for you called you to me across half the world.
I'm so sorry. I didn't hear that.
My love for you... I mean her, of course.
Yes.
Has called you... I mean...
I understand who's who.
Well, then, tell her yourself.
What did you tell her?
I said you wished to cut your tongue out because you could not speak your love for her in her own language.
That's very good!
Comfy?
Yeah, hm-hmm.
After we're married, ask her how many er...
How many what?
Never mind. I'll wait until she learns English.
I'll ask her that myself, thank you.
Bukistanians believe in large families, if that answers your question.
Now wait a minute, just...
Tarji, darling...
Now listen, listen...
Table... table...
Table.
That's very... Oh, this is going to be a cinch.
I don't think I'll need you for the moment.
Would you mind going over to the corner, relaxing?
That's a good girl.
Go somewhere, thank you.
Good, Tarji. Humm...
Couch... couch.
Couch.
Yes, darling, couch.
Yes, yes...
Couch.
Uhm... Oh, ashtray, see?
Ashtray.
Ashtray see.
Ashtray...
No, no, not the "see", dear, just the...
Never mind. We'll get to that later.
Fruit.
Fruit.
Fruit.
Prune.
Prune.
Well, hmm...
Prune.
Prune.
That's better, but uh...
Pruuuune,
Pruuuune...
Katan!
Katan!
You big silly ox!
Here, catch.
Now how long can a man stand this?
In three months I'll be a nervous wreck.
What does he think he is, the Iron Curtain?
He is until you're married.
You tell him we're in America now.
There are certain customs that...
What were you saying?
Uh, what was I saying? What, what?
Something about customs.
Oh, oh!
Well, there are certain customs that are sacred.
And I'm not the man to violate them.
I should say not.
If they want to separate their boys and girls, then I say separate them.
What are three months?
Why, they go by like that.
Clem!
Do you know the mark of a mature man?
Patience. The ability to wait for what he wants.
That is the key to the situation.
Well, I think I'll be running along.
Give everybody a chance to get a good night's sleep.
I think that's a very good idea.
Yes, would you do me a favor?
Would you please tell Tarji that I'll see her very soon.
She says her heart will be unable to wait.
May I drop you at your house?
No, thanks. I think I'll get a cab.
Well, good night all.
Darling.
Darling, I'm back.
Oh, I wish I could speak with you in your language.
There's so much I want to tell you.
But all you need to know now is that I love you.
It won't be easy to be patient but I want you to know that I'll wait as long as necessary.
And that I'll want you more each day.
Darling, it seems I've waited all my life for you.
And in just a little while we...
And in just a little while...
Badabani.
Katan, katan!
Shhh! You'll wake everyone up!
Mr. Reade!
I'm certainly not going to stay in such a noisy hotel.
You may go in now, Mr. Reade.
With our deepest regrets and sincere assurance to your excellency that there will not be a repetition of last night's er...
Last night's unfortunate incident.
Good. How does the whole thing sound?
Fine, I'll send it by special cable.
Good morning, Romeo.
Yes, yes, yes...
You sent for me?
Yes, sit down, Reade.
Now you look here. I'm a citizen...
And there are a few things that I've got to make clear to you, citizen.
The State Department has enough troubles without worrying about your love life.
As far as I'm concerned you can have a harem.
But when your irresponsible actions jeopardize the functions of this Office then I'm going to crack down.
You were warned about this sort of thing, Reade.
You're making a mountain out of a mole hill.
And you were told to keep away from that mole hill until after you were married.
Tarji is my fiancée. If I want to kiss her, what do you expect me to do?
Telephone the Secretary of State?
Now look, Reade. I don't care to have the State Department put in the position of playing Peeping Tom.
But for the next three months you're going to behave like Whistler's Mother.
You stick to protocol and we will not have any more trouble.
Whistler's Mother?
Just remember what I told you. Don't get too friendly.
Thank you. I'll remember.
Good!
You forgot to give me the key.
I haven't any... key.
I beg your pardon.
I'll show myself out.
Did you explain the facts of life to him?
He knows them. That's our problem.
Now that he understands, maybe...
My dear Effie, you know all about countries, but there are a few things you've got to learn about men.
You are moving in with the princess tonight.
Oh, Mr. Reade.
Good evening.
I've been waiting to talk to you.
Really? Anything wrong?
Yes.
It's about that bearded gentleman.
You mean our friend the skyscraper.
He's been trying to buy our chambermaids.
He has?
Yes, he's been offering them physicians in the Khan's harem.
I hope he hasn't offended them.
Offended them?
Six of the girls have already accepted.
Well, I'll speak to Miss Effington about that.
Good evening, Tarji.
Oh, she shouldn't do that.
You're telling me.
Oh, yes, it's the lady from the translation bureau.
Why don't you run along and see a French movie or something?
This is better than a French movie.
There's a good chance I may not need you anymore.
What's the matter, what...
What are you trying to say?
"Nonmoki"... you know...
Oh, you mean "Monkomi Bukistani sabeh"
Here, Katan, kattatch.
That fellow catches everything, except pneumonia.
Now that you're here you might as well make yourself useful.
Tell Tarji that she looks enchanting tonight.
And don't spare the adjectives.
Yeah... here we go again.
This is the life.
You'd have been a smash in the Middle Ages.
Yes, yes, yes.
Tell Tarji I've been longing to see her all day.
And put a little feeling into it.
What did she say?
She said there is no moon until you walk into her presence.
Oh, isn't that nice.
Is there any answer, Moon Man?
Tarji, now that we're alone...
I want you to know how sorry I am about the key last night.
Key?
Yes, dear, the key.
You see, I'm afraid it was one of those unfortunate things...
Key.
No, no, darling... you don't understand. You keep this.
See?
No, I can't take the key.
Key.
Tarji, you mustn't do this.
Clem.
I'd love to, but we need oil.
I mean, we'll have plenty of time to be together.
Right now, a little thing like a key seems important...
Key.
But, but...
Oh, Tarji...
I'm sorry about the interruption.
One of the dancing girls discovered the telephone and she won't get off it.
She probably thinks she's an American woman.
Shall I translate that for Tarji?
No, no, let's wait for something funnier.
Well, it's been a hard day...
You're not going already?
Do you mind?
MacBride neglected to tell me my bedtime... but I'm sure the State Department won't object if I retire early.
May I drop you?
No, thanks, I'm going to stick around for a while.
Tell Tarji that until I see her again the birds will have no song.
Oh, brother.
Now, look!
All right, all right, the birds will have no song.
Well, good night.
Oh, Moon Man...
Hm?
You forgot your shoes.
Darling.
Darling, I'm back, I'm back!
You see, nothing can ever keep us apart.
Not the State Department, nor protocol, nor Effie.
Especially Effie.
We will be rid of them soon and your little moon man will be all yours.
Oh, it seems I've waited all my life for you.
I never loved anyone before I met you, dear.
I'm afraid I must go now so there won't be any trouble.
But just one kiss before I leave...
Oh, there you are!
I've been looking everywhere for you.
I know, I can go in now.
Oh, you're not MacBride, he's taller.
Where's he?
On the phone trying to explain you to Washington.
I know you won't believe this, but I only went back there to give her a good night kiss.
I didn't expect to start a riot.
Look at that?
Where'd you get the key?
I found it.
At least you're a chivalrous liar.
Tarji told me she gave you the key.
She thought you were asking for it.
I was asking for it, all right.
I wish I could explain Tarji to you, Clem.
Her only concern is to please you.
That's the way she was brought up.
Any whim of yours is law to her.
That's a terrible power to hold over anybody.
No one will ever hold that power over you, will they, Effie?
We're not discussing me.
Oh, well, citizen.
Hi.
You're becoming quite a problem.
Oh, not really, I'm just a normal, high-spirited
American boy.
We're going to see if we can control those high spirits.
I don't know why I have to feel like Benedict Arnold every time I want to kiss the girl I'm going to marry.
The American people have stood for inflation and high taxes but let Washington try to control everything and you'll have a revolution.
Well, I'll remember.
Miss Effington tells me that you're not entirely to blame for last night.
She did?
She came up with a very excellent suggestion.
We've just cabled to Bukistan... for permission to have the wedding right away.
Well, now we're getting somewhere.
I thought it would serve the best interests of everyone.
I never doubted it.
Now, there's to be a reception for Tarji tonight at the Bukistanian Consulate.
You're welcome to invite your friends.
Oh, really, you're too kind.
Technically you'll be on Bukistanian soil this evening so you'll be expected to behave accordingly.
You can always count on me.
I'll be there to explain their customs to you.
I had a feeling you'd be there.
Have you had a chance to look at that?
Well, I'll see you at the party tonight, is that right?
We'll need their approval on this.
We'll meet over there, huh?
This pertains to Raffidat.
Yeah, well, Raffidat.
Where is she?
You'll meet her.
Here, put my gloves in your pocket.
But, darling, I'm already carrying your compact.
Do as I tell you.
There she is.
Good evening, Clem.
Hello, Eff.
Good evening, Tarji.
Hey, did you see that?
I certainly did.
Tell her that she looks like a goddess.
Why don't you say those things to me?
I think you know everyone here.
Would you introduce them, please?
Oh, thank heavens, I'm so thirsty I could die.
Don't! You mustn't touch that.
The drinks are just for the men.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I explained it to Clem this afternoon.
This is the Bukistanian Consulate and there are certain strict customs which we are expected to observe.
Well, I never!
Thank you, Tarji.
Now, gentlemen, help yourselves.
Well, very nice, thank you.
Well, to the ladies.
I never heard of such a thing.
When in Rome, Jean...
Don't you dare enjoy that.
No, darling.
What else can't the Bukistanian women do?
Oh, they can do everything. And do it better.
How do you know?
Uh...
Thank you, Tarji.
That means dinner is served.
Good, I'm starved.
Wait!
Would you walk three paces behind your husbands, please?
Well, these fellows really live, eh?
I'm sorry. This table is for the men.
Do you mean to say I can't eat with my husband?
In Bukistan the women do not eat with the men.
They eat separately at their own table.
The women will eat over there.
How far did you say it is to Bukistan?
Clem, I've never seen anything like Tarji.
I thought you were exaggerating.
She's incredible.
If I ever treated May that way, she'd shoot me.
Clem, how did you train her to light your cigarette?
I didn't train her.
She's not a trick dog.
All she cares about is whether I'm happy.
It's a natural instinct.
Some instinct.
Tell us about some of her other instincts.
You haven't seen anything yet.
I can't wait.
Hey, delicious, what is it?
Goat meat.
Oh, dear. You know, I'm getting tired of all this.
All these crowds all the time.
Nothing but people.
What exactly did you have in mind?
Anything.
I'd just like to be alone with Tarji sometime.
Just alone with her.
We could go walking somewhere.
We might even go walking in the park.
If you're planning on disappearing with her, forget it.
Effie!
When you're out with Tarji there are certain protocol that must be observed.
Of course.
And we will observe it.
Together.
Ughh.
Tomorrow we can go for a nice walk in the park.
Now, lie down, Bonzo. It's feeding time.
Oh, for heaven's sakes. Will you tell her she's in America now? She can't go on like this.
But this is what you wanted, isn't it?
Certainly not. She's like Brutus.
Darling, you eat with me.
We eat together.
Ashtray?
Oh...
Explain it to her, will you?
It's going to be pretty difficult.
I'm doing 3000 years of history, but I'll try.
Just tell her that now... now...
She adores me.
Good morning, sir, or madam, or a small child...
...as the case may be.
As the case may be. That's very good, Tarji. Go on.
In the morning I have breakfast with my brother...
John.
Hm-hmm.
Why Clem angry?
Angry?
Yes, he not do like me anymore.
Ah, it isn't that, Tarji. In America it's different.
Women walk with their husbands and eat with them.
American women are proud. They fought for their freedom and they've become a part of history.
Women like Harriet Beecher Stowe and Amelia Bloomer.
Bloomer?
Yes, Bloomer.
Bloomer.
Tell me, Bloomer.
Well...
Clara Barton started American Red Cross.
Yes... Now what has that to do with any...
Good night.
Badabani.
It's been quite an evening.
Wee!
Wee!
Darling, fetch me a drink.
No ice, a twitch of lemon and easy on the water.
No, no, you've had enough.
Put her to bed. I'll see her tomorrow.
Oh, my goodness. She's high as a kite.
Flown by Benjamin Franklin, a man.
Good night, Mrs. Frankenstein.
For me?
Thank you.
Hey, you!
That's okay, I'll take care of her.
Hey, wait a minute.
You forgot to pay for your drink back there.
Pay?
Sure, you don't get anything for nothing, you know.
But that's all right. I took care of it myself.
You ate very friendlike.
I was hoping you'd look at it that way.
I wouldn't want you to think I was one of those fresh guys.
Fresh? What is fresh?
That's what I always say.
What is fresh?
What's the matter whether you introduce yourself or somebody else does it for you.
My name's George Seegley. What's yours?
Tarji.
You live around here, honey?
I live in big hotel.
Oh.
See?
You certainly do.
Are you free tonight?
Of course. I am free woman all the time.
What do you mean you told her she could go out?
I don't like the idea of her roaming around the streets all by herself.
She just went for a little walk.
Now, what could possibly happen?
She's not a child, Clem.
She can take care of herself.
I don't like it. She's changed.
And it's all your fault.
It's time someone freed her.
Oh, look, Pygmalion.
Pygmalion was a man.
Don't tempt me.
Oh, don't you understand, Clem?
She's like a kid with a new television set.
She's learned a new word, freedom.
And now she's just fiddling with all the knobs.
After you're married she'll settle down and be everything you want her to be.
After we're married?
By that time I'll be in a wheelchair.
Have you heard from the Khan about our wedding yet?
We've been notified to expect an answer today.
And while we're at it I think there are one or two things
I'd better explain to you about the wedding ceremony.
And what happens afterwards.
Isn't anything sacred?
Everything. That's what I want to talk to you about.
Evelyn, I'll have to cancel my 3 o'clock appointment.
And tell Gregorovitch I won't need him.
Who's Gregorovitch?
He's a spy.
Oh!
Now, let's begin at the beginning.
The wedding ceremony itself lasts for three days.
And it's called the "huffi".
I don't care what it's called.
And then what happens?
Well, the ceremony consists of feasting, dancing and incantations.
Since Tarji is a princess, the honeymoon will last eight weeks.
It's called the "broukha".
Don't wear bow ties.
Now, during the "broukha"...
Wait a minute... what's that? What did you say?
I said during the broukha...
No, about the bow ties.
Oh, don't wear them.
You mean to say there's some kind of Bukistanian law about bow ties?
No, it's just that you don't look very good in them, that's all.
Now, during the broukha...
Whoa, wait a minute...
You always said you liked me in bow ties.
You always wore them what could I say?
Well, that's a fine thing.
May I explain the broukha?
Never mind the broukha.
What else?
What else what?
What else didn't you like about me?
I think it's rather pointless to reminisce about our likes and dislikes when we were engaged.
No, I'd like to hear it.
Oh, it's nothing important, just little things.
Like your salad dressing.
Why, you loved my salad dressing.
Well, didn't you?
If every woman told the man she's going to marry what she really thinks, this would be a nation of old maids.
I wouldn't mind if your criticism was justified.
Perhaps I should have told you about your hats.
It so happens that my salad dressing...
What about my hats?
Nothing. It happens that my salad dressing...
What about my hats?
Well, if you really want to know, they're the most ridiculous hats I've ever seen.
They all look like crackerjack prizes.
But did I complain? No...
You used to compliment me on my hats.
Isn't that what you wanted me to do?
Not if it wasn't sincere.
We shouldn't even discuss it now.
It seems to me we ought to get back to the broukha.
What else?
What else what?
Since my hats were so ridiculous I'm sure there were other things you found equally ridiculous.
All right, now that you're asking, your perfume.
It happens to be very good perfume.
What do you call it? Protocol Number 5?
How dare you?
You always used to ask me to put it on.
What was I going to do?
Ask you to take it off?
What else?
Your lipstick. I always got smeared.
If you knew how to kiss.
Now wait a minute!
The first time I kissed you you told me it was like an earthquake.
Did I?
Oh, I see, It was like my salad dressing.
It was pleasant.
Hm... pleasant.
Let's see.
No earthquake.
Hm... forget I did it.
That won't be difficult.
Hmm... give my regards to Gregorovitch.
Mr. MacBride has asked me to give you this.
It's just arrived.
The Khan has agreed to hold the wedding next week when we sign the oil agreement.
Thanks, Pat.
Evelyn, get out Givney's report for me and have Ben call me on Monday.
Then get me Francis Gordon in Washington...
Earthquake! It's an...
Oh, no!
Did you feel s shaking?
No, sir. Maybe it's a vibration from the service elevator.
It gets pretty strong sometimes.
Oh...
Well...
Thank you.
Would you like some more ice?
Oh, no, don't trouble.
It's no trouble at all.
Well, I think I'll recite a little poetry tonight.
What will it be?
Anything that pleases you.
How about Keats? He's always good.
A thing of beauty is a joy forever.
Its loveliness increases...
It's not very romantic, is it?
I like it.
I learned new thing today.
That's fine! Tell Clem.
I open charges account.
I go in many stores. They are very nice.
Macy, Gimble, Sak.
One store much fun. Many games.
Games?
Yes.
You put money in and you win sandwich, soup, coffee.
I win all time.
That's the automat.
Automat.
Yes...
Doorbell. I go.
Hiya, honey! I bet you thought
I wasn't gonna make it, didn't you?
Hello, George. Come in.
Oh, a double date. I'm mighty glad to meet you.
My name is George Seegley.
Really?
George my friend. Very fresh.
Is that so?
I think there must be some mistake.
I'll get it.
Oh, man, this is crazy!
I'll get to you later. Where's the doll?
Doll!
Who is he?
Louis.
I happen to have a date with this young lady.
Yeah, well so do I.
Wait a minute. Nobody has a date with this lady.
I have a date with this lady.
This dame does the land office business.
Where did you meet her?
If it's any of your concern, I met her in Bukistan.
Tarji, I think you should explain things to these gentlemen.
Now why don't you just run along, huh, fellows?
Look, bud, why don't you go out and get a girl of your own?
Yeah, and that goes for you, too.
Go away!
Who do you think you're cutting in on?
Tarji!
Dicky!
Get your coat, honey. We're going dancing.
Who's he?
He promised to teach Tarji jitterbug.
What am I supposed to do?
Why don't you join the marines?
Sorry, I must have the wrong... Tarji!
Scotty!
What is this, a convention?
Hey, you don't have any shoes on.
I know!
Tarji, where did you meet all these people?
I bought her an orange drink.
We went walking in the park.
I bought her a banana split.
I met her in the movies.
With Lana Turner.
How did you find time to go to the automat?
I beg your pardon, but I...
Oh, Tarji!
Uncle Clarence.
Uncle Clarence?
We were just leaving, Unc.
Look, I met her first, fellows, so if you all don't mind running along.
Are you kidding?
Come on, Tarji, we're going dancing.
Imagine! I'm taking her to a nightclub.
I'll toss you all out.
Gentlemen!
Come on, honey.
Now wait a minute!
Nobody is taking no one nowhere.
I don't believe we've met.
I'll attend to you in a minute.
Now listen, my friend.
Butt out, chum!
Who are you pushing?
You, chum!
Oh, big fight!
Clem, be careful!
Ouch! What did you do that for?
That's my shoe!
You wait till I find my shoe!
Oh, look out!
I'll come back and do the room later.
Stop it! Stop it!
Hello!
Oh, hello.
They're not even registered.
Hello, this is Bob. Signal red! Signal red!
Never mind that! Help me find my other shoe.
What? Where are you going?
Wait...
There is a young lady to see you.
I do not need any.
Do I?
No, Your Excellency.
Who is she?
Effington?
Send her in.
She dares to face me after what she's done to the princess.
We shall see.
Your Excellency.
Never mind that.
You are the American friend of my daughter.
I have that honor.
The one who has filled her mind with your Western nonsense.
Why are you here?
I am from the State Department.
Indeed?
Your country is foolish to allow women to meddle in government.
The coach of State cannot be driven from the back seat.
That is excellent. Make a note of it.
Excellent!
I came to speak about the princess Tarji and Mr. Reade, Your Excellency.
Their marriage means very much.
There will be no marriage.
If Tour Excellency will listen, I...
We can read!
The princess involved in a public scandal.
It's a disgrace.
In the rest of the world women know their place.
In your country women have forgotten to be women.
American women are not mothers. They're fathers.
I will not let my daughter become a father.
Oh, she isn't going to be... I mean.
I shall see to it.
She will not remain in this country and be blinded to what a woman should be.
One sees with the heart, not the eyes.
You speak Bukistanian.
I speak all the important languages, Your Excellency.
And what you say is true of some American women.
But that is because we need guidance.
The guidance of men who are wise and strong.
Men who can make women what they were meant to be.
As it is written...
One of my own quotations.
I know.
Araq!
A native wine made from rice.
I have good news, Your Excellency.
The princess has returned.
She can wait.
The araq is pleasing to you?
Oh, yes.
Good.
To the bride and groom.
You American women.
Yes, that's Effie, all right.
Always there when you need her.
Remarkable girl.
You know, I remember one summer...
Oh, dear me, he was in a hurry, wasn't he?
The Khan cannot see me tonight.
He does not wish to be disturbed until morning.
Oh, never mind, dear...
Morning?
What's wrong?
Well, Effie's in there!
They won't let you go in.
Let them try to stop me.
Katan! Katan!
Oh, please...
Effie! Effie! I'm here, I'm...
Are you all right?
Does he always enter a room like that?
Forgive him. He was eager to see you,
Your Excellency.
Yes, Your Excellency, I was eager to see you.
You are welcome, my son. You may join us.
Thank you, sir.
How are you doing?
I have him eating out of my hand.
Sweet meat?
Oh, I see...
Why are you doing all that?
I'm trying to make His Excellency comfortable.
You do want your future father-in-law to be comfortable, don't you?
My future...
Oh, yes, of course...
Oh, well, that isn't necessary!
What's that?
Araq.
Araq?
It's a wine made from rice.
Hmm... thank you.
Tastes like milk.
Sweet meat
Forgive me for leaving you, but duty calls.
Next time I'll leave them at home.
I will see you tomorrow at the wedding.
Congratulations.
Effie, I want to tell you how...
Skip it. Courtesy of the State Department.
We're going to have lots of oil.
That's why I'm celebrating.
Everybody's happy.
Don't you think you've had enough?
Of course not! It's just rice.
A little old rice never hurt anybody.
In China they live on rice.
Why don't you get some sleep?
What for? Complete waste of time.
Old Effie mustn't waste time.
Old Effie's a machine.
You didn't think I knew you thought
I was a machine, did you?
A little rice?
Uh, no, thank you.
Sure, click, click, push, pull, that's Effie.
You know, that isn't even my right name.
Do you want to know what my right name is?
Priscilla. Priscilla Effington.
I know.
Priscilla.
Isn't that a pretty name.
Say it.
Priscilla.
You want to know something?
Priscilla twisted the khan around her little finger.
Oh, hmm...
Oh, yes, thank you.
You want to know how?
It's a secret, but I'll tell you.
Shoot.
I can be a woman, too.
I know...
See?
Oh, no, a woman's work is never done.
Gotta wash him, dress him, feed him, and burp him.
Oh, now, stop it.
No, I'm just warming up.
Don't you think it's time to go to bed?
The night is filled with muted sounds.
The air is still, but in the hush the whispers of a thousand lovers... you and I together here to dream a thousand wonders the night is still, we kiss... and in my heart a thousand thunders
Thanksgiving, three years ago.
That was the night that we met at that silly State dinner.
It wasn't silly. Not until you got up to make a speech and started reciting poetry.
I couldn't help it. I couldn't take my eyes off you.
You mean my hat.
I love your hats.
You were wearing a sweet kind of airplane hat... with gumdrops hanging down.
Oh, darling...
Oh, you better get some sleep.
You should be rested for your broukha tomorrow.
Priscilla...
And don't call me Priscilla.
Tarji!
Clem not love Tarji.
Clem love my friend, Effie.
Well, uh... Tarji, you mustn't blame her.
It's all over between Effie and me, but uh...
Well, you see... once upon a time...
Bedtime story?
Yeah... yeah.
Bedtime story.
My friend Effie make you very happy.
You know, I didn't plan it this way, I just...
I not have to marry you now.
I free!
I beg your pardon?
Effie teach me. Woman not have to obey man she does not love.
You're amazing, Tarji!
Well, all right. Now go and tell your father right away.
Wait. I tell him I free woman.
I tell him I no love Clem.
You forget our wedding is in the morning.
You come to wedding tomorrow, I not arrive.
I jilt you.
You will? That's perfect.
I don't know how to thank you, Tarji.
I very happy. You be my friend.
Oh, indeed I will, always.
You're going to make someone a very lucky man.
Then, uh, I'll see you at the wedding.
I mean, I won't see you at the wedding.
Goodbye, dear, dear Tarji.
Or rather, badibani.
Badibani.
Right!
Father, welcome to America.
I must talk to you right away.
I have so much to tell...
Any minute now you're gonna be the happiest man in the world.
You don't know how right you are.
What have you got to be so happy about?
You're getting married.
Sure you feel all right?
Never felt better in my life.
I wonder what's keeping Effie.
Effie?
I mean Tarji.
Oh, there's a girl in a million.
She's gonna make some man a wonderful wife.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, hello, Mac! Any terrible news?
Huh?
I mean, what's new?
Nothing. What's new with you?
Nothing.
That's interesting.
We must have another nice chat  sometime, huh?
You know, there's nothing like a wedding.
I wonder why bridegrooms are always supposed to be so nervous.
What is there to be nervous about?
The ceremony...
Oh, Effie... Priscilla.
Effie.
I've got to see you. What are you doing tonight?
No wonder I'm the happiest man in the world.
Clem, whatever it is you're taking, don't take any more.
Oh, you should have seen Tarji last night.
She was magnificent.
There was fire in her eyes when she...
Tarji!
Who did you expect?
What is she doing here?
Maybe she came to get married.
No, no, she promised.
My son.
No, I'm not, sir. I mean...
The ceremony can start immediately.
I have long looked forward to this happy day.
Your Excellency will be pleased to know that the Bukistanian ceremony will come first... then the American ceremony, and then we can sign the agreement.
We are pleased.
But, sir, didn't Tarji tell you?
Tell me what?
Here we go. I know how anxious you must be.
No, Tarji!
Come on!
No, I tell you, I won't go through with this.
It never fails, they all go the same way.
I tell you, I love her!
That's why you're here!
Come on, everybody's watching.
Double crosser! Coward!
I thought you were a free woman.
What about Amelia Bloomer?
Doesn't she mean anything to you?
Well, what can you expect from a woman?
You're weak, helpless and nothing but trouble.
And that goes for all of you.
Harriet Beecher Stowe.
She wrote about slaves didn't she?
Well, it sure take one to know one.
She great woman. She write Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Susan B. Anthony.
Susan B, Anthony fight for women's vote.
And that not all. Carrie Country.
Carrie Nation!
Carrie Nation.
Silence!
I will not silence! I free woman!
I not love Clem.
She jilted me! She jilted me!
Do not worry, my son, she will marry you.
I'm not worth bothering about, I...
What have you done now, what's wrong?
Nothing's wrong. The wedding's off.
You do not wish to marry my daughter?
Of course he does.
It's just a little nervous breakdown, Your Excellency.
You keep out of this.
In Bukistan we do not use our women for political tricks.
Come.
What about the oil agreement?
It will be as you say.
It will be signed after the wedding.
And there will be no wedding.
Well spoken, Your Excellency.
You are wise not to be deceived by this man.
And you should be proud that your daughter has inherited your wisdom.
You are using psychology.
No, Your Excellency, truth.
The daughter of the Khan is not merchandise to be sent on approval to a man with the judgment of a camel.
That is truth.
Oh, absolutely.
I know how easy it is to be deceived by this man.
I myself was engaged to him.
You?
I admit it. With shame.
He would have made the princess as unhappy as he made me.
He was unsatisfactory.
Completely. He was conceited, and selfish and unbearable.
Surely the Khan will not allow a man like this to stand in the way... of signing an oil agreement that will benefit your country.
That is true. You are a remarkable woman,
Miss Effington.
He will not stand in the way.
I knew you would understand.
I do.
You must love him very much.
What was that again?
Clem, I've got so much to tell you.
You mean you've forgotten something?
I'm a selfish monster, I'm foolish, arrogant...
In other words, you're just an average man.
Oh, Clem, make an earthquake for me.
It's just an expression she uses.
Don't talk like that. They'll get the wrong idea.
Come here. I owe you a bloukha.
Subtitles: Luís Filipe Bernardes
I was born in Berlin, Germany.
My father and mother had a fur business in Germany.
And I have a brother who was a year younger.
We lived very comfortable, had a nice life in Germany.
I remembered that huge, beautiful building... with gardens all around and a stream going through it.
I lived there with my grandmother.
I went to a Jewish school- a private school.
Had a nice girlfriend there,
Anna-Marie... whom I was very friendly with, and we spent a lot of time together.
My sister went to another school.
She was older.
I had my dolls.
My mother made clothes for my dolls.
My father was a peddler in Germany which meant basically... he would go to a place and buy textiles... cut in three-yard length.
Then he’d go into villages and sell them door-to-door.
Usually when my father would return, if it was a successful trip... he brought back toys from the various villages, and that was exciting.
We used to go to the suburbs of Breslau on picnics.
In the winter we went to Czechoslovakia... to a place called Spindleruv Mlyn... where my parents went skiing and I went sleigh riding.
Jews in Germany felt at home and felt it was their vaterland... where they could live forever, and they felt at home with German culture.
They felt proud of
Germany's achievement... and of Jewish contributions to Germany.
While on the one hand German Jews- especially when Hitler rose- started writing a spate of books called Jewish Contributions to Germany...
Jewish Contributions to Civilizations- were not aware of the fact that the
Germans looked at it quite differently.
Instead of saying, look how much we contributed to law... to journalism- created a whole new genre- to medicine and science... the Germans said,
"You took over our science.
You took over our law.
You took over the newspapers. "
In 1933, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party rose to power in Germany.
They immediately acted on their ideology of racial discrimination and violence.
I came home from school... and the Nazi party was marching on the street... and everybody's standing on the side and saluting.
Suddenly they said-
That means "Hit the Jews. " They grabbed a few people and started beating them.
They were yelling,
"We are no Jews. We are no Jews. "
They kept on beating them for the cameras that were set up.
Till one day, in the usual ice cream parlor... we couldn't go in anymore... and we were just beginning to learn how to read.
That's when the signs came up all over.
"No Jews, no dogs" in the stores.
"No Jews, no dogs" on the benches.
Couldn't quite understand what this was all about... but I remember my grandmother taking us by the hand and says, "Haroldchen. "
That's how she used to call me.
"We can't go in here anymore.
We'll get ice cream some other place. "
Yeah, this "Jews and dogs forbidden" was all over.
I had non-Jewish boys to play with... and then sometime-
I don't remember what year it was- none of my non-Jewish friends... would play with me, talk to me- just disregard me.
My next memory actually was of our doorbell ringing at midnight.
I imagine it was shortly thereafter.
My parents wondering who's ringing the doorbell at midnight.
It was my uncle, my mother's brother.
He says, "I've got my chauffeur waiting downstairs.
I'm on my way to France via Switzerland... because it's the end for the Jews in Germany.
I think you should come with us. "
He had always been a bit of an eccentric, this particular brother... so, when my father heard it, he says,
"The meshuggener Leo.
What a crazy idea he has.
This madman's not gonna last. Things like that have happened before to the Jews.
Impossible. Besides,
I fought in the First World War... and we've been German for generations.
We've lived here.
Let's wait and see. "
In July, 1938...
President Roosevelt convened the Évian Conference... to try and solve the refugee problem in Germany.
But the conference ended with no solutions.
The refugees had nowhere to go.
Every country was told at the Évian Conference... that they do not have to take more than their usual quota.
Britain won out in that Palestine was not mentioned as a haven.
Goebbels writes in his diary...
"They are shedding crocodile tears.
They want us to do their job for them... and they really don't want the Jews as much as we don't. "
So the Évian Conference showed Hitler... that the world didn't give a damn.
In 1938, a young Jewish man... enraged at the treatment of his parents by the Nazis... shot and killed a German diplomat in Paris.
The Nazis used the incident as a pretext to orchestrate violent riots against Jews.
Thousands of shops were looted and destroyed... and virtually all synagogues in Germany were burned.
Ninety-one Jews died, hundreds wounded.
The police were told not to interfere.
This night was called Kristallnacht.
"The Night of the Shattered Glass. "
When the ninth of November came along... and the Nazis wanted to get into our house... the Hausmeister, who was a big Communist before 1933-
After 1933, of course, he became a big Nazi.
He was standing in front of the building in his uniform... and saying, "There are no Jews in this building. Keep on going. "
That saved us at that time.
My father put on the radio, and all he heard was martial music.
He went out.
He wasn’t sure.
He didn't like to see what was happening.
He decided to go into hiding.
When we got out the next few days...
I saw the glass... and the burning synagogues and all that.
We walked over to my grandmother's house to see if they were all right.
I remember the crunching glass under my feet.
Even now, more than 60 years later,
I can still remember it.
The day after Kristallnacht, my parents and I walked out of our house... and the grocery store near us, which was owned by a Jewish family-
The windows were shattered and had "Dirty Jew" on it.
Then we walked to the synagogue which we attended... and as we walked by we saw in the courtyard of the synagogue... there was a mound of ashes.
It was clear that these were prayer books.
Sticking out of the center of the mound were the scrolls of the Torah.
I remember being terrified by that... because I had just learned... that if the Torah was dropped in the synagogue, even by accident... the whole congregation would have to fast for 40 days.
And here I saw the Torah is being burned.
Internally I said to myself...
"There's no safety for us anywhere. "
All of a sudden... almost all Germans sought a way out.
"Where can we go?
Where can we find a haven?
Where can we get out?"
Of course, the lines on all the embassies and consulates... were blocks long with the attempts to find a haven.
The American consulate closed their doors... and no visas were ever given out again.
You couldn't get into America.
You couldn't get to England.
You couldn't get to any of these places because we had no passports, no visas.
The quota numbers were very small.
Among non-Jewish people that lived in our house... one of the men was a very high officer in the German air force... who warned my father not to stay in Europe.
He says, "We are going to conquer all of Europe. "
My father fortunately felt the same way.
He was a peddler... and arranged with 11 other people... to pay someone to get him across the border to Belgium.
They did make it across the border... and they were picked up by the Belgian authorities... who turned them back to the Gestapo who turned them over to Dachau.
One of the ways in which the Austrian Jews were encouraged to leave... was to arrest the men... and incarcerate them... in concentration camps... and then saying, "The only way you're going to get your men back-"
To these women who were left behind, the families that were left behind.
"The only way you can get them is if you leave within a month...
24 hours, two weeks, two months," or whatever they decided.
My father decided to come out of hiding.
It seems the Christian landlord told him, "Don't. "
He went to the friend's house to pick me up.
It so happened the Gestapo was in the same house.
He got picked up, and he was sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp.
I was picked up on the street... taken with all other Jews to Sachsenhausen.
We were standing there, and the command came out...
"Anybody below 14 and over 80, step forward. "
So, I was 13.
I stepped forward.
They put us on a truck, and they sent us back home.
I spent one day.
So, all of a sudden, there developed- first in Vienna- a haven that nobody dreamed of before.
There's a place you can go to without a visa, without papers.
It was extraordinary.
How could there be such a thing?
It was hard to imagine.
Where are you going?
8,000 miles away.
Shanghai... a sprawling port city on the east coast of China... was forced by the British to trade with the West... after the Opium Wars of the 1840s.
Powerful and decadent... tremendously wealthy and miserably squalid... voracious and corrupt... it became the commercial center of China.
To sustain their booming trade... the West created a section of the city where Western law ruled.
It was called the International Settlement.
Later on, the French created their own settlement called the French Concession.
The International Settlement... had grown up, since mid-19th century... outside of the walled town of Shanghai.
Shanghai was a town with walls around it... and the International Settlement grew up outside of it.
They built up those ports.
They built up all of them- not only Shanghai, but that was the biggest one- into a major world harbor... where the settlement created a tremendous boom.
There were two Jewish communities in Shanghai.
The first group came following the British during the late 19th century.
They were Baghdadi businessmen and their families.
As British subjects, they were able to take part in the booming Shanghai trade.
They were English-speaking.
They did business with the British.
They did very well by doing business with the British.
Some of them were enormously wealthy... like the Kadoorie... the Sassoon... and the Hardoon families.
The second community consisted of Russian Jews... who immigrated to China mostly to escape the Communist revolution in 1917.
Although not as affluent as the Baghdadi Jews... they also had a rich community life.
The Russian Jewish community which existed- the second one- grew up parallel but not identical... or mixed with the Sephardim.
They were separate and unequal.
In 1937.. began the war to attack the Chinese garrisons... in the outskirts of China.
From that time began the Sino-Japanese War.
In the Sino-Japanese War of 1937.. the Japanese conquered large parts of China... including Shanghai.
As it turned out, that was the only avenue of escape-
Shanghai- without papers.
All you needed really was passage on a ship.
What is not widely known, in '38, before the beginning of the war... you could get out of Dachau if you could leave the country.
If he could have left the country... he wouldn't have gotten smuggled into Belgium.
So, he was in Dachau for about 20 days.
During that time my mother found out... that you could go to the Japanese-occupied portion of Shanghai without a visa.
One did not need a visa to come to Shanghai.
But that is wrong.
Because visas were indeed required... in order to purchase a ship ticket.
Passport control, however... after July, 1937... was no longer in Chinese hands.
As a matter of fact, nobody controlled passports... because the foreign powers did not want to control passports... because then the Japanese would have said, "We want to control passports"... and the foreign powers... did not want the Japanese to control passports of foreigners... and therefore nobody controlled passports.
She decided to buy steamship tickets for Shanghai.
How did she have the money?
It wasn't that easy either.
We had money, but the bank accounts were frozen.
However, we were allowed to draw household expenses from our own moneys.
So my mother inflated, as much as she was able to, what she needed... and was very frugal on spending it.
But she did go and get the steamship tickets... for leaving on the Hakozaki Maru... a Japanese steamer... the following February from Naples, Italy.
My father was always very careful with money.
He had money put aside.
Most of that went for... bribing the NYK Line people to give us tickets... because if we hadn't gotten out by the middle of May...
I wouldn't be sitting here today.
I remember my grandfather- It's one of those things that sits in your ear-
You hear it.
He used to say to her, "Fuffchen. "
He called her Fuffchen.
"Where you taking the kid to?"
"To the Chinesin. "
"No, no. Forget it. "
He said, "Yeah.
I'm taking my boy. I'm getting out. "
On my mother's birthday, which was
December 5, 6:00 in the morning... the bell rang... and at that time if you heard a bell ring at any hour... but particularly at an ungodly hour, you might say... it did not sound too good.
I remember all of us huddling in the little hallway... as my mother opened the door, and there was my father.
He had come home from Buchenwald.
With much trepidation, she told my father...
"We're not waiting for a United States visa.
I got tickets to go to Shanghai. "
She expected him to make a big fuss... and all he said was... in today's vernacular...
"If we had left yesterday, it wouldn't be soon enough. "
We left Germany in...
1939 in May.
We said good-bye to my grandparents.
It was chaos.
My mother was screaming.
My aunt was screaming.
They were very volatile.
It was terrible. Awful.
And, you know, the Germans never came out to say good-bye.
They watched from behind the curtains.
We could see them, and they didn't come out.
They knew my mother since she was a little girl.
They didn't come out. They didn't say anything. They were really terrified... and also probably glad to see us leave.
At the train station there was the whole family there.
I see it like you’re sitting in front of me.
I see it like you're sitting in front of me.
Under Anhalter Bahnhofin Berlin.
Everybody.
Everybody. Bruno.
Omi-Sozia, Ada, Mietek.
The cousins-Judith, Margot.
All names today are-
It's a long time ago.
But a lot of people.
A lot of people.
And they're all gone.
I had to say good-bye to Anna-Marie, my girlfriend... and all of that.
I give talks in schools... and I talk about Anna-Marie, especially to the age group that- the nine-year-olds, the 10-year-olds.
I always talk about
Anna-Marie and say...
"If you ever hear about anyone called Anna-Marie Wallenberg... let me know. "
I get letters from them.
One little girl wrote a letter back, and she said...
"Don't worry if you don't find Anna-Marie.
When you go to heaven, you'll find her there. "
When the train reached the Italian border... and the Gestapo came on board the train... and my mother telling me...
"I want you to be very quiet.
Don't say a word.
Don't look up. Don't move.
Don't ask for anything.
Just sit. "
Funny how kids sometimes know that it's really serious business.
I was eight years old, and I did just that.
So I remember the Gestapo coming aboard the train to check papers... but I didn't see faces
'cause I was looking down.
My mother told me not to look up.
All I saw was black boots marching back and forth... and them saying "Papiere, " you know, "papers. "
The passports and whatever else was needed- the permission.
They went through the whole train... and after they got it from everybody, they left the train... and the train started again and crossed the border into Italy.
Everybody cheering and clapping.
They had champagne corks popping.
We were out of Germany.
Shanghai became a real option... for those Jews who had no place to go.
They scrambled to buy all the luxury ship tickets... to go to Shanghai... because that was the only way you can go at that point.
Got on the ship.
That was the Kashima Maru.
It was weird because it looked like a pleasure cruise... with the streamers and the music- the orchestra- a Japanese real snappy orchestra.
We thought we were on holiday, my sister and me.
I was nine, and she was 11.
So we had fun. We had a stewardess who was assigned to take care of us... and they gave us little cakes and little dolls.
We had tea parties.
We took a ship in Naples- a Japanese ship by the name of Hakusan Maru.
It was a beautiful four-week trip.
Long, beautiful trip.
I enjoyed every moment of it.
I didn't realize really what was going on in the world. We were too young for that.
My mother bought first-class passage.
So we had a relatively luxurious cabin... and there was more food than anyone could ever eat.
I remember vividly throughout the trip... my mother kept saying
I should eat everything in sight.
At that time we were kosher.
We basically ate the fruits... and the vegetables and much of the pastry.
In Port Said, the ship actually anchored... and I remember those sand dunes on both sides.
They later told us that a few young Jews-
German Jews, Polish Jews- jumped the ship... and actually tried to make their way to Palestine.
What's Israel today.
I don't know.
There was a recurrent theme.
She was saying, "Eat, eat, eat"... because who knows what will happen when we get to Shanghai.
Got off the ship in Shanghai... if I remember correctly... that was the shock of a lifetime.
It was completely different from anything you could imagine.
Absolutely different.
Nothing could prepare you for what we saw there.
I actually remember feeling very, very afraid.
I didn't know where I was.
I t was a whole different world... in overnight from white to black or from black to white.
In 1937, what was conquered was not the International Settlement... not the French Concession... but the Chinese portion of the town.
The Japanese did not want to establish a concession of their own... but they took a piece of the International Settlement... and that they said is under our military control.
And that is Hongko.
Hongko- or Hongke was some called it- was one of the poorest sections of Shanghai.
Badly battered in the war with the Japanese... it was home to poor Chinese... occupying Japanese and many Jewish refugees... who had little means to support themselves.
We landed in Hongkew, which is the place where all the ships landed- particularly the refugee ships.
It was very dirty.
It was terribly hot and very humid.
The heat is terrible there.
And crowded and smelly.
Thousands of people running around.
Chinese beggars with open sores.
It was just awful.
Shanghai was not prepared for this kind of an influx- for these waves and waves... shiploads- shipload after shipload.
One of my father's friends who had gone there before us... had rented us a room... in one of the little lanes that they have in Hongkew.
The room was fairly clean... but it was just one small room for our family... another small one for my uncle and my aunt.
No kitchen facilities. very poor bathroom situation.
No what they called WC's over there- water closet.
No flush toilets.
Buckets.
The first home was also on Wayside Road.
Further down on Wayside Road in a lane in an alley.
All of Shanghai was alleys and lanes.
Cars don't go through there. Bicycles.
With a wagon you can pull through there.
Very narrow, very crowded, very tight.
Not too much air.
Not too much light.
That's how people lived in those days.
So, a major problem arose already in December at the very beginning:
How to support these people, how to house these people... how to feed these people of already hundreds upon hundreds.
The Jewish Baghdadi families stepped in to help.
They established soup kitchens and temporary shelters called homes... or Hei me in German.
We were picked up by the Jewish Committee on trucks... and they took us to a camp... which was a converted school and a Kinchow camp.
The camp was normal. We had a little breakfast, a little lunch and no dinner.
We had to fend for ourselves.
We had a little money.
The first one to create what you call the international committee- or I CU- was the COMA Committee... which was subsidized by Sassoon. victor Sassoon said... that it was the cheapest place in the world to support a refugee.
For five American cents you could support a refugee.
But as more refugees were arriving daily, more help was needed.
The JDC- the Joint Distribution
Committee- took action.
It was an overseeing organization of Jewish-American communities... uniting their philanthropic efforts.
The JDC was the main source of hope and help for the refugees.
It financed the temporary shelters... the soup kitchens and the makeshift hospital.
Later, Laura Margolis, an American professional social worker... became the JDC's head official in Shanghai.
Under her effective management... the JDC was able to sustain close to 10,000 refugees... who had no means to support themselves.
One morning... the phone rang.
The boss at that time was Mo Levitt.
Moses Levitt.
He said, "Laura, how you doin'?"
Although "How you doin'?" was not an expression in those years.
But he said, "How are you?"
I said, "Fine. "
"Busy?"
"Yeah, we’re very busy here. "
He said,
"How would you like to go to China?"
I have to laugh when I think of it.
I said, "Where in China?"
"Shanghai. "
I said, "Sure. I'd like to go. "
I had no idea what he was talking about.
She came in May, 1941.
She was a professional social worker... who had worked in Cuba before that.
I found a news clipping in the Joint archives... describing "Laura Margolis from Cuba... is coming to straighten out the mess in Shanghai. "
Because you had the local relief organizations... by volunteers.
Laura Margolis, a highly intelligent woman... sent back weekly- sometimes even daily reports... describing precisely the situation as she saw it.
The relief organizations and how poorly they're managing... and the refugee problem and so on and so forth.
Now came the Polish Jews... and the Lithuanian Jews and the religious Jews and the yeshivot.
They wanted to be taken care of separately... because they were intellectuals... and they had to have their prayer books... and they had to have kosher food... and chicken on Friday.
It was very, very difficult.
Very difficult.
Yet again, the Jewish communities did try to accommodate them... did respond.
"These are religious people.
They need to be treated differently. "
So we went to the camp kitchens... for our first meals like everybody else did.
They had set up these homes- Heime- which didn't look much like Heim- or a home- for people who had no place to go.
They had kitchens, and they had a hospital.
Fortunately, we didn't have to live there.
That was even worse than living in the room- much worse.
It was kind of odd to see people there.
They all had these new German clothes they had bought before they left... if they had enough money left.
They were all decked out.
The men usually with hats and suits.
In that heat.
The women with nice suits and heels and all that... with a tin plate in their hand, waiting for food from the communal kitchen.
The summers would get so hot... that today you use a heat index or humidity index.
Under those conditions, the temperature could go up as much- measured that way-
140 in the shade.
The sanitary conditions were about the worst in the world that you can think of.
Every disease- known or unknown to man- was rampant in epidemic proportions.
Non-flushable toilet.
A Chinese woman would come every morning... pick that huge pot up... take it down the stairs and dump it into a wagon in the street.
So the street usually smelled not like Chanel Number 5.
You could not drink the water.
In Shanghai, at the time, you could not drink.
You drank water, guaranteed to get sick.
The older generation.
But when you were young, you do things.
I remember distinctly the first time
I drank the water from the tap.
You had to boil the water.
Eventually we were able- most of the younger people- to drink the water from the tap.
There was a way to do the rice that I remembered... and I usually tell that to people- how my mother used to put it out on the windowsill.
We had these wide windowsills.
If you left it sitting there for four or five minutes... the bugs would come crawling out.
My sister and I would count who had the most.
In summertime... the river would overflow on a regular basis.
Everyday, at certain hours, the streets were flooded.
You'd have swimming in there.
You name it, and it was swimming in there.
Most of the refugees came almost penniless to Shanghai.
The German government had confiscated most of their assets.
Many sold whatever salable items they had- clothes and furniture... which they brought from Europe in large crates called "lifts. "
The refugees now scrambled to find jobs in Shanghai to sustain themselves... although they did not know for how long.
My father had studied to be a typewriter mechanic before leaving Germany.
Also with the proceeds of what my mother sold... we established a typewriter business in the British foreign settlement... hiring a Chinese mechanic.
My mother stayed home.
She and my aunt knitted.
They opened up the old sweaters and the old shawls... and knitted for sale to make a little money.
My father and my uncle went to look for jobs in the city of Shanghai... with Chinese companies.
My father got a job with a chemical company... knowing absolutely nothing- not a shred of knowledge about chemicals.
But he learned.
He used to study every night.
She supported her husband and myself... with making hats.
She was an excellent hat maker.
Since the climate was cold, people wore hats.
The hope was always... create a temporary refuge so they can get to America... or elsewhere in the western hemisphere-
Canada, South America.
Nobody expected Shanghai to be a refuge for 10 years.
It was unintended to be more than anything temporary.
As bad as were offin Shanghai... we were still better off than most of the Chinese around us.
The Chinese were very poor, very hardworking... and were under direct oppression of the Japanese.
The poorer Chinese people... lived even... a poorer life than the Jewish refugees, it seemed.
The relief organization helped the refugees- the Jewish refugees- according to their standard.
The Chinese had this coexistence with the refugees- a sort of benign tolerance.
They had their own problems.
They kind of accepted us in their midst there.
I never once saw a sign of anti-Semitism... or disgust or criticism.
I never saw it at all.
The lot of the Chinese people was a very hard one to watch... beginning with the coolies- these poor guys who were carrying all daylong... and then the rickshaws.
A human being lugging a little wagon with two wheels... and rich people and running with them through the streets for hours and days... with the veins popping out of their legs.
It's inhuman.
The wintertime, there was no heating... and some just froze to death.
Then you'd see in the streets in the morning... little packages wrapped up where the children passed away... and they wrapped them up in a little straw mattress... and when the garbage truck came, they just picked them up.
Children play with other children.
It doesn't matter whether-
My sister writes in her diary...
"I gave the little Chinese girl next door a piece of white bread. "
Big deal, you know.
That's the way this worked.
Herfather gave me a pencil.
That's how these things evolved.
They didn't make lifelong friendships out of this... but they coexisted quite well.
So there was never-
We were lucky with that. After all, we were sitting on their territory...
20,000 of us pushing20,000 of them out... because they were already there... and overflowing, living really in poverty, many of them.
Because that was the poor section of town.
On the one hand, the white and the Chinese were simply two different worlds. very few understood Chinese or spoke Chinese.
What refugees had a lot to do with Chinese was in pidgin English.
They bought from them.
They bought the cheapest- the last bit of vegetables... and what was left in the stands when nobody else would buy... when they couldn't afford anything else.
Sometimes the Chinese were very good to the refugees.
They gave them credit, or they let them buy on credit.
There was this very sweet Chinese man... who came with his bamboo stick with two little baskets hanging on each side... and became a real friendship with my mother.
Used to come by-
I don't know about everyday- but very often- a good few times a week.
Then he'd be downstairs-
We lived on the second floor- and he used to call, "Ufi. Ufi, " and then my mother went down.
He had some vegetables... or fish and some chicken.
He always had something that she bought from him.
"Ufi. " She was his best customer.
In Shanghai... there was a Russian newspaper... for the Russian community.
And in this paper there was a Yiddish page.
In that Yiddish page... they recorded their reaction to Shanghai.
It is the most beautiful, heartwarming poetry that I've read.
I mean, it is just-
It's not self-pitying.
Some of the poems are sort of reaching out to the Chinese population.
Like, "Oh, my God.
This is terrible what is happening to you. "
This kind of sympathetic response.
So it comes straight from the heart.
Instead of saying, "Oy, poor me. "
You know,
" Gevalt! Who did this to me?"
They're saying,
"Oh, no. You poor Chinese. "
The utmost influence... the Jews asserted... on the Shanghai Chinese society... was on music and on medicine.
The Chinese themselves, many of them felt also sympathy for the Jews.
They're both being oppressed by the Japanese.
The Chinese worse. When the Chinese crossed a bridge they had to bow down... and Japanese sometimes stick 'em with a burning cigarette... or jab them.
But the Chinese got the better part of it.
They turned around and smiled.
And that killed the Japanese.
In other words, their smile-
In other words, they withstood the torture and the embarrassment... and said you-know-what to them in that language.
That hurt the Japanese more than anything else.
Every Chinese hated the Japanese very much.
Theykilled300,000people... when they occupied Nanjing.
I saw once... a Chinese stealing a canister of kerosene... and he was caught.
Right on the spot the Japanese tied up his hands... and chopped them off.
And that's it.
I couldn’t watch.
I ran away.
But in my opinion, man could never survive.
Although passport control was not in anyone's hands after 1937... the Japanese controlled the Shanghai harbor.
In spite of their alliance with Germany... they let the Jewish refugees into Shanghai.
I t is quite clear that they do not wish to antagonize American Jews.
They do not wish to antagonize world Jewry... because this stereotype of the Jew, which is still alive today in Japan... was very much alive then.
Jews are rich,
Jews have power...
Jews control governments.
Jews are compared to a blowfish or fugu.
If the skilled chef... can know how to cut the little poisonous sac out of the fish, it's a delicacy.
If not, it's a poisonous thing.
If we have such a great power like the Jews... we have to know how to utilize them on behalf of Japan.
Japanese had to be very careful... about being prejudiced against Jews... because they had complained... about German prejudice against Asians.
So, it was the Japanese,
Hitler's Axis partner... that determined, based on their concept of what the Jew was in the world- on their control of the West... and Western Jews being synonymous in their ideas- they thought, "If we are good to the Jews in East Asia, they will be good to us. "
Meanwhile, war was raging in Europe.
In September, 1939,
Germany invaded Poland.
In 1940, Denmark.
Then the Netherlands, Belgium... then France.
It seemed like
Hitler was unstoppable.
The beginning looked like total devastation- we don't have a chance.
The Germans were running across Europe... and the Japanese were storming all across Asia.
Till things started turning around, we didn't really know. It looked hopeless.
We got once a postcard from my grandfather.
We tried in Shanghai... to get some of my mother's family out... or my father's, but it was too late.
You had to go via Siberia, and as I said to you... the war was on already, and you could not come anymore.
My other uncle, though-
Leo who had gone to Paris- when he saw that it wasn't that great in France... he wrote my mother he’d like to come to Shanghai.
My mother immediately got things moving.
The European part of HIAS was called HICEM. H-I-C-E-M.
She went to the HICEM... in Shanghai... and sent papers.
At that particular time... you needed- it wasn't really sponsors... but you needed somebody to write a letter to say you wanted somebody to come.
It was very easy.
It was a semiofficial kind of thing.
There was no problem.
We did the same thing.
The HICEM took care of it.
And we got another letter from my uncle... that he was now interned at Septfonds.
"Please get me out as quickly as you can. "
My mother couldn't understand.
Why didn't he get the papers?
She went to the HICEM, and he assured her the papers were sent.
Well, nothing happened, and finally my mother got very upset... and she went back to the HICEM, and she says...
"You know, it doesn't take that long for papers to get to Europe.
Something must have happened. "
The man said, "No. We sent them. "
"I want the receipt... because you said you sent them registered mail.
I want the receipt that you sent them. "
They weren’t very nice to her, but she wouldn’t leave the office.
Finally he took out his file... and the way she said, his face blanched.
She said, "What's the matter?"
He said, "The papers were never sent.
They're in this file. "
So, my mother says...
"I'm gonna take the papers, and I will send them. "
She took the papers, 'cause they had to go to the HICEM in Marseille... and they he could have gotten on a ship.
She took the papers... and she immediately sent them out, registered mail.
They got to the HICEM in Marseille the day France fell.
They never reached my uncle.
To the day she died... my mother said, "Leo's gonna think his sister deserted him... that his sister didn't want him to come. "
She always spoke about that- how she sent him these papers.
They were overworked,
I guess- the HICEM.
She always says, "Why didn't I ask to see the file earlier? Why, why?"
Because he could have come.
There were various schools available in Shanghai... including French and British schools.
There was also the Kadoorie school in Hongkew.
It was built and financed by the Kadoorie and Sassoon families for the refugees... and was staffed by refugee teachers.
There was also an existing school: the Shanghai Jewish School... which was administered by these two families... the Sassoon and Kadoories.
It was a private school.
You had to pay tuition
If you could not pay tuition, you went for free.
It was a school run under the British school system.
The curriculum was made up in Cambridge, England... was sent to Shanghai, meticulously followed.
Examination papers were sent back to Cambridge for marking... and then returned to Shanghai.
There were kosher lunches... and there was a big, beautiful Sephardic synagogue, still in existence today... on the grounds of the Shanghai Jewish School.
Had a very, very lovely
English lady... in our Shanghai Jewish School-
Mrs. Beresford- who every weekend... would take from her class... one kid to her house.
I remember I was there twice.
Her son was a boy named Maxwell Beresford.
That was in downtown Shanghai.
They were beautiful- beautiful woman, beautiful people- and for two days you lived again in a different world.
When we kids had nothing to do... in the afternoon, after school... we got active and we had athletic competitions.
We had a soccer league, where we played soccer every weekend.
There also was a small boxing club... because there were some Jews from Germany-
Some of them were champion of Germany.
They had a little time on their hands... and they started to teach us to be boxers.
We had a very good boxing league.
I was pretty good.
I was very good at boxing.
I had a very strong right.
I won most of my fights by knockout.
Now as a man of72 years old... it doesn't look the same and it doesn't feel the same... but I was very strong and I was very good.
So were others in our group.
They were really good.
We had good trainers and we trained very hard.
We took enormous pride to win.
All of us wore the Magen David, which was important.
When you're always on the bottom, and everybody spits and laughs at you... you are finally on even keel-
It was important.
Here you have a community... that despite these disadvantages that I mentioned to you... created a viable cultural life... that would have done justice to a city of 100,000.
Newspapers, dailies, weeklies, monthlies-
An incredible array of newspapers.
Of course one person bought it... then gave it out to 10 other people to read.
These were read and read and reread until they were torn.
From Vienna, the sausages and bakery and other things-
The café house, which was a standard in Vienna and Germany... they brought to Shanghai.
Architects created a whole new area... where the bombed-out part of Hongkew had been rebuilt... to create apartments, rooms for refugees.
They created a theater, and this included a German theater and a Yiddish theater.
They had cabaret evenings in these little restaurants... that were fabulous.
We would go there-
Once in a great while my father would come out... with enough money for us to go to one of these places.
We would go there, and we'd listen to them sing and make jokes.
People like Herbert Zernik and Raya Zomina- she sang in Yiddish.
These two were so funny, and they were so good.
There was a lot of that going on.
You have this attempt... to bring some kind of cultural life.
It's not only the café houses.
It's not only recreating Little Vienna or Little Berlin... as some people have written.
It is much more.
Several newspapers-
The Gelb Reports, Shanghai Chronicle-
Many more that stopped and started.
Even books.
Poetry. People were writing wonderful poetry in German... not only in Yiddish.
It is that kind of thing which I think is moving.
Among the squalor, the poverty, the hunger... and this feeling of,
"What's going to be with us?
Where will all this end?
Will it ever end?"... there still is the human spirit reasserting itself.
The Jewish refugees built... an almost self-sufficient, beautiful society.
There's sports clubs, there's soccer clubs... there are recreation clubs, there are boxers.
It's an amazing story.
My father had come out of Buchenwald... where his war wound had acted up and had not been treated.
He got sick, then he got well, then he got sick.
He got checkups.
They didn't know what it was.
They pulled his teeth, they thought it was that.
He kept getting fevers, and it was called "Shanghai Fever. "
But he functioned and ran the business with a Chinese mechanic.
My mother went knocking on doors getting customers.
She did the bookkeeping, she did the correspondence and appointments.
My father did the repairs together with a Chinese mechanic.
Then he got sick again... and he died, just like that.
He was 43years old.
They were never sure what it was... but they presume it was some kind of a parasite... that he harbored from Buchenwald.
When he fought in the First World War... he was at the Battle of Verdun in France... which was a very big, important battle.
I think it was in 1916.
He was born in 1897... so he was about 19 years old.
He was a kid, really.
As he was standing with his gun... he sees a young French soldier... on the other side of him, opposite him.
That's the enemy... so naturally you shoot your enemy or he's gonna shoot you.
My father tells the story.
He sees this French soldier... and he raises his gun to shoot him.
At the same moment that he's shooting the soldier... the soldier shoots him.
And as my father fell-
He had a stomach wound, lying there- he heard the young French soldier say, "Shema Israel. "
That always affected him.
He killed a Jew.
All of a sudden, he wasn’t a German soldier killing a French soldier... it was a Jew killing a Jew.
It affected him all his life.
It must have, because he always told that story... and then my mother repeated it.
Although the situation in Shanghai was bad... it was far better than Europe, where war was still raging.
The refugees felt relatively safe in Shanghai under Japanese occupation.
That was about to change.
In December, 1941...
Japan attacked the American naval base at Pearl Harbor.
The United States entered the war.
Pearl Harbor was not only a major shock... which verified to some that the Gestapo had a long arm... and it reached out to the Far East.
It was a double shock.
Here they thought, "We have difficulties, but we're out of danger from Germany. "
All of a sudden, with Pearl Harbor they find Germany and Japan are allies... and Germans again are involved in their affairs.
We got very frightened.
With America at war, we're not going to get out of Shanghai.
Looked out the window... and all the ships in the harbor were burning.
Japanese had come across the bridge... marched into our hotel, occupied the hotel.
We were at war.
The Japanese quickly took over the International Settlement.
The British and the Americans were now enemies of Japan... and were regarded as prisoners of war.
The Japanese imprisoned them... in internment camps at the outskirts of Shanghai.
That group included the Baghdadi Jews who were also British subjects.
The Sephardic community, which had been helping the refugees... was no longer in the elite position that they were before.
They themselves were reduced... as to how much money they could take out of the bank.
Most of their money was confiscated.
Within three quarters of a year or so- certainly by the end of the year- all the enemy aliens- meaning American, British and Dutch nationals- were interned.
I remember when they locked all the British up.
A few of our guys- I was with them- knew where the camp was.
Long way to walk, the way I remember it today.
We gathered whatever we could steal- some cans, some this, some that.
We walked for kilometers, the way I remember it.
We brought them some. They were all locked up in the British camp.
We paid back.
With America at war with Japan... all lines of communication between
Shanghai and the US were suddenly cut.
Laura Margolis was cut off... without money coming from America to support the soup kitchens... the local shelters and the makeshift hospital.
Foreseeing such a problem, she had already obtained permission from the JDC... to borrow money from local businessmen... who were confident that they would be repaid by the JDC... at the end of the war, as indeed they were.
But without the Japanese approving the operation... everything could fall apart... leaving thousands of refugees with no means to support themselves.
So I phoned up Captain I nuzuka.
He remembered me... because we had been to social affairs together... and received me very nicely.
Made the tea ceremony, very nice, very cordial.
Then we got to the nitty-gritty of what I came for.
It's true that I'm an enemy alien.
I don't know what’s going to happen with me next.
But for the foreseeable future, apparently I'm free.
I would be able to take over the whole operation in Shanghai... and keep feeding the people... if he would give me permission to raise the money.
I said...
"You, as an occupying power... can not afford to have hungry people riot.
You're responsible for them.
On the other hand...
I can help you so they won't riot... if you’ll give me an okay... to raise the money. "
And he did.
The war years were very difficult years... in the sense that there wasn't enough food... and everybody had dysentery.
Having diarrhea was just usual.
Food got to be very difficult in '43, '44, '45.
There wasn't a lot of food.
Lot of people were clearly suffering from malnutrition.
You had a sense-
As a young kid, I remember... the people were shrinking into their clothes.
They looked gaunt and shabby.
Little Chinese boys would be chasing grocery trucks.
They'd have a knife.
They'd cut a hole in the sack.
The noodles would fall into the gutter.
They'd sweep them up, and they would be sold very cheaply.
Then my mother and I would sit around the kerosene lamp... or whatever was available in the way of light... and we’d separate the noodles from the debris.
Debris being broken glass, rusty nails, stones- whatever is swept up from a gutter.
I remember we were sitting on the balcony once-
Werner, my second father, and I-
Tiny little balcony.
My mother was in the streets.
She had just bought bread.
And we saw some young kid came up... grabbed the bread from her arm and started running.
When she came up, she said, "He must have been even hungrier than we are. "
Those were-
There wasn't much of anything.
Since the Baghdadi Jews were imprisoned in internment camps with the British...
Laura Margolis called upon the Russian Jews to help the refugees.
The responsibility for the refugees... fell now on the Russian Jews.
And I would say-
They had no choice, but we accept the responsibility.
But also they did their best.
They cannot be faulted.
After that, they simply had to do whatever was possible.
My parents and quite a few other people... had their kids go to a Catholic school.
Saint Francis Xavier's College-
SFX- which was an all-boys school.
Discipline extremely strict.
If I learned anything at all, that's where I learned it.
It was a Catholic school. All brothers, with the long black gowns.
Religious Catholics from all over the world-
Brother Leo,
Brother Ladislaus from Hungary.
There was one big redhead,
Brother John.
I'll never forget... every morning when we walked into school...
Brother John would give us... a little insight into what the political situation was.
He was very, very anti-Allies.
He was very much pro-German and pro-Japanese.
He was a real nice guy. He was very nice, especially to us Jewish kids... and yet... his actions showed different and the words that came out of his mouth were different.
After the war was over... it came out that Brother John was actually a very high officer in the British army.
He was no brother.
Not a religious man, but set up in there.
Apparently he was one of those... that gave a lot of information of what was going on in Shanghai... as far as the the Japanese army was concerned, to the Allied forces.
The refugee community was very worried what was happening... because after all the enemy aliens of Japan and Germany were interned... what was gonna happen to us?
Knowing that Jews were always first in line... when it came to bad things happening to good people, so to speak... what did they have in store for us?
On February 18, 1943... the Japanese issued a proclamation... ordering all stateless refugees who came to Shanghai after 1937.. to move to a segregated area in Hongkew.
That's when the German influence became much more crucial.
German influence pressured the Japanese into creating a ghetto.
This was the tendency of the Japanese in ruling.
Here this whole puppet-state concept comes into play.
If you have them nice and compact all together... you can watch them and you know what they're doing.
Then what you do is you give them... someone to watch over them.
No direct rule.
That's the puppet government that watches over them.
It's exactly what they did in Shanghai.
It wasn't a real ghetto.
It wasn't a ghetto that we know from Europe. It wasn't that.
It was a different concept.
It was a very Japanese concept.
And yes, all foreigners need to be watched.
The ghetto didn't have any walls around.
It didn't have to... because if you saw a European face in downtown Shanghai... and they were not German or Russian, they had to be one of us... because all the Americans and all the
British were put into internment camps.
So we moved into that ghetto area.
My mother sold a bunch of the possessions we had just to make room.
We had a very tiny room.
There were at the end- three, four, six- ten people in this house.
We lived in a Chinese house owned by a Jew... but there were five families in a ghetto... and we had the attic which was like this.
We were not able to stand straight, only in the middle of the attic.
On the side it went all the way down.
The major problem we had was my brother contracted polio in China... which was a disaster.
Food was scarce.
Eventually we couldn't get out from the ghetto anymore... so I started a job.
I worked in the kitchen.
The school had a kitchen.
We all had to move into one room to 51 Chusan Road... which was right smack in the middle of the ghetto.
They never called it a ghetto.
They called it a segregated area... but it was a ghetto.
I went back there too... and took a look.
Yes.
- We lived upstairs, you know?
- There you go.
Take care.
- Be careful on the steps.
- Take care.
Yes, on the steps.
It all comes back.
It all comes back.
The roof looks the same.
It's amazing how it didn't change.
I can't believe it.
We used to have the rice on this windowsill... and take the bugs out of the rice- my sister and me.
There was another window and we had a little kitchen... where there's now a wall here... with one little stove, two rings of gas.
We never used it because we didn't have enough gas.
And a little sink with cold water running.
We put a curtain across it... so that nobody would come in when we washed ourselves.
Never took a bath during the war, just sponge bath...
'cause the bathroom down the hall was so dirty.
Everything comes back.
We did everything in this room.
We lived here... we slept here, we argued here.
I learned to dance in this room with my father... to the radio.
Voice of America. We tried to get it, but it was forbidden... so we had to be very careful.
My mother always had flowers on the table.
You could buy flowers.
All the time we were wondering what happened in Germany.
We didn't know what was going on... all during the war.
It's just amazing how it all comes back.
To exit the ghetto for jobs or school... the refugees had to get special passes.
The Japanese authorities were represented by two officials;
Akura and Goya.
Goya- They called him "Meshuggener Goya" or "Paranoid Goya"- who had a-
He was really schizophrenic in many ways.
I'm giving you not a professional evaluation.
He could be very good to the children.
He'd give out candies to children.
He loved to play music, even though he was a lousy musician.
He always forced the refugees to play with him.
He liked to be called "King of the Jews. "
He was a short, ugly fellow.
He would stand on the desk and yell at some Jews.
There was one Jew who really caught his psychology.
A brilliant idea.
He saw the kind of person he was.
He had a silk top hat he'd put on.
He gambled.
He'd say, "You're making fun of me?"
He wore a silk hat when he went down the line to get a pass.
He said, "No, I only wear it... when I meet royalty and important people. "
He caught onto the psychology of that person... and he was always put in front of the line.
Anytime he came, he got his pass immediately.
Mr. Goya was a very short, little man... and my stepfather Werner was a very tall man.
He was about 6 foot 2, 6 foot 3.
The little Japanese man didn't like that.
So he pulled out his gloves... and he slapped my father across the face.
He jumped on the table and slapped him across the face... and yelled at him to get out and "no pass. "
I remember
Werner coming home that day... and he was a shattered, broken man.
So now my mother's typewriter business... definitely was down the drain altogether... because many refugees now were not just dying of disease... they were dying of starvation, because there was so little food around.
And what she decided was a ruse.
She wrote to one of her customers in the French Concession, a French lady... and asked her to send a letter... saying that she was still servicing her typewriter.
The lady wrote that letter.
Armed with that letter... she made an application for a special pass with Mr. Goya.
She stood in front of Goya, and Goya said, "You repair typewriters?"
She says, "Yes, I was in business.
My husband died here, but it was his business originally.
I still know how to repair them. "
She got a pass, and armed with that pass... she decided what she was gonna do.
She had no intention of servicing typewriters.
She got a pass to go to the French Concession.
What she did that was not legal... she got off the tram before she got to the French Concession.
She went to the parts of the city... where Westerners did not go, the Chinese parts.
She bought up sundries like sunglasses... nylon stockings, belts, scarves, stuff like that.
She would put them under the toolbox that she carried with her... and bring them back to the ghetto area... and then give them to the peddlers on consignment in the ghetto.
Even though it didn't bring in much money... it brought in just enough... to keep us slightly above the starvation level.
One night when my parents thought I was asleep... they were talking to one another... and my mother said that there were only $17 left.
I had no idea what 17-
It was a fair amount of money... but it was clear that when that was gone... we would be in terrible shape.
We had what they called a "paocha"... so the Japanese didn't have to do it... and we were happy they didn't have to do it.
Everybody was assigned a couple of hours a week... where you got an official armband and a stick... and you were standing and controlling... that the people don't go out without a pass- out of the ghetto without a pass- and that they came in on time.
But as I said to you,
I worked for Russians... and there was a Russian club.
The Jews that had Soviet passports could live outside the ghetto.
They had the radio and everything... and they got movies of the war going on with Germany.
The way to get back into the ghetto after the hour-
What I did is-
The ghetto did not have a wall around it.
This side of the street was the ghetto, the other side was not the ghetto.
So I walked on the other side of the street which was not the ghetto.
There was one street where the police station was.
Just as I came to the police station...
I walked across the street and into the police station.
If anybody would ask,
I'm going in to the police... but then I looked around, said, "I think I'm in the wrong place"... and I walked out again.
This was maybe 10:00 at night.
Anywhere else I walked... they would have caught me going into the ghetto at 10:00.
I was supposed to be home by 6:00.
There was this White Russian boy.
He was good friends with the Japanese kids there.
Whenever he got a hold of me,
I got my daily-
If I couldn't run fast enough,
I got my daily beating.
I remember one time I came home, my mother almost fainted.
A black eye and bleeding, no shirt, one shoe missing-
I took a bad beating.
George was his name.
Family name's not important.
George and his gang, always two or three guys. They get you.
I used to go to bed at night,
I remember that vividly... and I’d say, "Someday, I don't know,
I will get even.
I have to get even.
This can't go on. "
I took a beating maybe three or four times a week.
They'd catch you, you'd get it.
Butter was very valuable, very expensive.
I recall that my parents-
Later on there wasn't any butter, but my parents in '43, '44... would buy half a quarter of butter, two ounces... and they would watch and make sure that I ate it.
I remember once, vividly... walking out where my mother was washing the dishes.
I noticed that she licked the last bit of butter off the plate.
Till we moved into our-
Can't say a flat-
Till we moved into a room of a larger flat... which was shared... by probably four or five families-
11, 12 people all in all.
We had one room in there.
Bathroom facilities, if you can call it that... shared by about 11, 12 people, if I remember correctly.
In that one room, my mother made hats... and that's where we lived and slept and worked.
I can't explain.
I don't think people today... will understand what this is all about unless you see it.
Here we had our windows painted black... and if a little light would shine out... the Japanese would be cursing from the streets.
I don’t want to tell you what they cursed.
I could repeat it if I wanted to.
They used to yell from down there,
Bagero!
If a little light shone out, they'd come smashing the doors in.
So we made sure the windows were all blacked... with shmattes covering so nothing would shine out.
Werner and Fufi would lie under the blanket at night.
They had a tiny little radio- I don't know where they got that one from- and all covered up, they'd listen to the news.
Fufi understood a little Russian... so they used to listen to the news in
Russian- what happened in World War II.
We'd hear from the Soviet Union... that the Russian armies had started turning things around... and pushing the Germans back.
That gave us a little bit of hope- gave us a little bit of hope for the future.
It didn't all seem that bleak in those days.
Otherwise, that's about it.
From here we went to school, here we came home after we got beat up.
This room has a lot of history.
My mother was a very fine lady.
She made big pots of soup with all sorts of things inside... and then she fed another three or four people... who came for lunch on a steady basis.
There was a painter,
Kurt Frankenstein.
There was a Mr. Rouget who in turn taught me Russian for the food he ate.
There was another gentleman whose name I forget right now.
We always had three people... eating the same soup every day for lunch. I remember them.
Yeah, my mom was a nice lady.
She was a good gal.
In the place where we worked, we had a map... and every day... we put pins in for the advances of the Russian army... or the German-
We had the news through the Russian club.
We had the newspaper in the ghetto, in German.
And the official news came through.
The victorious German army withdrew from Harkoff.
We knew they got kicked out of Harkoff.
Shanghai, apart of the Japanese empire... was under attack by American forces, mostly by air.
So far up to this point...
Shanghai itself had not been bombed.
There were strafings.
We'd see Japanese and American fighter planes up in the sky.
Kids have no fear.
We’d be up on the roof.
We'd bet with marbles who would shoot down whom... as shrapnel was falling all around us.
When I think of it now, how foolish.
We could have gotten killed.
But nobody ever got hurt by that.
I don't know.
We must have been immune.
They would push the dining room tables together... and put mattresses on top and we would crawl underneath... and that was supposed to be a shelter.
It was July 17, 1945.
My mother was on one of her illegal forays in the city.
I was on my way to see Sue and Chaya, who were living together.
They lived on the exact opposite end of the ghetto from where I lived.
It was a very, very hot summer day... and in Shanghai the clouds used to hang... just a couple hundred meters above your head. You would choke.
There was an air raid alarm in the morning... and then it was called off.
I think two or three times and called off.
I remember I went to a haircut.
I'm walking down the road... and I stopped-
Next to the prison was a hospital.
And that hospital had become a prison hospital... for American and British POWs.
They always had them out on a balcony on a top floor... which was maybe the fifth or sixth floor.
We used to stop there and wave to them.
Sure they must have been wondering who we were.
They used to wave back and we'd wave to them.
Suddenly you thought the world was coming to an end.
Absolutely the world- Afterwards they said it was about a hundred B-29s... over Shanghai, just over the clouds.
That's a-
That's a ear-cracking noise.
It is unbearable.
Just as I'm starting to continue to walk over there... the dreaded siren went off that the city was under attack.
No bomb shelter, but a trench.
Jumped into a trench with some other people... and within a split second the bombs were flying.
And then the bombs started flying.
The bombs, when they go down, they go-
You hear that whistle.
I'll never forget that whistle... right before the thud.
We were always taught when the bombs start falling... you take an inside post of the building.
Never stand in the middle.
So everybody ran, grabbed some inside post of a building.
People screaming, and then you heard the sirens of the ambulances.
It was over very, very quickly.
Then we started running home.
Thirty-one refugees died, as well as hundreds of Chinese... in an attack by American forces... trying to hit a Japanese radio station in Hongkew.
The Japanese were terrific.
They had supplied the ghetto hospital... with medications and emergency equipment... in the event there would be a disaster.
They had the ambulances.
They came and they took care of everything immediately.
Didn't matter whether you were Chinese or white or green or yellow.
We had shrapnel coming into the window of the room where we lived... on my sister's bed, actually.
On her pillow.
And I kept that piece for many, many years.
You could see the evidence of the destruction all over the place.
There were shells of houses... and you could see that only walls had remained where houses had been. and there was rubble strewn everywhere.
I n the afternoon we went for a walk around the district... and that was devastating.
Dead bodies, blood, this, that-
I remember I couldn't fall asleep for a whole month.
I used to sit in bed all night long with nightmares... and I couldn't fall asleep.
I couldn't do my schoolwork.
My head was just not there anymore.
Then we heard about the first atomic bomb... on Hiroshima, then on Nagasaki.
We said, "Oh, my God. They're now going to drop it on Shanghai. "
It was a terrible fear for us... because we knew Shanghai was a military target.
Otherwise, why would there be strafings on the outskirts?
After the war was over, it suddenly got very quiet on the streets.
That was in August when that part of the war was over.
It got very quiet out there and the Japanese soldiers were gone.
We looked out through the blackout curtains... and there was nobody out there.
We waited a while to see if it was safe... and then we went out and there was nothing.
They were gone from the check posts around the ghetto.
They were out of there.
That's when we found out that it was over.
And when the war was over... we were in good shape.
We're strong kids, played a lot of soccer.
I went out to the streets.
Everybody was running wild. The Jews-
Suddenly, everything opened up.
I went out and two buddies came with me.
I went to look for George Bremen.
George Bremen saw me from a block away... and he knew this was the end, and he started running.
But I ran like a wild animal... so he couldn't have gotten away from me, no way.
I got a hold of George Bremen, and I was never a violent kid.
If those two guys would not have been with me-
I probably lost my mind.
I probably would have killed him.
I let out three, four years of anger... lots of pain.
I hit him with everything I could... and if those two boys weren't there,
I probably would have killed him... because I lost all humanity at that time too.
After the war was over... the Red Cross released lists of surviving family members in Europe.
The refugees rushed to see who survived.
Few did.
Soon after, news of what happened in Europe reached the refugees.
I remember we got a few letters... from the Warsaw ghetto, which I have... where my Uncle Mietek... wrote to his sister, my mother... if there’s anything she can do to help us get out of the Warsaw ghetto... and of course there was nothing to do.
There was nothing to do.
I have some of the letters in Polish, in German.
They're very sad letters... of „Help us get out of here," but there was nothing my mother could do.
A completely lost situation.
And those were the last letters.
I always admired the people that resisted.
I've taught my children that.
I thought by being an athlete, showing a different way of a Jew... that I contributed something... that we Jews are different and it can never happen again.
It won’t happen again.
I will have nothing to do with Germany.
Germany decimated my whole family.
Germany changed my whole life.
My father who fought for the country-
In my mind, they murdered him.
I have no aunts and uncles that I know of.
I grew up without cousins.
My mother had a very difficult life.
Everything was taken away from her.
I can't forget that.
Jewish life continues... which is not guaranteed, unfortunately.
I always say that if my grandchildren don't grow up Jewish...
Hitler won the war.
And it's a problem.
Anti-Semitism never bothered me as much as assimilation.
Most of the rest of the family... that I'd gotten to know from our yearly visits-
I spent a month or two in Poland every summer- did not survive.
When we heard about the concentration camps...
I remember vividly... that my only recollection of some of the people that did not survive... were things that I was very unhappy about.
That was long before
I learned about survivor guilt... because there was the feeling of we had survived and they had not.
I remember the last time I saw-
One of my cousins who lived in Dembitz... and his mother and I understand his father survived-
I was always very jealous of him.
He was clearly the brightest of all the cousins.
We must have had eight, nine cousins.
When we get together, he could solve any puzzle and stump the rest of us.
But he was physically somewhat more awkward than I... and I remember vividly that the last time we got together...
I had a big fight with him... and his eyeglasses were broken.
I remember when I heard after the war that he had not survived... that was the only memory that kept coming back to me.
How could I possibly have fought with him the last time I saw him?
But on the whole they didn't know what was happening... so they focused on their own life and on the misery of life in Shanghai.
Lo and behold, after the war they found out they're living in paradise... compared to what happened to their brethren in Europe.
That's what it was.
It's all a relative thing.
You don't know you’re living in paradise until you're kicked out.
After American liberation... the living conditions in Shanghai improved greatly.
In the following years... all the refugees left Shanghai and China... and spread around the world.
The Israeli government had chartered three small Greek ships.
These three ships sailed up the Yangtze River, the Whangpoo... with Israeli flags... which is still a very moving moment to me... because obviously if there were an Israel... there wouldn't have been a Holocaust.
It's as simple as that.
Of course, anybody who wanted to was welcome to go aboard the ship.
And no one-
These are still moving moments for me.
No one was ever asked for a visa or for a ship's passage... and if that had been true we wouldn't have been in Shanghai... and there wouldn’t have been six million
Jews killed during the Second World War.
Many of the Jews in Shanghai did go to Israel... and others- most came to the United States, some to Australia.
We came to the United States on a US troop transport- the SS Marine Lynx... which was a beautiful ship for transporting the US Army.
Beautiful ship that took us from Shanghai... through Yokohama and Hawaii to San Francisco.
Couple thousand Jewish refugees on the ship.
Ship got into San Francisco
3:00 in the morning.
I thought the ocean would overflow with all the tears of the refugees... when they see San Francisco at 3:00 in the morning.
But on the transcontinental train from San Francisco to New York...
I happened to be on the train with two black soldiers.
And usually as soon as the train would stop... we'd get off just to stretch our legs, get a different environment.
We got off at Albuquerque, the black soldiers didn't get off.
I didn't understand why.
Then I walked into the station... and there's a sign,
"White Men" and "Colored Men. "
I remember vividly
I felt as if I had been slapped.
I also felt that I couldn't face the black soldiers.
It's not that I was that racially conscious at the time.
Of course I knew about discrimination.
It wasn’t anything new to me.
But I'd never encountered it firsthand since we left Germany.
And the one thing I learned... having lived among
Japanese and Chinese people... is that I can't find it in myself to hate a nation... or a people.
[Wolf howling]
[Howling]
[Man]
* around the lonely campfire
* when the wolves begin to call *
* the riders tell the story
* of the bravest wolf of all *
* the king of all the hunters
* born to lead the rest
* his name became a legend
* across the great southwest
* lobo
* lobo

[Man narrating]
Like everything else,
A good legend's got to have a good beginning.
The right bloodline, you might say.
This one began even before lobo's time...
With a wolf famous in his own right.
He was a big, rangy fella.
He used to roam a wide piece of the territory...
Back when it was still empty and mighty fine to look at.
Around the neighborhood, he was known as the fierce one.
In the local Spanish,
El feroz.
The vaqueros had a great deal of respect for him too.
Fact is, it amounted to a kind of a superstition.
Some of 'em claimin' he was a spirit wolf.
Well, this El feroz was lobo's father.
So for breed and blood, lobo came from a good line.
It was in the spring of '89 he was born,
A litter of five pups, two brothers and a couple of sisters.
That's about the usual family for wolves.
Now, these young 'uns are off to a good start on a number of counts.
For one thing, they were lucky just havin' El feroz for their dad.
It's a common thing in nature for the male animal to kill his offspring,
If he can get to 'em.
But the wolf's different.
He's about the best parent there is,
Because he's gentle with his young.
[Whimpering]
The wolf's loyal too.
Somethin' most folks don't realize is that wolves mate for life.
It's for all time.
The male and the female both being devoted to each other and the family.
For a real fine domestic arrangement,
There's probably not another one like it anywhere in nature.
At six weeks of age, lobo wasn't much of a legend,
Not yet anyway.
He was bright-eyed and full of mischief,
But he looked exactly like his brothers and sisters.
And at this stage of the game, nobody would have bet on him as a future king of the range.
About the only thing different maybe,
He was a little more curious than the rest of the litter.
He sort of liked to follow his nose,
Find out what is goin' on around the neighborhood.
But bein' a little new at this, he sometimes followed it too far.
[Yelps, whimpers]
Well, if you're gonna leave your common sense at home when you go travelin',
You're bound to land in trouble.
[Yelping]
Still, the school of hard knocks isn't a bad place to start an education,
And lobo caught on fast.
The truth was, all of his life, he'd be one to learn from experience...
And, what's more important, store it up and remember it.
By now it was plain that the pups were growin' fast...
And about ready for good red meat.
So El feroz checked over his boneyard to see what was left.
The bone he finally dug up was the last one.
Pretty slim pickin's for a hungry family.
[Growling]
About all it was good for was a tug-of-war.
There wasn't enough nourishment in this old soup bone to feed a canary.
[Growling]
El feroz knew it was time to go huntin' again.
* he'll feed his hungry young ones *
* El feroz searched for game *
* but there was not a scent of prey *
* throughout his wild domain
* across the endless wastelands *
* his lonely trail had led
* and then at last he spied them *
Pronghorn antelope, his favorite prey.
* his family would be fed
An antelope's faster than a jackrabbit on the takeoff,
But he can't keep it up forever.
The wolf, on the other hand, is a stayer.
He can hold the pace for hours on end when he wants to.
He can even outlast a good strong horse.
So this is how it was.
El feroz was countin' on one of the herd fallin' behind.
Sure enough, a big pronghorn buck pulled up winded and heavin',
Too tired to go another step.
Now the chase was over.
The rest would be easy,
Except that El feroz wasn't in a hurry to move in for the kill.
He began to work this antelope like a good cuttin' horse,
Headin' it back in the direction they had come.
This was an old, old trick.
If a wolf chased his prey Miles away from where he wanted it...
Say, a half day's journey from a hungry family...
He didn't end things too soon.
Instead, he'd send it along home under its own power.
Back at the den, these little young 'uns were bein' as patient as they could,
Exceptin' it wasn't natural for pups to be very patient when they were hungry.
They growled a little, grumbled a little,
Chewed on things and generally felt sorry for themselves.
If they'd only known it, they really had somethin' to complain about.
A cougar was pokin' around in their vicinity.
And if he found 'em, it could mean trouble.
Real bad trouble.
When one of these big cats was circulatin', nothin' was safe.
Stealthy, tricky,
He'd sneak up soft and silent, never betrayin' his presence,
Never givin' a warning either.
[Snarling]
[Growling]
[Cougar growling]
Seemed like right about now, the wolves had been dealt a losing hand.
[Growling]
Then at the last minute, a wild card turned up.
[Cougar growling]
There was somethin' about cougars that just naturally...
Brought out hatred in cowpunchers.
Of course, the big cats were death on horses and other livestock,
But the resentment seemed more than that almost.
It was kind of unreasoning, and it generally took the form of a rifle bullet.
Now, this went for wolves too.
And right at this moment, little lobo couldn't know how close he was...
To gettin' a lead slug of his own.
About that time, El feroz came home with part of his kill.
Right off, he knew somethin' was wrong.
It didn't take him long to unravel the mystery.
He could have figured it out by the scent alone...
And catchin' sight of the riders only confirmed his conclusions.
Humans had been here, and they'd probably be back.
It was time to pull up stakes and move on.
When the whereabouts of a wolf's den isn't secret anymore,
He'll find himself a new one,
'Cause the one thing he's got to have is privacy.
Of course, when that day comes, father just acts as guide.
It's mother who does all the totin' and carryin'.
All right, dear.
Get a move on.
Let's get goin'.
Since there was only room for one passenger at a time,
Each of the pups had to wait his turn,
But lobo wasn't in the mood for waitin'.
Like a stray on the tail end of the herd, he came taggin' along behind,
Doin' his best to keep up.
[Whimpering]
[Whimpering continues]
[Barks softly]
It was gettin' plainer every minute that he wasn't any Mountain goat.
But if he wanted it this way, his mother seemed willing to let him work it out.
He wasn't a quitter.
No, sir.
He stayed with it, and in the end, he came out on top.
Now, once on the trail, the parents moved along at a steady lope.
It was a little tough on the pups,
Bein' short coupled with short legs tryin' to keep up.
Now, there was no time for the sights,
No time to fool around with strangers.
Bein' the curious one, lobo stopped to say howdy.
The tortoise wasn't much on hospitality.
He just wanted to mind his own business.
Trouble was, he was gettin' a lot of unwanted help.
Finally figurin' to sidetrack his escort,
The old slowpoke veered off the trail.
The sashayin' was over, but the pup was a little late gettin' the point.
By now lobo had forgotten all about his parents.
It was sort of mutual.
Being concerned with house hunting, they had their minds on other things too.
The pup, meanwhile, had taken up with a new sidekick,
Another funny-looking critter in a suit of armor.
Seemed like everybody around here wore it.
Maybe this is what made 'em all so standoffish.
Well, in a matter of bein' friendly,
Lobo decided it was up to him to make the first move.
Now, an armadillo's got tender ears,
About the only thing on him that's unprotected.
Hurt his ears and you've hurt his feelings, for sure.
All this time the family had been coverin' more and more ground,
Gettin' farther and farther away,
And still they hadn't missed lobo.
So at a rather young age, he was left playin' lone wolf...
And findin' it a bit tedious.
He was hot, tired and thirsty.
[Whimpering]
To make matters worse, his feet hurt.
It kind of dawned on him along about this point...
That he was travelin' in circles.
He was lost, just about as lost as they come.
Purely by accident, he stumbled onto a catch basin of rainwater.
Just enough left for a quick drink and a soothing cooling bath...
For his achin' feet.
His wet tracks would have been easy to follow...
If anybody'd come along in time, but that wasn't likely.
The family was a couple of canyons away before they hauled up to count noses.
Now, wolves don't excite easy.
The fact that a pup was missin' didn't mean much.
They figured he was still bringin' up the rear as usual,
And he'd be along in his own good time.
In makin' his rounds,
El feroz had had his eye for quite a spell...
On a deserted badger hole.
With a little fixin', it'd do just fine for a den,
So he took possession.
[Animal snarling, feroz growling]
It appeared the place wasn't vacant, after all.
Tenant was livin' here,
And he wasn't figurin' to move.
Badger's a tough critter to handle, even for a wolf,
And this one wasn't gonna budge for anybody.
[Growling]
[Hissing]
[Badger growling]
He might be small, but he was fast on his feet...
And dead game.
Fact is, it turned out to be quite a dance.
Heel-and-toe and do-si-do all around the hall.
[Snarling]
Finally, El feroz decided to call it quits.
He wasn't gettin' anywhere in this game.
Besides, he had a lost pup to worry about,
And it was time he went lookin' for him.
The first move was to try to pick up his trail.
It would still be fresh enough to follow if the parents could find it,
But that was the big "if."
[Howling]
They tried callin' to him the old pack rallyin' cry,
Hopin' he'd hear it and know enough to answer it.
[Yipping, howling]
There wasn't even an echo, nothin' but silence.
One thing was certain.
They'd better catch up with him soon,
'Cause lobo was courtin' disaster.
[Rattling]
A rattler has a built-in warning system for those who know what it means.
But bein' a greenhorn, lobo didn't get the message.
[Rattling continues]
Sensing he was in danger, he began to call for help.
[Whimpering, howling]
Lucky for him, his parents were within earshot.
[Whimpering continues]
[Rattling continues]
It didn't take long to size up the situation.
They knew exactly what to do.
Draw the snake's attention to themselves.
If they could just keep the rattler busy,
The pup might slip out of the danger zone.
Trouble with this plan, the way out was squeezed a little narrow.
Besides, would the pup know when to come?
[Rattling continues]
From the sidelines, El feroz could see it was a standoff,
And he decided it needed a quick ending.
Once the rattler was rooted out, his play was over.
Now lobo could rejoin his family,
Sore-footed and tuckered out maybe,
But glad to be back where he belonged.
As the weeks went by, lobo branched out more and more on his own,
Traipsing around exploring the countryside.
One fine mornin', he was amblin' along...
Not doin' much of anything,
When he came upon a sight that stopped him in his tracks.
A young antelope was feelin' his oats.
He didn't seem to mind where he was goin'...
Just so long as he got there in a jiffy.
He was a kind of a crazy little cuss,
Rambunctious and full of the old vinegar.
To watch him knock this pup around,
You'd think he'd never heard of wolves eatin' antelopes.
Well, like as not at his age, he hadn't.
[Whimpering]
These two weren't old enough to know they were supposed to be enemies,
So an unusual friendship developed,
One of those things that sometimes happens in nature.
In the weeks that followed, they sort of grew up together.
And when they were three months old, they were still goin' around as pals.
Often as not, their trail led to their favorite hangout,
A little creek runnin' through the neighborhood.
It was a real inviting spot for a couple of dry country young 'uns.
And they didn't need to be told what a swimmin' hole was for.
Naturally, the pup favored the dog paddle.
The other fella's style wasn't as neat maybe,
But it got him where he was goin' just the same.
While all this was goin' on,
They were being spied on by a non-too-friendly raccoon.
She kind of took the attitude that water belonged to water critters...
And not to landlubbers like these.
The raccoon had a family to worry about, too,
And that tended to make her leery of strangers.
Nups are like that though.
The kids couldn't see anything wrong with the visitors.
If it was to be a swimmin' party, they'd join in right now.
Three of 'em would anyway.
The fourth one... well, it took him a little longer to make the plunge.
Whenever you get a passel of small fry together,
It's about the same in nature as with humans.
After a while, their animal energy is apt to bust out in a squabble.
[Growling]
[Screeching]
So the party ended, and wolf and antelope moved on.
Something else had ended too:
Their unusual friendship.
It's just not natural for enemies to prolong an acquaintance.
And as it had to be in such things,
These two came to the fork in the trail.
By the time he was six months old,
Lobo was ready to run with the family pack.
He was bigger now, heavier, more like his dad in every way.
Every way except one, he wasn't much help yet with the hunting.
To El feroz, meantime,
It seemed the hungrier his family got, the scarcer the game got.
More and more civilization was pushing into the parts,
Killing off his prey or crowdin' it out.
* it seemed to old El feroz *
* the trail herd that he saw
* was some new breed of buffalo *
* movin' through the draw
* again there would be plenty
* the wolves would have their fill *
* and so he brought his family *
* to join him in the kill
[Snarls]
Makin' a kill wasn't exactly easy though.
It was a tricky business, even downright dangerous.
If the timing was off, a wolf could get himself kicked senseless.
And if the set-to was a challenge for
El feroz, the old master,
It was somethin' more than that for his pups.
Just when lobo thought he had the thing down pat,
He found himself with a bull by the tail and afraid to let go.
What in blazes do ya do now?
[Calf bawling]
[Lobo growling]
About that time the calf had sense enough to join the rest of 'em.
And now it had protection that was gonna be hard to beat.
El feroz kept dancin' around, keepin' his eye on the calf.
For one thing, it was nearer his size,
And he was figurin' there might be a way to slicker the guards out of position.
Of course, he wasn't foolin' anybody really.
The steers were wise to him and quick to match his move.
[Moos]
[Moos]
[Growls]
[Mooing]
[Growls]
[Moos]
[Growling]
[Bawling]
[Growling continues]
- [Mooing]
- [Bawling]
There'd be another chance.
Put wolves and cattle together and sooner or later there will be a killin'.
When the buffalo were wiped out,
It left cattle as the wolves' only hope for survival.
So El feroz took what seemed his rightful share,
But the cattlemen weren't sharin' with anybody.
And from the very beginning, it was open warfare.
Along about that point, the cowboys got lucky.
The mother was knocked down.
She got right up and went on,
But she wasn't in any shape for a long grindin' chase now.
El feroz lagged back from time to time,
Encouragin' her, hopin' she'd catch up.
But he had the young ones to think of, too, and he had to go on.
The female was gettin' near the end of her rope.
A wounded animal knows when it's reached its limit.
And typical-like, she went off to find a resting place.
Maybe the riders would miss the turnoff...
And give her a much needed breathing spell.
But that's not the way it was to be.
[Gunshots]
* lobo, lobo
* remember this day
* man's bullets have taken
* your mother
* away
* lobo, lobo
* there's no lookin' back
* now you must abandon her
* run with the pack
Never again would lobo forget the smell of gunpowder.
He got to know rifles by sight,
And he wouldn't let man nor horse come within a thousand yards of him.
Yet all the time, he and the family pack kept takin' more and more cattle.
Before long, the cattlemen's battle seemed to be a losin' one.
The enemy was almost too smart.
Maybe it was a war calling for more than guns.
To catch a wolf in those days, the cowman had to learn to think like one.
The trick was to make him outsmart himself.
A wolf's an intelligent critter.
Fact is, there's not many to match him when it comes to figurin' things out.
So if a trap was gonna fool him, it had to be rigged up with some extra special trimmings.
A little dogie was about the most delectable come-on.
There was something about young veal that was well-nigh irresistible.
Once the decoy was staked out,
The next thing was to plant the trap where the wolf would have to pass.
The trap could be most any standard make.
It had to be strong though, like, say, a well-made number 4.
Not big as a bear trap maybe, but big enough...
And smooth workin' with a fast action.
Well, these preparations had been pretty thorough.
You might say they had a touch of genius about 'em,
'Cause next morning it looked like nature herself was in on the deal,
Playin' it on the cattlemen's side.
El feroz came on in the lead.
He was still headin' up the family pack.
And quick as a wink, he spotted the calf.
Naturally, he was tempted, and why not?
A free meal like this.
But before he made any move hasty-like, he sniffed around a bit just checkin' on things.
This all seemed a little too good to be true.
Might be that was what was wrong with it.
Maybe he'd better back off and size things up again.
[Snarling, growling]
Like an unexpected gunshot, the trap sent the young wolves a-scatterin'.
They ducked out of sight quick, all except lobo.
[Snarling, growling]
He sensed something wasn't right.
[Whimpering]
There wasn't much he could do for El feroz except lend him the comfort of his company.
Still, there's a kind of nobleness in the wolf.
In the unexplained way of the breed, he stayed by,
Prepared to keep watch to the end.
Then the riders came back.
Lobo knew he'd have to leave.
He had no choice.
For all wild animals, there comes the moment when they must go their own road.
And for lobo that moment was now.
* the time had come for lobo
* to make his way alone
* and loneliness and hunger
* were things he'd never known *
* all through the long, long winter *
* beneath the frozen sky
* lobo learned he must be strong *
* he must be wise or die
By the next spring, lobo had been a loner about long enough.
It was time to start lookin' for a mate,
And his wanderings took him far from his old haunts into new territory.
One fine morning he met up with some wolves he'd never seen before.
He was of a mind to join 'em.
According to pack law, he might be accepted and he might not.
It sort of depended on whether they wanted him.
As it worked out, they were kind of hankering for a new face too.
Right off, lobo was made welcome.
In the midst of all the jubilation,
He caught sight of a dark beauty on the sidelines,
And he knew his searching was over.
The black female seemed charmed with lobo too.
Before long, an old-fashioned courtship was underway.
Takin' himself a mate wasn't gonna be quite this simple though.
There was a kind of a catch to it.
The one who really had the say was the pack leader,
Surly old brute who right away took a dislikin'...
To the young fella from out of the hills.
The pack leader could see he wasn't winnin'.
And when you're not winnin', you might as well do your losin' the easiest way possible.
No sense gettin' yourself killed just for show.
He just tucked his tail between his legs and gave up, simple as that.
And so the lobo legend began to get a little bigger.
From that time on, lobo ran at the head of the pack...
With his mate at his heels...
And a following of the biggest, strongest wolves in the vicinity.
When the mating season came on, the pack split up for a while,
Each pair of wolves goin' off by itself.
Some of 'em had dens left over from last year.
But lobo and his mate, bein' new at this,
Had to set up housekeeping somewhere brand new.
One day in their scouting, they made a mighty interesting discovery.
Across the canyon was an old Indian cliff dwelling.
Looked like it would just about fill the bill.
Only drawback was, there didn't seem to be any way of gettin' over to it.
Well, where there's a will, there's generally a way.
And it turned out, there was a sort of a crossing.
It was one of those
"as the crow flies" things,
And a wolf wantin' to use it was gonna have to be mighty eager to get on the other side.
This didn't seem to bother lobo though.
After lookin' it over good, he undertook to give it a try.
The wolf's a surefooted critter with strong nerves and a steady eye,
And lobo had all the confidence of the breed.
His mate, meanwhile, hung back.
She wasn't near so sure of herself.
Bein' the female, maybe she wasn't so foolhardy.
Finally, after lobo had showed it could be done,
She got up nerve enough to follow him.
Once underway, it wasn't so bad.
Fact is, in time, these wolves would come to use this bridge practically every day.
It came to be a part of the lobo legend.
The cliff dwelling, when they got to it, looked real inviting.
The scent of man was long gone.
Besides, to these two, it wasn't a house but a cave...
With all the proper advantages of same.
Dry floor, sheltering walls and a good roof against the rain.
This was it, their new den.
The both of 'em were pleased with their find...
And, what's more important, with each other.
These two had mated for life,
And right about now the life ahead looked good.
The next few weeks were pleasant ones, and the days passed quickly.
Then the time came when lobo's mate didn't hunt with him anymore.
One morning when he got home from makin' his rounds, he found out why.
Sure was a handsome litter.
Lobo was as proud as a new daddy could be.
[Mooing]
* as leader of the wolf pack
* his fame began to spread
* for many hundred Miles around *
* a price was on his head
* by every law of nature
* the cattle were his prey
* but to the angry cattlemen
* it didn't work that way
* lobo
* lobo

A thousand dollars, a darn sight more than most human outlaws were worth.
Lobo was a legend for sure,
The most notorious name in the whole southwest.
[Hounds baying]
One day a professional hunter from
Texas rode into the territory,
Hopin' to take the famous wolf that nobody else could catch.
Bounty hunting was his full-time trade,
And he came equipped for it.
He had a killer wolfhound so mean it had to be kept muzzled.
This was his hole card.
But first, a wolf had to be brought to bay.
And for this job, he had a pack of the finest trackin' hounds ever gathered together.
If anybody could bring in lobo, looked like this was the man.
[Hounds baying]
[Baying]
[Baying continues]
It didn't take the hunter long to see he'd been outsmarted.
This lobo was a lot wiser than he'd figured.
The truth was, he had a kind of a begrudging admiration...
For a wolf that could think up a strategy like this.
Well, if the dogs couldn't bring this fella in, there were other tricks to be tried.
In lookin' over the situation, he'd noticed somethin' important,
A clue about lobo's habits that just might prove his downfall.
[Jangling]
To anybody who could read the signs,
The giveaway was printed on the ground beside the log.
The wolf tracks here told their own story.
It was plain as anything...
The wolves always came off the log at this spot.
This was the place for a trap.
The hunter took a lot of care in settin' this one.
He picked an extra strong trap with a hair-trigger action.
Used a special trick to keep the dirt from cloggin' it.
Now it was just a matter of time.
It so happened lobo didn't make his usual rounds that day.
He'd stayed home with the family sort of takin' things easy.
His pups were about three months old now,
Gettin' more active every minute.
One of 'em was lobo's particular pride and joy,
The dark little female who was a dead ringer for her mother.
With a family to raise, lobo was apt to be watchin' his step pretty carefully.
The only thing was, this time the man who was out to get him...
Was the best in the business.
When the hunter came back, the trap was gone.
Just as he figured, lobo had come passin' by...
And had stepped down right where he thought he would.
The fact that he wasn't in sight was no cause for worry.
He couldn't have got far
'cause the trap was chained to a heavy drag.
It was leavin' a well-marked trail that would be no trouble at all to follow.
[Whinnying]
It was a wolf, all right, but the wrong one,
Lobo's mate, not the old outlaw himself.
Well, since exterminatin' was his business,
He might as well exterminate her on general principles.
Then a better idea hit him.
If it was lobo he wanted, maybe here was a golden opportunity.
Taken alive, this female was a sure way of gettin' at lobo.
When his mate didn't come home, lobo began to get restless.
He sensed somethin' was wrong.
It wasn't like her to stay away from her pups like this.
He set out to find her, just as the hunter reckoned he would.
At the other end of the bridge, lobo picked up the trail.
His nose told him his mate had been in trouble.
Mixed with her scent was another one, hated and bitter,
A taint in the air he wouldn't ever forget.
* the scent of man told lobo *
* that he must find his mate *
* but the bounty man was usin' her *
* to lure him to his fate
* the trail was plain to follow *
* he traveled hard and fast
* but he would have searched forever *
* to find his mate at last
* lobo
* lobo
* lobo
* lobo
* there's danger below
* but true to your loyal code *
* there you must go
* lobo
* lobo
* there's danger below
* but true to your loyal code *
* there you must go
Lobo knew the chance he was takin',
The odds against him.
He came on, steppin' soft,
Followin' the fence for protection.
His mate was somewhere near.
His keen nose said so.
Then he found her.
[Whimpering]
She was alive.
Now his problem was how to get to her.
[Whimpers]
[Gunshot]
[Howling]
[Wolves howling]

* a rally call he cried
* it echoed off the rimrock *
* and carried far and wide

Tonight on Lois & Clark:
Clark. What are you doing here?
- Dad's here.
- What's he doing here?
When the subjects were infants, they were injected with a dormant synthetic virus.
The only physical manifestation is a reoccurring rash.
That must be some itch.
Yeah. I get it every year around this time.
And they will carry out any mission you give them.
- It's time to choose the fallen warrior.
- Yes, I understand.
Put the gun down.
Come on, Jimmy. Jimmy, it's Lois.
You've been brainwashed.
Katherine?
- What are you doing?
- Dr. Golden.
I thought this was settled.
Those files are to be destroyed.
These files represent years of my father's work.
Katherine, Project Valhalla was a horrible mistake.
Was it?
Nice work, Mother. I thought you were gonna keep him occupied.
Yes. Well, apparently
I'm not Dr. Golden's type.
Claudette, this is insane.
Even your husband admitted that experiment never should've happened.
But my husband is dead.
And Project Valhalla is going to be my reward.
For playing the doting military wife all those insufferable years.
- I'm getting Security.
- Allen, please work with us.
You kept the secret for 20 years.
- Now earn your reward.
- You disgust me.
Katherine, please. Listen to reason.
You can't play God with people's lives.
Yes, we can.
- How many guinea pigs do we have?
- Three.
Sarah Goodwin, G.E. Mallow,
James Olsen.
That's him.
Jimmy. Jimmy, Jimmy.
I left contact sheets on your desk.
Did you look at them?
I got the chance to look at them right before I left. They look good, I like...
I'll have the prints after lunch,
I promise.
Thanks, Hank. Morning, Lois.
- What is that?
- Well, it's obviously a...
Dan Scardino sent it over, and I haven't a clue what it is.
Scardino. The DEA guy who's been hitting on you?
- He hasn't been hitting on me.
- Well, whatever it is, it's ugly.
That must be some itch.
Yeah. I get it every year around this time.
It looks painful.
Isn't there cream you can put on?
I've tried everything.
My doc says not to worry.
Jimmy.
Can I see you in my office?
Sure, Chief.
Hi.
- Hi!
- I see you got it.
Yeah. You shouldn't have.
Anybody can send flowers. I thought this would be something you could appreciate.
Yeah, well...
So...
So if you remember, a while back we talked about us maybe going out.
Right.
Dan, I'm really flattered.
It's just that I've been seeing Clark.
Kent?
Nice guy.
Real...
- ...polite.
- He's a lot more than that.
Look, I gotta go. I'll talk to you later.
What did Inspector Gadget want?
He is just temporarily on assignment in Metropolis, and he came by to say hi.
- Yeah, I bet.
- Lois, Clark.
Jimmy, what's the matter?
My doctor's been murdered.
Allen Golden.
They found his body this morning.
He just called me yesterday.
Left a message.
I was gonna call him back today.
Here, I want you two to check it out.
- On it, Chief.
- I wanna go with them.
- Now, Jimmy, I...
- Chief, I knew Dr. Golden my whole life.
- All right, son. Go ahead.
- Thank you.
Hey, guys! Wait up.
Were you able to manufacture the serum?
Yes. But what good is it, Mother...
...if you can't get your bimbo to bring in these kids so I can inject them?
She means "bimbo" in a good way, Klaus.
We'll find a kid.
- Did our buyer call?
- Yes.
He's very intrigued with the idea of creating assassins that can kill on command.
- Most terrorists are.
- He is returning to his country...
...the day after tomorrow, and he wants a demonstration.
So your Ken doll better get me a subject fast.
I have hospital rounds to make.
Excuse me. May I help you?
Yes. We're from the Daily Planet.
We'd like to look at Dr. Golden's office.
Would you?
Well, we have strict orders not to turn this place into a media circus.
Well, Miss Burky. I assume it's "Miss."
We assure you...
Do you understand English?
Maybe you can interpret for her.
- Charlene? Twenty-two needs a bedpan.
- Right away.
- Now, do I need to call Security? Security!
- No, no. That's okay. We'll be leaving now.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
And have a nice day.
Talk about your bedside manner.
We're gonna need some kind of diversion to get past her.
Please hurry.
I've got an idea.
All right, Lois. Keep it up.
- Nurse! I've got an emergency here.
- Doctor, what do you need?
- A room for a C-section.
- Who should I call for an anesthesiologist?
- Pain. I'm in so much pain.
- Anyone.
- What's the diagnosis?
- It's a complication of...
- And she's really in pain.
- Take the staff elevators, doctor. It's faster.
- The staff elevator, doctor.
- Pain. I'm in pain.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Watch it.
As a member of the board...
...I have to tell you, we're unhappy with the level of security at this hospital.
Excuse me. Watch it. I've got a pregnant lady coming through, and I think...
Look out!
Congratulations.
A healthy baby basketball.
Here you go.
- Guess I won't need that C-section after all.
- Security!
Just a mistake.
Sorry.
Bye!
- What was that all about?
- It was a couple of Daily Planet reporters.
Trying to poke around
Allen Golden's office.
You see. That's what I'm talking about.
The security here's atrocious.
I gotta admit, Clark, that was a pretty wild scheme.
- What happened to you guys?
- Our...
...basketball arrived a little early.
- Did you find anything?
- It's what I didn't find.
The police said Dr. Golden tried to call two patients.
Well, their files are missing, and so are mine.
I guess we should find these people and see what you all have in common.
You go after G.E. Mallow, and we'll take Sarah Goodwin.
Okay. And, Lois, keep an eye on him.
That's her room. Open up!
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I guess so.
- I'm going after him.
- What happened?
I don't know. All I remember is waking up and then seeing that guy standing over me.
- I haven't lost a game of chicken yet.
- Thanks, Superman.
Who are you?
Listen, blondie, unless you're a mute,
I want some answers.
I'll take him downtown.
Maybe the police can get him to talk.
Jimmy, her arm.
How long have you had that rash?
Well, ever since I was a kid.
I get it every year at this time. Why?
So you think the guy at my apartment is connected to Dr. Golden's murder.
I'm sure it's a possibility the police will be investigating.
How long have you been
Dr. Golden's patient?
All my life. Ever since my dad was stationed at Fort Truman.
- You were born at Fort Truman?
- Yeah.
Me too.
- How old are you?
- I just turned 20.
So did I. This is really weird.
Are you easily excited?
Prone to impulsive behavior?
Capable, intelligent, even sensitive, but still seeking self-confidence?
- What are you talking about?
- Well, I'm a psych major.
I was just wondering, am I close to describing your personality?
No. No, I don't think so.
Describes me perfectly.
- Well, we don't have that in common.
- Here you go.
- Where you been?
- At the police station.
Detective Wolfe told me what happened.
Hi, I'm Clark Kent.
What were you doing at the station?
You were gonna get Mallow.
Well, he's missing.
I don't think you should go home until we know what's going on.
- Jimmy, you can stay with me.
- All right.
And you could stay with me.
- Thanks.
- As long as you don't analyze me.
Just how long have you had this fear of self-discovery, Lois?
Jimmy. Hey, hold on.
Katherine has completed tests on one of the Valhalla subjects.
I'm sure you'll be very impressed with her findings, Mr. Moonhauer.
Well, I'm impressed with nothing
I've seen so far.
- Nothing?
- Mother...
...have some respect for yourself.
My daughter views this project as a validation of her father's work.
Me...
...I smell money and power.
So right now my goal is to please you.
Mr. Moonhauer.
When the subjects were infants, they were injected with a dormant synthetic virus.
This virus affects the part of the brain that controls free thought.
The only physical manifestation is a reoccurring rash.
But when they are injected with the Tycion serum...
...they can be activated by the trigger word "warrior."
And they will carry out any mission you give them.
But given the price you ask, you still haven't convinced me of its value.
Unlike my father, you're a man of very limited vision.
- Katherine.
- The virus and serum can be mass-produced.
You tell people your government is giving out flu vaccines...
...set up clinics, and you can inject everyone in your country.
Imagine. Thousands of people who blindly answer to your command.
I'd say that's valuable. Wouldn't you?
I want proof. And on a man only.
Where I come from, we don't need drugs to control our women.
And a man it shall be.
Mr. Moonhauer...
...meet Mr. Mallow.
We're sending him to deliver a special message...
...to some reporters at the Daily Planet.
I can tell a lot from the way you organize your kitchen.
- I'm taking this course in psychology...
- Sarah, I warned you not to analyze me.
Right.
That's exactly what I would've said about you from the way you organize.
I got it.
Hi. Is Lois home?
- Maybe. Can I tell her who's here?
- Yeah, I'm a friend.
A friend. A boyfriend, a "friend" friend or just a friend?
If I knew there was gonna be a test,
I would've studied.
Who are you?
- She's a friend.
- Just a friend.
What are you doing here?
You're working on the murder of Dr. Golden, right?
- Well...
- Well, I've been assigned to investigate...
...the disappearance of a shipment of a drug called Tycion.
- Yeah, so?
- I thought you might be interested...
...that Tycion is a regulated drug that Dr. Golden ordered.
Only it turns out his signature was forged on the order.
Lois?
Dad's here.
Clark. What are you doing here?
I've got some information on Mallow.
What's he doing here?
I was giving her information about your case.
Look, there was something else I wanted to talk to you about, but I'll catch you later.
Nice tie.
You know, what you two are doing is classic.
You're both thinking the same thoughts but hoping the other person's gonna talk first.
I left something in the bathroom.
Excuse me.
So, what did you find out about Mallow?
He was born in the same Army hospital as Jimmy and Sarah. And get this:
Golden was head of Pediatrics there till he went into private practice.
Really? I hate military investigations.
You never get anywhere.
Well, don't worry. Perry's old Navy buddy,
Admiral Whalen, he's in town.
You mean, Sailin' Whalen?
- D-3.
- Miss.
Again?
Admiral, about that hospital at Fort Truman?
Yeah. I heard about something...
...back in the '70s, something called the Valhalla Project.
What was that?
You play, and I'll talk.
G-9.
Hit. That sinks my cruiser, damn it.
According to the rumors...
...some rogue doctors were trying to tinker with the brains of babies...
...and fix it so they could control their minds.
The whole idea was to turn them into assassins when they grew up.
F-5.
- Miss.
- How far along did they get in their testing?
I don't know. The whole thing was scuttled by the Pentagon when they found out.
The colonel in charge got a DD, dishonorable discharge.
Your turn.
B-3.
Hit. If I didn't know better,
I'd say you have x-ray vision.
Do you have any idea where we might find this colonel?
Wilder? He's dead.
He died a few months ago.
J-8.
Miss. Any family?
Let's see, he had a wife and one kid.
In fact, the daughter grew up to be some kind of a doctor herself.
Your turn.
C-3.
Hit. And game.
It's probably a good thing
I was never in combat.
How are you at Stratego?
I know it sounds weird, Chief. But I feel like everywhere I go, there's eyes watching me.
Now, Jimmy, you gotta realize something.
It's just your mind.
It's playing tricks on you.
I guess you're right.
- I'll see you upstairs, okay?
- Okay.
Here you go, Mr. White.
- Mind control?
- It's just a rumor.
We haven't confirmed anything yet.
I thought listening to the Violent Femmes would fry my brain.
Jimmy, where's that photo sheet you promised me a half-hour ago?
I'm on it, Chief.
Who needs drugs to control people when you can use fear?
Lois, you got three calls. All of them from someone named Scardino.
Three calls? Can we say
"a little insecure"?
Maybe it's something important.
Well, let's see.
"What about dinner tonight?"
"Dinner tomorrow?"
"Lunch?"
That's real important.
Clark, let me see you in my office for a minute, please.
Excuse me.
- So, what is going on with you and Clark?
- Nothing that's any of your business.
Okay.
We went on a date, and it was great.
And then we kissed, and that was really great.
Ever since then, he's been tiptoeing around.
I have no idea what his problem is.
And now this Scardino guy's arrived on the scene, and he's looking pretty good.
Lois, it's classic. Psych 101.
Okay, look.
You ever have rocky road ice cream?
I think that's a bad example if you're talking about relationships.
Just a metaphor, Lois, okay?
Just go with me.
All right. If I told you...
...you could only have one ice-cream flavor for the rest of your life...
...what would it be, rocky road or chocolate?
Well, I don't know.
I'd have to try the rocky road before I decided.
That's the point.
Clark's chocolate. I mean, it's good.
It's good and all, but you've had it.
Yes. But you can put hot fudge on it. And whip cream and nuts.
- Bananas.
- Bananas.
Don't take me there.
Okay. So now this Scardino guy, he's rocky road. He's different, interesting, chunky.
You know, Sarah, if you go around trying every flavor, you're gonna get awfully fat.
That's when you go for the taster spoons.
A little bit of this, a little bit of that.
I'm telling you, Lois.
Chocolate will always be there.
Not necessarily.
I think I'd really miss chocolate if I couldn't have it.
Lois.
Thanks.
Chief, I'm not really sure
I'm comfortable talking about this.
Well, I don't wanna sound like an alarmist.
But it just seems like to me that this
Scardino character...
...has already got one paw in the chicken coop.
Chief, there's nothing more for me to do.
She knows how I feel.
I thought I knew how she felt.
If you ask me...
...you're doing too much thinking and not enough doing.
Chief, I really don't wanna start competing for her attention.
Well, you better do something.
Because believe me...
...it's no picnic down at Heartbreak Hotel.
It's not that simple, Chief.
My situation is a little bit different than your normal...
Am I interrupting?
No. No, no.
Medical association came through on Dr. Katherine Wilder.
Look familiar?
We saw her when we were dodging the claws of Nurse Burky.
She's on staff at Metropolis General.
- That's where Dr. Golden worked.
- Coincidence?
Give me the rifle.
All right.
He's dead.
- What did you do to him?
- Nothing.
Maybe something is wrong with the formula.
Ladies, please, it appears that this experiment was a waste of my time.
Relax, Mr. Moonhauer.
I'm sure that Katherine can fix it.
What good would that do?
You killed your subject.
We have another.
He's right over there.
The young man with the camera.
Hey, guys. Look at this.
Mallow had the same rash on his arm that we do.
You think he was already under mind control?
That's exactly the kind of behavior Whalen said Valhalla was capable of producing.
What does Valhalla mean anyway?
It was a Nordic myth.
Supposedly there was this band of young women called the Valkyries.
They would ride out over the battlefields on these great airborne warhorses.
And their job was to pick fallen soldiers who were fit to enter Valhalla.
The police finally ID'd that guy in Sarah's apartment.
His name was Klaus Martin.
And his one phone call was to a bail bondsman named Roxie Terrace.
Forensics report just came in on Mallow.
It says the doctors found a drug called Tycion in his blood.
Tycion? That's the missing drug
Scardino's been tracking.
The one that was ordered under the forged signature of Golden.
Yeah. So we have two doctors connected to this Valhalla Project...
...Golden and Wilder.
One of those is dead.
And I would bet my boots the other one doesn't make house calls.
Why don't you two pay her a visit.
Apparently too much Tycion leads to an overload on the brain synapses.
That's what killed Mallow.
Too bad your father didn't note that in his research.
Dr. Wilder, there are two reporters here to see you.
- Really? Send them into my office.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Can I help you?
- Hello. I'm Lois Lane.
- This is Clark Kent. We're from the...
- Daily Planet.
- Yes, I know. I've read your work.
- So have I.
You're very good.
- This is my mother.
- How do you do?
I'm terrific. How about you?
Dr. Wilder, we wanted to talk to you...
...about a project that your father, and your husband, was involved with in the Army.
Well, I'd love to stay and chat, but I have a pressing appointment.
I'm sure that Katherine can answer all of your questions.
Bye.
So while he did tell me of the Valhalla Project...
...as far as I know, all the papers were destroyed by the Pentagon.
- Dr. Wilder, line one.
- Excuse me.
- Dr. Wilder.
- I leave at 3 tomorrow.
- Will I be seeing another demonstration?
- Of course. I'll call with specifics later.
I was wondering, do you know a bail bondsman by the name of Roxie Terrace?
Do you always read people's phone messages?
Well, it's sort of a bad habit
I picked up being a reporter.
Bad habits can be very hazardous to your health.
Mr. Terrace is a patient.
- Perhaps you'd like his diagnosis?
- No. That won't be necessary.
Thank you for your time.
If Roxie Terrace is her patient,
I'm Dumbo the elephant.
And was she threatening me?
I don't know. I think we should keep an eye on her.
I've got a hunch that something is gonna happen tonight.
Another late-night stakeout.
You know, it seems like a stakeout...
...is the only way we can spend any time alone together these days.
You think it means something?
Like, on a cosmic level?
I don't know.
But...
...I know that there are things that I'd like to get clear about us and our relationship.
I'm glad you said that.
- I've been having feelings lately...
- Help me!
- I think it would be good...
- Look, I'm starved.
Why don't I grab some takeout and we can talk on a full stomach.
I'll be right back.
To get things out in the open.
Nice work.
Too bad that's a public wall and not a canvas.
- Hey! Let's go!
- Go, man!
Now that you've expressed your feelings,
I'm gonna express mine.
Hey, you missed a spot.
- You think that's funny?
- Yeah. It's F Troop.
I know it's kind of stupid, but it's funny.
You got Corporal Agarn, Chief Wild Eagle...
- You think I'm an idiot, don't you?
- No.
No, I think you're just weird enough to be sexy.
Bag F Troop.
Open up, police.
- Scardino, what are you doing?
- I got dinner.
Your office told me you were on stakeout, and I thought you might get hungry.
I got some great Thai food.
How did you know I like Thai food?
Lois, I am an undercover cop.
What else do you know about me?
Shall we toast?
- To what?
- How about...
- ...to the future.
- Whose?
How about ours?
Boy, you never stop, do you?
Lois...
...when you live the kind of life I do...
...you learn fast that time is a precious commodity.
And every minute that goes by that we're not together...
...seems like a terrible waste.
Carpe diem.
Considering the hour, carpe night.
Clark, where you been?
Scardino, if you wanna chase Lois, that's your business.
When you start doing it on my time, that's my business.
So I'd appreciate it if you'd let us do our job.
- Alone.
- Hey, not a problem.
Enjoy the food.
I guess he's starting to get on my nerves a bit.
Really?
At least he doesn't run out on me every time I have something important to say.
I'm... I'm gonna go get a drink.
You... you want something?
Well, this wouldn't be one of those avoidance-of-intimacy things, now would it?
I'll get it. Hello.
- Sarah?
- Yes?
It's time to choose the fallen warrior.
- What?
- Warrior.
Listen carefully.
- Open the door.
- I understand.
Well, all Lois has is diet.
I hope that's okay.
- Sarah, what are you doing?
- Exactly what she's been told to do.
Close the door, Sarah.
You still don't get it, do you?
Klaus wasn't kidnapping Sarah.
Don't move!
He was putting her back after we injected her.
- Jimmy?
- Yeah, Chief?
You getting enough sleep, son?
I find if I don't get enough shuteye, my carcass is dragging all the next day.
It's really weird.
I woke up on the couch, right? But I don't remember anything about last night.
Well, you've been under a lot of stress lately.
I guess short-term memory loss is not uncommon.
Oh, boy. You know, it's almost 12.
You seen Lois and Clark?
They're sleeping in.
They were out on a stakeout.
Oh, brother. You know, back in the days when I was a cub reporter...
...the old pros, they'd pull an all-nighter and be back first thing in the morning.
They were real warriors.
Speak of the devil, there's Clark now.
Clark.
How'd it go last night?
Wilder didn't leave her office till 3 a.m., then went home.
Canfield's watching her now.
Well, Sailin' Whalen called.
He remembered that the National Security
Agency had a file on the Valhalla Project.
It's in their database in Washington.
Looks like I have a little bit of hacking to do.
Kent.
What?
How?
All right. Well, we'll see you back here.
Canfield lost Dr. Wilder.
Judas Priest.
All right, well, see what you can get on the database.
- Jimmy, you feeling okay?
- Yeah.
Jimmy, I thought I told you to get some shuteye.
Yes, sir.
Mother, what are you doing?
How are we supposed to have this meeting with him in here?
Don't worry. Lars doesn't understand a word of English.
Isn't that so, you gorgeous blond moron?
That's right, I forgot.
Mother prefers men who don't talk back.
Mrs. Wilder, you have wasted enough of my time.
If you've perfected this technology to create the perfect assassin, show it to me now.
- Otherwise...
- Fair enough.
Get Jimmy Olsen on the phone.
Not only will I prove that our technology works...
...but I'll prove that our assassins will kill even their closest friends.
Daily Planet. Hold please.
- Jimmy, line one.
- What?
Line one for you.
Olsen.
I understand.
Hey, Jimmy. Where you going?
To see Lois. She needs me.
Well, this is the only book on Nordic myth your library has. What do you need it for?
I'm trying to find the code word that will let me access the files on Project Valhalla.
And you think they used one word associated with the myth?
Long shot?
Could you sharpen this pencil for me?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Here you go. Good as...
You got in?
I just typed in the word "Odin."
He's the Norse god who gave the Valkyries their orders, and voilà.
- Thank you.
- Well, you're welcome.
- Jimmy, you're friends with Lois Lane.
- Yes.
Would you please kill her?
Yes.
- Impressive, no?
- We'll see.
Hey, crazy boy, get out of the road!
One down, one to go.
Hey, Jimmy.
Are you here to see Lois too?
Look at this. It says the subject is triggered when they're given a code word.
They return to normal behavior once their mission is accomplished.
Excuse me.
Clark Kent.
Yeah, she's right here. It's for you.
Hello?
Yes.
A package on Lois' desk.
Yes, I understand.
Jimmy. What are you doing here?
I left my wallet here last night.
Really? Well, I didn't see it.
But come on in and take a look.
I was just about to get dressed.
Help yourself to some fruit.
This says there's a drug that can deactivate the Tycion serum.
Sarah.
Sarah, just relax.
Just put the gun down.
- What's going on?
- Somebody call Security.
- Yes, sir.
- What in the sam hill is going on out here?
She's been brainwashed, Chief.
All right. We better get the paramedics.
Are you okay?
Lucky she's a bad shot.
Where's Jimmy?
He went to see Lois.
No. Here.
All right. Come on, show's over.
Got a newspaper to put out.
Let's go. Come on. Come on.
I'm surprised Perry let you go out alone.
Did Katherine Wilder leave her house?
Come on, Jimmy. Jimmy, it's Lois.
You've been brainwashed.
Don't, Jimmy. Stay back.
No, Jimmy. Jimmy!
Jimmy, it's me, Lois.
Jimmy!
Whoa there, cowboy.
- Jimmy, take it easy.
- Jimmy, jump out the window.
- Lois?
- Come on.
Something tells me you folks aren't Jehovah's Witnesses.
Superman, what happened?
Well, for a minute there, Jimmy, you thought you could fly.
- Really? I wonder what got into me.
- You'd be surprised.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, honey.
Hey, Jimmy!
I thought I'd come by and cheer you up. How you feeling?
- Much better, Chief.
- I talked to your doctor.
He says you gonna be out of here, good as new, in a couple days.
It's great news?
Well, it...
...does have its downside.
Yeah, I'm gonna have to help him with his insecurities...
...about interpersonal relationships.
I bet you will. Well...
Jimmy, I just wanted you to know how...
...well...
...important you are to me, son.
And well, I...
I'm glad...
...you're doing okay.
- Okay?
- Thanks, Chief.
Okay.
So hey, what's the scoop around the office about Lois and Kent?
And used his heat vision to cut the cord.
I'd say that's good timing.
Speaking of timing, Lois...
...I know that mine wasn't very good last night.
You mean, when you went to get food as
I was about to reveal my intimate feelings?
You have every right to be angry, Lois.
I'm sorry.
Well, I appreciate you saying that, Clark.
- Help!
- Our relationship is very...
- Help me! Help me!
- You know... and I am so sorry right now.
Don't forget what you're about to say.
I'll be right back. I promise.
I'm sorry. I'll be right back.
Last time I saw that look, you stuck a plunger in my stomach.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I got information on Tycion I thought you might wanna know about.
The only thing I wanna know about is:
Would you like to go out?
- You mean, on a date?
- Yeah, on a date.
- Well, yeah. I mean...
- Great.
- You're on.
- Great.
Just out of curiosity, something happen that I should know about?
Come on.
- How about lunch. You hungry?
- Lunch is very good.
- What do you got in mind?
- Maybe ice cream.
Ice cream sounds good. Okay.
Did you ever try rocky road?
For those of you who were too fucking busy, this is what happened last week on Shameless.
I'm gonna give the baby up for adoption.
If there's a market for babies out there,
I'm gonna corner my share.
I'd kind of like to have a say in where this kid might end up.
What are you doing?
Sending cash
to my sons.
Frank gets none.
My fucking brothers?!
That bitch!
Presenting Frank and Monica Gallagher!
Holy shit.
Monica comes home long
enough to reunite with Frank,
gets knocked up with
another kid and then splits.
You look good, Moni.
You back on your meds?
I am not bipolar.
First thing she did-- bust my balls for kicking Lip out.
School or leave!
What are you doing?
I'm not going back to school, so...
I guess that means I'm leaving.
How long do you need to stay?
Just till I'm back on my feet.
It'll piss her off so much,
she'll be back at your doorstep
in a heartbeat.
Throw him out.
You don't always have to be responsible for everyone, Fiona.
Excuse me?
Monica's back. Enjoy it.
I'm here. Doesn't all have to fall on you.
I'm not in love with her,
but I shit myself
every time I think about what her dad would do if dumped her.
She doesn't love you, either.
She's got this other guy--
a Marco somebody.
I'm importing him to the States;
I'm gonna surprise her.
Leaving you free and clear.
So when he gets in, so do I. Deal.
Can't say he hasn't been working his fine ass off trying to win you back.
Where the hell
did you get all that?
I found it!
Where's the Squirrel Fund?
What the hell's a Squirrel Fund?
The first rule you
learn in this house, you hide the goddamn money!
You promised me.
Get out of bed!
Get out of bed, Mom!

Ha-ha! Two for two.
Hey, give me a turn.
Screw you.
I want to shoot a duck.
Go get your own gun, then.
At least give me a duck.
I fucking shot them.
It's my pool.
It's my dad's rifle.
You're an asshole.
An asshole who's eating duck for Thanksgiving tomorrow.
Yum!
Later.
Dick.
Monica?
Mom?
You okay?
I'm tired.
Made you breakfast.
It's been a few days.
It's toast with peanut butter!
Got a few jelly packets from Leo's diner.
I could get you one.
Mommy's not feeling too good right now.
What else did Grammy buy you guys?
Oh, I'm sorry, buddy, got to sell everything.
She still won't get out of her room.
I know what I want for Christmas.
I told you not to go up there.
Leave her alone.
Well, how's she gonna eat?
An AR-15 rifle.
She'll figure it out when she gets hungry. And no one's buying you a rifle.
Is something wrong with her?
She hasn't gotten out of bed in days.
Just what she does.
What is?
Little Hank has a rifle.
Little Hank's being raised by wolves.
Mom's bipolar, Debs.
Like the North and the South Pole?
Sort of.
Well, what can we do to help?
Not much. Just wait it out.
For how long?
Till she snaps out of it.
Which she always does.
It just takes time.
I wish Lip were here.
You should call him.
He'll know what to do.
There's nothing to do, Debs.
It is what it is.
Well...
I'll see if I can get her up.
Ian, don't...
Hey, Monica.
I want to go back to that bar tonight.
You know, the one you took me to?
Will you go with me?
Come on, it'll be fun.
You could wear that purple shirt.
Come on, Monica.
Here, you want some coffee?
Mmm.
Honey, Mom needs to rest.
Please?
All right.
Depression is hereditary.
Holy shit!
Look up the 10/22
Ruger target tactical rifle.
Get away from me. You had your turn all last night.
Geraldo, it's Fiona Gallaher.
Was just wondering if you...
Get away from me!
...have any extra shifts available?
Did she get up?
Uh, hang on a sec, Geraldo.
Hey, I need you to take the pool down-- there's homeless guy's bathing in it again.
I can't. Got to get to work.
Shit. Uh, sorry.
Anything would be great-- cleaning, front desk.
Whatever you got.
I think I'm depressed.
I've been feeling kind of funky lately.
Means you're gonna get your period soon.
It does?
Don't wear white for a while.
That sucks. All right, will you keep my name on the list?
Thanks, Geraldo.
Hello, my tribe.
Daddy! I'm gonna get my period soon.
No time for that now, Debs.
I fixed the Buick!
It's good as new!
Is, uh... is your mother upstairs?
Don't be getting her drunk-- it only makes things worse. It says depression is a symptom of menses.
Debs, wipe the memory on the computer.
Take it down to
Mr. Sam's Pawnshop.
See how much you can get for it.
What? No.
My X-box, too?
Everything.
Grammy bought us that stuff.
Yeah? Well, we have no money since Monica stole the Squirrel Fund, and we need to eat!
Is Lip coming home for Thanksgiving tomorrow?
I don't know.
Now, go. And when you get back, take the pool down before it freezes and cracks.
I don't know how!
You'll figure it out; it's not that hard.
Lip?
Go.
Monica, get up.
We're going on a road trip.
No. No.
We're gonna go see Clayton.
Moni...
No!
Back out of the rabbit hole.
Come on... up!
Up you go!
I need your help.
Remember,
I told you my mother mailed all her money to my brothers before she died?
Frank, leave me alone.
Well, that's ny money.
I deserve it.
I was with her on her death bed.
I paid the hospital bills and made the funeral arrangements.
P.U.!
A little ripe there.
We better get you in the shower.
No, Frank, please...
Honey, I need you to work your feminine wiles on Clayton.
He's always had a woody for you.
What are you doing with her?
Getting her out of the house.
A little sunshine.
A little vitamin D.
She needs to go back on her meds.
I'm her husband.
I think I know what's best.
Okay, you ready?
You can't lie down in the shower.
Also, you never use toilet paper on your dick after you take a piss.
You tap the end, let the drops fall off, flush.
- That's very fatherly.
- Is that really? - Yeah.
What you want to tell your kid?
Well, if it'll prevent him from being heckled in the locker room by other guys, absolutely.
Why'd the parents get you to make this stupid video anyway?
Oh, they didn't.
I thought of it on my own.
I wanted to give my son some tools to survive.
Hi. I'm Mandy.
I'm not your real mom.
She didn't want anything to do with you.
Look who's talking. Well, mine was barely a baby.
Like, eight cells or something.
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
Hey, come on, we need to finish the video.
Wouldn't it be cool if you're getting a blow job and talking to your kid at the same time?
Yeah, I guess we can finish the video later.
You know, this will be the third time we've been together.
Mm-hmm.
Usually after the third time, I either stop or we have to figure it out.
Figure it out?
Yeah.
Like, what we're doing and stuff.
Well, I thought we were just hanging out.
Maybe we should stop.
N-No, I don't want to stop.
So, uh, we're gonna figure it out and stuff?
Absolutely.
Yeah, coming.
Well, room service is getting hotter.
Is he here?
Uh, not at the moment, but yes.
He's been here for weeks now; why haven't you kicked him out like I said?
Because I don't do everything you tell me to do.
Since when?
How am I supposed to trust you if you don't keep your word?
I never said I would kick him out; in fact,
I was doing you a favor by letting him stay here.
Really? Because you're such an upstanding citizen?
What do you have him doing? Stealing cars?
Lip's a mess.
He's upset about Karen.
Drinking like a fish.
He'll be fine once he comes home.
Do you know anything about teenage boys?
You can't give them ultimatums.
Marco!
Oh, my God.
Here soon!
We pick up!
Yo, Marco, Marco.
Uh, you are?
Okay, yeah, we'll be right there.
Just...
Oh, hola, Fiona.
Yeah.
Listen, here's the thing, Fiona.
I want to be with you, but I'm not one of those kids you can just boss around.
I'm sorry, now I got to go pick up my wife's boyfriend.
How you doing there, Moni?
You hanging in?
Just think, in a few hours we're gonna be rich.
How much you think we can soak him for?
Once you turn on your charm, we can get whatever we want from Clayton.
I know my Monica.
Get anything from a man.
Hell, you took my heart.
Ahmoney from Clayton will be easy.
I can't, Frank.
Of course you can.
Have a little faith.
There is no God.
No, no, no, I'm saying.
Here.
Have a little faith.
# Hey, oh #
# Let's go #
# Hey, oh, let's go! #
Mr. Sam at the pawn shop's a douche.
Wouldn't trade me an iPad for a Ruger.
No one's gonna let you have a gun, Carl.
Little Hank gets to have one.
Because his dad hijacked a bunch of military cargo.
We got to empty the pool out, Conrad.
You guys got to get out of here.
Here, go screw this end of the hose into Tony's spigot so we can siphon the water out.
Or we could just do it this way.
Carl!
I'll patch it up next summer.
See ya.
Sorry we ruined your bathtub, Conrad.
It's okay; Il go down to the fountain in front of the Hyatt.
Hasn't frozen over yet.
Can't you just shower at the free clinic?
I like baths.
A childhood thing.
Why the long face?
I think I have depression.
It's hereditary.
My mother has it.
Well, come here, have a seat.
I can tell you a few things about depression.
Mind if you put your pants on first?
Hey, why are we meeting him here?
Well, he's paranoid that customs might've tailed him once he finally got out of the shipping container.
Is that him?
Este, Este, get out here.
Yep, yep,
I think this is him.
# Two, three four #
# Listen, baby #
# You know it's true #
# There's another side #
# It's all for you #
# Yes, it's true # My baby!
# All for you #
There's your five grand, my friend.
Oh, baby!
# You're the only one for me #
# Do-do-doo #
# Do-do-doo #
That's quite a homecoming.
True love.
# The only one for me #
Insert Scarface joke here.
# Do-do-doo #
Hey, how are you?
# You're the only one for me #
Grab that...
All right, you ready?
Surprise.
Aw, come on.
Aw, Jesus, Frank, what the fuc+ are you doing here?
Is that any way to greet your favorite brother?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You can't come in.
Frank.
Oh, Clayton.
Handsome as ever.
Why didn't you come by to visit Mommy when she was dying,
Clayton?
Because I didn't even know she was out of prison until after she was dead.
I had to take care of her all by myself.
I'm a little thirsty; is the kitchen in here?
Please, Monica, don't...
Heard she sent you, Wyatt and Jerry her money.
A few dollars, yeah.
Didn't leave me anything.
Is the wifey here?
No.
Work.
What was that?
Frank, what is she doing?
Seems to me it's only fair that you and I split the money, since I looked after Mommy on her death bed.
Wow, I've always wanted to try Veuve Clicquot.
Aw, we just bought that for Thanksgiving!
Oh. Happy Holidays.
Okay, really.
You have to go now.
Not without my share of the money.
I'm sorry,
Frank, there's nothing for me to give you.
Okay, the money's spent.
I used it to catch up on the mortgage.
Fine, be that way.
You don't want to give me any money, let it rest on your conscience, Clayton.
Now, I'm going to go to the bathroom, and then we will be out of your hair for good.
Long time, huh?
Come here, you.
Oh, Monica, don't do this.
Do what?
Get so close to me.
You mean like when we did
PCP at Comiskey Park and sold T-shirts?
You were quite the ladies' man then.
I'm not gonna give you any money.
Well, you know Frank is not gonna leave here without a couple thousands.
Oh, my God.
So, you might as well get your money's worth.
Monica, I-I can't.
I thought you couldn't resist me.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
No, I can't, I can't.
I-I'm married.
I-I have kids.
I'm sorry, you're gonna have to go.
Yeah?
What?
What are you doing?
Sweetheart, no, you can't lie down here.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
What-what are you doing?
No, no, no, no.
You got to get up; you can't lie down.
Honey, honey...
What did you do to her?
Nothing, we were just talking.
Hey, what's going on? Huh?
He didn't want me.
He didn't want me.
That's okay.
I'm an ugly old hag.
That is not true.
Yeah.
No, you're beautiful.
Fuck.
You are.
I'm gonna take you home.
Okay? It's okay.
I'm not finished with you yet.
Are you hungry, Marco?
Yeah, I don't think he really gives a shit about food right now.
All right.
Probably right.
Your sister's driving me crazy; I don't know what it's gonna take for her to trust me.
Again.
Can you blame her?
You know, you have a whole other family.
First, your name was
Steve, then Jimmy.
You know, you disappear to Brazil.
Come back married.
You know, it's kind of a tough way to build up trust.
I really am trustworthy, though.
Yeah, well, you're gonna have to do something bold to prove it.
Oh, my pussy for you.
Yeah, babe, like that.
All right, dude, you got to get me out of this car.
I'm getting too horned out; pull over here?
Fuck.
You ready to go home yet?
Are you trying to get rid of me?
Just wondering.
No, you know what,
I think I'm done living at home.
I like being on my own.
And by being on your own you mean sleeping on my couch at the Ritz?
See ya.
Mm, yeah?
Si, si!
Don't worry, this isn't too weird.
# Make her booty bounce, bounce, b-bounce, bounce #
# Make her booty bounce... #
So, what kind of stuffing should we make?
I like the one with sausage in it.
Then sausage we shall have.
Because I love you.
Thanks, Mom.
And I would never do anything to upset you or to hurt you.
Okay.
At least not on purpose.
I know.
That's not to say some urges might overtake me, and cause me to think unclearly and do things that I'm shamefully, shamefully embarrassed about.
Is this about you sleeping with Jody?
What?
No.... Yes.
Maybe.
You know about that?
Yeah, Mom.
Honey, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to.
It was an accident.
An accident where his penis slipped into your vagina?
Oh, God.
Hey.
Hey, what's going on?
My mom was just telling me how she fucked Jody.
Oh.
Sweetheart!
It was not like that.
Way to go, Sheila.
Oh!
You know what, Mom?
I don't care.
In fact, I want you to screw him more.
Screw him all the time.
Take him, he's yours.
Get him off my back.
Jody, get in here!
He's coming in here? Now?
Hey, I need to talk to you.
Why? You fuck my mom, too?
Yeah, payback's a bitch.
Are you having the baby?
No.
Help her with the stuffing or whatever it is that you guys do together.
Oh, okay.
Hi.
Hi.
Jesus.
So, what do you want?
I was wondering if you, uh, decided on a couple to give the baby to yet.
Yup.
Mark and Celeste.
Why them?
They gave me the most cash; eight grand.
Okay, but I was thinking, um, you know, maybe Jeff and Alana.
They only gave me, like, five.
Uh-huh, um, right, but, uh,
Jeff and Alana would be better parents.
Seems unfair they should get the kid if Mark and Celeste paid more.
Fine, if you're gonna pout about it, just give me your phone.
You're gonna call 'em now?
Might as well get it over with.
I scheduled a
C-section for Friday.
What?
I want this thing out of me.
I can't wait two weeks.
Holy shit.
I'm gonna see the little guy on Friday?
Yep, for, like, a second.
: Hi, Celeste, it's Karen Jackson.
Yeah, I decided to keep the baby.
I can't give it away, I'm so sorry.
Oh, thank you.
Yeah, you, too.
Bye.
Okay, where's the next number?
Hi, Fiona.
Hey, Debs, you're filthy.
Go take a shower.
Carl,
I took down half of the ol.
You have to do the rest.
Guess we're not having turkey tomorrow.
Too expensive. Got to use pawnshop money for the bills.
But it kind of looks like a turkey, doesn't it?
Yeah, it's pretty good.
This smells good.
Hey,
I'm selling those to
Mrs. Campbell over on Western.
20 bucks a pop.
So I'm not worried
I have depression anymore.
Why, what happened?
Talked to my friend Conrad.
Says depression usually skips a generation.
Conrad?
The homeless guy in our pool.
Okay.
And even if it doesn't skip a generation, it usually only runs in 20% of the family.
One in five-- those are okay odds.
Way I figure it, it's going to be Lip.
He's halfway there as it is.
Probably shouldn't have kicked him out.
It's Lip. Don't be a douche, leave a message.
Hope you know you're invited for Thanksgiving tomorrow.
Call me.
Love you.
Message deleted.
- We hope you enjoy your stay with us at the Ritz-Carlton. - Jesus, what are you, an old man?!
We're sure that our five-star...
Holy shit... they're still fucking?
Sometimes it's fighting. Can't really tell the difference.
Our hotel...
Wow.
Don't be rubbing your apple in there.
I can't listen to it from both sides.
Okay.
Hey, little guy.
Uh, I think I'm going to end this now
'cause you're coming into the world on Friday.
I hope I get to hang out with you for a few minutes before we hand you over to your new parents.
I think they're really going to take very good care of you.
You know, I wish
it could have been us.
But, um... well, things are pretty messed up around here, so...
Um...
You ever want to get in touch with me, though, that, that would be cool.
You know, just, uh, just look for this ugly mug.
You know, I'll be around.
I'm not going anywhere.
All right, take it easy, buddy.
English.
Marco, what's going on?
Wait, doesn't that fucking hu?
What?
Nothing.
Uh, Lip, what are they saying?
I think he's probably pissed because you fucked Estefania?
You fucked Estefania, too?
No, no, no.
He fucked Estefania.
Because we were married!
Estefania, get my gun.
He just told her to get his gun.
I know, he said it in English.
No, amor, no.
Listen to her, Marco.
Uh, uh, wait, wait, wait, w-wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Marco, you look like a reasonable man.
We can work this out.
Como?
How, man?
Uh, Lip, go to my bag.
Yep, okay.
Get my, uh, I.D. and passport.
Give it to Marco.
Marco, you're me now.
Take my identity, yeah.
It's your fucking picture here, man.
Little plastic surgery, new haircut, you'll be golden.
Yeah, I definitely see a resemblance.
And if Este's dad comes looking for you, Marco, she'll still be married to Steve
Wilton, the two of you will be safe.
That sounds like a foolproof plan.
We good?
Yeah.
I never want to see you again.
Yeah, not a problem.
Now, man.
The fuck you looking at, man?
Out, out!
Sure, yeah, right.
I'm-- just got to...
Okay.
What the hell was that?
You told me to do something bold.
# It's the universal blackness, au natural #

# It's the universal blackness, all natural... #

# It's the universal blackness... #
Hey, hot stuff.
What are you waiting for?
You want to go inside?
Come on.
Roger, he's with us.
I like my men red.
I'm gonna call you Ginger.
I'm so sorry, Frank.
It's okay, Moni, it's okay.
You, you don't have to keep apologizing.
But I've ruined everything.
No, we'll get the money from Clayton some other time.
Here, just...
Everything's...
Everything's gonna be fine.
You want a beer?
I'm .ot thirsty.
No one drinks beer because they're thirsty.
I got two more brothers we can get money from.
Jerry's weak.
He'll roll over quick.
Moni?
Monica?
Monica?
Monica.
Monica?
What are you doing under the stairs?
Come on, come on now, get out from there.
Monica, let's go upstairs.
I don't want to be me anymore.
# The first time ever #
# I saw your face #
# I thought the sun rose #
# In your eyes #
# And the moon and stars #
# Were the gift you gave #
# To the dark #
# And the empty skies, my love #
# To the dark #
# And the empty skies. #
Hey, Ginger, think fast.
Sweeplace you got.
Yeah, we have company condos all over the country.
Hmm, what do you do?
Real estate.
I live in Miami.
Hmm.
You mind if I, uh, sleep here for the night?
What, you don't like it at home?
Well, hey, that's no problem for me, huh?
We can go r round three, huh?
Come on.
Get it.
I can take you, brother.
All right!
I'm coming.
Who forgot their keys?
I kicked Lip out.
Where'd he go?
I don't know.
You don't know?
You didn't ask me to find out where he was going.
You asked me to kick him out.
You're right, I'm sorry.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
How'd he take it?
Seemed fine.
You want to go upstairs?
No, you got a thank-you kiss.
That's it?
What were you expecting?
Can I spend the night on your couch?
Why?
Then I'll be here tomorrow for Thanksgiving.
Who said you're invited?
I kicked Lip out.
I'll get you a pillow and blanket.
Hey.
Missed me, huh?
Yeah. Um, hey, look, is it... is it all right if I stay over tonight?
Couldn't go 12 hours without seeing me, could ya?
I shot a duck!
I shot a duck!
That's no duck.
That's a bald eagle.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Morning, Steve.
You know what, Debs?
Let's make it official.
No more Steve.
From now on, it's Jimmy.
Okay. Cool.
Really?
Yup.
To Jimmy!
To Jimmy!
Jimmy!
Cheers.
Cheers.
You know, I'm gonna call you
Jimmy pillow drooler.
Shut the fuck up.
I do not.
No, I swear to God.
This is you.
What are you doing over there?
What's it look like?
Plucking a bald eagle.
What?
Carl shot it in the yard.
With what?
That's against the law.
I already gave him a lecture.
And took out the bullets.
It says there was a re-release program in the Michigan peninsula.
Let out ten bald eagles that had been raised in the Detroit Zoo into the wild.
And one of them came to me last night.
You know, there is something on his leg.
That's a tracking device.
That way, they can monitor where it nests.
So, somebody knows that we have it?
Probably.
Uh, it must have hurt, huh, buddy?
Got him on my first shot.
Says tampering with a bald eagle tracker is punishable by law.
Problem solved.
Here, Carl, get rid of the evidence.
Eww!
Guess we can save this for the weekend.
Why? What are we having for Thanksgiving?
No, no, no, no, no. No.
It's just like the pilgrims intended.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Hmm.
Oh.
Stop it.
I'm not in the mood.
You're always in the mood.
How about a little handy J?
You don't have to do anything.
I'll do all the work.
That's a girl.
Moni, you got to squeeze a little.
Mm.
Time for you to go back on your meds, huh?
Yeah.
Okay.
I'll get you some.
When should we tell Ian?
Tell him what?
About us?
Yo.
Get the hell out!
What, are you
Gallagher hopping, Mandy?
Dad said you had to knock before you came in.
Need someone to do a beer run.
Yeah, just 'cause you two retards have DUIs don't make me your personal chauffeur.
No, I'll do it.
Yeah, cool.
Yeah.
Thanks.
We can go get breakfast burritos at Juan's truck after.
- I didn't know you could do that with a turkey baster. - Oh, honey...
Frank.
Sheila.
What are you doing here?
I came by to wish you... happy Thanksgiving!
Happy Thanksgiving, Frank.
What the hell is he doing here?
Where have you been?
Oh, Sheils.
I... I really didn't want to have to tell you this.
What? That
Monica's back?
You heard about that?
Yes.
Oh.
Are you... are you mad?
- I'm not, actually.
- Yeah.
Mom fucked my ex.
You slept with Lip?
Oh, God, no.
It was me.
You slept with him?
Yes.
Yes, I did.
Oh, my God!
Sheila!
How could you do this to me?
My heart-- it's broken.
I'm probably gonna go through a lot of depression over this.
Oh, God. Could use some antidepressants.
Lithium... if you've got it?
All right, okay, Frank.
God!
Frank, please don't be upset with Sheila.
It's my fault.
Shit! Fuck! Cock!
Did I just piss myself?
It's the baby.
Oh!
Honey, you're gonna have the baby!
I'll go get your suitcase.
Oh, my God!
I'm gonna be a grandma.
Yeah, I know.
This is exciting!
Hey.
I got your suitcase!
I got your suitcase!
Okay, okay.
Sweetie...
Somebody get some towels or something.
We'll be right back.
Want anything?
Uh...Too bad.
What should we do this weekend?
Karen's actually having the baby tomorrow.
So...
Whatime?
Want to see a movie after?
I-I guess?
Okay, cool.
Whoa. Mandy, come on.
Your brothers are right there.
I'll be fast.
Seriously. They're, like,
20 feet away. Come on.
What the fuck?!
Open the fucking register!
Let's go! Let's go!
Mandy, I thought you said they were getting beer.
A euphemism.
Come on, old man!
Let's go! Pick it all up!
Jesus!
Shit!
Where the hell are you going?!
We got to get out of here!
Get back in the car!
Got to get out.
No fucking way!
You're gonna fuck me and walk away?
Fuck you!
Asshole, Lip! Eat shit.
Mandy!
Hello?
Wait. She is?
Oh, my God.
All right, the baby, yeah.
Um...
All right, all right,
I'll be right there.
Didn't take much stuffing.
How long we supposed to cook it for?
20 minut a pound for turkey.
We are not having bald eagle for Thanksgiving. Here.
Whoa, this thing's huge.
You're welcome, Tiny Tim.
What are we supposed to do with this?
Toss it?
Hell, no. Hunt it, kill it, eat it. The hunter's code.
There's no way we're gonna let the most sacred symbol of
American freedom and individual liberty go to waste.
I'll put it in the freezer.
We got Thanksgiving!
Christ Almighty, this cock sucker's killing me.
Oh, my gosh, it's so exciting.
I can hardly contain myself.
Mom, I'm supposed to be the one breathing.
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I'm just so excited and nervous.
And out of the house.
Damn, that thing really opens up.
Get the hell away from me.
Sorry.
Mother fucking piece of shit!
We got a big turkey.
We got a big turkey.
Where have you been?
Out.
Did you come home last night?
No.
You even think to call?
I'm here now.
Wasn't gonna miss a family holiday.
Come here.
Happy Thanksgiving.
It's a ne hickey. Go wash up.
Should I set a place for Lip?
Sure, sweetie.
You better not have started without me.
Frank?
Hey!
Daddy!
You're gonna come to dinner?
Of course I am, son.
And so's your mother.
Lithium?
Moni,
I got your medications.
Mom's under the stairs?
How long has she been under there?
Here you go, sweetheart.
Here's your candy.
That should do it.
Get out of there.
Get out of there.
No, Fiona.
No, Fiona! No!
Come on out. Come on.
No!
Get out of there.
Come on.
No!
Come on.
Fiona.
Up you go.
Up you go. Come on.
I look a mess.
No, you do not.
You look beautiful. Doesn't she look beautiful, kids?
You look great.
Yeah.
Yeah. Hi, Mom.
You're not spending Thanksgiving under the stairs, okay?
Debs, set a place for Monica.
We're all having dinner together.
With the kids at the table.
That's right.
You're gonna sit right here.
Well, then, happy Thanksgiving.
Happy Thanksgiving!
Who's hungry? I...
Yeah.
Sorry. Hi, Jeff. Alana.
Hey.
Sheila called us.
Can't believe it's happening so fast.
I don't, either.
You guys coming in?
Karen didn't want us in there.
They told us to wait out here.
Okay.
She's in room 803.
Right. Oh, hey, um,
I wanted to give you guys something.
Uh, made this for the baby.
Um, if you guys could give it to him at some point, you know, if you feel like it.
Yeah. Thank you, Lip.
Yeah, we will.
Cool. Um, I should go in.
Go!
Here we go!
Good job, baby.
Can't wait to get that turkey in me.
You okay?
Ah! We haven't said grace yet.
I'll say it.
I'll say the grace.
Hold hands.
Dear Lord,
Thank you for this food that we're about to eat.
Thank you for bringing my Monica back to me.
And please make my brother
Clayton burn in hell for all eternity when the time comes.
Amen.
Amen.
Are you gonna carve the turkey?
I'm starving.
I'm carving.
I am the man of the house.
I'm gonna go wash my hands.
Fiona, is Lip coming?
Want me to call him?
Yeah.
Uh, he knows what time we're eating.
Mashed potatoes, please.
Who likes dark meat?
Me!
Ooh, me, too.
And on my turkey, also.
I invited Conrad. Is that okay?
Conrad?
My homeless guy from the pool.
Coming...
Sure, Debs.
Conrad, how are you?
Hi, Deb.
Hi.
Everyone, this is Conrad.
Hi, Conrad.
Much better than bald eagle.
Hey, we're still eating that.
We're gonna roast it, bake it, fry it.
I don't care, but we're really gonna eat it.
Bet it tastes like chicken.
Well, we could always have it for Christmas.
What was that?
I'm just gonna put all of this on this one plate, and then everybody could...
Holy fuck!
What?
Give me a phone.
Give me a phone.
Come on, guys, upstairs.
Upstairs, kids.
Okay, uh, fuck!
We're good. We're good.
We're good. Don't worry.
More towels.
- Shit!
- There's been an accident.
All right.
2119 North Wallace.
She's bleeding badly.
Yeah, she's awake.
Uh...
Frank, more towels!
Towels! Will somebody give me a fucking towel?
Frank, they want to know if she took any pills.
Dad! Dad?!
You're good.
I'm not sure.
Can you see me?
Can you see me?
Help me with her feet,
Frank. Frank?
Get... Get over here!
You with me?
You with me? Breathe.
You're gonna be good, okay?
Slow, slow. You're gonna be good. It's just... It's fine.
You're fine. You're fine.
Why didn't Frank come?
I don't know, Debs.
Holy fuck.
Dude, if you say that one more time, I'm gonna throw you in the oven with that turkey when we get home, okay?
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
You try Lip again?
Yeah, just left a message.
Miss Gallagher?
Debs, stay with me.
How is she?
She's stable.
Oh, thank God.
We're gonna hold her for 72 hours, make sure she doesn't try to harm herself again.
She's bipolar?
Okay, we'll get her back on her meds and leveled out.
Can we see her?
No, not right now.
She's heavily sedated.
You should go home. Excuse me.
You okay?
Lip just called.
He's coming?
Karen's having her baby upstairs.
Holy fuck!
Is Maternity this way?
I'm gonna be an aunt!
I'm gonna have a nephew I can beat up.
Why can't I just get a C-section?
You're too far along, sweetie.
- Sometimes Mother Nature has other plans, honey. - Fuck Mother Nature!
- She doesn't have to worry about her vagina getting stretched. - Ow!
You were already pretty stretched out down there, Karen.
I want drugs!
Give me drugs!
Sweetie, push!
You're almost there. Push!
I am pushing, bitch.
Oh, I can see his head.
Oh, my God, the miracle of birth, sweetie!
It's so beautiful.
More visitors.
Hey, sweetheart!
Oh, the Gallaghers!
It's a party!
I'm gonna be a grandma!
Great. Let's just have the whole
Fighting Illini marching band in while we're at it!
Lip!
Look, my baby boy's come out.
Ew.
Vagina.
Sorry we didn't have time to buy you any cigars, man.
Oh, no worries, man.
That's right, all you guys just fucking whoop it up while I'm sitting in here!
Fucking fuck!
Okay, it's coming.
It's coming. It's coming!
Breathe, Karen.
You keep breathing, fuck nut!
Shit, I don't know if I ever wanna do this now.
One more big push, Karen.
Um, Doctor?
What's going on?
Is he okay?
Oh, no.
That thing looks weird.
I think he looks beautiful.
What's wrong with him?
He has Down Syndrome, Debs.
Yeah, and he's Asian.
Maybe we're just looking at him upside down.
Here you go, honey, you can hold him now.
No, no, I don't want to touch him.
You should hold him and say good-bye.
Just take him away.
What the fuck, Karen,
I thought you said it was mine?!
I screwed Timmy Wong as much as I screwed you.
I never said it was your baby.
You just wanted it to be.
Go tell Jeff and Alana to come get their fucking baby.
# The fire, the wine, the bed and you... #
# This crimson light,
I find the truth #
# And truth is like a punch or two #
Lip?
# It hits you hard and knocks you through #
Let him go.
# So I get on the road and ride to you #
# I get on the road and ride to you #
# One tender payment for our sins #
# You are the drug that I can't quit #
# So I get on the road and ride to you #
# I get on the roadand right #
# The wheel, it settles in my hands #
# This is the measure of this man #
# I point the car at north, at you #
# My route has scarred the country through #
Come on, Sheila! Hurry up!
I got the baby!
I got the baby! I got the baby!
Come on! Come on!
Oh, my God!
Oh, Lord!
# My route has scarred the country through #

Last night, I dreamt I went to Manderley again.
It seemed to me I stood by the iron gate leading to the drive,
and for a while, I could not enter, for the way was barred to me.
Then, like all dreamers,
I was possessed of a sudden with supernatural powers
and passed like a spirit through the barrier before me.
The drive wound away in front of me,
twisting and turning as it had always done.
But as I advanced,
I was aware that a change had come upon it.
Nature had come into her own again, and little by little
had encroached upon the drive with long, tenacious fingers.
On and on wound the poor thread that had once been our drive,
and finally, there was Manderley.
Manderley, secretive and silent.
Time could not mar the perfect symmetry of those walls.
Moonlight can play odd tricks upon the fancy,
and suddenly it seemed to me that light came from the windows.
And then a cloud came upon the moon
and hovered an instant like a dark hand before a face.
The illusion went with it.
I looked upon a desolate shell
with no whisper of the past about its staring walls.
We can never go back to Manderley again.
That much is certain.
But sometimes in my dreams,
I do go back
to the strange days of my life
which began for me in the South of France.
No! Stop!
What the devil are you shouting about?
Who are you? 
What are you staring at?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to stare, but I... I only thought...
Oh, you did, did you?
Well, what are you doing here?
I was only walking.
Well, get on with your walking.
Don't hang about here screaming.
I'll never come to Monte Carlo out of season again.
Not a single well-known personality in the hotel.
Stone cold. Waiter!
Garçon! Call him.
Tell him to get me some...
Why, it's Max de Winter.
How do you do?
How do you do?
I'm Edythe Van Hopper.
It's so nice to run into you here, just when I was beginning to despair of finding any old friends here in Monte.
But do sit down and have some coffee.
Mr. de Winter is having some coffee with me.
Go and ask that stupid waiter for another cup.
I'm afraid I must contradict you.
You shall both have coffee with me.
Garçon. Coffee, please.
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.
You know, I recognized you just as soon as you came in, though I haven't seen you since that night at the casino at Palm Beach.
Perhaps you don't remember an old woman like me.
Are you playing the tables much here at Monte?
No. I'm afraid that sort of thing ceased to amuse me years ago.
I can well understand that.
As for me, if I had a home like Manderley,
I should certainly never come to Monte.
I hear it's one of the biggest places in that part of the country, and you just can't beat it for beauty.
What do you think of Monte Carlo?
Or don't you think of it at all?
Well, I think it's rather artificial.
She's spoiled, Mr. de Winter, that's her trouble.
Most girls will give their eyes for a chance to see Monte.
Wouldn't that rather defeat the purpose?
Now that we've found each other again,
I hope I shall see something of you.
You must come and have a drink in my suite.
I hope they've given you a good room.
The place is empty, so if you're uncomfortable, mind you make a fuss.
Your valet has unpacked for you, I suppose?
I'm afraid I don't possess one.
Perhaps you would like to do it for me?
Well, I... I hardly think...
Perhaps you could make yourself useful to Mr. de Winter if he wants anything done.
You're a capable child in many ways.
That's a charming suggestion, but I'm afraid I cling to the old motto,
"He travels fastest who travels alone."
Perhaps you've not heard it. Good night.
What do you make of that?
Do you suppose that sudden departure was intended to be funny?
Come, don't sit there gawking, let's go upstairs.
- Have you got the key?
- Yes, Mrs. Van Hopper.
I remember, when I was younger, there was a well-known writer who used to dart down the back way whenever he saw me coming.
I suppose he was in love with me and wasn't quite sure of himself.
Well, c'est la vie.
By the way, my dear, don't think that I mean to be unkind, but you were just a teeny-weeny bit forward with Mr. de Winter.
Your effort to enter the conversation quite embarrassed me, and I'm sure it did him.
Men loathe that sort of thing.
Oh, come, don't sulk. After all,
I am responsible for your behavior here.
Perhaps he didn't notice it.
Poor thing, I suppose he just can't get over his wife's death.
They say he simply adored her.
Oh... How awkward of me.
What a stupid thing to do.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Please don't bother.
It doesn't really matter.
No, leave that, leave that.
Go and lay another place at my table.
- Mademoiselle will have lunch with me.
- Oh, but I couldn't possibly.
- Why not?
- Oh, well, please don't be polite. I...
It's very kind of you but I'll be all right if they just change the cloth.
I wasn't being polite.
I should have asked you to have lunch with me even if you hadn't upset the vase so clumsily.
Come along.
We needn't talk to each other if we don't feel like it.
Well, thank you very much.
Oh, I... I'll just have some scrambled eggs.
Oui, mademoiselle.
- What's happened to your friend?
- She's ill in bed with a cold.
I'm sorry I was so rude to you yesterday.
The only excuse I can offer is that
I've become boorish through living alone.
You weren't really.
You simply wanted to be alone and...
Tell me, is Mrs. Van Hopper a friend of yours or just a relation?
No, she's my employer.
I'm what is known as "a paid companion."
I didn't know companionship could be bought.
I looked at the word "companion" in the dictionary once.
It said, "a friend of the bosom."
I don't envy you the privilege.
Well, she's very kind, really, and I have to earn my living.
Haven't you any family?
No. My mother died years and years ago, and there was only my father, and he died last summer.
And then I took this job.
How rotten for you.
Yes, it was rather, because, you see, we got on so well together.
You and your father?
Yes. He was a lovely person, very unusual.
- What was he?
- A painter.
Was he a good one?
Well, I thought so, but people didn't understand him.
Yes, that's often the trouble.
He painted trees. At least, it was one tree.
You mean, he painted the same tree over and over again?
Yes. You see, he had a theory that if you should find one perfect thing or place or person, you should stick to it.
Do you think that's really silly?
Not at all.
I'm a firm believer in that myself.
And what did you find to do with yourself while he was painting his tree?
Well, I sat with him and I sketched a little.
I don't do it very well, though.
Were you going sketching this afternoon?
Yes.
- Where?
- Well, I haven't made up my mind.
I'll drive you somewhere in the car.
Oh, no, please, I didn't mean...
Oh, nonsense. Finish up that mess, and we'll get along.
Thank you. It's very kind of you, but I'm not very hungry.
Come on. Eat it up like a good girl.
You've taken long enough for that sketch.
I shall expect a really fine work of art.
Oh, no, don't look at it.
It's not nearly good enough.
Well, it can't be as bad as all that.
Now don't rub it all out.
Let me see it first.
Well, it's the perspective.
I never can get it right.
Let me see it, let me see it.
Oh, dear.
Tell me, is it the perspective that gives my nose that curious twist in the middle?
Well, you're not a very easy subject to sketch. Your...
Your expression keeps changing all the time.
Does it?
Well, I'd... I'd concentrate on the view instead, if I were you.
Much more worthwhile.
It rather reminds me of our coastline at home.
Do you know Cornwall at all?
Yes, I went there once with my father on holiday.
I was in a shop once, and I saw a postcard with a beautiful house on it, right by the sea.
I asked whose house it was, and the old lady said, "That's Manderley."
I felt ashamed for not knowing.
Manderley is beautiful.
But to me, it's just the place where I was born, and have lived in all my life.
But now, I don't suppose
I shall ever see it again.
We're lucky not to be home during the bad weather, aren't we?
I can't ever remember enjoying swimming in England till June, can you?
The water's so warm here that I could stay in all day.
There's a dangerous undertow and there was a man drowned here last year.
I never have any fear of drowning.
Have you?
Come, I'll take you home.
Oh, yes, I know Mr. de Winter well.
I knew his wife, too.
Before she married, she was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth, you know.
She was drowned, poor dear, while she was sailing near Manderley.
He never talks about it, of course, but he's a broken man.
I suppose I'd better have it.
Wretched stuff!
Give me a chocolate, quick!
Oh, there you are. It's about time.
Hurry up. I want to play some rummy.
She was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth, you know.
They say he simply adored her.
She was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth, you know.
I suppose he just can't get over his wife's death.
She was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth, you know.
But he's a broken man.
Bonjour.
- Well, where are you going?
- I thought I'd take a tennis lesson.
I see.
I suppose you've had a look at the pro, and he's desperately handsome, and you've conceived a schoolgirl crush on him.
All right. Go ahead.
Make the most of it.
Off duty?
Well, yes. Mrs. Van Hopper's cold's turned into flu, so she's got a trained nurse.
I'm sorry for the nurse.
You keen on tennis?
- Well, not particularly.
- That's good. We'll go for a drive.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Van Hopper.
How are you feeling?
You got on rather well with him, didn't you?
That pro must have been teaching you other things than tennis.
Hurry up, I want you to make some calls.
I wonder if Mr. de Winter is still in the hotel.
May I go now?
For the number of lessons you've had, you ought to be ready for Wimbledon.
But this will be your last, so make the most of it.
The trouble is, with me laid up like this, you haven't had enough to do.
I'm getting rid of that nurse today.
And from now on, you'll stick to your job.
Yes, Mrs. Van Hopper.
- Nurse?
- Yes, Mrs. Hopper?
Are you absolutely sure you left those messages for Mr. de Winter?
- Why, yes, madame.
- I simply can't believe it.
He would most certainly have called me back.
Oh, well. Poor boy, I simply hate to see him so alone.
You know, I...
I wish there could be an invention that bottled up the memory, like perfume, and it never faded, never got stale.
Then whenever I wanted to,
I could uncork the bottle and live the memory all over again.
And what particular moment in your young life would you want to keep?
All of them. All these last few days.
I feel as though I'd... I'd collected a whole shelf full of bottles.
Sometimes, you know, those little bottles contain demons that have a way of popping out at you, just as you're trying most desperately to forget.
Stop biting your nails.
I wish I were a woman of 36, dressed in black satin with a string of pearls.
You wouldn't be here with me if you were.
Would you please tell me, Mr. de Winter, why you asked me to come out with you?
It's obvious you want to be kind, but why do you choose me for your charity?
I asked you to come out with me because I wanted your company.
You've blotted out the past for me more than all the bright lights of Monte Carlo.
But if you think I just asked you out of kindness or charity, you can leave the car now and find your own way home.
Go on. Open the door and get out.
- Better blow your nose.
- Thank you.
Please don't call me Mr. de Winter.
I have a very impressive array of first names.
George Fortescue Maximilian.
You needn't bother with them all at once.
My family call me Maxim.
And another thing, please promise me never to wear black satin or pearls, or to be 36 years old.
Yes, Maxim.
For the love of Pete! Come here!
What do you think?
My daughter's engaged to be married.
Oh, really? How nice!
We must leave for New York at once.
Get reservations on the Aquitania, and we'll take the 12:30 train for Cherbourg.
Hurry up and get me the maid to help with the packing.
We've no time to waste.
Go on and don't dawdle.
Mr. de Winter, please.
He's gone out riding?
He won't be back till noon?
Give me the porter, please.
I'll go and see if there's anything left in my room.
Has Mr. de Winter come in yet?
Oh, he has?
Would you connect me, please?
I was looking for my book.
I suppose I've packed it.
Well, come on, the car's waiting at the door.
I'd like to leave a forwarding address, if they happen to find that book.
- Would you ring Mr. de Winter, please?
- Yes, madame.
- There isn't any answer.
- Thank you.
- Tell her to hurry up!
- Yes, madame.
I was looking for Mr. de Winter.
Mr. de Winter just ordered breakfast in his room, mademoiselle.
Come in.
Hello. What are you doing here?
Anything the matter?
I've come to say goodbye.
We're going away.
What on Earth are you talking about?
It's true. We're going now, and I was afraid
I wouldn't see you again.
- Where's she taking you to?
- New York. I don't want to go.
I shall hate it.
I shall be miserable.
I'll dress in here.
I shan't be long.
Which would you prefer,
New York or Manderley?
Oh, please don't joke about it.
Mrs. Van Hopper's waiting.
I'd better say goodbye now.
I'll repeat what I said.
Either you go to America with Mrs. Van Hopper, or you come home to Manderley with me.
You mean you want a secretary or something?
I'm asking you to marry me, you little fool.
Come in.
Is that my food? I'm famished.
I didn't have any breakfast.
My suggestion didn't seem to go at all well. Sorry.
Oh, but you don't understand.
It's the...
- I'm not the sort of person men marry.
- What on Earth do you mean?
I don't belong in your sort of world, for one thing.
Well, what is my sort of world?
Well, Manderley. You know what I mean.
Well, I'm the best judge of whether you belong there or not.
Of course, if you don't love me, that's a different thing.
Fine blow to my conceit, that's all.
I do love you.
I love you most dreadfully.
I've been crying all morning because I thought I'd never see you again.
Bless you for that.
I'll remind you of this one day and you won't believe me.
It's a pity you have to grow up.
Well, now that's settled.
You may pour me out some coffee.
Two lumps of sugar and some milk, please.
Same with my tea, don't forget.
Who is going to break the news to Mrs. Van Hopper?
Shall you or should I?
You tell her. She'll be so angry.
What's the number of her room?
She's not there.
She's downstairs in the car.
Hello. Give me the desk, please.
Hello. You'll find Mrs. Van Hopper waiting outside in her car.
Would you ask her, with my compliments, if she'd very kindly come up and see me in my room?
Yes, in my room.
Mr. de Winter says please for you to come up to his room.
Mr. de Winter?
Why, certainly.
This isn't at all your idea of a proposal, is it?
It should be in a conservatory, you in a white frock, with a red rose in your hand, and a violin playing in the distance, and I should be making violent love to you behind a palm tree.
Poor darling. Never mind.
I don't mind.
Don't worry. Don't worry.
You won't have to say a word.
I'm so glad you called me, Mr. de Winter.
I was making a hasty departure.
It was so rude of me not to let you know.
But a cable came this morning announcing that my daughter is engaged to be married.
That's rather a coincidence, Mrs. Van Hopper.
I asked you up here in order to tell you of my engagement.
You don't mean it.
How perfectly wonderful.
How romantic. Who is the lucky lady?
I apologize for depriving you of your companion in this abrupt way.
I do hope it won't inconvenience you too greatly.
When did all this happen?
Just now, Mrs. Van Hopper.
Just a few minutes ago.
I simply can't believe it.
And I suppose I ought to scold you for not having breathed a word of all of this to me.
What am I thinking of?
I should give you both my congratulations and my blessings.
I'm very happy for you both.
- When and where is the wedding to be?
- Here, as soon as possible.
A whirlwind romance. Splendid!
I can easily postpone my sailing for a week.
This poor child has no mother, so I shall take responsibility for all the arrangements.
Trousseau, reception and everything, and I'll give the bride away.
But our luggage.
Go down and tell the porter to take everything out of the car.
Just a minute.
We're most grateful, Mrs. Van Hopper, but I think we'd both prefer to have it all as quiet as possible.
And I couldn't possibly allow you to change your sailing plans.
- Oh, but...
- No, no, no.
Dear, I'll go down and see that your luggage is brought back.
Thank you, Maxim.
So this is what's been happening during my illness.
Tennis lessons, my foot.
I suppose I've to hand it to you for a fast worker.
How did you manage it?
Still waters certainly run deep.
Tell me, have you been doing anything you shouldn't?
- I don't know what you mean.
- Well, never mind.
I always did say that Englishmen have strange tastes.
You certainly have your work cut out as mistress of Manderley.
To be perfectly frank with you, my dear,
I can't see you doing it.
You haven't the experience, you haven't the faintest idea what it means to be a great lady.
Of course you know why he's marrying you, don't you?
You haven't flattered yourself that he's in love with you?
Fact is, that empty house got on his nerves to such an extent, he nearly went off his head.
He just couldn't go on living alone.
You'd better leave, Mrs. Van Hopper.
You'll miss your train.
Mrs. de Winter.
Goodbye, my dear, and good luck!
Monsieur!
What is he saying?
He says I've forgotten the proof that we're married.
Good heavens.
Somebody else had the same idea.
- Isn't she sweet?
- Yes.
You'd have liked a bridal veil, wouldn't you?
Or at least...
Oh, Maxim, how lovely.
How perfectly lovely.
Perfectly lovely.
- Welcome home, Mr. de Winter.
- Thank you, Smith.
- Cold, darling?
- Yes, just a little bit.
There's no need to be frightened, you know.
Just be yourself, and they'll all adore you.
You don't have to worry about the house at all.
Mrs. Danvers is the housekeeper.
Just leave it to her.
Hello. It's starting to rain.
We'd better hurry up.
Here. Have this. Put it over your head.
Thank you.
That's it. That's Manderley.
- Here we are. Frith, everybody well?
- Yes, thank you, sir.
Glad to see you home, sir.
- This is Mrs. de Winter, Frith.
- How do you do?
I didn't expect the whole staff to be in attendance.
Mrs. Danvers' orders, sir.
Oh. Sorry about this.
It won't take long.
This is Mrs. Danvers.
How do you do?
How do you do?
I have everything in readiness for you.
That's very good of you.
I... I didn't expect anything.
- I think we'd like some tea, Frith.
- Ready in the library, sir.
Come along, darling.
Oh, Maxim, come in.
Oh.
- Good evening, Mrs. Danvers.
- Good evening, madam.
- I hope Alice was satisfactory, madam.
- Oh, yes, thank you, perfectly.
She's the parlor maid.
She'll have to look after you until your own maid arrives.
Oh, but I haven't a maid.
I'm sure Alice will do very nicely.
I'm afraid that would not do for very long, madam.
It's usual for ladies in your position to have a personal maid.
I hope you approve the new decoration of these rooms, madam?
Oh, I didn't know it had been changed.
I hope you haven't been to too much trouble.
I only followed out
Mr. de Winter's instructions.
Well, what did it look like before?
It had an old paper and different hangings.
It was never used much except for occasional visitors.
Oh. Then it wasn't
Mr. de Winter's room originally?
No, madam.
He's never used the east wing before.
Of course, there's no view of the sea from here.
The only good view of the sea is from the west wing.
The room's very charming, and I'm sure I'll be comfortable.
If there's anything you want done, madam, you have only to tell me.
I suppose you've been at Manderley for many years, longer than anyone else.
Not so long as Frith.
He was here when the old gentleman was living, when Mr. de Winter was a boy.
Oh, I see.
And you didn't come till after that?
I came here when the first Mrs. de Winter was a bride.
Mrs. Danvers, I do hope we'll be friends.
You must be patient with me.
This sort of life is new to me and I do want to make a success of it, and make Mr. de Winter happy, so I know I can leave all the household arrangements to you.
Very well. I hope I shall do everything to your satisfaction, madam.
I've managed the house since Mrs. de Winter's death and Mr. de Winter has never complained.
I think I'll go downstairs now.
That room in the west wing I was telling you about is there, through that door.
It's not used now.
It's the most beautiful room in the house, the only one that looks down across the lawns to the sea.
It was Mrs. de Winter's room.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- You're Mrs. de Winter, aren't you?
- Yes.
My name's Crawley.
I manage the estate for Maxim.
Awfully glad to meet you.
A fearful lot of stuff piled up while Maxim was away.
Yes, I'm sure there must have been.
I do wish I could help with some of it.
No, no! Frank never allows anybody to help him.
He's like an old mother hen with his bills and rents and taxes.
Come on, Frank, we must go over these estimates.
I'll get my papers.
You'll find quantities of breakfast over there.
But you must eat it all, or Cook will be mortally offended.
I'll do my best, Maxim.
I have to go over the place with Frank, just to make sure that he hasn't lost any of it.
You'll be all right, won't you?
Getting acquainted with your new home?
Have a look at The Times.
There's a thrilling article on what's the matter with English cricket.
Oh, yes...
My sister, Beatrice, and her husband, Giles Lacy, have invited themselves over for lunch.
- Today?
- Yes.
I suppose the old girl can't wait to look you over.
You'll find her very direct.
If she doesn't like you, she'll probably tell you so to your face.
Don't worry, darling,
I'll be back in time to protect you from her.
- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye, Maxim.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Good morning, madam.
- Good morning, Frith.
Isn't there anything
I could get for you, madam?
No, thank you, Frith.
I'm really not very hungry.
Thank you.
- The paper, madam.
- Oh, yes. Thank you, Frith.
I slipped.
Thank you, Frith.
- It's big, isn't it?
- Yes, madam, Manderley is a big place.
This was the banquet hall in the old days.
It's still used on great occasions, such as a big dinner or a ball.
And the public is admitted here, you know, once a week.
That's nice.
I beg pardon, madam.
I'm afraid the fire is not usually lit in the library until the afternoon.
But you'll find one in the morning room.
Of course, if you wish this fire lit now, madam...
No, Frith, I wouldn't dream of it.
Mrs. de Winter...
I mean, the late Mrs. de Winter always did her correspondence and telephoning in the morning room, after breakfast.
Thank you, Frith.
Is anything wrong, madam?
Oh, no. Which way is the morning room?
Oh, it's that door there, on the left.
Oh, yes, thank you.
Mrs. de Winter?
Oh, I'm afraid you've made a mistake.
Mrs. de Winter's been dead for over a year.
Oh, I mean...
Oh.
That was the house telephone, madam.
Probably the head gardener wishing instructions.
Did you want to see me, Mrs. Danvers?
Mr. de Winter informed me that his sister,
Mrs. Lacy, and Major Lacy are expected for luncheon.
I'd like to know if you approve of the menu.
Oh, well, I'm sure it's very suitable, very nice indeed.
You will notice, madam, that I've left a blank space for the sauce.
Mrs. de Winter was most particular about sauces.
Let's have whatever you think that Mrs. de Winter would have ordered.
Thank you, madam.
When you've finished your letters,
Robert will take them to the post.
My... My letters?
Oh, yes, of course.
Thank you, Mrs. Danvers.
- How are you, Frith?
- Good morning, Mrs. Lacy.
Where's Mr. de Winter?
I believe he went down to the farm with Mr. Crawley.
How tiresome of him not to be here when we arrive, and how typical.
I must say old Danvers keeps the house looking lovely.
She's certainly learned that trick of arranging flowers from Rebecca.
I wonder how she likes it now, being ordered about by an ex-chorus girl.
Now, where on Earth did you get the idea she's an ex-chorus girl?
He picked her up in the South of France, didn't he?
What if he did?
Well, I mean to say, there you are.
How do you do? I'm Maxim's wife.
How do you do?
Well, I must say you're quite different from what I expected.
Don't be so silly.
She's exactly what I told you she'd be.
Well, how do you like Manderley?
It's very beautiful, isn't it?
And how do you get along with Mrs. Danvers?
Well, I...
I've never met anyone quite like her before.
You mean, she scares you.
She's not exactly an oil painting, is she?
Giles, you're very much in the way here.
Go somewhere else.
Well, I'll try and find Maxim, shall I?
Giles.
I didn't mean to say anything against Mrs. Danvers.
Oh, there's no need for you to be frightened of her, but I shouldn't have any more to do with her than you can help.
- Shall we sit down?
- Yes. Yes, please.
You see, she's bound to be insanely jealous at first and she must resent you bitterly.
But why should she?
Don't you know?
I should have thought
Maxim would have told you.
She simply adored Rebecca.
- How are you, Robert?
- Quite well, thank you, madam.
- Still having trouble with your teeth?
- Unfortunately, yes, madam.
You must have them out, all of them.
- Wretched nuisances, teeth.
- Thank you, madam.
What a plateful.
Do you hunt?
No, I don't.
I'm afraid I don't even ride.
You have to ride down here, we all do.
Which do you ride, sidesaddle or astride?
Well, of course, I forgot.
You don't, do you?
You must. Nothing else to do around here.
Maxim, when are you going to have parties here again, like the old days?
I haven't thought about it.
- But everyone's dying to see you and...
- Yes, I bet they are.
Why don't you have the masquerade ball again this summer?
My dear, are you fond of dancing?
I love it, but I'm not very good at it.
Do you rumba?
- Never tried.
- You must teach me.
Actually, I'm trying to find out exactly what your wife does do.
She sketches a little.
Sketches.
Not this modern stuff, I hope, you know, portrait of a lampshade upside down to represent a soul in torment.
Don't sail, do you?
No, I don't.
Thank goodness for that.
You're very much in love with Maxim, aren't you?
Yes, I can see you are.
Don't mind my saying so, but why don't you do something about your hair?
Why don't you have it cut or sweep it back behind your ears?
Oh, no, that's worse.
What does Maxim say about it?
Does he like it like that?
Well, he never mentions it.
Oh, well, don't go by me.
I can see by the way you dress you don't care a hoot how you look.
But I wonder Maxim hasn't been at you.
He's so particular about clothes.
I don't think he ever notices what I wear.
Oh. He must have changed a lot, then.
You mustn't worry about old Maxim and his moods.
One never knows what goes on in that quiet mind of his.
Often, he gets into a terrible rage, and when he does...
I don't suppose he'll lose his temper with you.
You seem such a placid little thing.
Come on, old girl.
We've got to go on the first tee at 3:00.
All right, I'm coming.
Well, goodbye, Maxim, old boy.
Goodbye, Giles.
Thanks for coming, old boy.
Goodbye, my dear.
Forgive me for asking you so many rude questions.
We both really hope you'll be very happy.
Thank you, Beatrice, thank you very much.
And I must congratulate you upon the way Maxim looks.
We were very worried about him this time last year.
But then, of course, you know the whole story.
- Goodbye, Beatrice.
- Goodbye, old boy.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Well, thank heavens they've gone.
Now we can have a walk about the place.
Looks as though we might have a shower.
But you won't mind that, will you?
No, but wait a minute.
I'll go upstairs and get a coat.
There's a heap of mackintoshes in the flower room. Robert?
Run and get a coat from the flower room for Mrs. de Winter, will you?
What do you think of Beatrice?
Oh, I liked her very much, but she kept saying that I was quite different from what she expected.
What the devil did she expect?
Oh, someone smarter and more sophisticated, I'm afraid.
Do you like my hair?
Your hair? Yes, of course I do.
What's the matter with it?
Oh, I don't know. I just wondered.
How funny you are.
Thank you.
- Do I have to put it on?
- Yes, certainly, certainly, certainly.
You can't be too careful with children.
Come on, Jasper.
Come and take some of that fat off.
Jasper! Here. Not that way! Come here!
Where does that lead to?
Oh, it leads to a little cove where we used to keep a boat.
Oh, let's go down there.
Well, no. It's a perfectly dull, uninteresting stretch of sand,
- just like any other.
- Oh, please.
Well, all right. We'll walk down and take a look if you really want to.
That's Jasper.
There must be something wrong.
- Perhaps he's hurt himself.
- No, he's all right, leave him alone.
Don't you think I'd better go and see?
Don't bother about him, I tell you, he can't come to any harm.
He'll find his own way back!
Jasper! Jasper?
Oh, there you are.
What do you want in there, Jasper?
Come on. Come on home. Let's go home.
Jasper...
Oh.
I didn't know that there was anybody...
I know that dog.
He comes from the house.
He ain't yours.
No. He's Mr. de Winter's dog.
Have you anything I could tie him with?
Come on, Jasper.
You won't tell anyone you saw me in there, will you?
Don't you belong on the estate?
I weren't doing nothing.
I was just putting me shells away.
She's gone in the sea, ain't she?
She'll never come back no more.
No. She'll never come back.
Come on, Jasper.
Maxim! What's the matter?
Maxim!
I'm sorry I was such a time, but I had to find a rope for Jasper.
Hurry up, Jasper, for heaven's sake.
Please wait for me. Maxim, what is it?
You look so angry.
You knew I didn't want you to go there, but you deliberately went.
Why not? There was only a cottage down there and a strange man who...
- You didn't go in the cottage, did you?
- Yes, the door was...
- Don't go there again, do you hear?
- Well, why not?
Because I hate the place.
And if you had my memories, you wouldn't go there or talk about it or even think about it.
What's the matter?
Oh, I'm sorry, please.
We should have stayed away.
We should never have come back to Manderley.
Oh, what a fool I was.
I've made you unhappy.
Somehow, I've hurt you.
Oh, I can't bear to see you like this because I love you so much.
Do you?
Do you?
I've made you cry.
Forgive me.
I sometimes seem to fly off the handle for no reason at all.
Don't I?
Come, we'll go home and have some tea and forget all about it.
Yes, let's forget all about it.
Here, let me have Jasper.
- Hello. Come in.
- Oh, please don't get up, Mr. Crawley.
I was just wondering if you meant what you said the other day
- about showing me the run of things.
- Of course I did.
What are you doing now?
Notifying all the tenants that in celebration of Maxim's return with his bride, this week's rent will be free.
Oh, is that Maxim's idea?
Oh, yes, all the servants get an extra week's wages, too.
Oh, he didn't tell me.
Can't I help you?
I could at least lick the stamps.
Well, that's terribly nice of you.
Won't you sit down?
Yes, thank you.
I was down at the cottage on the beach the other day.
There was a man there, a queer sort of person.
Jasper kept barking at him.
Oh, yes, it must have been Ben.
Excuse me. He's quite harmless.
We give him odd jobs now and then.
That cottage bay seemed to be going to rack and ruin.
Why isn't something done about it?
I think if Maxim wanted anything done about it, he'd tell me.
Are those all Rebecca's things down there?
Yes.
Yes, they are.
What did she use the cottage for?
The boat used to be moored near there.
What boat? What happened to it?
Was that the boat she was sailing in when she was drowned?
Yes. It capsized and sank.
She was washed overboard.
Wasn't she afraid to go out like that alone?
She wasn't afraid of anything.
Where did they find her?
Near Edgecombe, about 40 miles up channel about two months afterwards.
Maxim went up to identify her.
It was horrible for him.
Yes, it must have been.
Mr. Crawley, please don't think me morbidly curious.
It isn't that. It's...
It's just that I feel at such a disadvantage.
All the time, whenever I meet anyone,
Maxim's sister or even the servants,
I know they're all thinking the same thing, that they're all comparing me with her, with Rebecca.
You mustn't think that.
I can't tell you how glad I am that you married Maxim.
It's going to make all the difference to his life.
From my point of view, it's very refreshing to find someone like yourself, who's not entirely in tune, shall we say, with Manderley.
That's very sweet of you.
I daresay I've been stupid, but every day I realize the things she had that I lack.
Beauty and wit and intelligence, and all the things that are so important in a woman.
You have qualities that are just as important, more important, if I may say so.
Kindliness and sincerity, and if you'll forgive me, modesty, mean more to a husband than all the wit and beauty in the world.
We, none of us want to live in the past,
Maxim least of all.
It's up to you, you know, to lead us away from it.
Right.
I promise you I won't bring this up again, but before we end this conversation, would you answer just one more question?
If it's something I'm able to answer,
I'll do my best.
Tell me, what was Rebecca really like?
I suppose...
I suppose she was the most beautiful creature I ever saw.
Good evening, Maxim.
Hello. The films of the honeymoon have arrived at last.
Do we have time, do you think, before dinner?
What on Earth have you done to yourself?
Oh, nothing. I just ordered a new dress from London.
I hope you don't mind.
Oh, no, no. Only, do you think that sort of thing's right for you?
- It doesn't seem your type at all.
- I thought you'd like it.
And what have you done to your hair?
Oh, I see.
Dear, oh, dear. I'm sorry.
You look lovely, lovely.
It's very nice, for a change.
- Shall we see these pictures?
- Yes. I'd love to see them.
Look now, look at that.
Wasn't it wonderful, darling?
Can't we go back there someday?
Yes, of course. Of course.
Look at you.
Won't our grandchildren be delighted when they see how lovely you were?
Oh, look at you.
Oh, I like that.
Look at that.
Yes, very nice.
- Remember that?
- Yes.
I wish our honeymoon could have lasted forever, Maxim.
Dash it, look.
Hang it.
I've threaded it up wrong as usual or something.
Yes, Frith. What is it?
Excuse me, sir.
May I have a word with you?
Yes. Come in.
It's about Robert, sir.
There's been a slight unpleasantness between him and Mrs. Danvers.
Oh, dear.
- Robert is very upset.
- This is trouble.
What is it?
It appears that Mrs. Danvers has accused Robert of stealing a valuable ornament from the morning room.
Robert denies the accusation most emphatically, sir.
- What was the thing, anyway?
- China cupid, sir.
Oh, dear. That's one of our treasures, isn't it?
Well, tell Mrs. Danvers to get to the bottom of it somehow.
- Tell her I'm sure it wasn't Robert.
- Very good, sir.
Why do they come to me with these things?
That's your job, sweetheart.
Maxim, I wanted to tell you, but I forgot.
The fact is, I broke the china cupid.
You broke it?
Now, why on Earth didn't you say something about it when Frith was here?
I don't know. I didn't like to.
I was afraid he'd think me a fool.
He'll think you much more of a fool now.
You'll have to explain to him and Mrs. Danvers.
Oh, no, Maxim.
You do it. I'll go upstairs.
Don't be such a little idiot, darling.
Anybody would think you were afraid of them.
It's all a mistake, Mrs. Danvers.
Apparently, Mrs. de Winter broke the cupid herself and forgot to say anything about it.
I'm so sorry. I never thought that I'd get Robert into trouble.
Is it possible to repair the ornament, madam?
No, I'm afraid it isn't.
It smashed into pieces.
What did you do with the pieces?
Well, I put them at the back of one of the drawers in the writing desk.
Well, it looks as though
Mrs. de Winter was afraid you were going to put her in prison, doesn't it, Mrs. Danvers?
Well, never mind.
Do what you can to find the pieces.
See if they can be mended, and above all, tell Robert to dry his tears.
I shall apologize to Robert, of course.
Perhaps if such a thing happens again,
Mrs. de Winter will tell me personally.
Yes, yes, all right.
Thank you, Mrs. Danvers.
Well, I suppose that clip will hold all right.
I don't know.
I'm awfully sorry, darling.
It was very careless of me.
- Mrs. Danvers must be furious with me.
- Hang Mrs. Danvers.
Why on Earth should you be frightened of her?
You behave more like an upstairs maid or something,
- not the mistress of the house at all.
- Yes, I know I do.
But I feel so uncomfortable.
I try my best every day, but it's very difficult with people looking me up and down as if I were a prize cow.
What does it matter if they do?
You must remember that life at Manderley is the only thing that interests anybody down here.
What a slap in the eye
I must have been to them, then.
I suppose that's why you married me, because you knew I was dull and gauche and inexperienced, and there'd never be any gossip about me.
Gossip? What do you mean?
I don't know.
I just said it for something to say.
Don't look at me like that. Maxim.
What's the matter? What have I said?
Wasn't a very attractive thing to say, was it?
No. It was rude, hateful.
I wonder if I did a very selfish thing in marrying you.
How do you mean?
I'm not much of a companion to you, am I?
You don't get much fun, do you?
You ought to have married a boy, someone of your own age.
Maxim, why do you say this?
Of course we're companions.
Are we? I don't know.
- I'm very difficult to live with.
- No, you're not difficult.
You're easy, very easy.
Our marriage is a success, isn't it, a great success?
We're happy, aren't we?
Terribly happy?
If you don't think we are happy, it would be much better if you didn't pretend.
I'll go away.
Why don't you answer me?
How can I answer you when I don't know the answer myself?
If you say we're happy, let's leave it at that.
Happiness is something I know nothing about.
Oh, look. There's the one when I left the camera running on the tripod, remember?
Pardon me, madam.
Is there anything I can do for you?
I'm all right, Hilda.
Thank you very much.
I'll bring the sandwiches immediately, madam.
- Hilda.
- Yes, madam?
The west wing.
Nobody ever uses it anymore, do they?
No, madam.
Not since the death of Mrs. de Winter.
Come along, Mr. Jack, or someone may see you.
Well, Danny, old harpy, it's been good to see you again.
I've been simply breathless to pick up all the news.
I really don't think it's wise for you to come here, Mr. Jack.
Jasper, come here.
Oh, nonsense, nonsense.
It's just like coming back home.
Quiet, Mr. Jack.
Yes. We must be careful not to shock Cinderella, mustn't we?
She's in the morning room.
If you leave through the garden door, she won't see you.
I must say, I feel a little like the poor relation, sneaking around through back doors.
Well, toodle-oo, Danny.
Goodbye, Mr. Jack, and please be careful.
Jasper, be quiet.
Looking for me?
- I didn't make you jump, did I?
- No.
Of course not.
I didn't quite know who it was.
Yes. You're pleased to see me, aren't you, old boy?
I'm glad there's someone in the family to welcome me back to Manderley.
And how is dear old Max?
Very well, thank you.
I hear he went up to London, left his little bride all alone.
It's too bad.
Isn't he rather afraid that somebody might come down and carry you off?
Danny, all your precautions were in vain.
The mistress of the house was hiding behind the door.
Oh. What about presenting me to the bride?
This is Mr. Favell, madam.
How do you do?
How do you do?
- Won't you have some tea or something?
- Now, isn't that a charming invitation?
I've been asked to tea, Danny, and I've a good mind to accept.
Oh, well, perhaps you're right.
Pity, just when we were getting on so nicely.
We mustn't lead the young bride astray, must we, Jasper?
Goodbye. It's been fun meeting you.
Oh, and by the way, it would be very decent of you if you didn't mention this little visit to your revered husband.
He doesn't exactly approve of me.
- Very well.
- That's very sporting of you.
I wish I had a young bride of three months waiting for me at home.
I'm just a lonely old bachelor.
Fare thee well.
Oh, and I know what was wrong with that introduction.
Danny didn't tell you, did she?
I am Rebecca's favorite cousin.
Toodle-oo!
Do you wish anything, madam?
I didn't expect to see you, Mrs. Danvers.
I noticed that a window wasn't closed and I came up to see
- if I could fasten it.
- Why did you say that?
I closed it before I left the room.
You opened it yourself, didn't you?
You've always wanted to see this room, haven't you, madam?
Why did you never ask me to show it to you?
I was ready to show it to you every day.
It's a lovely room, isn't it?
Loveliest room you've ever seen.
Everything is kept just as Mrs. de Winter liked it.
Nothing has been altered since that last night.
Come. I'll show you her dressing room.
This is where I keep all her clothes.
You would like to see them, wouldn't you?
Feel this.
It was a Christmas present from Mr. de Winter.
He was always giving her expensive gifts, the whole year round.
I keep her underwear on this side.
They were made specially for her by the nuns in the Convent of St. Claire.
I always used to wait up for her, no matter how late.
Sometimes she and Mr. de Winter didn't come home until dawn.
While she was undressing, she'd tell me about the party she'd been to.
She knew everyone that mattered.
Everyone loved her.
When she finished her bath, she'd go into the bedroom and go over to the dressing table.
Oh, you've moved her brush, haven't you?
There. That's better.
Just as she always laid it down.
"Come on, Danny. Hair drill," she would say.
And I'd stand behind her like this and brush away for 20 minutes at a time.
And then she would say,
"Good night, Danny," and step into her bed.
I embroidered this case for her myself, and I keep it here always.
Did you ever see anything so delicate?
Look. You can see my hand through it.
You wouldn't think she'd been gone so long, would you?
Sometimes when I walk along the corridor,
I fancy I hear her just behind me.
That quick light step.
I couldn't mistake it anywhere.
Not only in this room, it's in all the rooms in the house.
I can almost hear it now.
Do you think the dead come back and watch the living?
No, I don't believe it.
Sometimes I wonder if she doesn't come back here to Manderley, and watch you and Mr. de Winter together.
You look tired.
Why don't you stay here a while and rest?
And listen to the sea.
So soothing.
Listen to it.
Listen.
Listen to the sea.
Tell Mrs. Danvers I wish to see her immediately.
You sent for me, madam?
Yes, Mrs. Danvers.
I want you to get rid of all these things.
- These are Mrs. de Winter's things.
- I am Mrs. de Winter now.
Very well. I'll give the instructions.
Just a moment, please.
Mrs. Danvers, I intend to say nothing to Mr. de Winter about Mr. Favell's visit.
In fact, I prefer to forget everything that happened this afternoon.
Maxim, Maxim, you've been gone all day.
You're choking me.
Well, well, well, what have you been doing with yourself?
- I've been thinking.
- What did you want to do that for?
Come in here and I'll tell you.
Darling, could we have a costume ball just as you used to?
Now what put that into your mind?
Has Beatrice been at you?
No, no, but I feel that we ought to do something to make people feel that Manderley is just the same as it always was.
Oh, please, darling, could we?
You don't know what it would mean, you know.
You'd have to be hostess to hundreds of people, all the county.
And a lot of young people would come up from London,
- and turn the house into a nightclub.
- Oh, yes. But I want to. Please.
I've never been to a large party, but I could learn what to do.
And I promise you, you wouldn't be ashamed of me.
All right, if you think you'd enjoy it.
You'd better get Mrs. Danvers to help you out, won't you?
No, no. I don't need Mrs. Danvers to help me.
I can do it myself.
All right, my sweet.
Thank you, darling. Thank you.
- What'll you go as?
- I never dress up.
That's the one privilege I claim as the host.
What will you be? Alice in Wonderland, with that ribbon around your hair?
No, I won't tell you.
I'll design a costume all by myself and give you the surprise of your life.
Come in.
Robert found these sketches in the library, madam.
- Did you intend throwing them away?
- Yes, Mrs. Danvers, I did.
They were just some ideas I was sketching for my costume for the ball.
Hasn't Mr. de Winter suggested anything?
No, I want to surprise him.
I don't want him to know anything about it.
I merely thought that you might find a costume among the family portraits that would suit you.
Oh, you mean those at the top of the stairs?
I'll go and look at them.
This one, for instance.
Might have been designed for you.
I'm sure you could have it copied.
I've heard Mr. de Winter say that this is his favorite of all the paintings.
It's Lady Caroline de Winter, one of his ancestors.
Oh, well, that's a splendid idea, Mrs. Danvers.
I'm very grateful.
- Everything under control, Frith?
- Yes, sir, thank you.
Excuse me, sir, are you supposed to be a schoolmaster?
Oh, no. This is just my old cap and gown.
It certainly makes a very nice costume, sir.
And economical, too.
Yes. That was the idea.
Good evening, Robert.
Not very good weather for the ball.
- No, sir.
- Very misty on the way and very chilly.
Oh, this wig's so tight they ought to send an aspirin with it.
Hello. What's the idea? Adam and Eve?
Oh, Maxim, don't be disgusting.
- Strongman. Where's my weight thing?
- What thing?
You haven't left it in the car, have you?
There it is.
- You were the first one down?
- Yes.
Where's the child?
Well, she's keeping her costume a terrific secret.
Wouldn't even let me into her room.
Oh, lovely.
I'll go up and give her a hand.
- I could do with a drink.
- Won't you catch a cold in that thing?
Don't be silly. Pure wool, old boy.
- Pardon me, sir. You forgot this.
- Thank you.
Here I am, dear, it's Bea.
I've come to give you a hand.
Oh, please don't come in, Beatrice.
I don't want anyone to see my costume.
Oh. Oh, you won't be long, will you?
Because the first people will be arriving any moment.
Now, you're sure that's where that should be?
Yes, madam, it's just right.
- Isn't it exciting?
- Indeed it is, madam.
I've always heard of the Manderley ball, and now I'm really going to see one.
I'm sure there will be no one there to touch you, madam.
Do you really think so?
Now, where's my fan?
Here.
- You're sure I look all right?
- You look ever so beautiful.
Well, here goes.
Good evening, Mr. de Winter.
What the devil do you think you're doing?
Rebecca.
But it's the picture.
The one in the gallery.
- What is it? What have I done?
- Go and take it off.
It doesn't matter what you put on.
Anything will do.
What are you standing there for?
Didn't you hear what I said?
Sir George and Lady Moore.
Dudley Tennant. Admiral and Lady Burbank.
I watched you go down, just as I watched her a year ago.
Even in the same dress, you couldn't compare.
You knew it.
You knew that she wore it, and yet you deliberately suggested I wear it.
Why do you hate me? What have I done to you that you should ever hate me so?
You tried to take her place, you let him marry you.
I've seen his face, his eyes.
They're the same as those first weeks after she died.
I used to listen to him walking up and down, up and down, all night long, night after night, thinking of her, suffering torture because he'd lost her.
I don't want to know.
I don't want to know!
You thought you could be Mrs. de Winter, live in her house, walk in her steps, take the things that were hers.
But she's too strong for you.
You can't fight her.
No one ever got the better of her. Never. Never.
She was beaten in the end, but it wasn't a man, it wasn't a woman.
It was the sea.
Oh, stop it. Stop it. Oh, stop it.
You're overwrought, madam.
I've opened a window for you.
A little air will do you good.
Why don't you go?
Why don't you leave Manderley?
He doesn't need you.
He's got his memories.
He doesn't love you.
He wants to be alone again with her.
You've nothing to stay for.
You've nothing to live for, really, have you?
Look down there. It's easy, isn't it?
Why don't you? Why don't you?
Go on.
Go on.
Don't be afraid.
- Shipwreck.
- Ship on the rocks!
- A ship aground, sending up rockets!
- Shipwreck!
Come on, everybody, down to the bay.
- Notify the coast guard.
- She's aground.
Maxim! Maxim!
- Ship ashore.
- Come on! Come on, everybody.
- Come on! Come on!
- Maxim! Maxim!
Oh!
Ben, have you seen Mr. de Winter anywhere?
She won't come back, will she?
You said so.
Who, Ben? What do you mean?
The other one.
- Frank, have you seen Maxim anywhere?
- Not since about half an hour ago.
I thought he'd gone up to the house.
No, he hasn't been in the house at all, and I'm afraid something might have happened to him.
Frank, what's the matter?
Is anything wrong?
- There is something wrong.
- Well...
The diver who went down to inspect the bottom of the ship came across the hull of another boat.
A little sailboat.
- Frank, is it...
- Yes.
It's Rebecca's.
How did they recognize it?
He's a local man. Knew it instantly.
It'll be so hard on poor Maxim.
Yes. It's going to bring it all back again, and worse than before.
Why did they have to find it?
Why couldn't they have left it there in peace at the bottom of the sea?
Well, I'd better get along and arrange some breakfast for the men.
All right, Frank.
I'll go and look for Maxim.
- Hello.
- Maxim.
You haven't had any sleep.
- Have you forgiven me?
- Forgiven you?
What have I got to forgive you for?
For last night.
My stupidity about the costume.
Oh, that.
I'd forgotten.
I was angry with you, wasn't I?
Maxim, can't we start all over again?
I don't ask that you should love me.
I won't ask impossible things.
I'll be your friend, your companion.
I'll be happy with that.
You love me very much, don't you?
But it's too late, my darling.
We've lost our little chance of happiness.
- No, Maxim, no.
- Yes.
It's all over now.
The thing's happened.
The thing I have dreaded day after day.
- Night after night.
- Maxim, what are you trying to tell me?
Rebecca has won.
Her shadow has been between us all the time, keeping us from one another.
She knew that this would happen.
What are you saying?
They sent a diver down.
- He found another boat.
- Yes, I know. Frank told me.
Rebecca's boat. Oh, it's terrible for you.
I'm so sorry.
The diver made another discovery.
Broke one of the ports and looked into the cabin.
There was a body in there.
She wasn't alone.
There was someone sailing with her, and you have to find out who it was, that's it, isn't it, Maxim?
You don't understand.
There was no one with her.
It's Rebecca's body lying there on the cabin floor.
Oh, no.
The woman that was washed up at Edgecombe, the woman that is now buried in the family crypt, that was not Rebecca.
That was the body of some unknown woman, unclaimed, belonging nowhere.
I identified it.
But I knew it wasn't Rebecca.
It was all a lie.
I knew where Rebecca's body was, lying on that cabin floor on the bottom of the sea.
How did you know, Maxim?
Because I put it there.
Will you look into my eyes and tell me that you love me now?
You see? I was right.
It's too late.
No, it's not too late.
You're not to say that.
I love you more than anything in the world.
- Oh, please, Maxim, kiss me, please.
- No.
It's no use. It's too late.
Oh, we can't lose each other now.
We must be together always.
No secrets, no shadows.
We may only have a few days, a few hours.
Maxim, why didn't you tell me before?
I nearly did sometimes, but you never seemed close enough.
How could we be close when I knew you were always thinking of Rebecca?
How could I even ask you to love me, when I knew you loved Rebecca still?
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?
Whenever you touched me,
I knew you were comparing me with Rebecca.
Whenever you looked at me or spoke to me or walked with me in the garden,
I knew you were thinking,
"This I did with Rebecca, and this, and this."
Oh, it's true, isn't it?
You thought I loved Rebecca?
You thought that?
I hated her.
Oh, I was carried away by her, enchanted by her as everyone was.
And when I was married,
I was told I was the luckiest man in the world.
She was so lovely, so accomplished, so amusing.
"She's got the three things that really matter in a wife," everyone said.
"Breeding, brains and beauty."
And I believed them. Completely.
But I never had a moment's happiness with her.
She was incapable of love or tenderness or decency.
You didn't love her.
You didn't love her.
Do you remember that cliff where you first saw me in Monte Carlo?
Well, I went there with Rebecca on our honeymoon.
That's where I found out about her, four days after we were married.
She stood there laughing, her black hair blowing in the wind and told me all about herself.
Everything.
Things I'll never tell a living soul.
I wanted to kill her.
It would have been so easy.
You remember the precipice?
I frightened you, didn't I?
You thought I was mad.
Perhaps I was. Perhaps I am mad.
It wouldn't make for sanity, would it?
Living with the devil?
"I'll make a bargain with you," she said.
"You'd look rather foolish trying to divorce me now after four days of marriage, so I'll play the part of a devoted wife, mistress of your precious Manderley.
I'll make it the most famous showplace in England, if you like, and people will visit us and envy us, and say we're the luckiest, happiest couple in the country.
What a grand joke it'll be.
What a triumph."
I should never have accepted her dirty bargain, but I did.
I was younger then, and tremendously conscious of the family honor.
Family honor.
She knew that I'd sacrifice everything rather than stand up in a divorce court and give her away, admit that our marriage was a rotten fraud.
You despise me, don't you?
As I despise myself.
You can't understand what my feelings were, can you?
Of course I can, darling.
Of course I can.
Well, I kept the bargain and so did she, apparently.
Oh, she played the game brilliantly, but after a while, she began to grow careless.
She took a flat in London, and she'd stay away for days at a time.
Then she started to bring her friends down here.
I warned her, but she shrugged her shoulders.
"What's it got to do with you?" she said.
She even started on Frank.
Poor, faithful Frank.
Then there was a cousin of hers, a man named Favell.
Yes. I know him.
He came the day you went to London.
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't like to.
I thought it would remind you of Rebecca.
Remind me?
As if I needed reminding.
Favell used to visit her here in this cottage.
I found out about it, and I warned her that if he came here again,
I'd shoot them both.
One night, when I found she had come back quietly from London,
I thought that Favell was with her, and I knew then that I couldn't stand this life of filth and deceit any longer.
I decided to come down here and have it out with both of them.
But she was alone.
She was expecting Favell, but he hadn't come.
She was lying on the divan, a large tray of cigarette stubs beside her.
She looked ill, queer.
Suddenly, she got up, started to walk toward me.
"When I have a child," she said,
"neither you nor anyone else could ever prove it wasn't yours.
You would like to have an heir, wouldn't you, Max, for your precious Manderley?"
Then she started to laugh.
"How funny.
How supremely, wonderfully funny.
I'll be the perfect mother, just as I've been the perfect wife.
No one will ever know.
It ought to give you the thrill of your life, Max, to watch my son grow bigger day by day and to know that when you die,
Manderley will be his."
She was face to face with me.
One hand in her pocket, the other holding a cigarette.
She was smiling.
"Well, Max?
What are you going to do about it?
Aren't you going to kill me?"
I suppose I went mad for a moment.
I must have struck her.
She stood staring at me.
She looked almost triumphant.
Then she started toward me again. Smiling.
Suddenly, she stumbled and fell.
When I looked down, ages afterwards, it seemed, she was lying on the floor.
She had struck her head on a heavy piece of ship's tackle.
I remember wondering why she was still smiling.
Then I realized she was dead.
But you didn't kill her.
It was an accident.
Who would believe me?
I lost my head.
I just knew I had to do something.
Anything.
I carried her out to the boat.
It was very dark. There was no moon.
I put her in the cabin.
When the boat seemed a safe distance from the shore, I took a spike, and drove it again and again through the planking of the hull.
I had opened up the seacocks and the water began to come in fast.
I climbed over into the dinghy and pulled away.
I saw the boat heel over and sink.
I pulled back into the cove.
It started raining.
- Maxim, does anyone else know of this?
- No. No one except you and me.
We must explain it.
It's got to be the body of someone you've never seen before.
No, they're bound to know her.
Her rings, bracelets she always wore.
They'll identify her body, then they'll remember the other woman.
The other woman buried in the crypt.
If they find out it was Rebecca, you must simply say you made a mistake about the other body.
That the day you went to Edgecombe, you were ill, you didn't know what you were doing.
Rebecca's dead. That's what we've got to remember. Rebecca's dead.
She can't speak. She can't bear witness.
She can't harm you anymore.
We're the only two people in the world that know, Maxim, you and I.
I'd told you once that I'd done a selfish thing in marrying you.
You can understand now what I meant.
I've loved you, my darling.
I shall always love you, but I've known all along that Rebecca would win in the end.
No, no. She hasn't won.
No matter what happens now, she hasn't won.
Hello?
Hello, Frank.
Hello, Frank. Yes.
Who? Colonel Julyan?
Yes. Tell him I'll meet him there as soon as I possibly can.
What?
Well...
Say we could talk about that when we're sure about the matter.
What's happened?
Colonel Julyan called.
He's the chief constable of the county.
He's been asked by the police to go to the mortuary.
He wanted to know if I could possibly have made a mistake about that other body.
Well, Colonel Julyan, apparently I did make a mistake about that other body.
The mistake was quite natural under the circumstances.
- Besides, you weren't well at the time.
- That's nonsense. I was perfectly well.
Don't let it worry you, Maxim.
Nobody can blame you for making a mistake.
The pity is, you've got to go through the same thing all over again.
What do you mean?
There'll have to be another inquest, of course.
Same formality and red tape.
Wish you could be spared the publicity of it, but I'm afraid that's impossible.
Oh, yes, publicity.
I suppose Mrs. de Winter went below for something and a squall hit the boat with nobody at the helm.
I imagine that's about the solution now, don't you think so, Crawley?
Oh, yes. Probably the door jammed, and she couldn't get on deck again.
Yeah.
Tabb, the boat builder, will undoubtedly come to some such conclusion.
Why, what would he know about it?
Well, he's examining the boat now.
Purely as a matter of routine, you know.
I'll be at the inquest tomorrow, Maxim, quite unofficially, you know.
We must get together for a game of golf when it's all over, eh?
Bye-bye.
I have the evening papers, madam.
Would you care to see them?
Oh, no thank you, Frith, and I prefer that Mr. de Winter weren't troubled with them, either.
I understand, madam. Permit me to say that we're all most distressed outside.
Thank you, Frith.
I'm afraid the news has been a great shock to Mrs. Danvers.
Yes, I rather expected it would be.
It seems there's to be a coroner's inquest, madam?
Yes, Frith. It's purely a formality.
Of course, madam. I...
I wanted to say that if any of us might be required to give evidence,
I should be only too pleased to do anything that might help the family.
Oh, thank you, Frith, why, I...
I'm sure Mr. de Winter will be very happy to hear it.
But I don't think anything will be necessary.
Maxim.
Hello, darling.
Oh, Maxim, I'm worried about what you'll do at the inquest tomorrow.
What do you mean?
You won't lose your temper, will you?
Promise me that they won't make you angry.
All right, darling. I promise.
No matter what he asks you, you won't lose your head?
Don't worry, dear.
They can't do anything at once, can they?
No.
Then we've a little time left to be together.
Yes.
- I want to go to the inquest with you.
- I'd rather you didn't, darling.
But I can't wait here alone.
I promise you,
I won't be any trouble to you.
And I must be near you so that no matter what happens, we won't be separated for a moment.
All right, dear.
I don't mind this whole thing except for you.
I can't forget what it's done to you.
I've been thinking of nothing else since it happened.
It's gone forever, that funny, young, lost look I loved.
It won't ever come back.
I killed that when I told you about Rebecca.
It's gone.
In a few hours, you've grown so much older.
Oh, Maxim, Maxim.
Black Jack Brady was his name.
The most important arrest I ever made.
It must have been about two years ago now.
Of course, there was no doubt about it.
He was hung a month after I caught him.
Hello. Wait a minute.
They've got old Balmy Ben up now.
You remember the late Mrs. de Winter, don't you?
- She's gone.
- Yes, we know that.
- She went in the sea. The sea got her.
- That's right. That's right.
Now we want you to tell us whether you were on the shore
- that last night she went sailing.
- Eh?
Were you on the shore that last night she went out, when she didn't come back?
I didn't see nothing.
I don't want to go to the asylum.
Them cruel folks there.
Now, nobody's going to send you to the asylum.
All we want you to do is tell us what you saw.
I didn't see nothing.
Come, come.
Did you see Mrs. de Winter get into her boat that last night?
I don't know nothing.
I don't want to go to the asylum.
Very well. You may go.
- Eh?
- You may go now.
- Mr. Tabb, step forward, please.
- Yes?
The evidence you give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
I do, so help me God.
The late Mrs. de Winter used to send her boat
- to your shipyard for reconditioning.
- That's right, sir.
Can you remember any occasion when she had any sort of accident with the boat?
No, sir. I often said Mrs. de Winter was a born sailor.
Now, when Mrs. de Winter went below, as is supposed, and a sudden gust of wind came down, that would be enough to capsize the boat, wouldn't it?
Excuse me, sir.
But there's a little more to it than that.
- What do you mean, Mr. Tabb?
- I mean, sir, the seacocks.
What are the seacocks?
Sea...
The seacocks are the valves to drain out the boat.
They're always kept tight closed when you're afloat.
Yes?
Well, yesterday, when I examined that boat,
I found they'd been opened.
What could be the reason for that?
Just this, that's what flooded the boat and sunk her.
Are you implying that boat never capsized at all?
I know it's a terrible thing to say, sir, but in my opinion, she was scuttled.
- And there's them holes.
- What holes?
- In her planking.
- What are you talking about?
Of course, that boat's been underwater for over a year, and the tide's been knocking her against the ridge.
But it seemed to me them holes looked as if she'd made them from the inside.
Then you believe she must have done it deliberately.
Couldn't have been no accident, not with her knowledge of boats.
You knew the former Mrs. de Winter very well, I believe?
Oh, yes.
Would you have believed her capable of suicide?
No. Frankly, I would not.
But you never can tell.
You may stand down, Mr. Tabb.
Mr. de Winter, please.
Sorry to drag you back for further questioning, Mr. de Winter.
But you've heard the statement of Mr. Tabb.
I wonder if you can help us in any way.
I'm afraid not.
Can you think of any reason why there should be holes in the planking of the late
Mrs. de Winter's boat?
Well, of course I can't think of any reason.
Has anyone ever discussed these holes with you before?
Well, since the boat has been at the bottom of the ocean,
I scarcely think that likely.
Mr. de Winter, I want you to believe we all feel very deeply for you in this matter.
But you must remember that I don't conduct this inquiry for my own amusement.
- That's rather obvious, isn't it?
- I hope that it is.
Well, since she went sailing alone, are we to believe that she drove those holes herself?
You may believe what you like.
Can you enlighten us as to why
Mrs. de Winter should have wanted to end her own life?
I know of no reason whatever.
Mr. de Winter, however painful it may be,
I have to ask you a very personal question.
Were relations between you and the late
Mrs. de Winter perfectly happy?
Were relations between you and the late
Mrs. de Winter perfectly happy?
I won't stand this any longer!
You might as well know now...
We'll adjourn till after lunch.
Mr. de Winter, I presume you'll be available for us then?
I told you, you should have had some breakfast.
You're hungry.
That's what's the matter with you.
Mr. Frith thought you might like to have some lunch from the house, and sent me with it.
No, that's fine.
Pull around the corner.
Very good, sir.
Awfully foolish of me, fainting like that.
Nonsense. If you hadn't fainted like that,
I'd have really lost my temper.
Darling, please be careful.
Darling, wait here a few moments.
I'll see if I can find old Frank.
Of course, darling.
Don't worry about me. I'll be all right.
Sure?
Here, try a spot of this. Do you good.
Thank you.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, of course.
- I won't be long.
- Right you are.
Hello.
And how does the bride find herself today?
I say, marriage with Max is not exactly a bed of roses, is it?
I think you'd better go before Maxim gets back.
Oh, jealous, is he?
Well, I can't say I blame him.
But you don't think
I'm the big bad wolf, do you?
I'm not, you know.
I'm a perfectly ordinary, harmless bloke.
And I think you're behaving splendidly over all this. Perfectly splendidly.
You know, you've grown up a bit since I last saw you. It's no wonder...
What do you want, Favell?
Oh, hello, Max. Things are going pretty well for you, aren't they?
Better than you ever expected.
I was rather worried about you at first.
That's why I came down to the inquest.
Well, I'm touched by your solicitude.
But if you don't mind, we'd rather like to have our lunch.
Lunch? I say, what a jolly idea.
Rather like a picnic, isn't it?
I'm so sorry.
Do you mind if I put this there?
You know, Max, old boy, I really think
I ought to talk things over with you.
Talk what things over?
Well, those holes in the planking, for one thing.
Those holes that were drilled from the inside.
- Oh, Mullen?
- Yes, sir?
Would you, like a good fellow, have my car filled with petrol?
- It's almost empty.
- Very good, sir.
- And, Mullen, close the door, will you?
- Yes, sir.
Does this bother you?
You know, old boy, I have a strong feeling that before the day's out, somebody's going to make use of that rather expressive, though somewhat old-fashioned term,
"foul play."
Am I boring you with all this?
No?
Good. Well, you see, Max,
I find myself in a rather awkward position.
You've only got to read this note to understand.
It's from Rebecca.
And, what's more, she had the foresight to put a date on it.
She wrote me the day she died.
Incidentally, I was at a party on that night so I didn't get it until the next day.
And what makes you think that note would interest me?
Oh, I'm not gonna bother you with the contents now.
But I can assure you that it is not the note of a woman who intends to drown herself that same night.
By the way, what do you do with old bones?
Bury them?
However, for the time being...
You know, Max, I'm getting fed up with my job as a motorcar salesman.
I don't know if you've ever experienced the feeling of driving an expensive motorcar which isn't your own?
But it can be very, very exasperating.
You know what I mean.
You want to own the car yourself.
I often wonder what it would be like to retire to the country.
Have a nice little place with a few acres of shooting.
I've never figured out what it would cost a year, but I'd like to talk about it with you.
I'd like to have your advice on how to live comfortably without hard work.
Hello, Favell.
You looking for me, Maxim?
Yes.
Mr. Favell and I have a little business transaction on hand.
I think we had better conduct it over at the inn.
They may have a private room there.
Well, see you later.
Find Colonel Julyan.
Tell him I want to see him immediately.
Come on, Favell. Let's go.
- Have you a private room, please?
- Of course, sir. Through there, sir.
Hope this will do, Mr. de Winter.
Splendid. Splendid.
Exactly like the Ritz.
Any orders, gents?
Yes. You might bring me a large brandy and soda.
How about you, Max? Have one on me.
I feel I can afford to play host.
Thanks. I don't mind if I do.
Make it two, will you, like a good fellow?
- Very good, sir.
- Where's Mr. de Winter?
Through the other door, sir.
Colonel Julyan, this is Mr. Favell.
Oh, I know Colonel Julyan.
We're old friends, aren't we?
Since you're old friends,
I assume you also know he's head of the police here.
He might be interested to hear your proposition.
Go on, tell him all about it.
I don't know what you mean. I merely said I hoped to give up selling cars and retire into the country.
Actually, he offered to withhold a vital piece of evidence from the inquest if I made it worth his while.
I only want to see justice done, Colonel.
Now, that boat builder's evidence suggested certain possible theories concerning Rebecca's death.
One of them, of course, is suicide.
Now I have a little note here which I consider puts that possibility quite out of court.
Read it, Colonel.
"Jack, darling,
I've just seen the doctor and I'm going down to Manderley right away.
I shall be at the cottage all this evening and shall leave the door open for you.
I have something terribly important to tell you.
Rebecca."
Now, does that look like the note of a woman who had made up her mind to kill herself?
And apart from that, do you mean to tell me that if you wanted to commit suicide, you would go to all the trouble of putting out to sea in a boat, and then take a hammer and chisel and laboriously knock holes through the bottom of it?
Come, Colonel. As an officer of the law, don't you feel there are some slight grounds for suspicion?
- Of murder?
- What else?
You've known Max a long time.
So you know he's the old-fashioned type, who'd die to defend his honor, or who'd kill for it.
It's blackmail, pure and simple.
Blackmail is not so pure, nor so simple.
It can bring a lot of trouble to a great many people.
And the blackmailer sometimes finds himself in jail at the end of it.
Oh, I see. You're going to hold de Winter's hand through all this.
Just because he's the big noise around here and he's actually permitted you to dine with him.
Be careful, Favell.
You've brought an accusation of murder.
- Have you any witnesses?
- I do have a witness.
It's that fellow, Ben.
If that stupid coroner hadn't been as much of a snob as you are, he'd have seen that half-wit was hiding something.
And why should Ben do that?
Because we caught him once,
Rebecca and I, peering at us through the cottage window.
Rebecca threatened him with the asylum.
That's why he was afraid to speak.
But he was always hanging about.
He must have seen this whole thing.
It's ridiculous, even listening to all this.
You're like a little trade union, all of you, aren't you?
And if my guess is right, Crawley, there's a bit of malice in your soul toward me, isn't there?
Crawley didn't have much success with Rebecca, but he ought to have more luck this time.
And the bride will be grateful for your fraternal arm, Crawley, in a week or so.
Every time she faints, in fact.
- De Winter!
- Maxim, please!
That temper of yours will do you in yet, Max.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Now is there anything else?
- Yes.
You might bring Mr. de Winter a sedative.
- No, no. Nothing at all. Just leave us.
- Very good.
Now, Favell, let's get this business over.
As you seem to have worked out the whole thing so carefully, perhaps you can provide us also with a motive.
I knew you were going to bring that up, Colonel.
I've read enough detective stories to know that there must always be a motive.
And if you'll all excuse me,
I might supply that, too.
I wish you'd go home.
You ought not to be here through all this.
Please let me stay, Maxim.
Surely, Colonel Julyan, you're not going to allow this fellow to...
My opinion of Favell is no higher than yours, Crawley.
But in my official capacity,
I have no alternative but to pursue his accusations.
I entirely agree with you, Colonel.
In matters as serious as this, we must make sure of every point and explore every avenue.
And in fact, if I may coin a phrase, leave no stone unturned.
Here she is, the missing link, the witness who will help supply the motive.
Colonel Julyan, Mrs. Danvers.
I believe you know everyone else.
Won't you sit down?
No offense, Colonel, but I think I'll put this to Danny.
She'll understand it more easily.
Danny, who was Rebecca's doctor?
Mrs. de Winter always had Dr. McClean from the village.
Now, you heard.
I said Rebecca's doctor in London.
I don't know anything about that.
Oh, don't give me that, Danny.
You knew everything about Rebecca.
You knew she was in love with me, didn't you?
Surely you haven't forgotten the good times she and I used to have down at the cottage on the beach.
She had a right to amuse herself, didn't she?
Love was a game to her. Only a game.
It made her laugh, I tell you.
She used to sit and rock with laughter at the lot of you.
Can you think of why Mrs. de Winter should have taken her own life?
No, no. I refuse to believe it.
I knew everything about her and I won't believe it.
There. You see? It's impossible.
She knows that as well as I do.
Now, listen to me, Danny.
We know that Rebecca went to a doctor in London on the last day of her life. Who was it?
I don't know.
I understand, Danny.
You think we're asking you to reveal secrets of Rebecca's life.
You're trying to defend her.
But that's what I'm doing.
I'm trying to clear her name of the suspicion of suicide.
Mrs. Danvers, it has been suggested that Mrs. de Winter was deliberately murdered.
There you have it in a nutshell, Danny.
But there's one more thing you'll want to know, the name of the murderer.
It's a lovely name that rolls off the tongue so easily.
George Fortescue Maximilian de Winter.
There was a doctor.
Mrs. de Winter sometimes went to him privately.
She used to go to him even before she was married.
We don't want reminiscences, Danny.
What was his name?
Dr. Baker.
165 Goldhawk Road, Shepherd's Bush.
There you are, Colonel.
There's where you'll find your motive.
Go and question Dr. Baker.
He'll tell you why Rebecca went to him.
To confirm the fact that she was going to have a child.
A sweet, curly-headed little child.
It isn't true. It isn't true.
She would have told me.
She told Max about it.
Max knew he wasn't the father.
So, like the gentleman of the old school that he is, he killed her.
I'm afraid we shall have to question this Dr. Baker.
Hear, hear. But for safety's sake,
I think I'd like to go along, too.
Yes. Unfortunately, I suppose you have the right to ask that.
I'll see the coroner and have the inquest postponed pending further evidence.
I say, aren't you rather afraid that the prisoner, shall we say, might bolt?
You have my word for it that he will not do that.
Toodle-oo, Max. Come along, Danny.
Let's leave the unhappy couple to spend their last moments together alone.
Are you sure you don't want me to go with you, Max?
No, darling.
It'll be very tiring for you.
I'll be back the very first thing in the morning.
- And I won't even stop to sleep.
- I'll be waiting for you.
- Ready, Maxim?
- Yes.
You two go on ahead.
I'll follow with Favell.
Dr. Baker, you may have seen
Mr. de Winter's name in the papers recently.
Yes. Yes. In connection with the body that was found in a boat.
My wife was reading all about it.
A very sad case. My condolences.
This is going to take hours.
Let me...
Don't bother, Favell.
I think I can tell Dr. Baker.
We're trying to discover certain facts concerning the late Mrs. de Winter's activities on the day of her death.
October the 12th, last year.
I want you to tell me if you can, if anyone of that name paid you a visit on that date?
I'm awfully sorry.
I'm afraid I can't help you.
I should have remembered the name de Winter.
I've never attended a Mrs. de Winter in my life.
How can you possibly tell all your patients' names?
I can look it up in my engagement diary if you like.
- Did you say the 12th of October?
- Yes.
Here we are.
No. No de Winter.
Are you sure?
Well, here are all the appointments for that day.
Ross, Campbell, Steadall, Perrino, Danvers...
- Danny? What the devil?
- Would you read that name again?
Did you say Danvers?
Yes. I have a Mrs. Danvers for 3:00.
What did she look like?
Can you remember?
Yes, I remember her quite well.
She was a very beautiful woman.
- Tall, dark, exquisitely dressed.
- Rebecca.
The lady must have used an assumed name.
Is that so?
This is a surprise.
I've known her a long time.
What was the matter with her?
Well, there are certain ethics.
Could you supply a reason, Dr. Baker, for Mrs. de Winter's suicide?
For her murder, you mean?
She was going to have a kid, wasn't she?
Come on. Out with it!
Tell me, what else would a woman of her class be doing in a dump like this?
I take it the official nature of this visit makes it necessary for me to...
I assure you we'd not be troubling you if it were not necessary.
You want to know if I can suggest any motive as to why Mrs. de Winter should have taken her life?
Yes, I think I can.
The woman who called herself Mrs. Danvers was very seriously ill.
She was not going to have a child?
That was what she thought.
My diagnosis was different.
I sent her to a well-known specialist for an examination and x-rays.
And on this date, she returned to me for his report.
I remember her standing here holding out her hand for the photograph.
"I want to know the truth," she said.
"I don't want soft words and a bedside manner.
If I'm for it, you can tell me right away."
I knew she was not the type to accept a lie.
She'd asked for the truth, so I let her have it.
She thanked me.
I never saw her again, so I assumed...
- What was wrong with her?
- Cancer.
Yes, the growth was deep-rooted.
An operation would have been no earthly use at all.
In a short time, she would have been under morphia.
There was nothing that could be done for her, except wait.
Did she say anything when you told her?
She smiled in a queer sort of way.
Your wife was a wonderful woman, Mr. de Winter.
And, oh, yes, I remember she said something that struck me as being very peculiar at the time.
When I told her it was a matter of months, she said,
"Oh, no, Doctor, not that long."
You've been very kind.
You've told us all we wanted to know.
We shall probably need an official verification.
- Verification?
- Yes.
- To confirm the verdict of suicide.
- I understand.
Can I offer you gentlemen a glass of sherry?
No, that's very kind.
I think we ought to be going.
Thank heaven we know the truth.
Dreadful thing. Dreadful.
Young and lovely woman like that.
No wonder...
I never had the remotest idea.
Neither did Danny, I'm sure.
I wish I had a drink.
Will we be needed at the inquest any further, Colonel Julyan?
No, no. I can see to it that Maxim's not troubled any further.
- Thank you, sir.
- You ready to start, Colonel?
No, thank you.
I'm staying in town tonight.
And let me tell you, Favell, blackmail is not much of a profession.
And we know how to deal with it in our part of the world, strange as it may seem to you.
I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about.
But if you ever need a new car, Colonel, just let me know.
It's impossible to thank you for your kindness to us through all this.
You know what I feel without my saying it.
Not at all.
Put the whole thing behind you.
But let your wife know.
She'll be getting worried.
Yes, of course.
I'll phone her at once and we'll get straight down to Manderley.
Goodbye, Crawley.
Maxim's got a great friend.
- Frank.
- Yes, Maxim?
- There's something you don't know.
- Oh, no, there isn't.
I didn't kill her, Frank.
But I know now that when she told me about the child, she wanted me to kill her.
She lied on purpose.
She foresaw the whole thing.
That's why she stood there laughing when she...
Don't think about it anymore.
Thank you, Frank.
Hello, Danny.
I just wanted to tell you the news.
Rebecca held out on both of us.
She had cancer.
Yes, suicide.
Now Max and that dear little bride of his will be able to stay on at Manderley and live happily ever after.
Bye-bye, Danny.
- This your car, sir?
- Yes.
Will you be going soon?
This isn't a parking place, you know.
Oh, isn't it? Well, people are entitled to leave cars outside if they want to.
It's a pity some of you fellows haven't anything better to do.
When you phoned, did she say she'd wait up?
I asked her to go to bed, but she wouldn't hear of it.
I wish I could get some more speed out of this thing.
Is something worrying you, Maxim?
I can't get over the feeling something's wrong.
- Frank.
- What's the matter? Why did we stop?
What's the time?
Well, this clock's wrong.
It must be 3:00 or 4:00. Why?
That can't be the dawn breaking over there.
It's in the winter that you see the northern lights, isn't it?
That's not the northern lights.
That's Manderley.
Frith! Frith!
Mrs. de Winter. Where is she?
- I thought I saw her, sir.
- Where?
Maxim!
Thank heavens you've come back to me!
- Are you all right, darling?
- Oh, yes, I am.
Are you all right?
Mrs. Danvers, she's gone mad.
She said she'd rather destroy Manderley than see us happy here.
Look! The west wing!

PARLIAMENT MEET IN VICHY
FRANCE'S DESTINY
IN PETAIN'S HANDS
PARLIAMENT AND SENATE DISSOLVED
This film shows France, not as it was between 1940 and 1944...
...but as Pétain and the
Collaborators wanted it to be seen
The retreating British army set fire to Lorient's oil tanks...
...thus harming their former allies
It was on thanks to German firemen...
...that the blaze was extinguished and the fuel saved
In the occupied zone the Germans are mustering...
...every able-bodied man to erase all traces of war
Most of the French rail network...
...is in service again
Side by side, German employees and their French colleagues...
...ensure an efficient service
The ladies of the German Red Cross help everywhere

22nd October 1940
Last Thursday I met the Chancellor of the Reich
Our meeting...
...both raised hopes and provoked concern
I owe you an explanation on the matter
M. Scapini. the French Ambassador
Almost two million men...
...who represent the élite and flower of French youth...
...are POWs
France can only recover with their help
For her part, Germany can only consider returning these prisoners...
...if a Franco-German common interest...
...is clearly apparent
That general principle was set out at Montoire
It is in the interest of our two countries...
...to collaborate in this effort of reconstruction
We must show our commitment by backing Maréchal Pétain to the hilt
France gives unanimous support to Pétain...
...its symbol and leader
And French youth chooses the finest oak in the forest...
...and names it after Pétain
Toulouse is the starting point of Pétain's tour...
...which will bind the country even closer to its leader
He spends the day...
...between the préfecture and the
Assézat, home to the floral games...
...and the municipal authorities
The Head of State talked to local representatives
Before leaving Toulouse...
...he visited the Agricultural School
Here a new generation of peasant is acquiring not only training...
...but professional pride
"France is her soil and her sons," as Pétain once said
After Toulouse and Montauban...
...it was Lyons' honour to welcome Pétain
Lyons which calls itself France's most industrious city...
...backs Pétain whole-heartedly
The cheering populace offers its trust...
...to the leader who said,
"l give myself to France...
"...to relieve her pain"
MARSEILLES December
You said our duty was to obey
To your call...

Aix-en-Provence
City of fountains
City of Provencal peace...
...now wakes to the clarion call of
St-Cyr and St-Maixent
Early each morning...
...the two schools are out exercising
In the pool and lecture theatre...
...are trainee officers
Students but soldiers too
In Toulon harbour...
...a moving ceremony...
...on board the Strasbourg
Admiral Darlan decorates...
...the heroes who upheld...
...our great naval tradition at Mers el Kebir
Let us remember the 1,300 dead...
...who sacrificed their lives for the French flag
I have taken a decision...
...I deem to be in the country's interest
M. Pierre Laval...
...will leave the government
M. Pierre-Etienne Flandin will succeed him
I shall stay at the helm and the
National Revolution will continue
At all times, use new Lavor
The best soap powder
Let's wash with new Lavor
Paris, 15th December 1940.
Hitler gives back to France...
...the body of Napoleon II
It's midnight. The sarcophagus leaves...
...the train bringing it from Vienna and is transported... on a gun-carriage to Les Invalides
At this precise hour, a century ago...
...Napoleon's body arrived in Paris from St Helena
Now the Germans place his son's coffin...
...outside Les Invalides
Today all Frenchmen will feel great emotion...
...at this spontaneous act of German homage
The unemployed can find work in Germany
Unemployed skilled workers can register... for jobs in Germany...
About 50,000 French workers are at present in Germany...
...where they receive high wages
This reduces payments of French unemployment benefit...
...and also allows workers...
...to appreciate German
National Socialist values
The train is off to Germany
In the first German station...
...food is distributed
Factories provide every hygiene facility
Workers returning to France will certainly remember...
...the high standard of living and good working conditions...
...but above all the friendship of German workers
To tackle the scourge of unemployment...
...the representatives of labour have been meeting...
...under the banner of National
Revolution and European collaboration
Mesnard's address
I'm speaking to men who hoped for peace...
...because the aim of trade unionism was peace
France, even in her present situation...
...is not abandoning that mission and tradition...
...but she must in with Europe to make revolution and peace
Frehel now takes the floor
The French, to their honour, will continue to think as Frenchmen
They will remain rooted to the soil
Dumoulin's speech
We mustn't just express resentment
We must sound the alarm...
...if it's not already too late...
...to try and safeguard at least the dignity of France
Admiral Darlan, Commander in Chief of the French navy...
...has been appointed Pétain's
Vice-Prime Minister
For 8 months they've been working together for French recovery
Darlan will continue negotiations...
...to give the Montoire policy a new lease of life
He and Pétain will lead France to recovery...
...within a European framework
Mutual aid in Paris
The local prefect opens Pétain's first restaurant...
...for people of slender means
Here, those who have fallen on hard times...
...can eat well and cheaply
Pétain's portrait is being sold in aid of the fight against poverty
Packets are being sent by the thousand from Paris
The postman sells Pétain's portrait door to door
His picture is close to all our hearts...
...and should be in every home
In France we have...
...a habit that's more damaging today than ever before
We reduce the totality of the French problem...
...to the single issue of Franco-German difficulties
But French interests, just like all national interests today...
...need much wider solutions
So, at this very moment...
...a huge design for continental unity is being mapped out
A vast geographic mass...
...with common political and economic interests
It will stretch from the China Sea, across the vast Asian plains...
...held together by Japan and
Russia...
...now part of the new economic and political order
It will continue across the Balkans and Germany...
...to the extremity of Europe,
France
No wonder then, if  today they say to France...
"Agree whole-heartedly to be a bastion of this new world order
"Then the Atlantic defence role....
"...will be entrusted to
French forces...
"...and France will run her own affairs"
Greeted by  a crowd rejoicing in renewed hope...
...Pétain salutes the arrival of the Caudillo...
...returning from a meeting with Mussolini
Near a POW camp outside Berlin
Before going home, recently freed
French officers...

World War One war memorial
Homage of war veterans who understand...

At Chalon-sur-Saône...
...Ambassador Scapini welcomes sick prisoners...
...repatriated from Germany
A few days later in Chalon-sur-Marne...
...Scapini welcomes a contingent of freed POWs
In this war, many things have been new
Many things will continue to be new
It's unusual to free prisoners....
...in wartime
I spoke to the German authorities
I asked the Führer to be so good as to consider the situation...
...of families and particularly of children deprived of their fathers
And so you are free
He has it all back
Country, family, work.
The page is turned
The earth awaits tomorrow's toil
The women of France have worked valiantly
Lamirand, Minster for Youth
Pétain has asked the French people...
...to fight for what he calls the National Revolution
That means a real revolution...
...breaking deliberately once and for all...
...with everything that led France into its present situation
To achieve that, we need the enthusiasm and the purity...
...of the young
In the main, it is the young who will create the National Revolution
This revolution will happen on a social level
It will happen on a European scale
In the building of the new Europe, the young will give France...
...the place her genius and renewed power deserve
Our young people are determined to furnish every effort...
...by showing love for their work and united determination...
...and by acts of renunciation and sacrifice
The will carry through this revolution with enthusiasm and joy
An Institute for Jewish Research has been set up in Pars
The Institute will not be subject to any political party
It will be a central bureau of co-ordination and information...
...dealing with the Jewish issue scientifically...
...and studying the problem at a European level
"The Jewish Peril" (1941)
The Jew is like a rat
Like rats the Jew is a coward...
...he's sly and cruel
He feels the irresistible need to destroy
The Jews' power lies in their superior numbers...
...and, like proliferating rats, they are a danger to human health
Talking of salubrious places...
...let's visit the dark and repulsive pigsty...
...where this Jewish family lives
Vermin swarms there
Maréchal Pétain speaks to France
On 17th June 1940, a year ago today...
...I made my first appeal to France
Today my voice is firmer because France is recovering
But many Frenchmen won't admit it
Do they really believe their lot is more tragic than last year?
You have short memories
Believe me, this is no time to indulge in bitterness...
...or give way to despair
You have not been sold, betrayed or abandoned
Those who say so are lying...
...and are throwing you into the arms of Communism
You will suffer for a long time still...
...for we have not atoned yet for all our faults l need your trust, the trust of your hearts and minds
I need your wisdom and patience
These attributes you will only acquire under my discipline
None but those who forget our history...
...or enemies of our unity will seek to escape
Remember you are men
Men of an old and glorious nation
Pull yourselves together, forget your fears
Give me your trust
Together we shall emerge from the night...
...of this terrible blunder
GERMANY
Dawn on 22nd June 1941
Propaganda Minister Goebbels broadcasts Hitler's proclamation...
...which condemns Russian
Bolshevism...
...for machinating for 20 years to destroy Europe
Germany and Finland are now brothers in arms
Day and night troops roll east
Leningrad is threatened
Poverty there, intrigue here...
Crime everywhere
For 15 years in central Paris...
...the GPU, Russia's Secret Police, has had a base...
...where evil is perpetrated
This house with barred windows is more like a prison than an embassy
What were these sinister peepholes for?
What kind of diplomacy needed such devices?
Ovens which look very much like those in a crematorium...
...cast a glaring light on the GPU's activities
France no longer wants Red crime on its soil
France calls for the liquidation of Bolshevism...
...and the birth of a new Europe free from Moscow's influence
French Volunteers Against Bolshevism hold their first meeting...
...at the Winter Velodrome
It wasn't France or the French who were beaten
It was those vile Jews and
Capitalists who led us
Jacques Doriot, French Popular Party
...and be worthy of Europe...
...we must fight Bolshevism alongside
Europe. There's no other way
In Versailles, the first anti-
Bolshevik contingent is constituted
Young French men enroll with Pétain's approval...
...to take part in Europe's crusade against Bolshevism
What's happening?
Someone has fired on Laval
LAVAL was not in office at the time
While German is engaged against the USSR...
...the RAF, thinking the occupied territories would be underdefended...
...attempts a Channel sortie
CODED RADIO MESSAGES
The postman was asleep
The elephant has broken a tusk
Once more, France is wounded by her former ally
Victorious Britain?
Half its merchant marine is sunk
And a third of its navy
Britain has lost Europe
It's losing the little influence it had on the Soviet continent
It will soon lose its influence in India. Britain is beaten
Her only way out is to negotiate peace
But I'd rather she didn't.
It might be at France's expense
It's France's future, her recovery...
...and, as Pétain said, the possibility of keeping...
...her place as a great European and colonial power
It's being able to look our children in the eye and say...
"Despite the contempt and hostility of others. We've worked hard...
...so you'll have a much better life than us
"We've worked hard for your happiness"
That should be our legacy
Pétain is a guest of the Limousin
He has come to visit...

He wants the young healthy in mind and body...

HOW TO TELL A JEW FROM
A FRENCHMAN
France has been the victim of its generosity...
...and traditional hospitality
Since 1936, she has been overrun by Jews
Jews held all France's top posts
After plunging a peace-loving country into war...
...they led France to its worst ever defeat
Such was the destructive work of the Jews
Paris. World News has managed to film....
...part of the trial of the Jew,
Tanenzat, alias Bernard Nathan
Our presence embarrasses the accused who would like more privacy
The preliminaries are over and the Court proceeds...
...to delve into Nathan's many swindles
France eagerly awaits its judgement
But other Jews are still on the run with forged papers
In their new promised land, the Côte d'Azur they continue speculating...
...despite the poverty of the people
They flaunt their stolen wealth
Why should they care about the misery of a country which isn't theirs?
Cocksure and cynical, they invade casinos...
...and bet millions. People's misery doesn't bother them
They speculate on it. They're the kings of the black market
But they'll be stopped
Pleasure has prevailed over
the spirit of sacrifice
People have made demands
instead of making efforts...
...and the result is misery
"I hate the lies that did us so much harm," Pétain said
The people who corrupted us and still spread lies...
...are always the Jews
They'll e expelled from our society no matter what tricks they try
They held all the key roles...
...in the economy
Now our youth can have those jobs
From now on, we shall not seek pleasure without effort
Conscious of their national responsibility, our children...
...will create a new life and a new civilisation...
...purged of all destructive and anti-social elements
Let us put the past behind us
Let us trust Pétain who has made the first move to free us...
...by proclaiming the Jewish Statute
This is the dawn of a new era with unlimited possibilities
On your feet, Europe! People of
France, answer "present"!
This isn't what you think
These film stars were admired by the whole world
But fame is transitory
Old films are now torn up...
...and their pictures chemically erased
Your favourite star...
...will now be used to varnish your nails
Old films are now used...
...to make nail varnish
The residue...
...is then melted down...
...to make shoe-polish
With a little imagination, you'll see reflected in your shoes...
...a smile you once dreamt of
A year ago...
...Pétain accompanied by Laval arrived in Montoire...
...where they met Hitler
It was the dawn of a new era for a beaten, isolated France
But this gleam of hope unleashed enormous hatred beyond our frontiers
Shots were fired at officers
of the occupying army
Two died. Fifty Frenchmen...
...have already paid for this crime with their lives
Another fifty will be shot tomorrow
if the culprits aren't found
Your duty is clear
These killings must be stopped
You must aid justice
One culprit found...
...means 100 French lives saved

Sunday in Paris
The cafés are full
This well-dressed man has no tie
Is he right or wrong?
He's right. What's the use of a tie today?
We've so few clothes coupons
For smokers, tobacco is a real problem. The butt end...
...was once a poor man's right but today charity begins at home
This should be enough for a pipe
Is he right or wrong?
Right because tobacco is in short supply
Wrong because butt-ends re ad for your health
So are they right or wrong?
The world's eyes are turned on Dieppe
British, American and Canadian troops attempt a landing
A division comes ashore
At sea, 26 transports await the result of the battle
The next day Britain reports...
"Our troops were met by a curtain of fire"
The attackers could not silence the German defence
It's 4pm. The operation has failed totally
The English have left behind
3,500 dead, wounded and prisoners
The German government recognises the bravery of these young men...
...who were sacrificed by their High
Command with amazing nonchalance
The people of Dieppe fought fires...
...and helped the defenders
To reward their bravery...
...Hiter has released all POWs from the Dieppe area
At Dieppe station, the first khaki uniforms appear
Everyone looks for his loved ones
Unforgettable moments, reflecting the hope...
...in our hearts
Mothers, wives, children...
...are living their finest hour
Was this not a generous gesture?
Today hatred is no more. We must all work to make our country great...
...and to build peace between our peoples
30th August
From  tribune decked in purple, the country's saviour...
...reviews an impressive parade
Pétain goes to Jaude Square...
...where Légionnaires renew their oath of loyalty
Before a fervent crowd, he addresses the whole country
Too many French people...
...look back
They still believe in a return to an easy life under the old regime
Politicians...
...who have lost their privileges...
Bourgeois businessmen blinded by selfishness...
Trusts eager to restore domination...
Public officials, passively if not actively hostile
I will not accept doubts...
...or complaints whatever their source
Pétain then leaves...
...to meet Laval
THE SCHOOLS OF THE STATE POLICE
At this school founded in 1942...
...policemen receive 5 weeks's training
Five weeks of active, disciplined life...
...give men who have the delicate...
...and often dangerous job of ensuring law and order...
...a sense of duty...
...dedication...
...and national pride
It was said 1942 would be the year of the Middle East
Rommel has reinforced his position in the west...
Von Bock has reached the Caucasus
German troops have pierced
Stalingrad's defences

The others hope to return soon
- You had a good trip?
- Yes
48 hours is nothing after two years
You're 300 from the free zone?
About 230
The Battle of Stalingrad
Day and night, German squadrons support...
...the infantry's pincer movement from the north, west and south
They bombard Soviet fortifications...
...and dive-bomb troop concentrations
German troops have infiltrated the suburbs
There is no mechanised support
There is hand-to-hand fighting in the streets
German troops advance house by house, meeting desperate resistance
In the Velodrome in Paris, Marcel
Cerdan and Spaniard José Ferrer...

Cerdan is the new European champion

...the British advance
At the Winter Garden in Berlin,
French trapeze artists...
...are a great success
Frenchmen, some officers in the service of a foreign power...
have refused to obey my orders
Generals, officers and soldiers of the African Army...
...do not obey these unworthy leaders
I order you...
...to resist Anglo-Saxon aggression
Your only duty is to obey
Your only government...
...is the one to which I gave power
On the Eastern front
Near Leningrad in the hard Russian winter...
...troops are learning to adapt
The new camouflage
It's very cold
The blizzard blows
The men's lives...
...are a daily fight...
...against the winter as well as the enemy
Thanks to them, Europe is spared the nightmare of Bolshevism
PETAIN'S CHRISTMAS MESSAGE
I am not giving you my good wishes for the future tonight...
...because I've no more idea than you what the future holds
Misery or a better life?
Providence works in mysterious ways
But I tell you this. You should meditate on your misfortunes
Far from making you dejected, meditation will lift you up
Try to understand what you were, what you are, what you must become
YOUR MEMORY IS SHORT
School children are Vichy's guests of honour
Pétain is meeting 1,200...
...of the most industrious who will hand him donations...
...collected all over France
More than four million francs for POWs' children
French solidarity is no empty word
Pétain had gifts...
...for his visitors

Parliament is corrupt, both the left and the right
You Capitalists...
You've led the working class into poverty
And you Communists...

For the first time in history,
POWs arrive home on leave
After flowers, wine
A taste almost forgotten
These are the first of the 250,000
POWs...
...to become free workers in Germany
In France or Germany...
...work against the enemy

...when Christmas brings back the ghost of happy days...
...to our dark times...
...France's children should be writing...
...to show their distant fathers...
...they love them even more than if they were here
How can you show them you're thinking of them?
By writing, sir
What will you write?
That I'll be good at home to please him
What else?
That I'll help Mum
Tell them all the simple things...
...and I'm sure you'll write the best letter

MARECHAL PETAIN DELIVERS XMAS
MESSAGE TO THE FRENGH PEOPLE
Dear friends....
...circumstances force me...
...to make my Xmas wishes sound like a supreme exhortation
Listen to a man only here for you, who loves you like a father
Once more, I beg you to think...
...of the fatal danger our country would face...
...if an awful civil war broke out...
...or if Communism and its barbarism triumphed
But let us not end Christmas Eve with such painful visions
I want to reaffirm my hope before you and with you
Our POWs and workers are far from us.
They will return home
Our towns are destroyed.
We shall rebuild them
The storms we are enduring will pass
The French will love each other again
On 1st January, Pétain and Prime
Minister Laval carried out...
...their first duty of the year
They received minsters...
...representatives of the occupation authorities and diplomats...
...thus affirming their harmony
French people, remember
Yesterday isn't that long ago
Unemployment, the cancer of Capitalism, was rife in France
By a cruel fate, these men and women...
...seemed excluded from normal life.
They had no right to make a living
They were a burden on society
NO VACANCIES
They were a burden on society
Despite a year of war...
...in 1940, there were still
1,074,188 unemployed
In 1941, there were only 181,768
This great reduction took only a year
In 1942, the number of unemployed in France went down to 59,262
In 1943, there were just 10,583 unemployed
Today there are none
Why?
Pétain, our leader, says...
"You may be far from home but you're still working for France
"Yesterday's unemployed are now workers conscious of their duty
"Working for our common country,
Europe"
You men preaching patriotism whilst sheltering behind...
...your microphones in London and Algiers. Where do you stand?
We're told we're not patriots because we collaborate with Germany
Because we believe it's essential for Europe
We're told we're not patriots because we accept defeat
It breaks our hearts too...
...but we start from that point with courage...
...using French methods and French leaders...
...to attain a French recovery
And you say we're not patriots?
You who have so lost faith in your country...
...that you count on foreigners to bring back what's lost
In Paris, Field Marshal Rommel...
...meets Field Marshal Von Rundstedt
Ordered by the Führer, he visits...
...the Atlantic fortifications...
...with a group of experienced officers
All along the coastline...
...the German army is on guard
Near Chalon-sur-Saône, 18 die in a terrorist attack
These are not reprisals but
legitimate self-defence
They salute the bodies of three security officers...
...killed while fighting
Communist terrorists
Anglo-American planes drop incendiary bombs on Clermont-Ferrand
Pétain goes in person to comfort the victims
In Paris, Labour Minister Bichelonne cedes his post to M. Déat
The ministers introduce...
...their assistants
Air battle at the Nettuno bridgehead
Afterwards, anti-aircraft guns open up
Enemy ships re bombarded in Anzio harbour
It is your duty to tell our French brothers about the LVF
GENERAL EDGAR PUAUD
LEGION OF FRENCH VOLUNTEERS (LVF)
It has been dragged in the mud
Wearing grey uniforms doesn't make us German
These sons and fathers aren't soldiers of fortune
They're risking their lives for an deal
I only wish others did as much
...a strong France...
...which will be symbolised by a new army...
...a young army, a dynamic army
Just tell the French...
...those in the East are true
Frenchmen fighting for their country
At the Winter Velodrome...
...French Volunteers...
...against Bolshevism...
...cheered by 20,000 people...
...call on the youth of France
Pushed around...
...and shaken by the truth among this apathetic people...
...youth doesn't know where to turn
It's a beautiful mystery, a chronicle in verse...
...that our boys are writing with their bayonets and blood...
...on this immense white page of Russia's snowy steppes
Youth of France, will you understand the Légion's spiritual message?
Don't our young people realise that if they don't fight...
...European youth fighting on the Eastern front will despise them?
To he twenty...
To live in the greatest period of history...
...and to behave like physical and moral hooligans...
...how weak and degenerate!
They gave their lives to fight banditry
Before leaving Vichy temporarily...
...Pétain attends the trooping of the colour...
...a ceremony held in Issy each Sunday since the armistice
More upright than ever...
...despite his responsibilities...
...he is still young in mind and above all in heart
The great soldier is the leader...
...around whom our threatened
French unity must be consolidated
Pétain goes to the Paris town hall with M. Bousquet and M. Bussières
Pétain is out to sign the city's book of honour
Afterwards he said...
"I beg you to do nothing that might endanger Laval's and my actions...
"...and France's future"
Paris shows its joy...
...at seeing the man who best incarnates France's image l have come to visit you
I can't address each of you one by one. It's impossible
You're too many l think of you a lot
As soon as I can, l will come back on an official visit l hope to see you again soon
He drives triumphantly through Paris
I don't work for Germany,
I don't work for the enemy
I'm not like Messieurs Grenier,
Marty and Labarthe...
...nor those Jews, Schumann, Dac,
Bloch...
14th March
...and Mendès-France
Many times it's been said...
...Pétain wouldn't dare leave
Vichy...
...or be seen in France's true capital
But when he came to Paris the other day...
...million Parisians crowded the streets
One felt it was the moment...
...when people came to their senses and began regaining their lost unity
Heavy guns every 300 yards
Along 2,000 kms from the Pyrenees to the North Sea...
...6,000 guns in gun emplacements
Plus 5,000 pieces of artillery and 3,000 armour-piercing guns
Millions of mines have been laid at sea, and on the beaches...
...there are barbed-wire fences and traps to stop advancing tanks
There are daily drills
The men take up action stations
These blockhouses used
10 million tons of concrete
The cement lorries, end to end, would have stretched round the globe
Posts are inter-communicating
Lifts bring up men from underground
In minutes, everything is ready
Here is an exceptional document
An invasion exercise by
Anglo-American troops
Footage obtained with great difficulty
Landing craft head for the shore
They are followed by specially designed tanks
A beachhead is established
But the troops are surrounded by the German defence
If an invasion were attempted, this is how the Germans would react
Millions of tons of steel...
...fall on the attacker
Hellish visions. They are ready
It's not their enemies the Anglo-Americans are bombing
It's France
This building in flames
...isn't just a house, it's a home
Tomorrow it could be yours
Is this modern warfare? Is this the new Anglo-American weapon?
Decimating...
Murdering defenceless French people?
No other word for it. This is murder
Actors like Jean Marais and
Alain Cuny...
...murdering Racine's work would be no less sacrilegious...
...than Britain attacking our cathedrals
Events are dictating the news.
The Whitsun holiday
A bloody day. Lille, Marseille,
Epinal, Nantes, Nice, Rouen
5,000 dead, over 7,000 wounded, over 100,000 bombed-out in 3 days
The Anglo-Americans can be proud of themselves
This is London.
The French speak to the French
Be patient, we're coming
Isn't this France?
Yes, bomb them
Mickey, is it true they have better spinach in France?
We're coming, we're coming, we're coming
Léonie, we'll have steak and chips again
And coffee in the morning
And English cigarettes
Hot chocolate and croissants
This is London. French friends,
our programme is over
Pétain is in Lorraine to show his sympathy for the victims
This is Square Stanislas in Nancy
As in Paris, Louviers and Rouen...
...Pétain's visit was not announced in advance
Yet people have come out quite spontaneously
Listen to their shouts. This isn't joy by decree...
...or a cheers brigade
Don't take part in the conflict
It would cause you and France only grief
Accept the ordeals that are sent to us. They are terrible
But they'll ne less terrible if you don't take part
Trust in France's future
28th May
Cheering in Dijon
Tomorrow, Pétain...
...goes back to Vichy...
...as freely as he left it
In Algiers or London...
...they think they're better patriots than us
But they can no longer say we don't see Pétain...
...as our only legitimate leader
Yesterday in the Commons...
...Mr Eden talked about a landing in France
So a landing may be attempted tomorrow
What if only French troops are involved and they're told...
..."You can have the honour of reconquering France"?
And then they're massacred by
Germans troops
Meanwhile the British rub their hands in glee...
...calculating the regiments they've saved
Historic night of the 5th June 1944
The Anglo-Americans land in Normandy
The supreme battle has begun
After so much fighting, fury and
pain...
comes the decisive shock
So long awaited
It's not only the French battle
It's the Battle of France
The enemy has widened its beachhead by sacrificing thousands of men
Parachute divisions and airborne troops...
...land behind German lines
In fields and woods, gliders lie wrecked
In three days, 1,300 gliders have been destroyed
In the sky...
...RAF and Luftwaffe squadrons...
...fight a merciless duel
The Caen area...
...is bombed
German armoured divisions continue to press forward
The battle spreads across the Normandy countryside
Sadly there will be no harvest here
In a week 400 Anglo-American tanks have been put out of action
Protected by their ships' guns, after 12 days' fighting...
...the assailants have control of a 100 km coastal strip
After months of terrorist attacks,
France once more faces war
War on our soil...
...with its vile retinue of destruction...
...desolation...
...and death
Behind the lines,
France's martyrdom has begun
Here is Lisieux
After 22 minutes' bombing, it looks like the ruins of Pompei
The town is now only a name on a map
HOPE
On 10th June, 1944...
...4 days after France's invasion...
...the 'Maréchal Pétain' is prepared for its launch
Image of a time of peace, a comforting image
It lights in our hearts a glimmer of hope
First things first. Maintain life, and law and order
It is vital for France's future
At Belleville, the Choirboys of the Wooden Cross...
...celebrate their 20th anniversary
We remember the man who died in the service of France
All Europe will feel his loss
Philippe Henriot is no more but his faith and words remain in our hearts
It's as if we could still hear his passionate voice
Insult me, criticise me,
I won't answer back
Any spilt blood was your doing
I won't honour slanderers and
murderers by talking to them
I can't hate you because I'd only be
hating a name you'd stolen
I despise you too much to say more
Bombing Paris has no bearing on the war but it makes life difficult
Yet artistic life goes on
There's an open-air performance of
'Mignon'
A good audience assembles under the trees
It's a tradition in the capital
Parisians know how to adapt
There's no electricity...
...so many theatres have removed their roofs for open-air shows
Artists won't give in. And, when it rains, people have umbrellas
LAST NEWSREEL OF THE OCCUPATION
Geneva's Ethnographic Museum...
...is host to a strange exhibition
Grotesque or frightening...
...the diversity of these masks is amazing
The collection...
...offers great interest to visitors
In 1940, there are 1,600,000
French POWs in Germany
In 1944, there re 1,750,000 French
POWs workers and deportees there
Men and women...
...we're here, we're home...
...in Paris which rose to liberate herself...
...by her own hands
We will not hide our deep and sacred emotion
We all feel that some moments surpass...
...each of our paltry lives
Paris was raped
Paris was broken, martyrised
But Paris was liberated.
Liberated by her own hands
It was liberated by her people with the help of France's armies...
...with the support and the help of the whole of France
I mean the strong France, the only France...
...the real France, the eternal France
Three months ago, Pétain, dismissed by Hitler, surrendered to France
At the Swiss order
General Koenig...
...took charge of the man who used our defeat to suppress the Republic
Pétain, now with a rather different personal guard, has been imprisoned
After Montoire, Montrouge
