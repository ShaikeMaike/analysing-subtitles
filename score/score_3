Papa!
Papa!
What now, Hildy?
Look!
Gee whiz. Again.
What´s the matter, Gus?
Cigarette.
Ken riding her?
He was, but not now.
Hildy.
Whoa, whoa.
Doggone that kid.
Look at this.
I hope he´s all right.
Young´uns fall light.
He´s used to it.
He could get hurt.
Saddle Shorty.
I better go see.
Ja, Boss.
Never mind, Gus.
Ken.
Yes, sir?
Come here.
You all right?
Sure, I´m all right.
Cigarette toss you again?
Yes, sir.
You ""digged"" your heels in her.
I didn´t.
Did you, Son?
Yes, sir.
Ken, aren´t you ever going to grow up?
I´ve told you not to clap your heels into her.
Look at that bridle.
Second one you´ve broken this week.
I´m sorry, Dad.
Oh, you found the saddle blanket.
What saddle blanket?
I lost it yesterday afternoon.
You forgot to cinch the saddle properly.
Yes, sir.
Gee whiz, it´s all ""tored.""
Will you keep quiet?
It got caught on some barbed wire.
You´re the doggonest kid... for losing, busting, and forgetting.
Breakfast is all ready.
Where´s Ken?
He´s coming.
Cigarette tossed him again.
I don´t know what
I´ll do with that boy.
Doesn´t pay any attention to what I say.
Always losing equipment or breaking it somehow.
He´s still a child.
He´s old enough to have his wits about him.
He´s walking around with his head in the clouds.
It´s a wonder he doesn´t trip.
Morning, Mom.
Come on, darling.
Eat your oatmeal while it´s hot.
Good heavens.
What is it?
Ken´s report card.
I suppose you´re not surprised you haven´t been promoted.
No, sir.
Here, look at your marks.
Let him eat his breakfast first.
Just as a matter of curiosity... how do you go about getting a zero on an examination?
40 in history, 1 7 in arithmetic, but a zero?
Just as one man to another, what goes on in your head?
What have you got to say for yourself?
Nothing, sir.
What were the questions you missed... in that English exam?
We were to write a composition.
Couldn´t you think of anything?
I was going to write... about how you lost your polo mare... how the albino stole her from Banner.
Well, why didn´t you?
I got to thinking.
I thought we had time.
I thought the hour had just begun... when the school bell rang.
You never even got started.
Not a single word, Ken?
No.
Just daydreaming, huh?
No, I was thinking about--
About what?
About my colt.
You haven´t got a colt.
Dad, give me a colt, won´t you?
You´ll get one when you learn how to treat one.
You´ll have to buck up.
Trouble is, you don´t try.
I do try, Dad.
I´d like to see some proof.
Meantime, you´ll study an hour a day... to make up your work.
[Knock On Door]
Come in.
Good morning,
Missus.
Good morning, Gus.
What´s today, Boss?
Good day to move the horses.
It´s time they were off the meadows.
A storm´s cooking up.
Can I help?
Four older horses have to be in shape for the rodeo... and those three-year-olds have to be broke.
Can´t I help move them?
Great guns, no.
It´s tough enough to move 1 00 horses... all fresh as blazes after a winter out... without a kid along to make them nervous.
- I´ll be right out.
- Ja, Boss.
Want another cup of coffee, dear?
No, I had enough.
Got to get started.
Kenny, you can ride any horse on the ranch.
Why are you so set on having a colt?
It isn´t just riding.
I want a colt to be friends with me.
I want a colt of my own, all my own.
You better start your studying.
Get it over with.
Bye, Daddy.
Bye.
Ken, what are you doing?
I´m doing my arithmetic, Mom.
[Alarm Rings]
Where are we going?
To watch Dad bring in the horses.
We can take the shortcut.
No, you better stay here.
It´s tough enough bringing in 1 00 horses... all fresh after a winter out... without having a girl tagging along making them nervous.
Those horses ain´t scared of me.
Good morning.
Nice work, Banner.
Banner don´t let those mares get away with nothing.
Banner´s got everything it takes to make a great horse-- brains, heart, and courage.
If he´d just pass it on to all the colts.
What horses we´d have then.
Whoa now!
Whoa now!
Whoa there!
Look out, Gus.
They´re stampeding!
Gus, try to head them off.
Stop them, Banner!
They´re making straight for the rock slide.
Head them off, Banner.
[Whinny]
[Whinny]
[Whinny]
What are you doing here?
I--I came to see the horses.
I didn´t mean to do it.
I didn´t mean to scare them.
[Whinny]
Jeepers, if I could ever have a colt like that.
Are we on the downgrade?
I never had so many bills and less money to pay them.
We can´t sell our horses at a profit.
They´re good horses with good blood.
Mm-hmm, all but that albino strain.
They got a crazy streak in them.
No use trying to sell them.
I wouldn´t even get back the cost of raising them.
I´d rather shoot them.
I would, too, if they weren´t so doggone fast.
I hoped to get one decent colt out of that bunch.
Rob... give Ken a colt.
Huh?
I want you to give Ken a colt.
After that stunt he pulled this morning?
You know he didn´t mean to.
He doesn´t deserve a colt.
Won´t you ever give him one?
Sure. I´ve been expecting to.
If he pays attention to his studies--
Uh-uh.
No.
That´s another thing.
That isn´t going to get anzwhere.
Didn´t he study today?
He exposed himself to his books.
Good heavens. Nothing I say to him makes any impression.
He wants his own colt.
He can´t think of another thing.
But that´s all backwards.
You don´t bribe children to do their duty.
It´s not a bribe.
What would you call it?
I just have a feeling...
Ken isn´t going to pull anything off.
It´s time he did.
Maybe a little thing like this... would turn the trick.
That isn´t a little thing.
It isn´t easy to break and school a colt.
I won´t have a good horse spoiled by his carelessness.
Rob, it´s important.
He´s got to succeed at something.
What he needs is--
Is to snap out of it.
If you want to put it that way.
He needs to grow up.
How would having his own colt help?
Oh, you know.
Something of his own... responsibility.
He´d have something real that he cared about... more than those things he goes mooning about.
Don´t go.
I´d like to give Ken a colt.
I´d like to get closer to the boy somehow... but every time I get set for a get-together session... he hands me a facer like what he pulled today.
Rob, didn´t you ever want anything... more than anything else in the world?
Yes. You.
You do understand.
[Whinny]
[Whinny]
[Humming]
Where´s Ken?
Probably looking at the ducks on the landing.
For Pete´s sake, what ducks on what landing?
That old print of mine.
He likes to look at them.
Gus says Rocket broke away last night.
Thinks she´s got a colt somewhere.
We´ll have to look for her.
I´ll find her.
Good. I´ll go with you.
Son, I´m taking back yesterday´s order.
You can forget that hour of study.
Thanks, Dad.
And, Ken...
I´m going to give you a colt.
A colt?
A colt of my own?
Mm-hmm.
I´ll give it to you a week from today.
That´ll give you time to make your own choice.
I can have any colt on the ranch?
- Ayearling?
- That´s right.
Gosh.
Jeepers, maybe I can have the one I saw yesterday.
Come on, you old jughead.
Come on there.
Oh, come on. Come on.
Oh, step on my foot, would you?
Come on.
Why don´t you take Highboy for your colt?
That chump?
Don´t think I´m riding Cigarette because I want to.
It´s because
I have to.
Then how about Lassie?
She´s as fast as anything and black as ink.
Who said I wanted a black horse?
How about College Boy?
He´s smart like a fox.
I´m going to pick a filly.
I know the one
I want, too.
I hope I find her.
Hey, don´t do that again, Hildy.
Cigarette´s kind of nervous.
She might kick you.
She better don´t.
I´ll kick her back.
Thanks, Tim.
OK.
Ready, Ken?
Yes, sir.
Don´t see why
I can´t go, too.
You´re a girl.
That´s why.
Check your cinch?
Yes, sir.
Let´s go.
Ken, don´t you want your hat?
Oh, thanks, Mom.
Don´t see why
I can´t be a boy.
Even you´re a boy...
I guess.
Maybe you think it´s funny, giving you a colt... when you deserve a good hiding.
Flunking all your exams... then pulling that stunt yesterday.
Don´t think
I´m letting you off.
I´m not.
I haven´t gone soft.
Don´t get that into your head.
I expect as much now as I ever did.
This isn´t any reward... because you haven´t won any reward.
This is a partnership.
One of these days,
I´ll need your help.
You have to be trained so you can give it.
Every man needs training.
Discipline.
I got mine at West Point.
And how.
You´re going to train that colt.
I´ll help you with the first breaking... but you´ll train it, and it´ll train you.
Yes, sir.
You and your mother may have to care for this ranch... without me pretty soon.
Where will you be?
I may have to go back into the army.
You understand, don´t you?
Yes, sir.
You make a good pony out of that colt... and let it make a man out of you.
Yes, sir.
I rode all through here yesterday.
I didn´t leave any colts behind.
If Rocket had a colt, she wouldn´t leave it.
I saw a colt yesterday... that got separated from the bunch in the stampede-- a sorrel filly with a cream mane and tail.
Sounds like
Rocket´s yearling.
Rocket´s?
The filly sired by Banner last spring.
That´s what was wrong with Rocket-- she missed that little filly.
She´d very likely console herself with a yearling.
Should pick up a track around here someplace.
Hey, Boss!
A cat.
That´s a mountain lion, all right.
Ja. A big one.
Haven´t had one around here for a long time.
Good thing we got the brood mares out of here.
Maybe we better look around that cave.
Well, it got one of them.
It´s dark brown.
It´s Rocket´s, I guess.
Tim was right.
She had one.
Didn´t she know it was dead?
Yes and no.
Mares are funny about death.
They´ll leave a dead foal... then remember it and hunt for it.
Will the mountain lion get any other horses?
Not now, Kenny.
They´re all out on the range.
Can´t he get the horse and colts there?
Not where there´s no cover.
Their only chance is surprise.
If a horse is off by itself... a lion will jump on it, bite through the spine.
Quick kill.
[Whinny]
It´s Rocket.
And her filly.
What a pretty little flicka she is.
Flicka<
What does that mean?
Swedish for ::little girl.´´
Flicka. That´s what I´ll call her.
My colt.
Your colt?
Yes, sir.
That´s the one I want.
Rocket´s filly, Ken?
Yes, sir.
I hoped you´d make a wiser choice.
You know how I feel... about Rocket´s line of horses.
But she´s fast.
Rocket´s fast, too.
They´re my worst horses.
There´s not one among them with any real sense.
The mares are hellions, the stallions outlaws.
They´re untamable.
I´ll tame her.
Nobody´s ever been able to tame a one of them.
You want a horse that´ll be a friend?
Yes, sir.
You´ll never make a friend of her.
Look what they did to get back together.
No fence in the world will ever hold them.
You better change your mind.
No.
OK, Ken. I promised you could make your own choice.
But remember--
Rocket´s loco... and 1 0-to-1 the colt is, too.
But she may not be.
Banner´s her father.
All right.
We´ll bring her in tomorrow or the next day.
It´s silly to write horses´ names on things.
Horses can´t read.
People can read.
But Pop can´t.
Besides, you ain´t even got a horse yet.
What do you mean
I haven´t got a horse?
Well, it ain´t here.
Dad´s bringing her in today.
[Honk Honk]
[Honk Honk Honk]
That´s Mr. Sergent.
He´s got lots of race horses.
He´s got a fat belly, too.
Hey, Gus, is Rob around?
Ja.
He´s in the house.
Hi, Rob.
Hi, Charley.
How you been doing?
Good. You?
Swell.
Glad to see you.
Sit down.
Rob, I´m shipping a carload of horses to Los Angeles.
Maybe you´d like to go in on the deal... and share the shipping expenses.
Might do that.
There´s room in the car for four more horses.
Sounds pretty good.
You know, Pop says
Flicka´s loco... like her mother.
Don´t say that, Hildy.
Well, ain´t her fault.
She can´t help it if her mom´s crazy, can she?
Banner´s got sense.
She could be like her father, couldn´t she?
I don´t know.
When I do something dumb...
Mom says I take after the old man... and when I do something smart...
Pop says I sure don´t take after the old lady.
You haven´t got anything like Rocket.
That she-devil can outrun... any animal you´ve ever seen.
You´re crazy.
Like to make a bet?
Hello, Charley.
Well, hello there, Nell.
No. Don´t get up.
I only have a minute.
What are you two talking about?
Rocket.
If I could get a mare to do #5 miles an hour--
She´ll make you a fortune... if you could break her.
My broncobuster can break any horse.
He can do it if she´s worth breaking.
Worth it?
Didn´t I tell you?
How much do you want?
Dollars.
You got a stopwatch?
No. I got a speedometer.
Good enough.
Let´s go.
I´ll get lunch ready for you.
[Honking]
There they are.
Isn´t Flicka beautiful?
[Honk Honk]
She´s heading for the north range.
We´ll clock her there.
The ground´s flat.
[Honk Honk]
She´s like a locomotive.
Does she always run with her nose up?
Yeah. She´s a stargazer.
[Honk Honk]
[Honk Honk]
Look at the speedometer.
Faster, Boss.
She ain´t half trying.
[Honk Honk]
If she does #5,
I´ll buy her.
Jumping jeepers!
Well, what do you say?
It´s a deal... if she´s delivered sound in wind and limb.
Just how you´ll do that is anybody´s guess.
You leave that to me.
Look out for Rocket.
Get in there, get in there!
Tim, throw a rope on her.
[Whinny]
Won´t be easy to get her in.
Stay with her, Tim.
Come on!
Get that noose off her neck.
Be careful, Rob.
Think I´d deliver her with string hanging on her?
I put it on.
I´m going to get it off.
Look out!
Open that chute gate so she can see through.
Get in there.
Shut the gate.
Get the truck.
Whoa. That´s it.
Sergent expects her in good shape.
Try not to skin her up.
Get her out of here.
Well, that´s that.
You mean that´s $500.
It´ll come in mighty handy, won´t it?
Dad, look!
Oh, Rob.
That finished her.
Well?
She´s dead.
Poor old Rocket.
It´s too bad, but these things will happen.
Just takes little lick to kill horse.
There´s one thing
I can still do.
Hello, Williams?
This is McLaughlin.
OK. Thanks.
Look, Williams, I got a load of horses for you.
Yeah, those albinos.
Yep. Every one of them,
Rocket´s whole tribe.
There should be some good horseflesh among them.
All right, your own price.
Good.
Yep.
There are nine of them.
Wait a minute.
There may be 1 0.
Ken, come here.
Here´s a chance to do a sensible thing.
I want you to choose another colt... and let me sell Flicka to Mr. Williams.
I´m asking for your sake as well as mine.
What´s the use having another Rocket?
You saw what happened.
I´m going to tame Flicka.
That´s impossible.
Sometimes bad horses get tamed.
You don´t want a loco horse, do you?
I want Flicka.
Look at me.
Dad, please.
She´s mine.
Sorry to keep you waiting, Williams.
I thought there was one more.
No. There are only nine.
Right.
I´ll send them over.
So long.
Haw!
Haw!
Git!
Well, that´s that.
Sure is a wild one.
We´ll let her think it over.
She´ll go right through that wire.
She´ll never go over.
It turned her.
Dad, she has got sense.
Flicka!
I knew it, that crazy--
Rob, hurry!
Whoa, whoa!
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
There now.
Don´t think she´ll pull out of it.
Maybe it´s just as well.
Hadn´t been this way, it would´ve been another.
A loco horse isn´t worth the bullet... it takes to shoot it.
Now easy, girl.
Flicka.
Eat your dinner,
Kenny.
Do I have to, Mom?
You heard what your mother said.
Flicka, she´s--
Let him go to her.
He can´t do her any good.
Gus and Tim dressed her cuts.
She snaps out of it, she´s got water and oats.
Oh, Flicka, I didn´t mean to hurt you.
Get well.
Please be all right.
Gee, she was pretty.
What do you mean ::was´´?
She is.
She´s beautiful.
I meant when she was running back there.
Say, Ken.
Tomorrow, if you want to take care of her...
I´ll do your work for you.
Would you, Hildy?
Gee, that´d be keen.
Sure.
I´ll exercise Cigarette... bring in the wood, and dry the dishes.
You can stay with Flicka all the time... except when you´re sleeping.
Thanks, Hildy.
[Rooster Crows]
[Ring]
Gus, she´s going to be all right, isn´t she?
Pretty good chance... if we could get her to eat.
Maybe she don´t like oats.
I´ll get her some hay.
Whoa.
Don´t run away, Flicka.
Don´t be afraid of me.
I´m Ken.
This is hay.
You´ll like it.
Have some.
Take it easy.
She´s been scared pretty bad.
She´s eating.
She´s going to get well.
Ja.
It´s good sign.
Move her to the calf pasture.
There´s shade there and a running stream.
And she´ll be alone.
I thought horses like company.
Not her.
She´s a lone wolf.
She might jump out of the calf pasture and get away.
She won´t jump out.
She won´t jump anything for a long time.
[Whistling]
Ken. Breakfast.
Coming, Dad.
What´s he so chipper about this morning?
Flicka. She´s better.
Coming along, huh?
Mm-hmm.
She´s almost well.
The cuts are all healed up... and she´s eating like a horse.
Ooh.
Maybe we´re going to have a pleasant summer after all... if she doesn´t turn out to be another Rocket.
Oh, I hope not.
Ken, what kind of manners is that?
Sorry, Mom.
Morning, Dad.
Morning, Ken.
How were the ducks on the landing this morning?
What ducks on what landing?
Oh. Those.
Hardly noticed them.
Been so busy with Flicka.
Now that Flicka´s getting better... don´t forget you´ve got other duties.
Oh, yes, sir.
Give some time to your colt... but not all your time.
I won´t.
Will you come down... and look at Flicka this morning... see how she is?
Will Her Highness let you get near her?
Well, not too close.
She´s still a little scared.
But she´ll let you look at her... from the other side of the fence.
That´s big of her.
After breakfast, I´ll take a look.
Oh, swell.
Ooh!
Kenny.
Good morning, Flicka.
Flicka, Dad´s coming to look at you.
Be a good girl and don´t run away.
Well, she does look good.
Her cuts are all healed up... except for the one on the right front leg.
It´s almost well.
She´s beautiful.
Dad?
Do you think she´s... loco?
I´d have sworn it by the way she´s behaved... ever since she was born.
In fact, we´ve never seen her... except when she´s looked terrified.
Every horse looks wild in the eye... when it´s terrified.
She tried jumping that fence.
Anyone can try the impossible once.
There´s the old saying--
::It couldn´t be done... but the darn fool did it anzway.´´
Horses have jumped over 6 feet.
Maybe Flicka thought she could do it.
We´ll forgive her that one.
Point is, will she learn?
Can she learn?
Rocket couldn´t.
Or wouldn´t.
Dad, maybe I´ll never get her trained.
Heavens, Son, what have I been telling you... all these weeks?
Didn´t you understand?
What did you think loco meant?
Sort of goofy or wild-- hard to handle.
Oh, no, Son.
Much more serious than that.
There´s inherited insanity among animals... just as there is among humans.
Bad blood carries on... and albino blood isn´t safe for any filly to have.
But you said... maybe it´s just because she´s been scared.
She´s got a very intelligent face.
Much better than Rocket´s.
Fine, delicate mouth.
And such lovely eyes.
Mm-hmm.
Set far apart.
We´ll have to see how she responds to training.
How can I train her?
All you can do is try and win her confidence.
You know, Son, if you take everything away... from a living creature-- freedom, friends, its home, habits... happiness-- it´ll turn in sheer need and desperation... to the one thing that´s left.
In this case, that´s you.
Me?
Yes. You´re her whole life now.
Make her to like it.
Oh, I will, Dad.
I will.
Give her love and companionship.
Talk to her.
Will she understand me?
Of course.
A horse can tell you a lot of things, too... if you watch and expect it to be sensible and intelligent.
Pay attention to all the little signs.
The way it moves its body.
The ears. The eyes.
The whinnies.
That´s its way of talking, Ken.
That´s right.
There´s a neigh of terror.
A scream of rage.
A whinny of nervous impatience.
[Flicka Snorts]
The nicker of longing or hunger... or friendliness.
You learn its language, and it´ll learn yours.
And never forget-- horses understand everything you say to them.
Everything, Dad?
Everything.
[Flicka Snorts]
You mean... if they´re not loco.
[Whinny]
[Whinny]
[Whinny]
All right, all right... you´re hungry for your oats... but I´m hurrying as fast as I can.
There.
There you are.
Come and get it.
Good, isn´t it?
You do understand me, don´t you, Flicka?
Eat it all so you´ll be big and strong like Banner.
You´ve got a very smart father, Flicka.
You´ve got to forget all your wild ways... and be just like him.
Who are you talking to?
Flicka.
Aw, horses can´t understand people´s talk.
That´s all you know.
Flicka understands everything I say.
What´s more, she talks back to me.
Aw, poo.
Maybe you don´t know it... but horses got a language all their own.
There´s a neigh of terror... a scream of rage... a whinny of nervous impatience... a nicker of longing--
Eee-h-h-h!
There´s a nicker of hunger.
R-r-r-r.
Can you wiggle your ears?
Oh...
[Whinny]
What´s she saying now?
Oh, she´s telling me she´s finished her oats.
Oh.
Maybe she´s saying thank you, too.
Maybe she wants more oats.
[Whinny]
Maybe she´s had too many.
Maybe she´s got a pain in her stomach.
Maybe she needs some castor oil.
Only gluttons need castor oil.
[Whinny]
[Whinny]
She wants something.
Oh, I know.
She´s thirsty.
Why don´t you go and get a drink?
There´s a whole lake full of water.
Oh, all right.
Boy, you sure are getting spoiled.
Oh, gosh. I forgot.
Your Pop´s back.
For Pete´s sake.
Why didn´t you tell me?
I´ve got to see him right away!
[Whinny]
You hear that?
That means she doesn´t want me to go.
Aw, I betcha it just means... she´s got gas on her stomach.
[Whinny]
Bet you I didn´t forget anything this time.
Flour, salt, ham--
What about my hairpins?
How could I forget anything as important as hairpins?
They´re in there.
Dad!
Dad, did you get it?
Get what?
You know.
Sorry. I forgot all about it.
You did get it, didn´t you?
Sure, I did.
It´s a beauty.
Where is it?
Well,just a minute, Son.
Your work done?
Yes, sir.
Did you exercise
Cigarette?
Yes, sir.
She´s in her own pasture... and I tied the gate.
Good. Is she hot?
No, sir. I cooled her off on the way home.
Give her a good workout?
Yes, sir, and I didn´t lose or break anything.
Good work, Son.
You´re really coming along.
Can I have it now?
It´s in the front seat.
You were right, Nell.
The filly sure did the trick.
He´s a changed boy.
Flicka!
Flicka, I´ve got something for you!
Look. Brand-new saddle blanket.
Tailor-made especially for you.
Isn´t it keen?
When you grow up, we´ll put it on you.
Won´t even know you´ve got a saddle on your back.
We´ll go riding on the range... fly like the wind.
Look.
Got your name on it.
Oh, Flicka, I didn´t mean to scare you.
Honest, I didn´t.
Come back, Flicka.
Oh, please come back.
You don´t have to have it.
I won´t ever ride you... or put a saddle on you... if you don´t want me to.
You´ll just be my friend.
[Whinny]
Mom... did you ever want anything terribly?
Most everyone wants something, dear.
But you´ve grown up.
You´re married.
You´ve got Dad and me.
Why, you´re finished.
Then I shouldn´t still be wanting, should I... if I´m finished?
But people do, Ken.
Everyone?
Always, Mom?
Don´t you ever really get finished?
Yeah, I wonder.
Maybe sometimes, for a minute or two.
What is it you want now, Ken?
I do so want Flicka to be all right and not loco.
Oh, perhaps she isn´t loco, dear.
We don´t know yet for sure... but if she is, Ken... wanting won´t change it.
If she is, it´ll look bad for her, won´t it?
Let´s see what happens when we try to halter-break her.
Does she have to be?
We´ve got to find out, don´t we?
I suppose so.
As soon as she´ll let you touch her... we´ll have a try at it.
What if she won´t let us?
She loves you, doesn´t she?
Oh, yes.
I´m sure she does.
Well, that shows she´s intelligent.
How does it, Mom?
It´s just a way of putting away fear.
Don´t you understand,
Ken... that if you find love... if a person or an animal finds love... it´s the same as finding safety.
It´s comfort and friendliness and help.
Everyone longs for it.
And if Flicka´s found it... and yet doesn´t have sense enough... to know she´s found it... and goes around being crazy and silly with fear, then--
Then she´d be loco.
[Humming]
Good morning.
Where´d you catch them?
At that deep hole under the falls.
Put them in here.
Thank you.
Well, Boss, what today?
Look over the mowing machines.
We have to get at the haying soon.
Those stackers need repairs.
Oh, Gus.
Before we begin...
I want to help Ken halter-break his filly.
I want you and Tim to be on hand.
Where, Boss?
The calf pasture, and we´ll do it right now.
But, Dad, maybe... maybe we better wait a little while.
She´ll let you close to her now, won´t she?
Oh, yes.
Flicka´s my friend now.
She likes me, but--
Good. I´m glad to hear that.
It´s a fine thing to have a horse for a friend.
Flicka´s never had a rope around her neck.
She may fight us putting one on her now.
Maybe she´ll act like she did when she arrived.
Maybe she´ll act like Rocket.
She has to be halter-broken sometime.
Might as well get it over with.
Get ready.
I´ll be right down.
Didn´t you find a broken mule shoe last night?
Yes.
That´s good luck, ain´t it?
Yes, but if I make a mistake...
Dad may blame it on Flicka.
And then he wouldn´t--
Call her, Ken.
Flicka!
Have your loop ready, Tim.
[Whistles]
Put your bandanna around her neck.
Tie it in a loose knot.
Easy, Flicka. Easy.
Now take your belt off.
Slip it through the bandanna.
Now take ahold of the belt and lead her around.
All right.
Now bring her back.
Let go of the loop.
Hold your hand under her chin.
That´s it.
I´d call that halter-broken.
But it isn´t a halter, Dad.
You really take some convincing, young man.
All right. Give us the halter, Gus.
There you are.
Put it on her.
Go ahead, Son.
But how, Dad?
Just the way you put it on Cigarette.
All right, now lead her around again.
How did she get halter-broke, Dad?
That´s the way we break horses... on the Goose Bar ranch.
You figure it out, Ken.
Come on, boys.
Let´s get at those machines.
Then she´s not loco.
She´s not loco.
You could have knocked me down with a feather.
I knew she liked me pretty well, but gosh... she let me halter-break her... without even an argument.
Flicka´s a smart filly, just like her father.
All girls are smart like their pops.
[Whinny]
She´s calling me.
She sure is, Kenny.
That´s the nicker of friendliness.
Bet you she´s just hungry.
Gus, something´s happened to her!
She´s limping.
Something´s wrong with her front leg.
Flicka, what´s the matter?
What´s happened to you?
It´s that barbed-wire cut.
But that was all healed up.
But it didn´t heal right.
The leg´s swollen.
Is that bad?
Means infection.
Infection? That´s dangerous, isn´t it?
You betcha.
Hildy, you talk too much.
I think it hurts her.
She ain´t bearing any weight on it.
What do you do for a horse infection?
Just the same like for people-- put on poultice so it´ll drain.
I´ll get Mom to make a poultice.
Ja, I think you better.
She has got sense, hasn´t she, Mom?
She knows we´re helping her, doesn´t she?
Of course she does.
She´s a good little girl... and we´ll get her out of this in no time.
Slack off!.
Rip it!
Dad, I´d like to talk to you.
What about?
About Flicka.
For the love of Mike, can´t you see I´m busy?
Can´t be worrying about that filly.
I´m sorry, Dad.
Just a minute, Ken.
What is it, Son?
Flicka worse?
Dad, she´s so sick.
Will you come down and see her?
Maybe you can do something to help her.
All right. I´ll come have a look at her.
She´s lying down again.
Good heavens.
What´s happened to her?
She´s been getting awfully thin.
Thin!
I´m afraid she ain´t going to pull out of it.
Pull out of it?
She´s dead already.
How long´s she been like this?
She´s been real sick the last few days.
It´s the fever.
It´s burning her up.
She´s going to die.
We´ll have to put her out of her misery.
Oh, no, Dad.
I´m sorry, Ken.
It isn´t fair to an animal... to let it suffer like this.
Pick a time when
Ken isn´t around.
Gus!
Gus, when are you going to do it?
I was--I was going down soon now, Kenny.
Don´t do it tonight.
Wait till morning.
Just one more night.
Gus.
Well, in the morning, then.
It´s got to be done.
Your father gave the orders.
I know. I won´t say anything more.
[Dog Barks]
Shhh.
I´m coming, Flicka.
I´m coming.
Flicka?
Flicka, where are you?
Oh, my little Flicka.
Give him one of these every hour.
I´ll call to see him tomorrow morning.
He´s a very sick boy.
It isn´t only the cold and fever--
He had a shock,
Dr. Scott.
Something happened--
He´s been sad about a horse I gave him.
It´s been sick.
Oh, I see.
Well, you´d better have this prescription filled right away.
I´ll follow you into town... and bring it right back.
Don´t worry.
How is the little boy,
Missus?
Gus, he´s so sick.
Poor little boy.
[Thunder]
Gus, is Flicka dead?
No. Tim and me fixed her up in a blanket sling.
She can´t stand alone... but she drank a bucket of water.
Did Rob say you didn´t have to shoot her?
No, but I couldn´t do it.
When I found them like that this morning, I--
I know what you mean.
She´s got plenty of strength.
Sometimes I think, Gus, miracles can still happen.
It was the water washing the fever out of her... but it was Ken giving her courage.
All night that little fella sitting by her... saying, ::Hold on, Flicka.
::I´m here with you.
The two of us together.´´
I´ll tell Ken.
Maybe it will help him get well... knowing she´s still alive.
There´s a storm coming up, Missus.
I´ll stay here if you need me.
Thank you, Gus.
[Thunder]
I thought you´d never get here.
How is he?
Better. He´s been resting.
Good. We need some hot water.
Did you do as I told you?
Boss, I couldn´t.
I gave the order, and you´ve had plenty of time.
I just couldn´t do it.
Where´s the rifle?
In the bunkhouse.
Go get it.
Oh, Rob, please don´t.
He knows she´s alive.
He thinks she´ll get well.
Give him something to hope for.
[Thunder]
Would have been better if she were shot weeks ago.
It´s been nothing but misery for everyone.
Look what it´s done to Ken.
I wish you wouldn´t, Rob.
He needn´t know.
He´ll hear the shot.
He´ll think it´s thunder.
He´ll know it´s the rifle.
I´m sorry, but... it´s just no good letting sick animals live.
It´s raining.
The rain won´t hurt her, darling.
Flicka´s been out in thunderstorms all her life.
That was Dad´s car, wasn´t it, Mom?
Yes, dear.
[Whinny]
[Growl]
Please, darling.
It was only the thunder.
[Whinny]
Don´t worry about the cat.
I´m staying with you for the night.
Feel a lot better if I had a drink... and some dry clothes.
I´m a drowned rat... but so are you.
Rob!
Oh, Rob.
Yeah?
You all right?
Sure.
Ken´s asleep.
Gus is with him.
I got worried about you.
[Whinny]
But I thought--
I heard a shot.
It was a mountain lion.
Did you get him?
I will before morning.
I couldn´t do it.
She wants to die, she´ll have to do it by herself.
Ken heard the shot.
How´d he take it?
Well, he took it.
He didn´t question it, he didn´t seem to rebel.
If he wakes up and asks... don´t tell him she´s still alive.
But, Rob--
She may be dead by morning.
Wouldn´t surprise me.
He´s accepted her death.
If he knows she´s still alive, he´ll be all upset again.
I won´t tell him.
[Nickers]
[Whinny]
Thanks, Flicka.
[Whinny]
Morning, Dad.
How do you feel this morning?
Much better, thanks.
Enough better to go out in the warm sunshine?
I guess so.
It´s doctor´s orders.
Come on. I´ll help you get dressed.
Dad...where are we going?
The calf pasture.
That´s right, Son.
[Whinny]
Flicka.
It is Flicka.
But I thought--
I didn´t shoot her.
I couldn´t.
That shot you heard?
That was the mountain lion.
I killed him.
Ohh.
Ohh.
Easy, Ken.
[Whinny]
Flicka.
[Whinny]
Oh, Flicka.
She did get gentle, didn´t she, Dad?
Gentle as a kitten.
She´s given us a lot of trouble, Son... but she´s taught us some important things, too.
You, responsibility.
Me, there is such a thing as hope beyond hope.
That sometimes, when things are at their lowest ebb... all we need do is have a little more love... a little more patience, and a little more faith.
Man: And the winner is...
Gloria sanchez!
Congratulations, gloria sanchez!
Woman: That was the climactic moment last night
At the little miss havana pageant
As gloria sanchez won the crown.
And with election day only 4 Weeks away,
It was no surprise to see our very own handsome
Congressman steve marcus getting acquainted
With some of his voters.
Congressman marcus faces a tough fight
In one of the most closely contested races
In southern florida.
The beauty contest,
Hosted by the council de cubanos americanos,
Attracted an enthusiastic crowd.
Festivities lasted all night with dancing till dawn.
Frankie!
Ohh...
Man: It's me!
Come on, frankie!
Open up!
Frankie, I'm sorry.
I know I'm a little late,
But, you know,
I was working.
You shoulda seen me.
I was great!
You know how big
The cuban-American vote is down here,
And they love me!
Save it for miss little havana, steve.

Morning, pinky.
Breakfast as usual,
Andget me a Cosmopolitan,
A Glamour, A New woman,
 Complete woman,
 Working woman,
And Modern wrestler.
You got it.
I'm in a hurry, so just send them up, ok?
Morning, bruce.
Morning.
Meyerholtz group is still waiting on the promo copy.
Giraldi likes the slogan,
But he wants to delete the word "small."
He thinks it's a turnoff.
Ok, change it from
"small enough to hold"
To "big enough to grab on to."
Frankie--
And dr. Ramdas and the n.A.S.A. People
Are offering you a rush job
On some project of theirs.
They're waiting for you in conference room b.
Excuse me, bruce,
I have the floor.
Frankie, I didn't think that we were taking on
Any new clients until after the marcus campaign.
Thanks, suzy, but we just finished.
We did?
By the way, folks,
We're dropping congressman marcus.
We are? But why?
I don't understand.
Suzy, just burn the file
And bill him, ok?
And your mother called at 8:45,
Something about have you decided
On the lime green bows
Or the passion pink rhinestones
For your shoes for your sister's wedding?
Oh, god!
Tell her I'm coming barefoot--
In black.
Oh, wait. Hold?
Smile...
Perfect.
Sorry, gentlemen, to keep you waiting.
I'm always late, but I'm worth it.
Ok, boys.
Let's see what you've got.
Man: Chemtec gives us america's future today,
Bringing space inside the american home.
And now it is developing
Its most extraordinary creation yet,
The ulysses android,
Destined to revolutionize the american way of life.
Developed here at chemtec laboratory
Under my direct supervision,
Ulysses is the closest thing to man himself.
The future applications for such an android
Are virtually infinite:
Handling hazardous chemicals,
Detecting radiation,
Disarming explosives,
Fighting fires,
Test-Piloting new aircrafts,
And, of course, exploring space.
The awesome distances,
Prolonged periods of time, and tortuous confinement
Have made deep space exploration problematic
For the human pilot.
We believe the ulysses android
Is the answer.
Ok, I think I've seen enough. Bruce?
What do you think?
Well, it's not gonna win any oscars.
And what's more important,
We're losing our funding in congress.
That's why we came here.
We need to make people see
How important this project is.
Miss stone...
The ulysses android
Is an amazing piece of equipment.
Yeah, but...
I'm not used to promoting hardware, doctor.
I promote people.
Politicians, businessmen,
The occasional rock star.
Dr. Ramdas...
Do you know who controls most of america's tv dials
And buys 72%
Of all magazines?
Women.
And if this publicity campaign is gonna work,
That, gentlemen, is your target group.
This sounds like something you could do
In, say, 35 Days?
Only if I can publicize the android My Way,
And that means full media saturation.
And I promise you, boys,
I'll have everyone in congress itching
To fund your program before you can say E.T.
Welcome to chemtec.
Parking in lot c.
Thanks.
Welcome to chemtec, miss stone.
Oh, dr. Ramdas, it's a pleasure.
Quite a facility you've got.
Well, thank you.
It's the way
Of the future.
Your visitor's pass.
Would you follow me, please?
Sure.
P.A.: Paging dr. Nipatoe.
Dr. Nipatoe to robotics, room d, please.
Dr. Nipatoe...
This is where ulysses was born.
In the future,
Making love will no longer be necessary
For the creation of life.
It can all be done far more efficiently
In the lab.
How romantic.
Of course, I myself
Prefer the old-Fashioned way.
Why don't you wait in here?
I'll see if dr. Peters is free.
I know he'd like to meet you.
Okey-Dokey.
Oh!
Oh, hi, you must be dr. Peters.
I'm frankie stone.
What do you call these?
What?
Oh--Wh--
What are you--
You've been in this lab too long, buddy!
P.A.: Paging dr. Stevenson.
You're wanted in image processing, dr. Peterberg.
Oh, my god!
I knew it!
One minute with a woman and he short-Circuits.
My god, he looks like you!
What did you think he'd look like,
An erector set?
What's the matter, no man ever lose his head
Over you before?
He looks so real.
He--He--
He is real...
In his own way.
Metal, proteins, synthetic fibers.
He's no different than you or I.
What's that?
That--I-I--
Is his reset button.
It reactivates his motor control.
I told ramdas that the concept
Of a woman would merely confuse him.
Ulysses, stop playing games.
Ulysse--
Ulysses!
Here.
Oh--Uh!
Dr. Ramdas: I thought showing you these tapes
Might help to make you more familiar with the droid.
You see, miss stone,
Programming the android takes him just so far.
The rest must be learned
Like a human child.
We had some difficulty with his gross motor functions
Before we modified his cerebral
Muscular coordination.
Dr. Peters, severely:
Edge perception, miss stone,
Is extremely difficult.
Dr. Peters: It--It may look simple to you,
But it really is an incredibly sophisticated
Series of programs.
Dr. Peters:
Once we were able
To modify his hand/Eye coordination,
We--We realized he had a retinal resolution
10 Times greater than that of the average human eye.
Dr. Peters:
And as you can see,
We licked that problem.
Frankie: Well, if all else fails,
He can always take your place
On jury duty.
Men: ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy birthday, dear ulysses ♪
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
Ahem. Dr. Peters,
He really is an amazing creation,
But I think that we might wanna take
Some time to polish up his social graces.
Social graces?
What for?
Jeff,
I've gotta agree
With miss stone.
I think a woman would be
A good influence on him.
Trish?
Hi!
What are you doing here?
Ivy's wedding isn't until next week.
Oh, trish...
I can't believe donald would do this to you!
Yeah, my mother was right.
I should never have married an actor.
Ohh...
What's going on?
Are you having a garage sale?
Oh, you might call it that.
I'm changing my life,
Getting rid of the garbage.
Oh, no!
Steve, too?
Mm-Hmm.
Jesus, frankie,
I always thought steve
Was about the best you were gonna do.
But it's nice to know
I'm not the only one
Who's been dragged through the mud
By some macho scum.
Snowball!
Trish, it wasn't exactly like that.
You know, frankie,
Being single again could be really great.
I mean, you could go wherever you wanted,
Sleep with whoever you wanted,
Have absolutely incredible sex
With strangers.
Like, um...
I've never made it with a bodybuilder,
Have you?
Or an acrobat?
How about a car mechanic?
A sweaty one.
I've never even tried a m\Nage à trois,
Have you?
With steve?
Mm-Hmm.
Oh, god, it was hard enough
To get him alone.
Oh.
And even then it wasn't hard enough.
Well, frankie,
When you think about it...
There are a lot of possibilities.
Frankie: Ok...
That's the first problem.
You've got nice eyes, ulysses,
Now use them.
Look at me.
Why? I know you're there.
Because looking someone in the eyes
Makes them feel that you care
About what they're saying.
That's point number one:
Make eye contact.
And point number 2
Is listening.
Now, you look at a woman,
Or anyone, for that matter,
And Listen--
As if what they're saying
Is the most important thing in the entire world.
Good.
Good. Now, point number 3:
Confidence.
Just stay there.
Stay...
Stay.
Yeah?
Woman: Steve marcus is here to see you.
Ok, uh, just hold him there, would you?
I'll be right up.
Ulysses, why don't you watch this
For a little while, ok?
They have nobody.
Phil donahue:
You also are, like--
I'm very pleased that you would be--
Oh! Here.
Here. This is a talk show.
Now, you're gonna be on one of these
In a couple of weeks,
So I want you to study,
Okey-Dokey?
Okey-Dokey.
How 'bout, should you marry, what about children...
I'll be right back.
Biological clock, all that stuff?
Yes, my biologic clock is counting down,
And, um, I would like to have children.
And, uh, right now,
I just try
To psych myself out of Not Having children
Because I don't think they're in my future.
Um, are you looking for mr. Right?
Yes. Yes, but--
Isn't that a trap?
Is there such a person?
P.A.: Attention, welding teams c and d...
Hi.
Please report to annex b on c level.
What are you doing here?
I have to talk to you!
You won't return my phone ca--
Shh!
My phone calls!
Here.
What happened to your lip?
It's a mustache. I felt that it would make me
Look more mature.
Voters like that.
Well, I'm a voter, steve.
You don't like it?!
Shh!
Why are you here?
Is there someplace a little more private
Where we can talk?
Yeah, sure.
I'll walk you to your car.
One of the things is that you can't sit around
On your hoopey-Doopey
Waiting for mr. Right to come!
Woman: She's not doing that.
Man: Yeah, I know, but you've gotta get out there,
And you've gotta let yourself be known.
You've gotta say,
"here I am,
And I'm worthwhile."
I think a lot of that depends
On your own image of your self.
If you sit home and turn on the television set,
Don't expect anything to happen!
Get out there and say,
"look at me! I'm gorgeous!"
Donahue:
But the problem is,
There aren't that many other gorgeous,
Wonderful people out there!
That's the problem!
Man: Well, you know, I don't--
Woman: There are--
There are a lot--
Man: I don't believe it!
I think there are!
Donahue: All right.
Are the--What's the matter?
Yes, ma'am, would you kindly stand?
Second woman:
Yes, I am a widow.
I've been a widow for 5 Years.
And I've found out the best way...
...And do something for somebody.
Donahue: And we'll be back in just a moment.
Man: Aren't you tired of politicians
Who don't give a damn about what you think?
We are.
Who are we?
We're voters for steven marcus,
Believers in a better congress
With better congressmen.
What makes marcus so much better
Than even the so-Called "best"?
He's sensitive to your needs.
I really believe he cares.
He's smart as a whip.
He stands for the issues that really matter.
 Una persona sincera.
I think he's just like you and me,
Except he's a little better.
Man: Steven marcus.
It takes a man
 This Sensitive
To know your needs.
Paid for by citizens for marcus.
Donahue: Here's the point.
If you're looking for mr. Right,
Then your well-Being is determined by...
What are you doi--
It takes a man thissensitive
To know your needs.
My god, that w-Woman
Is turning you into a hooker!
Woman: I think that I have a hope
That there is a mr. Right out there for me.
How you doin', skippy?
Is that your new campaign manager?
That's very funny.
Come on, frankie.
I need you back on board.
Skipper?
Take a break.
You know, I've, uh...
I've really missed you.
I'm desperate.
I fell three points in the polls.
My entire career is on the line!
Ok, call the office.
Maybe we can recommend somebody.
I already have. I mean,
I'm considering, uh--
I'm considering hiring suzy duncan.
You mean my assistant suzy duncan?
Well, why not? She's had some good ideas so far.
Look, frankie!
Look, you come back!
We can keep it strictly professional.
I mean, we can, uh--
We could even date other people!
I mean, I thought that's what you'd want!
Isn't it?
Are you dating other people?
Well, yeah,
I mean, you know,
Kind of. Aren't you?
Yeah, sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Jesus, that was damn quick work!
We only broke up last tuesday!
What, you keep this guy on a back burner
Or something?
Steve!
Well, it got serious pretty goddamned quick!
Look, I don't have time to get into this right now.
I've gotta go back to work.
It's somebody you work with, right?
See, you never were very good
At separating business from pleasure!
I need to speak with you right now.
Jeff!
Look, don't--
Don't get upset.
There's nothing to be jealous about.
I'm not jealous!
Uh, steve marcus.
Jeff peters.
 Dr. Jeff peters.
Well, I hope you're registered, jeff,
Because I'm gonna be needing You
Out there 4 Weeks from tuesday.
I don't follow politics.
Sorry, steve.
Take good care of him, skippy.
Ok? Bye bye.
 What Are you doing?
Shh!
You're my new boyfriend.
Miss stone, if I have unwittingly led you on,
I sincerely apologize.
Don't flatter yourself.
I hate men.
Ivy, must you babble like that?
You are going to shave those
Before the wedding?
Hector likes me like this.
Shaving's such a bourgeois concept, mom.
Marriage is a bourgeois concept, ivy.
How come I can't talk you out of that?
Sorry I'm late!
Well, you two look adorable.
Who's getting married here, huh?
The wrong person.
You could have married the most eligible bachelor
In all of miami
If you'd played your cards right,
And your sister here insists on marrying a busboy.
Hector and I are in love, mom!
What's love got to do with it?
Frankie and steve had a relationship.
It didn't work out.
Did they have to go through a horrendous divorce
Like me? No, they were sensible.
They parted as friends.
If I never see him again,
It will be a day too soon.
How about a week from saturday, frankie?
It's bad enough you asked that creep
To the wedding, but, mother,
Asking steve to give ivy away!
I certainly did not invite him!
He called ivy, didn't he, ivy?
You asked him.
No, I didn't!
It was his idea.
Well, he said you wouldn't mind, frankie.
Oh, I don't mind.
I just won't come.
No problem!
We'll call off the wedding!
I'm happy to lose my deposit!
I'm getting married, mother!
So, you're really not gonna come, frankie?
Of course
I'll be there.
I'm a big girl.
I'll come.
It's no big deal.
Oh, you're amazing, frankie.
I knew you'd understand.
Mother: Bye, ivy!
Woman: Oh, ho ho!
Bullshit, donny!
Stop seeing that no-Good slut!

Who are you?
Where's trish?
Moe glickstein, don's business manager.
This is manny our accountant.
Are you a friend of trish's or something?
I happen to live here.
Oh! Oh, very nice place you've got here!
Sit down, have a nosh.
Manny, give her some of your corned beef.
Why not?
I'm not hungry.
What's going on?
My boy donny suddenly announces
He's losing his equilibrium.
He can't sleep, he can't work.
He needs his old lady back.
Ah,he's a Meshugenuh!
Hey, you want a pickle?
Honey, you can't go up there.
Don and trish need their space!
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.
Honey, calm down!
Here's $20.
I can get you in to tiny tim
At the eden roc.
It's a terrific show.
What do you say, huh?
Trish: Bullshit, donny!
Ohh!
Oh, ulysses, what are you doing here?
Standing.
That's what
I do at night.
That's it?
You don't...
Read or watch television
Or multiply
6-Digit numbers?
No.
Ulysses, why are you staring at me like that?
Because you taught me to
And because I think you're attractive.
I think you're the most attractive woman I know.
I'm the only woman you know.
But thanks, ulysses.
That's nice.
You're welcome.
Frankie, what are You Doing here?
Good question.
Ohh, I'm tired,
And I guess I didn't know where else to go.
Jeff taught me to massage the body part
When I have a spasm in My Mechanism.
Uh...
Oh.
Hee hee hee!
Um...
You know, ulysses,
You can't just go grabbing people's feet like that.
Why not?
Well, because it just isn't done.
Why?
Well, um...
You see, there are--Are rules
For social behavior, and, um...
Well...
Relationships between people
Develop in stages, and...
To get physical with someone,
You have to get to know them first.
Now, if you don't mind,
I've had a very long day,
And I'd like to get some sleep.
Good night, ulysses.
Good night.
Good night.
What was that?
A kiss.
People kiss when they like each other.
It's a sign of love or affection.
Although in my case, maybe I'm going nuts.
Now, ulysses, if you don't mind,
Could you just stand out here
In the hallway, please?
Sweet dreams.
Sweet dreams.
Jeff!
Jeff!
Excuse me.
Sure.
Guess you didn't see me back there, huh?
Hello, sandra.
I told you to call me sandy!
We're still friends, aren't we?
I take the blame for everything
That happened the other night,
But, you know what they say,
Getting started's the hardest part.
Look, I've got a lot of work to do.
And I'm the carefree type,
No pressures, no demands,
Anything for a laugh.
We're still on for tonight, aren't we?
Y-Y-Yeah. Yeah.
I--I guess so.
Ok! Great! So...
It's a date!
Oh, excuse me.
Ow!
Damn!
P.A.: All those wishing to participate
In dr. Niederhol's single interface
Are to meet in artificial intelligence,
Room b,
Promptly at 6:00.
I love you, jeff.
Oh, my god!
What is that woman teaching you?
Dr. Peters: She is cluttering his progress
With useless nonsense,
Monopolizing very valuable training time
With god knows what.
But--Wha--B--E--
Emotional tics that I have worked
To get out of my own personality,
She has managed to drum into him overnight!
This morning,
Ulysses met me in--
In that hall,
And he kissed me...
Right near my mouth.
I guess he likes you, jeff.
Um, very funny.
Miss stone?
I am not amused.
Ulysses is going into deep space.
He is going to be alone for 7 Years.
He is not going out to discotheques.
All right. All right.
Jeff...
If you feel you need more time with ulysses--
Yes, I do!
I'm sure miss stone can reschedule.
And, miss stone, please,
Try to stick to the essentials.
Ok.
Oh, and, jeff...
Now that ulysses is acting more human,
Perhaps he could give You A few lessons.
Bruce: Well,I'm still waiting to hear
From Good morning,
 America
And Live at 5:00,
Butthe only confirmation
I haveso far
Is from
 Eye on miami. 
Jesus, bruce,
Can't we get anything national?
Well,the Dr. Ruth People aren't sure.
They wanna know if...
If he has a, uh--
A penis.
Forget it.
Try the Carson People.
Ok.
P.A.: Paging dr. Nipatoe.
Dr. Nipatoe, your pizza is here.
Oh, wait! Wait!
Shit!
Woman: Yes?
All right.
Yes, sure.
Good night, dr. Peters.
Is everything all right?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

But I want you to know

I know you'd never do anything
To jeopardize this project.

Frankie: Ulysses!
Get in the car!
Frankie: Ulysses!
I could go to prison for this!
Ulysses, get back here right now!
You're making me very angry!
Ohh!
Oh, pardon me.
Dr. Peters?
Is that you?
What are you doing down there?
Steve. Steve marcus.
We met once before, remember?
It takes a man this sensitive
To know your needs.
Well, yes.
That's the, uh--
That's the campaign slogan.
But, uh, what really concerns me--
Sir. Sir.
See you out there--
What really concerns me, of course, are the issues.
 Ulysses--Steve!
Hi! What a surprise!
Steve, there's a b-A-B-Y over there.
I think you should--
Ahem.
Frankie!
Well, suzy!
You know,
I love the hair,
The mustache, the whole new look.
Suzy: Really?
You know, uh,
Frankie, I'm super sorry that I didn't call you,
But after all, this is my big shot, you know?
Well...
Not all that large, suz.
But I'm happy for you, really.
I wish you all the success you deserve.
Well, off we go.
Right, jeff?
Bye bye!
See you at the wedding!
What's a wedding?
Man on tv: Joker...
Joker...Hey!
So, what can
I help you with?
I'm going to a wedding.
No, you're not.
I'm sorry, sir.
We're just looking.
A wedding!
Mazel tov!
You've come to the right place.
So, you seem like the kind of guy
Who's ready to take a fashion chance.
I've got something,
It's gonna knock your socks off.
I don't wear socks.
Ha ha ha!
Right.
Ha ha ha!
So what are you?
A 38? 40? Huh?
Oh, here we are!
Try this on, my friend.
Um...
Ulysses, don't waste this nice man's time.
Now, take it off.
I like it, frankie.
He likes it, frankie.
You don't like it, frankie?
No.
You prefer something more conservative? No problem.
How about your basic black, huh? Half-Price--
No.
Because I'm a nice guy,
I'll even throw in some shoes.
So listen, when's the affair?
Ulysses: Frankie?
What do I do now?
Put on the jacket and the pants.
Frankie: No.
Take the jumpsuit off first.
Is it congenital or contagious?
Drugs.
Uh-Huh.
Now what do I do?
Oh, my god!
Is there something wrong?
Nothing a rabbi couldn't fix.
Salesman: Take a look at this guy, huh?
Now, that's what we call pizzazz!
Think about it while
I write up the bill.
Frankie, do I look bad?
No, you look great.
Um, look, ulysses,
I didn't mean to embarrass you back there,
It's just that...
Well, I've always thought of you as a child,
If you know what I mean.
Yes.
Yes. Um...
Uh, what I'm trying to say is, um...
Well, see I--I just don't understand
Why jeff felt it was necessary
To give you that, um...
Thing.
Jeff felt it would give me confidence.
Salesman: Ok, I'm gonna throw in some shorts.
Oh...Ok!
With the shoes and the cumberbund,
That comes to $294.98
With the tax.
We accept cash, credit cards.
Would you prefer our convenient layaway
Loan program?
Oh, no, no.
He just wanted to try one on.
It was just kind of a joke.
Electronic voice:
We're sorry,
But we failed to remove the inventory control--
Ulysses!
Uh...
We accept All
Major credit cards.
Howdy, pardner! Come on down to big bob's

Sandy: Jeff. Jeff!
Hi! It's me! Hi!
Howdy, pardner.
Ha ha ha! Howdy!
That's funny, us bumping
Into each other like this, huh?
Small world!
Yes, it is.
The earth is the fifth largest planet
In the solar system,
Its diameter being 7,918 Miles.
Hey, you look great!
You got a tuxedo on and everything.
I hope you didn't do that just for me.
Although I'd really be flattered if you did.
We're still on for tonight, aren't we?
'Cause I had a great time the other night,
And I was just thinking that
You were just beginning to like me,
Although I don't wanna pressure you at all.
What is your name?
Sandy!
Ha ha ha! You got a short memory!
Live for the moment, right? Ha ha ha!
Hey! I just had a crazy idea.
What if, instead of going out tonight,
We just went out right now, just--
Ha ha ha!
I don't know,
What would you think?
══ Subtitles by dw817 ══
Well, great!
You're really in a good mood!
So, I'll just go change.
I got a new designer outfit,
And I'll be right back.
Don't go away!
Ha ha ha!
Hey...
Does it seem like people are staring at us?
We must look pretty great together!
Oh, god, if I felt this good all the time,
I wouldn't be back in therapy.
You know what
I mean?
No, I don't, sandy.
Ohh! Look at those earrings!
I've been dreaming about those
Ever since july!
Would you like them?
You think
I was hinting.
I was just daydreaming!
They're too expensive.
No! No!
Oh!
Salesman:
A wonderful choice.
Those are japanese cultured pearls
In a very handsome setting.
Jeff, no, really.
I can't. I--
This is so embarrassing!
They'll look lovely on you, miss.
Thank you, jeff.
I have a confession to make.
I'm really just an old-Fashioned girl
And...
Getting a gift from a man
Really means a lot to me.
Yes. That'll be
$139.56 With the tax.
Would you like to pay with credit card, cash, or check?
Sir?
Sir?
Jeff, the money.
I don't have any.
Huh?
That's ok!
I don't mind, really. I--
They're just so beautiful.
You take american express?
What an amazing concept!
You don't have a credit card?
Jeff, you're really a lot different
Than I thought you were.
Trish! Thank god you're there! Look,
I'm with my cousin--
Actually, I'm not with him, but I should be.
Yes, I have a cousin.
He's in for the wedding.
Who cares if he's cute?!
Look, if by any chance he shows up there,
Just keep him there, would you?
I'll be at the lab.
I can't explain!
Just do it!
Here you go.
You certainly have quite an appetite.
Yes. I never get food with so many colors.
What do you usually eat, jeff?
Phenodyethemine in an amino acid base.
Guess that means you don't cook, huh?
Ow!
Jeez!
Well, I think I've had
About enough fun for one night.
My cash is gone,
And my credit card's getting a little thin.
Why don't we just go home?
Could you take me?
You don't have your car!
No.
Ok!
Where do you wanna go?
Frankie stone's?
You'll like her!
Oh, no, I won't!
Hello?
No. No.
Mrs. Stone is--
Miss stone is not here right now.
All right.
Oh, thank god you're here!
Miss stone, my god!
Jeff!
Haven't you ascertained by now
That I have no desire
In pursuing intimate relations with you?!
Sorry, jeff.
Sorry.

Where is he?
Oh, frankie!
He must have broken his neck.
What?
He just flew out of control!
And he jerked forward!
It was terrible!
Wait!
Where is he?
Aah!
Frankie: Trish!
He was so giving, so compassionate.
He had such a wonderful understanding
Of a woman's heart and now he's dead!
Trish, trish, calm down!
Now, what happened?
I couldn't help it.
It was the way he looked at me.
He was so beautiful, and all of a sudden
We were in each other's arms,
And we were making love, and it was so--
Wait a minute!
You were making What?!
We were making love, and it was
The most beautiful thing
I have ever felt
In my entire life!
Wait! Wait!
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
He could do That?
With You?
Why shouldn't he do that with me?
Oh, trish! Damn it!
Did you show him how?
This is getting a little sick,
Don't you think?
Your cousin is dead
On the kitchen floor!
He was on top of me, inside me,
And then he just started going crazy!
His head started twisting off,
And he died!
Trish...
Trish, just help me get his head off, would you?
Ohh! My god!
What are you talking about?!
Listen! I'm sorry to have to tell you this,
But you didn't make love to my cousin.
You just made it with my android!
Your what?
Ewwh!
Ewwh!
What are you so happy about?
It's so beautiful out here, frankie.
You know, I'm really enjoying our date.
Let's get one thing straight, ulysses.
This is not a date, ok?
Is that because you're uptight?
No, I am not uptight!
And who taught you that stupid word?
Trish.
That figures.
Look, ulysses,
I'm just a little upset right now, ok?
It's 3:00
In the morning,
I'm tired,
I haven't changed clothes for two days,
And you've probably just cost me my job.
I'm sorry, frankie.
I mean, what a joke!
Me, trying to turn you into somebody
That everybody in america's supposed
To fall in love with.
Frankie?
Why do people want to fall in love?
I don't know, ulysses.
You're asking the wrong girl.
Don't you want to fall in love?
Yeah, sure. Why not?
But, believe me, it's not that easy.
You fall in love with some guy,
But he's in love with somebody else.
Or you think you're in love,
But you're not.
Or he thinks he's in love, but he's not.
Or he was in love, but now he's not,
But now you are.
You make it sound so complicated.
It Is Complicated.
And, ulysses, you should be glad
That you're not human
And you don't have to suffer
Through that kind of humiliation.
If I were human, frankie,
It would be simple.
I would be in love with you.
You know, frankie,
I thought last night was a lot of fun,
But I think tonight was even better.
I'm glad
 You Had fun.
I certainly did.
Good.
Now I want you to go in there
And change back into your jumpsuit,
And please, ulysses,
Don't say a word about this evening
To anyone, ok?
Ok.
Ok, good.
Good night.
Can I keep my tuxedo?
Ok. For now.
Does that mean I can go to a wedding?
I'm sorry, ulysses.
Just go change, ok?
Good night.
Ulysses: Jeff?
What?
Let's say there's this certain person
That you really like,
But then you have sex with someone else.
Now...
A: Do you have to like the person
You have sex with?
B: Do you have to have sex
With the person you like?
C: Do you have to stop liking
The person you like?
"D"--
D...
None of the above.
I'm going to have to change your program.
But, jeff, what about babies?
Can I have one?
It is that Woman,
Isn't it?
What has she been teaching you?!
She's teaching me about life, jeff,
And it's very interesting,
But what I really need to know is,
Are love and sex the same thing?
Look, ulysses,
I want you to remember
That you are much more advanced
Than that woman will ever be.
Do not let her drag you down to her level!
She lives in an emotional swamp!
But then, so do most people!
Some minor activity occurs in the medulla,
And--And wham! They think they're in love.
The next thing they know,
They have 2 Children and a canine.
And then, boom!
Some neuron misfires,
And they're divorced, miserable,
And only get to see their children on sundays.
It is all chemical, ulysses,
And it is all a waste of time.
You were made for grander things, pal.
Do you read me?
Loud and clear, jeff.
Good, ulysses.
Good.
Jeff?
Do you think miss stone has sex appeal?
I do.
But steve's mother said steve said
You had a date for the wedding, dear.
Frankie: I don't know what steve's talking about.
Well, according to steve's mother,
He's not much to look at, but...
I heard he was some sort of doctor.
We're all dying to meet him.
Mom, look,
I told you
I'm coming alone!
Now, darling,
You Are Gonna be able to dig up somebody,
Aren't you?
Now, you don't want steve
To see you there all alone,
Do you, dear?
Mom, thanks for the advice.
I've gotta go.
Look, I'll call you when I get home, ok?
Bye.
Ohh!
Dr. Peters?
Hi.
How did work go today?
Fine. Just...
Great.
Oh, good.
Ahem. Jeff, um...
I--I don't want to scare you,
Understand that, ok?
But could I ask you something?
Ok.
Um...
Well, for, uh, reasons I can't go into
And you don't wanna know about,
I have to go to this...Wedding,
And I need a date,
And you'd be the exact perfect guy.
Now, this isn't a proposition.
I just wanna know if you might think about...
Maybe going with me?
A wedding?
Um, I don't know.
I'm not very good with people.
Oh, they're not people!
They're just my family.
You know, jeff,
You've got really nice eyes.
Have you ever considered maybe wearing contacts?
Good night.
Frankie: You can pick me up at 4:00 At 1313
Southeast 10Th street,
Miami beach.
Ok?
Thanks so much, jeff.
I really appreciate this.
Oh, hello.
Sandra, I'm--I'm sorry about last night.
I wasn't feeling well.
Ahem.
Shouldn't you be having your lunch now?
I'm not hungry.
Frankie!
Frankie, come here!
Frankie!
What?
What is it?
That's her! That's the slut that stole donald.
I know nothing of the kind.
Look me in the eye and say that.
Do you want me to list
The things we've done together?
Oh...Shut up.
Oh, my god, they're frenching!
This is network tv,
And they're using tongues!
That's got to be against some rule!
Oh, no.
No, I can't.
Please stop!
Alessandro,
I'm pregnant.
Trish: It better not be donald's.
Is this some trick of yours?
What?
If it is,
I'll slap you.
Oh, go ahead and hit me.
Do you think that
I have any pride left?
Oh!
Mmm!
Oh.
Oh, I love you...
And I hate you!
I love you,
And I hate you, too.
Oh!
 New jersey.
It's not just a state.
It's a state of mind.
Huh...
If we ever get back together,
I'm going to hold this against him forever.
Look, trish,
Don't use that vcr, ok?
I told you,
I'm sending all of this stuff back tomorrow.
Oh, god!
I don't see why ulysses bought You
All this stuff anyone.
I'm the one who slept with him, for christ's sake.
It's bad enough to be dumped by donald
But to be jilted by an android!
Ulysses just thinks
I'm mad at him,
And this is his way of apologizing.
Hmm.
But still...
Why 12 Pairs of the same shoe?
Because he didn't know your shoe size.
He's so sweet.
Mind if I borrow the size 8?
Hey, frankie,
How do you think he manages to buy
All this stuff?
Hey, it looks like prom night out here.
Come on in.
You're looking spiffy.
Hey, trish!
Our escort's here.
Oh.
Well, thanks, jeff.
It's, uh...
Oh, a wrist corsage.
Very cute.
Ah!
Oh, my god!
I can't believe they look exactly alike!
I know.
I wonder if everything else
Is the same.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
What a wonderful reaffirmation of life.
Please, steve, cut the crap.
Dearly beloved...
We are gathered here today...
That's nice.
That's beautiful.
Oh, that's very romantic.
That's nice. Hold that.
Very nice.
More romance.
Oh, that's very good.
Hold that.
Very nice.

Was our song, steve.
Frankie, you're really exciting me
In that dress.
Listen, what's the matter?
It's a little difficult to take you seriously
With that ridiculous mustache, steve.
Would you try?
I mean, I don't tease you about yours.
Sometimes I forget what a creep you are.
Oh, come on, frankie.
Won't you give me a second chance?
I think
I'd like to marry you.
Careful, steve. That almost sounded sincere.
Are you in love with that doofus or what?
He happen to be one of the brightest men
On this planet.
Oh, I don't doubt it.
I'll make you take me seriously.
Stay right there.
Don't move.

Well...
Ha!

I was, uh--Hello?
Hello.
I was traveling far, far out into another galaxy,
And I had this strange sensation
That space was folding in on itself,
Like it was curved or something.
What?
Folding in on itself.
That's amazing.
That's what does happen!
Space Is Curved.
Really?
Yes. You see...
If this is our galaxy
And these represent other known galaxies--
Is that a pimento?
Oh, I'm sorry. Am I destroying distant worlds?
No. That's ok.
Now, that is a quasar, ok?
What's that?
That...That's a black hole.
Black hole?
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Yes, sir?
Yes. Straight through to the back.
As...
I was saying, you see,
A black hole is so dense
That its gravity
Actually sucks in light.
Its gravity actually sucks In Light.
Mm-Hmm.
I still don't understand.
You're driving me crazy!
I got to get her back, man.
Donny, you got to make it up with your missus.
We can't schlep down to miami
Every time you can't fall sleep at night!
New? He's got to get her back.
He's a Meshugenuh!
Oy yi yi yi.
Oh, my god,
It's alessandro from New jersey!
Allesandro!
Aah!
Can I just touch your hair?
Don't touch my hair, all right?
Just--Just--
Just don't touch my hair.
It's gorgeous.
Oh!
Manny, come on, man.
Take care of this.
Ooh!
Now can you take me seriously?
Here, take this.
Come on, frankie.
I want you back.
It's not just because of the election.
It's because I love you.
What does albert einstein here want?
What is it, jeff?
I came to tell you something.
Well, what is it?
Frankie, I love you.
Shall we dance?
Oh!
I'll be right back.
This is insane.
We've got to get you back to the lab!
Why?
I came all this way to be with you.
I love you.
You love me.
How could you love me?
Ah, excuse me.
Excuse me.
Donald!
Where the hell is she?
What are you doing here?
Where's trish?
Trish?
Yeah. What do you know about trish, tough guy?
Trish really likes sex.
Aah!
Donald, don't hit him!
Hit me.
You're really sick.
No, no! Aah!
Get away!
Frankie, I'm coming!
Freeze!
Oh!
Aah!
Oh!
Come on, buddy.
It's go time.
Oh...
Donald!
Aah!
Donald, stop it!
You're a dead man!
I'll kill you!
Aah!
I'm gonna kill you!
Donald, stop it!
Stop it!
Ow!
Donald!
Aah!
Aah!
I'll get you!
Aah!
Oh!
Aah!
What's going on?
Whoa!
Aah!
Oh!
Oh! Oh!
Ulysses!
Oh, my god!
Oh, god!
Ulysses!
Is he dead?
Oh, god!
Oh, god!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Move!
Can you fix him?
Ooh!
Ooh!
Although some of the stories are slightly exaggerated,
There's no doubt that ulysses' popularity
Is spreading across the country
From miami to seattle.
We'll take a closer look
At some of the reasons why.
Coming up at 11:00
After New jersey.
Stay tuned.
Trish, what's wrong with me?
Look, you're having a nervous breakdown.
I have those all the time.
Just because everything of value in your life
Has been destroyed, so what?
There's still food.
 New jersey Continues.
Oh, why are you watching this idiotic show?
Because don gets punched
At least once every episode,
And I like watching that.
Admit it, trish.
You still love the jerk.
After what he did at the wedding,
You must be joking.
No! Please.
I thought he was having an affair
With a tall gorgeous blonde.
Oh, he always has time
For a little something extra.
Oh!
No, marissa.
No!
You see, isn't this fun?
Yeah, he is kind of cute
When he begs.
You know you're the only one I love.
You couldn't live without me.
Kill him.
Why?
Because you're weak.
Aah!
Oh, my god!
She's killing him!
Don't worry,
Nobody ever dies on these shows.
He's dead!
Unless they're canceling his contract.
Ohh!
Deader than a door nail.
Oh, no! It's got to be a mistake!
He's supposed to be a regular!
10 Years as a starving actor.
They can't kill him after 12 Episodes!
It's not fair!
Trish, it's not your problem anymore.
He must be devastated.
Why didn't he call me?
Trish, think a minute!
Think how he treated you.
Listen, donald is not perfect,
I'm not perfect,
Neither is steven neither are you!
What are you saying?
Look...
I don't know!
Maybe you should go back with steve.
Look, he's handsome and he's funny...
Well, maybe he's not all that funny,
But he has an interesting job,
And he earns his keep.
Look, I don't even like him that much,
But it's better than nothing.
I'll just  go call from the other room.
Come on, snowball.
Ulysses, you're not concentrating. What's wrong?
I don't know. I keep thinking about frankie.
I miss her, jeff.
I think I'm in love.
No, you're not.
You were never programmed
To be in love,
Therefore, you can't be in love.
Ulysses, I won't allow you to screw up
10 Years of research and hard work
Because you're mooning over some female.
I'm just not that interested in space anymore, jeff.
Don't say that!
Please!
This has been a dream of mine
Ever since
I was a little boy,
And you're going to make it come true for me.
Ulysses, you have a great future in space.
You'll go down in the history books.
You're to be envied.
I don't want to be envied.
I want to be loved.
Jeff, I love frankie.
She is a person, and you are an android!
What happened between you
Was ridiculous!
Ridiculous, and she knows it.
She thought it was ridiculous?
Yes, ulysses.
I promise you once you're up there
You'll feel completely different,
Because what you'll be doing is truly
The most exciting thing in the world.
Deejay: 97 Gtr.
Good morning, south florida!
What do you say, guys?
You're on your way with the bearman this morning.
It is 7:20.
It is going to be sunny and warm again today
In south florida.
Great day to go out to the beaches and work on your tan.
Let's talk a little bit about ulysses.
We've heard about him a lot lately.
What do you think of ulysses?
Why don't you call me now?
All the lines are open
In dade, broward and the palm beaches,
But first, coming up, a song ulysses might like,
 Pink floyd's
Welcome to the machine.
97 Gtr.
The best rock 'n' roll variety.
My gosh!
Snazzy car!
Sure is a welcome relief
From that old wreck of yours.
Hi, steve.
Ow!
You know,
I'm really glad you called.
It was, um...
A nice surprise.
You know how much
I wanted to go
To this press conference
And you let me tag along
And I really appreciate that.
Well, as a friend of mine said,
"Any woman in miami would give up
A month of good sex just to see this blastoff."
But I know one gal who won't have to.
Frankie, how's my--
How's my hair look?
Um...
Is it ok?
It's fine.
Sure?
Steve.
Oh, alan, good to see you.
I heard about your hand.
The only thing affected is my golf game.
Steve, can you excuse me
For a minute?
All right. Yeah.
You remember guy, don't you?
Guy, good to see you.
Jeff.
You don't have any business being here.
Look, jeff,
I'm really sorry about what happened.
But I'm glad he's fixed and everything's ok.
Who said he was ok?
The papers, the television.
Well, he isn't.
He doesn't work the way he was programmed to.
What do you mean?
You don't even realize the damage you've done, do you?
I have spent years developing ulysses
So he could function in space alone.
And now, in less than one month's time,
You have ruined him.
Tell me this--
How's he supposed to survive out there now
When all he thinks about is you?
Ready, hon?
We are pleased you could all be here today
To meet the ulysses android.
The awesome distances involved in the exploration of deep space
Have always posed a serious dilemma.
How could a man withstand the terrible isolation
And confinement?
How could a machine be our eyes and ears?
We believe the ulysses android...
Is the answer.
And now, let me introduce
Ulysses himself.
Hello,
I am the ulysses android
Developed by dr. Jeff peters at chemtec,
And I am here to answer any questions.
We're curious to know what your feelings are
Concerning your imminent departure into space.
I'm an android.
I don't have feelings.
But it looks like your program
Contains a lot of human tendencies.
These minor technical errors have been corrected.
The question everyone's dying to ask is,
Are you still lovesick?
No. Next question.
Aren't you frightened
Going up there alone for seven years?
No.
That's easy. It's people who are frightening.
They walk around hurt and confused and more alone
Then I will ever be in space.
People can build an incredibly sophisticated space program,
And yet they can't solve their most basic problem--
How to love and care for those who love them.
Someday when people have figured that out,
They might be more than just machines.
Jesus christ!
This guy could run for president.
What are you doing here?
I just wanted to tell ulysses good-Bye.
I don't think that's very appropriate.
Do you?
No.
Probably not.
Man: Minus 10...
Main engine start,
0...Liftoff!
This evening marked the dawn
Of a new era in space travel.
At 6:42 P.M.
Eastern daylight time,
The ulysses android was successfully launched
On its seven-Year mission into deep space.
It was a near-Perfect liftoff
Viewed by an enthusiastic crowd of over 10,000,
Many of whom carried signs and banners
With their best wishes for the charismatic ulysses,
Who so recently
Has captured the heart and imagination of this nation.
Congressman marcus, who earlier this week
Made headlines with the android,
Was among the dignitaries
At the press conference yesterday
To bid ulysses a farewell and bon voyage.
The launch from pad number 19...
Was broadcast live via satellite
To over 60 Countries throughout the world.
We take you now for a summary of today's launch
To flight director charles kraftman
At mission control.
We will be speaking directly with ulysses
In the capsule.
Dr. Peters, what are you doing here?
Oh, god,
I miss him so much.
What...
Jeff, what are you doing?
I love you.
Ulysses?
Mmhmm.
I love you, too.
Oh, no!
No!
I'm sorry, frankie.
I always seem to fall apart
At the wrong time.
That's ok, ulysses.
Nobody's perfect.
That's good news, hank.
Man: Ulysses, how is the mission going so far?
It truly is the most exciting thing in the world.
Is it difficult functioning out there all alone?
No.
You see, I'm not very good with people.

Hey Alilo!
You have a good trip?
Hello Cousin! It was okay.
I got a little sick on the boat.
And then the train kept on stopping around Lyon!
I hardly recognized you!
Man, you've changed!
You tool Classy!
Just like an American!
Hey!
Cousin, I have a big problem!
I lost an address.
On the train or the boat...
We'll find it. Don't worry.
Mokrane! Please!
I must call my boss in Algiers.
Don't call me Mokrane! Be nice.
Everyone calls me Mok here.
It's simpler. Call me Mok.
Hey, Alilo, there's a booth...
Give me a coin.
I don't have any money from France.
We use cards here!
Here!
It goes in there.
Okay. Dial 19...
And you dial 2 for Algiers.
HELLO!!
Look, I lost the paper with the address and the phone number.
I can't get the valise.
I can't... I lost...
The boss isn't there?
In Morocco?
For five days?
And me? What do I do?
See if you can find me the number with the address.
I don't know. I've got nothing.
I get it today. I come back tomorrow.
I'll get by?
That's all you know to say?
Like your mother! Scumbag!
Thanks a lot! Thanks, thanks.
So? What's up?
I'm screwed.
It's the end of the world... for me!
Let's gal You'll explain.

The metro's a hassle.
Shit! You on holiday or what?

Everyone wants to live here.
Hello Mr Vincent.
Never mind. It's usually quieter.
She's gonna fall, land on him. You'll see.
Hey Isaac.
Hey! How ya feeling?
Isaac's a Shakespearean actor.
He studied acting in London.
Watch out for the hole.
Just like Algiers.
Hey Abidjan.
Hey show-off.
- You're not afraid?
- Of what?
- Blacks!
- What are you, a racist?
Those blacks, they do import-export.
They're neighbors.
Watch the steps.
There's no electricity.
No fear. I'm used to it.
In Algiers there's no light in my building, and nothing to hold on.
An old man came from the country and took a dive. From third floor!
Luckily, his burnoose worked like a parachute.
He fell softly...
Fuck! More ads.
He's an American novelist.
He's here for inspiration.
We've got artists and thinkers in this neighborhood.
The 18th, it's a really integrated neighborhood.
This is Paris' future!
That crib is where a great
Japanese pianist lives. Yashimata.
She's on tour in Australia.
I gotta listen to my messages.
My manager should've called.
Jerome's a great guy.
He handles Johnny, Sardou,
Patrick Bruel and loads of others.
He saw me and something clicked!
What a break!
He's a beauty, huh?
His name's Nobody.
- Nobody?
- Yup. That's what he's called.
Above all, don't give him any grub.
He's got special shit.
Cut that out!
You wanna traumatize him?
Damn machine is totally shot!
It's getting dark.
Wanna eat out or stay here?
As you like.
Out, maybe. That would be nice.
Great. That's settled, then.
We'll eat here.
I've got some good pasta and a dynamite sauce.
I got you bananas as a treat.
So you like music, huh?
But what do you do for job?
I'm hittin' out to make it as a singer.
And thanks to Jerome it's gonna take off!
In a year I'll be on the charts!
I'm using de La Fontaine's poetry.
The ant and the grasshopper?
I learned that in school!
He's got the cheese in his mouth...
Fuckin' useless!
You kill me!
That's 'The Fox and the Crow.'
The bananas are a little tired, maybe?
Ah, this one's okay.
- Some good spaghetti!
- What are you doing?
You should wait until all water is boil.
Then you throw macaroni in. Not you...
Hey! It's my recipe.
This is spaghetti, and I'm preparing it Thai style.
Mokrane. Please, Mok.
Mok, wake up.
What? What is it?
I'm gonna die. I'm so...
You're dying?
What kinda shit is this?
What's wrong? What's wrong?
Tell me.
Is it your stomach? Is that it?
Stop howling, You'll wake all the neighbors. Sit there.
- I don't want to die.
- You won't die! Don't move.
Don't move! I'm calling 911.
Don't move!
Hello, Emergency? It's for my cousin from Algeria... His stomach hurts...
Really, I think you've lost it, eating a dozen bananas.
I thought it was eleven. Mokrane,
I promise I thought I must die.
I saw cancer. In front of me I saw men with no head... I thought I must to die.
You're not cool, man.
You're ruining my rep in the hood!
I spoke to the doctor.
You're on a diet.
Hey! It's serious, man.
From today on, it's rice only.
I'll eat rice the rest of my life, okay.
I can't even bear a photo of a banana.
Sure! So you say.
- Look! I phone a call.
- Do it fast, okay?
Wow! Look, someone left his card!
Dream on. If it's there, it's because it's used up.
Here!
Okay, quickly. Yeah?
And what do I do with this?
A pain up the...
Zoubir! Yes, it's me...
What?
He's not back yet?
And how do I do now? How?
Ah, work it out! Again, work it out!
Great! You're a champion problem solver!
The boss, he doesn't return, and
I'm stuck. Cousin Mokrane, I'm in shit.
Mokl I want you to call me Mok.
All right!
Okay. I gotta split to see my shrink.
I've got an appointment.
I'm in analysis!
Get your analysis. I'll go to Barbes.
There's action there.
What action?
The young from Algiers!
I'll go see how it is.
I find one I know.
I talk with him, calm.
Rachid?
Hey Alilo!
How are you, my brother?
Okay!
Hey bandit! So you left too?
I'm just passing through. Business.
Were the kids telling the truth?
You 'crossed over'?
I figured they transferred you...
You're crazy!
I've been here for six months now.
I'd rather sell this stuff all day than have my throat slit like a sheep or get a bullet in the head.
You deserted.
Think what you want. Come on!
Let's get a cold drink.
You know me, Alilo!
When I was a cop, did I ever hurt anyone?
Well! In fact, yeah. In October...
Yeah, October.
During the riots! It was my job!
We couldn't let kids burn Bab-el-Oued.
But I was straight.
I didn't work any scams like some.
Scam or no scam, you're here now!
And who's the Red Cross?
Joel
Joe, could you see to your clients and let us talk?
Yeah. I'll do that.
So what are you doing? You legal?
This summer, God willing,
I go to Canada. It looks easier there.
I'll get a yellow card.
There's plenty of refugees there.
They're all there.
And why are you here?
Business!
Business!
Just for three days.
Meanwhile... Want any jewelry?
I got only good stuff.
None of that here!
Take care, man.
If you get caught, Rachid...
Let me show you something.
See this?
Any time I get stopped for my ID
I put this on, and I pass for a Jew.
They don't even dream I'm Algerian.
You're a demon.
And all our house in it great perplexity
yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed a tear.
He is a stone, a very pebble stone,
and has no more pity in him than a dog.
Don't give up! Fight on!
Feeling.
Feeling!
So you fried potatoes...
Yeah.
The city mt deserts his comrade following...
Wait, let me have...
No! You're on brown rice.
So. You say your pal's a dealer and an illegal in Barbes.
Is that it?
I saw him. He used to mess me around because he was a serious cop.
Serious! Serious!
They're all rotten!
Rotten! I saw that film!
It's not about a film.
It's about all those creeps coming from that hole... who'll create problems for us...
What problems?
All the same, I don't give a shit!
Yeah! I'm French.
I got to phone a call.
I don't believe it!
It's worse than a disease!
- Hey! Where you going?
- I'll be back!
Fuck! Bruno! We've got a...
Leave him to me.
I'll take care of him. What's wrong...
Faggot!
Relax...
- Fatoumata, what's in this?
- Lots of good stuff.
Here, drink this.
It'll make you feel better.
Don't worry, it's nothing.
Anyway, you've got a strong stomach.
Fucking neighborhood!
Shittier and Shittier!
It's lucky we were around!
It could been a lot worse.
Because those guys are nasty bastards!
You're right, Isaac.
We better stick together.
That's for sure!
All right, all right.
- My cuz is a rock...
- Anyway, his luck didn't hold...
It's OK. He's learning about Paris.
You wanna call the cops?
That won't do any good.
They never bother anyway.
It's nice, huh?
My stomach hurts.
All night I thought it'd burst.
It's nothing! You'll see.
It'll get better.
I'm gonna show you the hip side of Paris. Come on!
It's about babes!
You know, girls!
Sit down in front of any cafe... Bum!
For real? They come over and talk?
Of course!
They just gotta see you got some style.
- Just show you're on top of it.
- On top of what?
You're gonna burn me out!
Explaining everything!
Open your eyes and learn!
Look at this magnificence!
The Opera of the Bastille.
A temple of music. Like the rock palaces Bercy or the Zenith.
I gotta be cooled out today because tonight...
Hey baby!
Call me tonight on my portable!
- You know her?
- Sure I do. She's a girlfriend.
Move your ass.
They drive like maniacs here.
- What about tonight?
- My concert out in Aubervilliers.
A really important test...
It'll be a rough night, with them just waiting for me to screw up.
- You're singing?
- Affirmative, cousin.
I'm singing, and you're gonna be knocked out.
Come on!
Paris is like that.
You gotta be quick.
Oh fuck! Shit! They're undercover cops, those two guys...
So. We did nothing.
What's up?
Yeah, but they can be mean.
Make like you're innocent.
Salaam aleikam.
So they answered in Arab?
Shit! You're not supposed to show them!
How do I know?
It just came out.
Once upon a time, upon a time, the city rut invited the country rut...
and in a very polite way...
What's so funny?
No, it's good. Your song's good!
Shit! I'm nervous.
It better work.
Jerome's counting on me.
They're paying you for singing?
Or nothing.
No man! They're not paying.
What it's about is doing well!
That, my man, is what counts in a career!
Come on. We gotta get moving or we'll get there late.
I'm gonna stay here.
I'm gonna watch my favorite TV show I like best.
You watch that stupidity...
You're nuts! You ever see it?
You didn't see when the Algiers guy found his brother in Paris, sleeping in a box and his mom in Marseilles working in McDonald's.
Everyone cried, cried, even the guy who... who presented...
He wanted himself to cry too.
They do miracles there.
Miracles, my dick!
Anyway, tonight there's nothing on 'Missing.' Nothing at all.
All right! Let's hear a big hand for Bush Broadcasting!
And now in the song category, here's Mok The Ghost, the 'phantom from the grave, ' doing some rap-fusion based on La Fontaine's poetry!
That's right, La Fontaine's poetry!
So, let's give him a big hand!
Once upon a time the city mt invited the country rut
very politely indeed, to share the Ortolans' leftovers.
Dinner was served on a Turkish rug.
Just imagine
the lives they led, these two friends.
The lives they led...
Not worth it! Not worth it!
Get off the stage!
This isn't grammar school!
Shut your face! You shithead!
Twisted...
Really Mok, it was world champ!
It's not matter they didn't get it.
It's them the animals.
I know all that slime who were whistling at me.
Motherfuckers!
They were there just to sabotage me.
Just think I.
Because I left the projects.
You used to live here?
Yeah! I pissed away twenty years of my life. Luckily I was able to split.
And your folks,
Aunt Aldjia and Uncle Mohand?
They're still here.
In Courtiliéres.
Those run-down projects.
You know, they repaint them but that don't change shit.
Ten days there and you flip out.
I should go.
Say hello for my mom.
Drop it. They're in Z City.
Z City?
Yeah man, Z City. Asleep.
It's getting real heavy trying to explain things to you.
Every line, every word that I pronounce.
I am speaking French, right?
OK. Tomorrow if you like, you bring me if you want to...
Listen to me! I'm already wired enough, like this. I'm upset.
So be a nice guy and give me some space!
You think they need to have you see them?
Your Uncle Mohand's was laid off three years ago.
And don't ask what laid off means!
I didn't ask.
Meaning, he doesn't work any more.
Meaning, he stumbled around until he got welfare.
You don't get it?
So much the better.
My brother Said, he's in the can and my brother Reda, he's zoned out on smack.
I don't know if he'll cash his check from AIDS or an overdose.
And your Aunt Aldjia, my mother, the poor woman...
She lives on coffee grains, half crazy with all this shit around her.
You know my sister Malika.
Well, you don't know her now.
She's on the game. For four years now.
Yeah, working the main drags.
So you dig, when you talk to me about the family... you're fucking my head, man.
It's due to them I'm in analysis.
I'm sorry.
This is really painful. It's...
It's okay.
I'm sure it's rough in Algiers.
- Me, I don't talk about it.
- And why not?
Because. Me, I don't talk about that.
You don't talk family. OK. That's it.
You see Laurence?
No, she hasn't been in. But Isaac was looking for you ten minutes ago.
I don't give a fuck about Isaac.
I understood what you said about your family. And it hurt.
But you know, things are even worse in Algiers. You know, you don't even know what will happen the tomorrow.
You wake up, you don't know. You carry all your money, it disappears like that!
We don't live. Life's impossible.
Now even more so, the dead, the fear.
Five years now
I want to marry. I can't.
I have no money, no apartment, nothing.
You've got a babe, all the same, right? A fiance, right?
Not really like that.
I watch her window.
We only touch with our eyes.
From window to window.
I swear I'll send my mother one day.
She asks... and I'll marry.
Ever talk to her?
You're crazy! If I talk her and she talk me, is over. I can't marry her.
Why?
If she talks me, she's like a street walker.
Come on, even flowers get hungry.
A little cake just for a snack...
You're hiding, but I see you behind the curtains.
Be nice to me.
Let's have dinner. Be nice.
Champion, Mr Vincent!
Open the window for me!
Egotist!
- Other booths...
- I want here! Because I want!
Here? There're booths all over!
I live here I phone here.
- You trying to break the phone?
- It won't work.
Give it to me! I collect...
I got a collection!
Here.
Wait! Come here.
- It's empty?
- Of course!
Not possible make it work?
- Make what work?
- To rig it?
No way. It's electronic.
Get outta here!
Excuse me, please...
I'm looking for the Courtail Projects...
Courtiliéres...
- Courtiliéres?
- Yes, that's it.
It's that way.
Go left for 200 yards, then left again, go for about 500 yards to the traffic circle. Take the second right for about 300 yards to the underpass.
Take the underpass and you come to the metro station.
And you're facing the projects.
You should've taken the metro, cousin!
It's direct to Courtiliéres.
You shouldn't take the train.
Your box is a bit bent.
Hey Mister! Excuse me...
- Fraternity Street?
- Fraternity?
That is the Courtiliéres?
Yeah, that's it.
Fraternity's the first left.
First...
Come along with me.
Visiting someone?
Yeah! Your box is bent.
No it's not! Yours is.
Uncle! How are you? It's Alilo,
Aunt Fatma's son. From Algiers...
You recognize me?
And howl do!
Alilo!
This is a surprise!
Come in, my son. Come in!
Uncle Mohand, with that, can you get Algeria?
Ah yes...
These days everyone's on cable here.
We don't watch anything else.
Everything's the opposite. In Algeria no one wants to watch Algerian TV.
They watch only French.
That's life.
So you're living at Mokrane's place?
The hoodlum!
All right! He's okay...
He's okay!
We haven't seen him in two years.
Don't talk about him.
Uncle Mohand.
Being laid off isn't too rough?
Laid off?
It means you're not working.
Not working.
Of course I'm not working!
I retired three months ago!
And Aunt Aldjia? How's she?
Aldjia? She's all right.
- All right?
- Of course she's all right!
In fact, very very well.
You'll see for yourself. Hey!
Hair and all... very classy.
She's sleeping?
What do you mean, sleeping?
Huh? It's noon!
Well, I...
Here!
Here she is, your Aunt Aldjia.
You were worried...
- You recognize me?
- Me, not recognize my sister's son!
Sit down!
How are you?
And the family? They all right?
Thanks be to God.
And how are you?
Me? I'm really okay.
Very very well.
Just a little fatter because
I still eat too much cake.
My health's good, thanks to God.
I'm really happy.
Are you here to immigrate?
Only that I come three days.
I'm at Mokrane's.
There's shit...
There's shit all over.
Be careful.
The other day, almost I walk on it.
Here we are.
Come on.
What? They put a mosque here?
You know, it's our group that does everything.
They cleaned it all up, arranged everything...
Before, there was drugs, drinking...
Filth.
You'll see how nice it is.
Hey! Who's that one over there?
That's Fouzi, the imam!
He's from Algiers.
- That's an imam?
- Yes, that's the imam.
Oh boy! I know that one.
If I tell you what he did...
Nona. Twelve hundred...
Thanks. See you later.
Hey Claude. How you doing?
You got balls! Now you're gonna make me happy and fuck off.
Don't talk shit! I gotta bet.
Two-bit little shit!
You don't pay up and you wanna bet?
Look! I feel lucky today.
I even consulted my horoscope.
I'm sure Nana's gonna win.
Don't fuck with me.
Lay 500 on me, dammit!
I said I'd pay up by the weekend.
You damn well better!
Fuck, Claudel
Show some confidence, will ya?
Get outta here!
You're lucky I'm busy.
Or I'd bust your face.
Throw him out! Out!
What an asshole!
Hey Mokrane!
How you feeling my man?
That business I told you about is on.
At Father Nemo's, the Oasis.
Count on me. I'll be there.
Look, Gontran... You don't maybe have a little advance? To pay for the suit?
Along with the color TV you already got.
You're too much. I get you on a dynamite scam and you fuck with me.
Go on, piss off.
Piss off.
Hey Laurence!
You're nuts to be here.
Claude's raving.
Yeah, yeah. I know!
We talked it out.
Look, you absolutely have to lay 500 on me.
I'm sure Nana's gonna win.
He'll rip apart...
You're setting me up for trouble...
Come on, Laurence.
You're not his slave, are you?
You're free, right?
Right. To pay for your bets?
Just this one time.
Here. Shit!
Thanks Laurence.
You know I love you.
We gonna hook up?
I got my cousin at my place.
But if you want, right after the match, behind the rails. Okay?
- You want some more?
- No thanks. Saha!
- Come on!
- No, really. I've had three servings.
- You'll get fat like your aunt.
- It's champion, but...
He's skinny, like a bird.
And the twins, Said and Reda?
How are they?
Oh no! Don't start again...
I'm sorry I
I don't want to upset you. What...
It's nothing. She just worries...
That's normal. I can understand.
Since Reda left for America, it's been too much for her.
- America?
- Yes. In New York.
First Said goes to the army and then Reda to America.
So home feels a little empty.
They're not on...
On what?
Nothing!
...Is the last one left standing!
Come on Nono!
Gimme some smokes. I'm out.
What was he telling you, that asshole?
- Who are you talking about?
- Mokl.
He was asking for some tips on the fighters.
Eat him up!
Don't wander off.
We're invited to Max's tonight.
Fucking cripple!
What have I done for Chrissake!
It's normal they leave. That's men...
And what's Reda doing in America?
He's in America to make movies.
But for the time being, he's working in a restaurant.
You know, I think he's going to marry a theater actress.
Sharon Stone.
I think I know... the Rolling Stones?
Malika!
This is your cousin Alilo.
Hi. How are you?
Happy to meet her.
You've never met?
The couscous is still hot...
No thanks.
- Finished?
- No, I just have ten minutes.
To shower and redo my makeup.
I didn't get one client all morning. It's hell.
You know, some days she has fifty clients!
It used to be better on the Boulevard de L'Opera.
Now she gets lots of work in St Denis.
A lot of Arabs from back home.
They're complicated.
Ah well! Now you're going to have a good coffee.
No, Auntie. I've got to go.
No. You drink your coffee calmly and Malika will take you back by car.
This job is really physically demanding.
Physically?
Sure! You work with your body.
And you're not ashamed doing this?
Not anymore!
In the beginning, yeah.
People in the projects mocked me.
That's over! They're used to it now.
Sometimes I even give them a ride...
Come here, look!
I'll show you my motor.
So, what you think of that?
Classy, huh?
- What is it?
- Isn't it a beauty?
Well, it's my taxi!
You drive taxi?
Yes! What did you think I did?
My God, thank you! I swear.
What's wrong? What is it?
Nothing! It's okay, it's okay.
- Okay. Where can I drop you off?
- Barbés.
Are we finished with the bullshit?
It's that lame, Nona.
See how he fought?
I'm not talking about fighting.
It's your debts.
It's getting scary.
Look, Laurence, you know damned well
I'm doing this all for Roger.
Leave Roger out of this.
He just needs some rest. That's all.
My head turns turns but I don't know why Mok never tells me the truth.
You mustn't be angry with him.
The poor thing.
What! Poor thing!
He thinks I'm a donkey or something.
That's not it, Alilo.
The problem is in Mok's own head.
Anyway, what's he up to?
I don't know, singing with animals.
I don't know.
He says bad things about you.
About everyone. He thinks...
- Like what?
- You not okay, the family not okay...
He's not okay, but he doesn't want to understand.
Malika, I'm very happy I saw everyone, and it's a pleasure
I see everyone do well. Hamdoulah!
Give Mok a kiss for me.
And don't forget!
Be patient with him.
He's a little strange, but not mean.
Good-bye.
Alilo! Wait!
I've got a letter for Mok.
I think it's important.
From the central office of the police.
A summons.
Tell him he better see what it's about.
- I hope he's not messed up with some...
- See, you're not scared.
Salaam aleikam.
Joe. How are you?
Say, have you seen Rachid?
Rachid got pulled in by the cops.
They caught him with a bag of Taiwan Rolexes.
The fool!
Illegal and he plays the fool!
It's no joke these days.
I warned him. They'll send him back home. You'll see.
You don't do that shit?
God save me! Never!
I don't go near that.
Can I make phone quick Algiers?
To call Rachid?
No! Business for me. Don't worry.
Careful, okay?
If they send him there, he'll understand, Rachid.
That's for sure.
It's not easy...
Zoubir! It's me!
Is the boss back?
What?
Listen to me Zoubir!
If I want, I call ten, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand times.
It's my business.
That's right!
I see! I'll work it out again. Fine!
Mule-headed.
How much for the phone?
It's okay. Never mind.
Hello!
- Some bananas.
- A kilogram?
No, two just.
- Okay? Are they good?
- Yeahhh. Very good.
- There you are. Two francs, eighty.
- How much?
A pound of grapes.
Hello!
You doing okay?
- Wait. Let me pay.
- Nine, sixty. Thanks.
- How are you?
- I'm fine. And you?
Yeah! You shopping?
A bit. I'm buying for the house! With...
- Would you like I can carry that?
- That's very kind. Thanks.
- Hold on. I still have to get some fish.
- I come with you?
- Sol How's the stomach?
- How's your head?
- You want to give me the evil eye.
- Your stomach...
What are those little bags?
That's a real mystery.
I never understood.
Because Mok say export-import or something.
I don't know.
What can go in a small bag?
A dress or pants can't go in.
Maybe bottles of perfume,
I think. Yes?
- I don't know.
- Jewelry!
- Like I said, it's a real mystery.
- Rolex!
Doing okay, Mr Cousteau?
You too, you not eaten yet.
Okay, I'll give you something.
Mok, he give you only dust.
The bastard!
Enjoy your meal.
- Who is it?
- Isaac.
- Mok's not around?
- No, he went out.
I got a reading to get into the conservatory. Can I take a tie?
- Sure, if he likes.
- No problem.
- He told you?
- Sure. No problem. He's cool.
- Oh yeah!
- Everything's here.
My happiness is here...
The ties are here.
You go look or I'll burn the food.
No problem! Thanks.
This is damned nice...
Just what I wanted...
That's it!
A yellow jacket...
A tie!
A hat...
Wonderful...
You'll see, I'll pass that reading.
I just have to.
- That smells good. What is it?
- Chuktchuka! Here, taste!
No, I... Well, to make you happy...
That's good.
Enjoy your meal, good ministers.
O rage! O despair!
Age, my old enemy!
Haven't I been through too much to merit this infamy,
cleansed through the works of war, to see so many laurels fade in a day?
Okay. Thanks for the clothes. Tell Mok
I'll bring them back after the reading.
- Yes! Bring back the clothes.
- No problem! Thanks.
Oh rage against friends...
Fuck! It smells burnt here!
What is this shit?
Chuktchuka!
Burnt beyond recognition...
My pan's a train wreck... Alilo!
You've cremated... Like burned it!
Fuck! He's blocked up the sink!
What did you do to the fish?
Lumps of bread!
I'm sorry I I made for you, but I sleep...
Rig ht! I sleep!
Right. I sleep!
That's right!
Better you should learn to speak.
Right, I sleep...
Right! And what is...
- I go saw family...
- What family?
Our family. Everyone, your father, mother. They're okay.
What you tell isn't true. So there.
Learn to speak... Your sister give me that. It's important, the police.
You think I'm a donkey. You think
I see nothing. You play with my head.
You want go crazy with me?
I go crazy with you!
I'm fed up.
Look! This isn't the moment.
They're pushing me...
You're the one who pushes.
Look, I'm gonna cop a quick shower.
Tonight we boogie!
It's gonna be dynamite...
A fiesta.
You'll see. We'll have a ball.
I want to stay here. I'm watching TV.
It's like you're glued to that TV.
Tonight, no TV.
Cremated, burned! There!
Fuck, it's nine. We're ultra late.
The metro's a pain in the ass!
Come on, this way.
Shit! It's not here!
I don't believe it!
Okay, there it is. Go to the corner and see if any heat's coming.
Heat?
- Yeah! Cops, like, the law...
- For what?
Don't you see we don't have a helmet?
- Is this your scooter?
- No, it's a girlfriend's.
I've got a big hog.
Let me know when!
Come on! There's no law! Come on!
You really have a real bike?
Sure, that's what I told you.
Mok, I dream about one day riding a big bike.
But you are riding a big bike.
You are riding a big bike.
You're late. Asshole.
Someone committed suicide on the metro tracks.
I committed suicide too.
And you're risking suicide some day.
Who's that?
My cousin. In from Algiers.
Come on. I'll introduce you to your wife and future father-in-law.
- You're the son-in-law?
- Yup.
This isn't a funeral.
Try to look happy.
I'm very happy.
I'm very very happy-
Yeah. That's it.
Well, kiss her if you're happy. Act natural. There might be some cops here.
Come on. We'll do the photos and the henna.
Henna?
Photographer!
- Sit!
- Thank you sir.
Hey you! I'm not paying you to put us to sleep. Music! Heat it up!
So, cousin. Can I phone a call here?
Just local calls.
- Is there any couscous?
- After the henna.
See if there's any soda around.
I'm here.
Sol You're gonna be head of a family!
How does it feel, asshole?
She looks pretty hot, big Zubida.
She's got it where she needs it!
Could I have the money, please?
Money!
Always money!
You'll get the rest at the ceremony.
And don't be late, asshole.
Or I'll have Athos eat your balls.
It's his favorite dessert.
Athos!
See you at town hall tomorrow.
Come on. Let's go. Let's split.
A paper wedding!
For twenty thousand francs.
So she, you don't love.
Not at all.
Fat girl needs papers.
So her father springs for it and I cop the bread for playing the groom. Dig?
You know the father?
Course not! Best you forget.
Drop it.
I got it! I watch father all night.
I ask where I saw him.
You know who is father?
Yes or no?
He worked in government. I saw him on TV. In the papers, all over.
He stole bread and left.
- Yeah?
- Yeah!
Okay, tomorrow, I promise.
At town hall
I'm gonna ask for a pay raise from that creep.
It's not possible!
It's not real!
Everything's not real!
Zoubir? It's me.
What?
Oh, he's back?
World champ!
Put him on.
Yes, boss!
I'm sorry I
Did Zoubir tell you for...
I'm sorry. I know.
No, I didn't do right.
What I You've lost faith.
Give me the address. I go right now for bag, I go now for it.
And tomorrow morning, first thing, the bag is in Algiers, like already there.
I'm writing. Mr Maurice...
Yes! I know.
Stop screaming on me!
I'm not a slave.
Excuse me.
Where's the St Denis station?
All the way?
I go that way, all the way?
Okay, thanks.
Excuse me. You're Mr Maurice?
No. Hey Maurice!
Hello Mr Maurice!
Mr Belaid is sent me.
For to take bag.
So it's you!
I've been waiting five days.
What happened to you?
I lost the address.
Or you got lost in Paris?
No! It's true I lost address.
Only today I could call Algiers.
I get address and here I am.
Mr Belaid does as he likes.
It's not my problem.
The bag is there, waiting patiently for you.
- You look out of breath.
- I ran!
Sit down. Take a chair.
- You want a tea?
- Thank you Mr Maurice.
It's good when you're hot.
Tell me what's happening back home.
Catastrophic, eh?
Yes, catastrophic!
The dead, one by one.
You know,
I'm here thirty years now, but every time something happens there, it's like a dagger in my heart.
You never returned?
But when I'm homesick
I've got this.
You know that music?
Of course I know I.
With that music I can travel far.
I'm in Soustara Plaza.
I go down the Street of the Lyre, to Government Plaza,
I take Bab el-Oued Street.
Avenue of the Marne,
Avenue of Bouzareah and the Three Clocks.
I smell the mint, the chorba, the coriander.
Mr Maurice! It's sure that you, you know La Fontaine.
La Fontaine?
Women's ready-to-wear?
No! No!
La Fontaine, the one he wrote little songs for animals.
He's smart.
He talks with animals and with us.
- The wolf and the lamb!
- That's it!
I know it.
You know,
I'll never return to Algiers.
But every Saturday I go to temple and pray for peace there.
In my opinion, they've massacred Algeria.
Okay. Now you go.
Take the bag. Go on!
The grasshopper, after a summer of song, was unprepared when the cold wind blew.
That you, Alilo?
- You got it?
- Yeah!
That's for you for costs when I'm here.
- Here! I want to be straight!
- Put it away.
Wow! They're beautiful.
This is worth ten thou!
You know, that in Algiers, girls go crazy.
They love the colors.
Sells like pancakes.
I saw Mr Maurice!
He's Jew from Algiers.
Very nice. We had good talk.
Too bad I go.
I like you meet him.
- You leave when?
- Tomorrow.
Oh no! You staying tomorrow.
We having a party.
We're going to a karaoke bar.
You know, the boss already bawled me out.
I'll stay with you a day more.
Say, could you do me a little favor?
- How about taking a little walk?
- Why?
I'm waiting on someone.
It's too cold outdoors!
Be nice, like.
I'll loan you my jacket. It's warm.
It's warm.
Figures.
Come in! Come in!
The best show in Paris! It's all new!
It's just come out!
Brought here from New York!
Welcome to Paradise!
Natasha's waiting for you!
Don't be afraid!
Welcome to the sexual kingdom.
You did right to come in.
I've got something great for you!
Something brand new.
It comes from America.
There's only two of them in Paris!
Usually you only watch.
Now you can touch!
Twenty francs and you can pet.
Real petting with a real woman!
Devilish, isn't it?
You never saw the Drag Queen?
- Is there music too?
- Yeah, that's it. It's like a disco.
You make up your mind yet?
- You're good for 200.
- No, you said 20!
Okay! But I'm warning you.
It'll be shorter.
Go on. Don't be afraid, this is paradise.
See you later.
Stop!
Madame!
- What is this shit? Shut up!
- My hand.
I said the token was for a minute, not two hours.
What's this madness?
Where do you think you are?
Go on! Get a move on.
Pay up and take off.
Get this clown outta here.
Go on! Go on!
What are you thinking about?
Nothing.
It's all muddled up inside my head.
Take me along!
I want to go with you.
You've gotta be patient.
I got to put things in order.
With Roger?
You know that I love you.
I want to go with you.
I'll take you along. I promise!
We'll leave all this.
It's just my cousin. He can wait.
Hold on! He won't stop.
Okay! There you are.
- That you, Alilo?
- It's Claude. Open up!
My things!
Coming, coming!
Hey Claude.
Today's Monday.
That ring a bell?
In bed already?
Nah, it's my cousin.
He's catchin' a snooze.
Look, Claude. I gotta tell you.
I've got a problem.
I don't have the bread.
How's that?
You don't have my bread?
You fucking with me?
You come and hassle me when I'm working,
"Loan me some! Nono's gonna win!
Nono's gonna win!"
I'll help myself.
I swear, I don't have your bread.
What's this?
My cousin's rags.
Hey, this is some merchandise!
He a cross-d resser?
Don't touch that, please.
Fancy shit.
No! It's all imitation.
Imitations.
Well, I'll just take the bag.
This doesn't cover it all.
So don't play the fool.
That's my cousin's bag.
You can't do that. Look, really.
Right. Because you can be trusted!
Okay, I leave you to your love life.
Think I don't know I
The crib stinks of pussy.
Not the bag!
What am I gonna tell him?
You give me my dough,
I give you your bag. So long asshole!
What are you doing with my bag?
Go ask your cousin.
I'm asking you.
What are you doing with that bag?
What is this?
You looking for a kick in the balls?
That bag, it's not leaving here!
Shit kicker! You broke my tooth!
I think you're crazy, you!
I think you're sick in the head!
Why did you give my bag to that other bastard! This is too much!
- Who is this guy?
- My cousin, Alilo.
Fuck it! I didn't give him your bag.
I swear it. He took it by force.
This is all an act.
Always you cry. Always.
Why didn't you give money from wedding? Why?
Now you finish your act.
You got your bag back!
If you give him something, give your money!
You know, I got the money, but I promised it to someone.
I got a friend who's dying.
And I don't give a fuck about your bag.
If you not my cousin,
I break your face.
Stop it!
Go ahead, then! Hit me!
Like that, cousin?
You fuck me around since I'm here.
Never the truth. Just bluffing.
Always zigzagging.
But it's the truth! Fuck!
The motherfucker won't believe me!
It's not true! He's a total liar.
He lies on family, on me, on everyone.
All his head is bent.
That's enough.
Let's calm down and discuss it.
He's insulting me!
Just what do you know about me?
Really, man.
I can't stand looking at your mug anymore. You make me wanna puke.
That's your act again!
I'll go get him!
No.
Let him go.
He'll calm down and come back.
You know, he told you the truth.
Claude did take it, the bag.
What'll I do? I don't know.
Mok's a good guy.
If he gets out of this mess, he could do a lot.
What mess?
The fire at the club.
He didn't tell you about it?
One night we wanted to go to a club.
Mok, Roger, his best friend, and me.
The bouncer...
Bouncer?
The guy at the door.
He wouldn't let Mok in.
Roger got angry.
It degenerated into a brawl.
He got beat up by the bouncer.
That drove him crazy.
He came back with a gasoline can.
He emptied it in front of the door to the club... and lit it.
Mok and I could do nothing.
We get chased by a cop car.
We get stuck against a wall.
And Roger's paralyzed.
He's my brother.
Mok and me, we didn't...
In fact, yeah, Mok's in the shit.
He's gotta go back on trial.
And obviously, just when he's trying to get his papers.
Then the jerk does a paper marriage, using fake papers.
O rage! O despair!
Age, my old enemy!
Haven't I been through too much to merit this infamy,
cleansed through the works of war, to see so many laurels fade in a day?
You okay Mok?
You got insomnia?
Don't catch bronchitis.
Wake up.
How come you didn't sleep over there?
It would've been better.
I want you to excuse me for yesterday.
I got too upset.
No big deal. It's already forgotten.
I'm going skating!
It's Zen.
Fatoumata!
- You okay?
- I'm okay! And you?
Yes, okay! I'm telling you, because...
You come with us.
We make party because I go to Algiers.
Mokrane said tonight we go there to a karakory.
We're going to sing to laugh.
I'd like that a lot, to go with you.
Okay then! Fine.
What are you up to?
Want a cup of tea?
I can't.
I get train ticket.
I go tomorrow to Algiers.
Okay, then, see you tonight.
- Tonight!
- Tonight for sure!
World champ.
The grasshopper, after summer of song, was unprepared when the cold wind blew.
Not even a little bit of fly or larvae...
He went and cried famine
at the door of his neighbor the ant
begging to borrow some grain to survive
until the spring comes.
'I'll pay you for it," he said,
"before August. On my word as an animal, interest and principal."
Great! It's him who wrote all the songs.
Lyrics and all?
He works with a machine, and with Mr La Fontaine for the lyrics.
I like it a lot.
Why the other day you were crying?
- Because I lost someone.
- What? Someone is died?
No.
I lost my fiancee.
- Abdulah left me.
- Who's that?
The healer I work for. Or who I used to work for. As that's over now.
And that's it.
We were together a year.
A year and two weeks.
And last week he had his wife come, without warning me.
He brought her from Guinea.
And that's it. The next day it was finished with me.
It's not easy, but...
It's hard for me to manage, sometimes.
Life's like that.
They're really good.
Yeah! Champ!
And you. What are you doing in Paris?
Me, I'm running here and there.
I should be leaving tomorrow.
I want to go... and I don't want to.
In my head...
I don't know.
I understand.
What a town, Paris isl I love it.
I saw nothing of Paris. I saw nothing.
I only work everyday, here, there.
Eiffel Tower I didn't see.
It's not too late.
We can go if you like.
Really?
- You and me?
- Yes! Now!
We going to see the Tower?
Do we go? Come on.
- You leaving with her?
- She say we take short walk.
And you're not afraid?
Here.
- What's that?
- Gum! They always like it.
It's beautiful!
I like a lot water like this.
In Algiers always I walk next to sea.
It smells good.
I stroll.
We could walk along the other bank.
You want to?
- We can go there?
- There are steps under the bridge.
- Come on!
- Do we go?
- Look! It's smaller than on TV.
- It's you who's grown.
The Eiffel Tower!
It is big! Look!
- I think something is moving.
- It's the elevator.
If we make little shop there, it goes champion.
Promise! People go up, go down.
We bring merchandise to third floor.
And we sell one by one. No?
You, you get on first floor and me on the third floor and we send.
Round trip, right?
What time's your train tomorrow?
At three. I take train, go to Marseilles, sleep there.
And the boat after, direct until Algiers.
- Want some gum?
- Yes, please.
What's this?
What is this, Alilo?
What's wrong?
Is this your gum?
I swear it's not me. It's Mok who...
First time I've seen a come-on like that.
You see how quiet it is here at night?
And the neighborhood's going to vanish.
Why?
Everything's going to be demolished.
Then there'll be new buildings, but where do we go?
Mok he tell me this is neighborhood of future of Paris.
Mok dreams while he's awake.
This is the Moskova, poverty-stricken.
It's like where I live.
So you really have to leave?
Have to! And with the bag.
I can't...
It's better if I didn't know you...
You know, I wanted to tell you...
I'm happy to have met you.
Alilo...
And...
And I really had a lovely evening.
Me too.
And you helped me forget for a moment.
Thanks very much.
Well! I want to wish a good trip and a happy return home!
Me too.
No! I mean, thanks very much.
Take care!
Fuck me! A bomber's flying around in my head. Oh, fuck me!
Oh, my head!
I don't believe it!
My head's gonna explode.
You mixed too much drink. You...
Drink some olive oil.
After, that's it!
It's not that, Alilo!
It's spinning, I swear!
Fucking hangover!
No more drinking. That's it.
OK, let's go to the train.
No, stay! I'll say good-bye.
That's it. Come on.
I don't want... Stay and sleep.
Stay... Rest.
Why? Are you messed up about leaving? That it?
No. It's not that.
So tell me, then.
It's Fatoumata!
No! That's it! Come on. Good-bye.
Tell Laurence I said good-bye.
And you too, good-bye.
Hey Alilo!
Write me when you get there!
Be cool, there in Algiers!
And come back to see me. Because I ain't ready to set foot in your shithole, what with all that's going on there.
Ladies and gentlemen!
In the interest of your security,
French Rail asks you not to leave any object or baggage unattended.
We ask you to alert us if you see any unaccompanied baggage.
It's true. You camel
I wanted to see you before you left!
Last night we said good-bye, just like that.
I'm very happy!
Very happy.
I'm very happy.
I really wanted to see you again.
You know...
Last night...
Well, I wanted you to stay.
I want to stay too, but I think fate, he doesn't want that.
Last night I dreamed that you stayed with me.
I'm very happy!
You know...
I want to tell you something.
I can't.
It's okay. I understand.
What?
Me tool.
What?
You're in love, and so am I.
I'm ashamed.
Will you come back?
Yes!
And there,
I think of you all the time.
And if you give me your address,
I write you everyday letters.
I'm very happy!
Mr Mokrane Bensalem?
Yes. That's me.
Police.
We've got an order here for an immediate deportation.
So get dressed, pick up your things, put them in a bag and follow us.
Deportation? But that's...
What is this?
You know what it is.
Your plane leaves in an hour, so get moving. Come on.
But I was born here.
I'm... I'm French.
- Is that it, then?
- Yeah, it'll do.
Wait!
It's not worth answering.
You're not here, anymore.
Come on, let's go.
Hi! You've reached Mok's place.
"He who travels fur respects his mount...
"Nothing is gained by rushing.
One must leave on time..."
I'm not here, but don't worry.
I'll be back right away.
In the meantime, if you have a message, please leave it after the beep.
Hey, ciao!
Hello Mokrane! It's me.
Answer me, just a second.
I know you're asleep.
But I want to talk. It's very serious.
It's very very serious.
The police, they exploded the bag.
Impossible I go back to Algiers. If I arrive without bag, boss cut my throat.
I want to tell you...
Fatoumata came to see me. I'm with her.
She told me I stay in Paris with her a while if I want.
Listen to me,
I want to tell you truth.
I think I'm in love with her.
I'll see you in a little while. Okay?
Hey Cousin!

- Can I help you?
- Well, I called for her last night.
Her husband died last night.
His picture was in the paper once, but you misspelled his name.
She wants to be sure you get it right.
- You see, it's not one, but two "I"s.
- You want obituaries.
It's the guy in the back with the urn on his desk.
What funeral home was she taken to?
How old was she?
What did she die of?
Well, I have to know what she died of or I can't write the obit.
I don't make the rules.
Could I call you back? Thank you.
Excuse me, will you?
Tom?
Tom, look, I cannot take this anymore.
You got to get me off the obit desk.
I can't write another obituary.
Calm down, Adam. Relax.
It isn't going to last forever.
Think of it this way:
This is your last chance in journalism to write anything nice about anybody.
Perfect.
New York City - Five Years Later
So, you can't talk to me about the arrest.
Can you talk to me about after the arrest?
You know, his time in prison.
It was terrible.
He was in shock the entire time.
He lost a lot of weight because he couldn't eat the food.
He couldn't sleep.
They had him in the same cell with a Mafia hit man.
- He was afraid to close his eyes for a week.
- Interesting.
For a man like him... that was cruel and unusual punishment.
I'll say.
What do you think, Charlie?
Can you get him to talk to me?
He's not talking to any press, Adam.
He doesn't trust you guys.
I don't blame him.
There's been a lot of bad press lately.
I thought he'd want to tell his side of the story.
The only way to do that is an interview.
Especially if he feels that the government is screwing around on him.
Now, I didn't exactly say that.
Anyway, not for the record.
I don't want you to twist what I said out of shape.
Right.
The problem is, the only people that will talk to me are people that hate him.
And I'm doing this story whether I talk to him or not.
So don't fault me if this is a negative piece.
That sounds vaguely like a threat.
No, I think that if he wants a chance, he's got to turn his press around.
You reporters think you make the world turn.
I don't know about that.
You know,
I used to be a reporter myself... until I got tired of starving my family.
That's why I got into public relations.
- To make a living wage. I love it.
- Yeah.
I really do.
Excuse me. I have to take a piss.
- Am I interrupting something?
- No. Adam, come on in and look at this.
- Frankie strikes again.
- Look at that. They're good.
At last someone has managed to capture his true essence.
Look at this one.
I can't believe that she got him to do this.
Believe me, it was easy.
I think this will be the one we use on the cover.
- You like it?
- I like it.
- You want to get some lunch?
- Yeah.
- Frankie, you want to join us?
- Absolutely.
How did it go this morning?
Fascinating.
He insisted we meet at the Atrium Club, saying it was a safe place to talk.
He implied the government had a reason for putting McKenzie out of business.
He was so nervous.
- But what about the interview?
- He thought it was doubtful.
- There's no story without an interview.
- Or without pictures.
You don't want to recycle the same wire service photos.
- I'd love to shoot him.
- You'd make him pose with coke in his lap.
- I can make him do anything.
- Come on, you guys.
I have an idea.
McKenzie has a hearing tomorrow, in Los Angeles, to reduce his bail.
But he needs the $2 million to pay his lawyers.
Why don't I fly out there tonight and get the interview?
- You hate flying.
- I'm fine, as long as there's no turbulence.
When it starts bouncing around,
I get drunk.
If you're going, let's find a story for you to do at the same time... in case it doesn't work out. I don't want you wasting your time or my money.
You cheap fuck.
You want two stories for the price of one?
Fine.
I have an idea for a story that would take place in California.
What?
I got the idea at the Atrium Club, this morning.
- Who would you be going after?
- Not who, what.
- Excuse me, what will you be going after?
- Health clubs.
- Groan.
- No.
I'll do a story about how they're turning into the singles bars of the '80s?
Find a couple.
Do a non-fiction love story.
- With pictures.
- Lots of them. It could be hilarious.
Particularly set in Los Angeles.
You know, inflated bodies. Airheads.
- Hot tubs? Alfalfa sprouts?
- Absolutely.
We haven't done L.A. in a long time.
It would be wonderful.
- Sounds great.
- Shit.
- What?
- Carly Simon just walked in.
Oh, God.
- She hated the story you did on her.
- I know, I know.
- Hi, Carly.
- Hi, Carly.
Hi, Carly.
- I read that shit you wrote about me.
- Come on, Carly.
The only thing worse than being written about is not being written about.
There is a motion with respect to the bail for Mr. McKenzie.
- Is that correct?
- It is, Your Honour.
- Yes. Is there a written motion?
- No.
I'd like to make an oral presentation.
- You filed the notice?
- Yes, Your Honour.
All right, then, go ahead and state your reasons.
Then the government may reply.
We are seeking a reduction in bail based on two major things:
One, Mr. McKenzie is simply not as wealthy as the government... and the press, for that matter, imagines.
Let's leave the press out of it.
They have nothing to do with setting bail.
Here they come.
- Charlie, what about the interview?
- He's not talking to anybody.
- Period.
- If he changes his mind, I'll be at...
He's not changing his mind.
He's flying to New York today.
The Sunset Marquis.
The Sunset Marquis!
Hello.
- Adam?
- Yeah.
- How's it going?
- It's going fine.
He got his bail reduced, but I couldn't talk to him.
He had to go back to New York.
I'm working on some other angles.
I'm trying to locate some friends of his.
I started the piece. It's real good.
- In other words, no interview?
- Come on, Mark, please.
The story is great, and the material I have is terrific.
- It should be a cover.
- You get the interview and we'll talk cover.
Simon & Schuster just made an inquiry for me to do this as a book.
Cover would help.
I'm not in the goddamn book business.
- Have you found a health club yet?
- Yes, I found an ad in the phone book.
The club's name is The Sports Connection.
"Health club, racquetball, and good times.
"We're a totally new concept in athletic club.
"We're more than a club, we're a lifestyle."
Then it has this illustration of a couple in sports clothes hugging each other.
It sounds perfect.
What kind of story are you planning to do?
Maybe something about couples meeting here, falling in love
- getting married.
- That sounds good.
Let's go down and get you a membership, so you can see what's happening.
Now that sounds even better.
Nanette, where did you get this idea to make this place... more than a health club, like your ad says?
I looked around the city and I saw that people had had it with singles bars.
They even had the supermarkets staked out. That was getting boring.
Really?
There wasn't anywhere people could get together in a healthy environment... and have some social interaction.
- Right.
- Mr. Lawrence, hold it.
Michael and I, he's my partner, thought it'd be great to create a place... like the lodge at the bottom of the hill in Aspen.
Where people could share a common interest.
- All right.
- Phone, Nanette.
- Take a message, okay?
- Okay.
My concept was to get people out of their potato chip bags... into the club by convincing them it didn't have to be drudgery.
- That it could be fun.
- Right.
- I'll get somebody to show you around.
- Sounds good.
We have nine racquetball courts.
These two courts are our challenge courts.
- The winner stays on, loser gets off.
- Really?
Then, you have a lounge area.
It's a good place to sit and relax, before and after your workout.
Your entrance and registration area.
And then we have Pete's Pro Shop.
They have the latest in workout apparel... and racquetball equipment.
Then you have the snack bar.
They have fruit juices, great smoothies.
- Beer and wine?
- No wine, just beer.
- You can get a beer after your workout.
- Good.
- And great sandwiches.
- Sprouts?
- Definitely.
- Yes.
- Are you into health food?
- No, not really.
Okay, let's look at Body Dynamics.
What they do in here is personal fitness assessments.
They do cardiovascular testing, nutritional analysis... hydrostatic weighing, or weighing the body underwater.
It helps determine your percentage of body fat.
Then, you have an hour-and-a-half-long consultation.
- And here we have the coed gym.
- So this is where all the action takes place.
On the free weights, the universal equipment... the Nautilus, and Icarian equipment.
- I feel guilty, all these people working out.
- And the Lifecycle bikes.
- Hi, Bobby.
- Hi, Linda.
- I miss you. I never see you anymore.
- Adam, Linda. Linda, Adam.
Hello, Linda.
I mean it. I really miss you.
I worked up here as an instructor before I was promoted to sales.
- I see.
- He used to work on my body.
- Looking good.
- God knows, I try.
I'm still in the "before" group, not the "after," but I'm gonna get there.
- Where's Sally?
- She's there, working out with Roger.
- Trying to make her tits even bigger.
- Well, see you.
- Nice meeting you.
- You, too.
- What's her story?
- She was a mess.
- What do you mean?
- No one works as hard to get in shape.
- Really?
- Hi, Sally. Hi, Roger.
- Five.
- He's killing me.
- Come on, let's go, back to work.
- How many? Just three more.
- That's a couple you should talk to.
- Who are they?
Sally works with Linda at the Apparel Mart, downtown.
And Roger, he's a stripper at Chippendales.
- Interesting. I do want to talk to them.
- Nice people. They met here.
- You'll have such a good time, I promise.
- Come on, come on!
How big do you want them?
Can I get a list of couples that met here, and their phone numbers?
- It's against policy to give phone numbers.
- Can't you bend the rules?
I really don't have much time.
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you.
- Kenny, this is Adam Lawrence.
- How you doing?
He's a reporter for Rolling Stone.
Kenny can answer questions if I'm not in.
- Nanette said you're looking for couples.
- Yeah.
I'm a big fan of yours.
- Really?
- Yeah, I subscribe to Rolling Stone.
I read your piece on Carly Simon.
I thought it was great.
So did I.
I bet lots of lustful matinees get started here.
- What? What do you mean?
- Excuse me, I mean, social interaction.
- Let me show you the rest of the club.
- Okay.
By the way, what kind of story are you writing?
This is aerobics and "slimnastics."
That's Jessie Wilson.
She's probably the best female instructor we got right now.
They call her "the Aerobics Pied Piper."
- A lot of couples met in her class.
- Really?
Turn it around.
I'm going back to my workout.
- Enjoy the class.
- Thanks.
- Nice meeting you.
- It was very nice meeting you.
Squeeze. Release. Squeeze. Release.
Toes out!
Shoulders down.
Really tighten your thighs!
Touch down!
Straight leg, left. Go!
Hold it down on two...
Hold it!
Let's go!
- 'Night, Kim.
- Goodnight, Jessie.
- Hi, Shirley.
- Hi, Jessie.
Jessie.
- Adam Lawrence. Hi.
- Hi.
- I really enjoyed your class. You're great.
- Thanks.
I'm a reporter for Rolling Stone.
I'm writing on the Sports Connection.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Rolling Stone?
- Yes.
I'd love to interview you.
- Why?
- Why not?
- I can think of a lot of reasons.
- It would be good for business.
Business is fine.
You think about it.
I'll be around for a few days.
I will, but I don't change my mind about anything.
Could you give me a reason why?
I read magazines.
The Star Garden Club is proud to present...
direct from New York City, the one and only...
Shotsy.
- Jessie, hi.
- Hi.
- Did you think about it?
- Very, very hard.
- Did you change your mind?
- No.
- Well, I'll get someone else to interview.
- I guess you will.
Maybe you don't understand.
I may want you as the focus of my story.
No, you don't understand.
I don't want to be the focus of anything.
Okay, you don't have to be the focus.
I just need your viewpoint.
Last time I counted, there were 90 aerobic instructors.
- But your classes are the biggest, sexiest...
- Are you deaf? No!
- What's the problem?
- I was burned once.
I don't intend to get burned again.
- The battery's dead.
- No kidding. It happens all the time.
Where's your car?
I have jumper cables.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
I can never remember which is positive or negative. Try that.
- All right.
- Keep it going.
Okay, I have an idea.
I know you don't want to be interviewed.
- But how about dinner tonight?
- Sorry.
How about lunch tomorrow?
- All off the record?
- Just like regular people.
- Hello.
- Hi.
I'm sorry to call so late, but I just got your message.
What's going on?
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Why?
Hold on, I'm putting you on speaker.
I got a call from a guy I know who's in the shady end of the record business.
He said you're ringing the wrong doorbells and might end up in the hospital.
Make sense to you?
I don't know.
I've been poking around, but...
I made contact with one of his old girlfriends today.
Maybe somebody's nervous about that.
I called just to say watch yourself.
I want you to promise me you'll be real careful on this one, okay?
Anyway, how's the other one?
Have you found a hook?
Yeah, as a matter of fact.
I found this terrific opportunity.
It's not the kind of story I had in mind at first, but it's pretty good. Listen.
There's a girl at the Sports Connection who they call "the Aerobics Pied Piper."
She's got this following of leotards and sweat suits.
She's fun to watch, so lots of couples meet there.
Sounds good. Maybe that will work.
It's great. The only problem is she doesn't want to cooperate.
- But she will.
- I'm sure she will.
Just remember, get close to her while you research, but when you write...
Forget she has a mother. Right.
Don't I always?
- Talk to you later.
- 'Bye.
So, who's going to get the Lawrence treatment this time?
Some girl he met.
- That's obvious.
- So what's the hook of your story?
It's not one of those pieces about how health clubs are the new singles bars?
God forbid.
- Do you work out?
- Yes, I do work out, when I have time.
I don't take it as seriously as you guys do, but I do work out.
My dad didn't take it seriously, either.
He died fat at 40.
Sorry.
I was 8. I knew even then... if he had worked out and not smoked, he'd have lived longer.
How old are you?
I'm sorry.
You don't have to answer that question.
- Mid to late 20s.
- Interesting.
What?
Most people I've interviewed are about that age.
I think when you get to our age you feel the need to keep in shape.
Probably no coincidence that the baby-boom generation... approached 30 at the same time as the exercise boom started.
- You do have a hook?
- Maybe.
It's good to talk a story out before writing.
It's all spitballing at this point.
- What's that?
- A tape recorder.
I thought maybe we'd exchange ideas, if you don't mind.
- Do you mind?
- Yeah.
- I won't do it.
- Thanks.
I do have some notes that may interest you.
Look at this.
"The baby-boomers are leading a physical great awakening...
"like the spiritual awakenings that grip America about every 100 years."
Pretty good.
I think people want to take responsibility instead of leaning on institutions.
For instance, does anyone believe the government will take care of us?
- No.
- Not since Vietnam or Watergate, no.
Or big corporations? Or even doctors?
So, you have to take care of yourself.
A lot of people are trying to get in shape, as you well know.
I think we've come full circle.
Almost back to Emersonian America of self-reliance.
There's something else here.
Emerson: "Do that which is assigned thee and thou canst not hope too much...
"or dare too much."
So, what could be more all-American, more old-fashioned all-American... than institutions like the Sports Connection?
Little capitals of Emersonian America scattered from sea to shining sea.
You are so hot.
I'm glad we had this off-the-record lunch.
I was real suspicious of the kind of story you were going to write.
If you want to know about the Sports Connection... a real writer would work out. Join.
- You ever taken an aerobic class?
- No.
I've got one starting soon.
You should take one of mine.
I should, but I can't, I don't have the time.
I've another appointment this afternoon.
I have to finish up a story before I can concentrate on this one.
- What's the other story?
- Joseph McKenzie.
You do important stuff, too?
- Will you be here later?
- Nope. I'm on the road.
What do you mean, on the road?
I teach class at the
Beverly Hills Sports Connection, tonight.
- Coming in?
- No, I really don't have the time.
I'll make a deal with you, though.
I would gladly take one of your aerobic classes if you'd let me interview you.
I was really beginning to like you, too.
Notes on lunch.
We talked about baby-boom generation, great physical awakening...
Emersonian America.
Father dies fat at 40.
Interesting girl.
She's smart, but I've got to be smarter.
McKenzie and I go way back.
I met him when I was in New York, and I was stripping, even then.
Right, but in a little classier club.
I didn't know who he was and he walks into the club one night... and he puts a $1,000 bill in my G-string.
- Are you kidding? Really?
- We had a lot of fun.
- He's really a great guy.
- Sounds it.
I'll tell you something, if you promise not to tell.
- Okay.
- He bought this house for me.
- Really?
- Yes.
- Well, do you still talk to him?
- Joe and I talk all the time.
- Shotsy?
- My God, my husband's home.
Eddie?
- Honey, this is Adam Lawrence.
- Hi.
He's a reporter for Rolling Stone, and he's doing a piece on Joe McKenzie.
- Get out of here.
- I wanted to ask your wife a few questions.
- You leave her out of this.
- Eddie, I invited him.
I told him he could come.
He says that nobody has anything nice to say about Joe, and I want to help.
You're not saying anything to anybody.
I don't want her name mentioned in any article, understand?
Now get out of here.
Knees up!
Jumping jacks!
See you next week.
- I'll see you guys later. I'm late.
- Great class. Thanks.
'Bye.
You did good.
- See you later.
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?
- I just thought I'd come by... and see if you needed someone to help charge your battery.
- I have a confession to make.
- A confession? Yeah?
What kind of confession?
On my way to work, I went to the library and pulled some back issues... of Rolling Stone and read some articles that you wrote.
Really? Which ones?
Abscam and Junk Food.
"And?" he says, fishing for a compliment.
You're pretty good.
Must be fun being a reporter nowadays.
"Yeah," he says suspiciously.
You get to try to keep the big boys honest.
At the same time, you get to figure out which way the culture's going.
I guess that's true.
A friend of mine says... that popular culture is to society what dreams are to an individual.
If you want to find out about an individual, you analyse their dreams.
Same with society.
If you want to find out about a society, you analyse things like music and film.
- Or health clubs, or junk food.
- And in doing so, you can be quite vicious.
I think I try to be objective.
Do you always work on a computer?
Do you know anything about computers?
I took a couple of courses.
- You left it on.
- I always leave it on.
This way, it's already warmed up if I get an idea in the middle of the night.
May I?
Everybody writes that.
I was hoping you'd come up with something more original.
How do you erase it?
A good reporter would never get in bed with a subject.
You keep forgetting something.
I'm not your subject.
- You'd probably be a lousy interview.
- Probably.
- No opinions, no ideas.
- None.
- I think I'll take your class anyway.
- I give a very tough class.
You do? Tell me about it.
First, there's the warm-up.
The warm-up is designed... to increase blood to the muscles, to warm up the muscles.
So as to be able... to do the more strenuous exercises.
And then, there's the cardiovascular.
Let me get rid of this.
Hello. Yes. Who?
Mr. McKenzie, yes.
Well, this is he. Well, who told you?
Shotsy did. Good.
That's good, I think you should tell your side of the story.
Well, if I left right now,
I could probably catch the redeye.
Great. Sounds good. Thank you.
He'll meet with me. Maybe he'll talk.
I got to go.
Of course you do.
Wait a minute.
This is to be continued.
I certainly hope so.
- Hello?
- Hi, I called the office.
They said you're still home.
Rough night.
Mikey Douglas was in town, and I got the cocktail flu.
- Where are you?
- I'm at JFK. Guess what?
I got a meeting today with McKenzie.
We're to meet at 12:00 at the Atrium Club.
- You're shitting me.
- No.
- You got any space in the next issue?
- I'll make space.
- Has the cover closed yet?
- Yeah, it's closed.
Screw the cover.
You're drunk, aren't you?
Must have been some turbulence.
Listen, I can't talk. I got to go.
I'll drop by later, how's that? 'Bye.
Wish me luck.
Adam?
Kent, it's Mark.
Listen, I've waited all my life to say this:
Hold the presses.
And get me Frankie.
- What is she doing here? Frankie!
- Adam!
- What are you doing?
- Mark wants me to photograph McKenzie.
- No, he's nuts. I can't take you with me.
- Come on. You can try.
- Forget about it.
- Adam, come on.
Go, Frankie. I'm not kidding.
Nobody's supposed to be here.
You'll blow it.
- My photos are as important as your story.
- There'll be no story without an interview.
- Don't do this to me.
- Bull!
- What?
- It's Charlie, his flack.
- Stay here.
- Charlie who?
- Give me your camera.
- No.
Charlie, hi.
I'm so sorry I'm late.
The traffic was impossible.
- Mind if I use my tape recorder?
- Why don't you ask him yourself?
Well, you certainly come prepared.
- Where to, Mr. McKenzie?
- Just drive around the park.
- So, what happened?
- I got it.
I never thought I'd get him to talk, but once he started he wouldn't stop.
It was amazing.
I have three solid hours all on tape.
Adam!
Where's my camera?
Give it to me right now.
- Don't ever pull that again.
- The film's inside.
- My first picture credit.
- What?
- Have it developed. See you later, Frankie.
- Screw you.
- So what's the story?
- Okay.
McKenzie was negotiating to sell his computers to Czechoslovakia... to save his company.
He had it all worked out.
He was gonna move computers... through dummy corporations, all over Europe... until they wound up behind the Iron Curtain.
He claims the government found out what he was up to... and put him out of business by busting him.
- How much space do you need?
- Six pages.
Four.
Five.
Okay, four and a half.
We'll hold the issue. When can I have it?
- How soon do you need it?
- Tomorrow morning.
You got it.
What about this aerobics contest coming up?
They want me to make a demonstration.
- Jessie, phone for you.
- Okay.
- Okay, killer, I'll see you later.
- Be good.
- How you doing? You through?
- Yeah.
- Where were you?
- Hiding.
Here you go.
Hello.
Adam, hi.
I'm fine. How was the interview?
It was real interesting.
I really can't tell you the details right now.
I'm afraid this phone is being tapped.
I'll be in tomorrow.
I'll call you when I know what time.
I'll be there.
Make sure my tape recorder is on.
I understand you suspect the government of what lawyers politely call "misconduct."
That's right.
Well, could you expand on that?
I have reason to believe...
that they eavesdropped on my office computers.
You know, like hackers. But...
these hackers weren't kids.
They were FBI hackers.
Yes, hello.
What cuts?
What trouble?
Right.
I'll be there. Okay.
Frankie.
- How did my pictures turn out?
- Bad, amateurish, snapshotty.
That good?
- Mark can see you. The lawyers are here.
- The lawyers?
Come on in.
You know Tod Turner and Martha Young?
Only on the phone.
You really are expecting this to cause trouble.
- I thought you liked causing trouble.
- I do... more than anybody you know, but up to a point.
Let me guess what that is.
Could that be the point where trouble costs you money?
Right. You want to split the bills on this one?
- What's the problem?
- Martha, why don't you start?
Mark says that you have the entire interview on tape.
Something like three hours?
- Who's to retain custody of the tapes?
- I am, why?
The magazine should retain the original tape, or a copy for its files.
- That's not a problem, is it?
- That is a problem.
I promised McKenzie
I wouldn't let anyone have a copy.
The prosecutors will demand a copy once this story is out.
I promised him they would never get it.
I gave him my word.
We'll do everything to keep the tapes from the government.
- We'll fight any subpoena in court.
- That's not good enough.
I will make sure the tapes don't get out.
The only way to do that is to keep them.
What happens if the magazine were fined
$1,000 a day until you turned them over?
I won't test the magazine's guts or its bank account.
The government could pressure you, too, send you to jail.
That's a risk I have to take.
Where are the cuts? I want to see them.
Adam, be reasonable.
You could have libelled McKenzie.
He could have libelled others.
Let's not kid around.
Mark could be facing millions in lawsuits.
Without your tapes we have no evidence to go into court with.
I can't recommend that Mark publish the article unless you turn them over.
I can't recommend these cuts.
Someone's editing with their elbows.
- Where are the tapes?
- In my bag.
Look, you wanted me to do the story,
I did the story. Okay?
Take it or leave it.
Print it, don't print it.
I got a plane to catch.
Another story to write.
You have a big decision to make.
Now, where were we?
What comes after the warm-up?
After the warm-up... is the cardiovascular section.
It should last for 15 to 20 minutes.
It should be un-interrupted and steady.
This aerobic phase exercises the most important muscle in the body.
- Which is?
- The heart.
- How do you feel?
- I feel great.
- You're gonna be sore tomorrow.
- I don't think so.
- Still want to interview me?
- I don't know.
- I broke the cardinal rule of journalism.
- What's that?
After what we did last night,
I don't think I can be objective.
- I need to take a shower.
- I need to make a phone call.
- You want to come out to my house later?
- Yeah.
- You did good today.
- Thanks.
For a New Yorker.
- For a New Yorker, too.
- Nice legs.
- Mark, it's Adam!
- I'll take it up here.
- Tell him I have to talk to him.
- Hello.
Mark? Hi. Just checking up.
The McKenzie story going or what?
- We're closing it tonight.
- Good.
- Where are you?
- I'm at the infamous Sports Erection.
- How's that going?
- It's tougher than I thought.
I need some more time.
I haven't really started writing yet.
What about that Aerobics Pied Piper?
- Hi, Adam.
- Hi.
I'm working on her.
Do me a favour and send an advance copy of that McKenzie story... to Simon & Schuster? Dick Schneider.
Tell him why it's not on the cover, okay?
Speaking of covers, I got this great idea for the health issue cover.
Ready?
You wanted to use Christie Brinkley, now you can.
- In a leotard.
- Not bad.
- Dita needs to talk to you.
- No, I don't want to.
I don't have my notes.
I'll just call her later, okay?
All right, I'm going. 'Bye.
- Kenny?
- Hey, what's up?
Could you tell me something?
This girl, what's her name?
- Which one?
- The one with Robert.
That's Linda Slater.
- She's dying to get in your article.
- Really?
- Yeah, but you don't want to talk to her.
- Why not?
She's the most used piece of equipment in the gym.
I don't know.
I don't think you can be objective.
I mean, really objective, under any circumstances.
- Like the Heisenberg principle of physics.
- Yes.
The theory that we change things by observing them.
The idea is that to see something you have to shed some light on it.
- And light alters what it shines on.
- Yeah, that's good. Very good point.
- Hi, you guys.
- Hi, hon.
Jeff, Bobby, this is Adam Lawrence.
Adam, Jeff, Bobby.
How you doing?
Your mother's in the kitchen.
- Is she sober?
- She brought the divinity again.
- Not a good sign.
- We're going skiing this weekend.
- Why don't you guys come?
- Skiing? This time of year?
They ski Mammoth until July 4.
Why, you ski?
Sometimes, yeah. I like to ski.
- Why don't you guys come with us?
- Maybe we will.
We'll see how he feels. You see, he just took his first aerobics class. Mine.
Nothing to it.
- This place is great.
- Yeah, we like it.
Jeff and I are just roommates.
He teaches at the Sports Connection.
That's where he met the girls.
You should interview them.
They have this interesting relationship.
Mom!
I'm not staying, I'm leaving. Don't worry.
I was lunching at The Muse and I wanted to drop by some divinity I made last night.
- Hi, Jess.
- Hi, Billy.
As I said, they have an odd relationship.
Yeah.
- This is the best divinity I've ever made.
- Mom, Adam Lawrence.
- Adam, my mom, Melody.
- How do you do?
Adam works for Rolling Stone.
He's doing an article on Sports Connection.
- He looks too nice to be a reporter.
- Mother.
A piece of divinity, Mr. Lawrence?
She makes the best divinity in the world.
You're thinking of interviewing Jessie for this story?
We're talking about it.
We haven't quite decided.
Well, I hope you treat her better than the last reporter.
That was one of the worst experiences of my life.
I thought we weren't going to talk about it.
All right, I'm going.
Goodbye, darling. Come visit.
'Bye, Mr. Lawrence. Enjoy the divinity.
Jessica, you're too skinny.
- This stuff will kill you.
- What was she talking about?
Who is this reporter and why was he interviewing you?
If I told you, you might be tempted to use it.
I couldn't stand that.
Wait a minute, I want to know what she was talking about.
In high school, I was a swimmer.
I was a very good swimmer.
I broke world records.
I made the Olympic team.
That was the year Carter decided to boycott the games in Moscow.
I didn't agree with him and was vocal about it.
There was this reporter who said he wanted to write about how I felt.
But what he ended up writing about, after a series of interviews... was my alleged love affair with my coach.
- I'll show you where the phone is.
- Wait a minute.
- Where's the phone?
- On the roof.
- Jessie, hold on.
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Jessie.
- I don't want to!
- Just tell me about the L.A. games.
- I was never that fast again.
Here's the phone. Make your call.
I'm going to go check on the mail.
Hello.
Dita. What's up? You need me?
I'm having trouble checking this.
Everyone's afraid, nobody will talk to me.
I really need your help.
- You ready?
- Shoot.
- Are you sure about the spelling of Shotsy?
- S-H-O-T-S-Y.
- How did you like the piece?
- Not bad.
We should do more of this sort of thing.
Man does not live by rock 'n' roll alone.
Woman either.
I got to put you on hold.
Somebody's buzzing me.
- Okay.
- Adam!
Believe it or not,
I've changed my mind about something.
Let's go skiing. I want to go to Mammoth.
You can interview me all you want.
What's the matter?
I can't move.
God, I can't move.
I got polio.
I got polio! God!
- How many articles do you write in a year?
- I don't know. Ten, sometimes more.
Do you always follow your subjects around?
You're interviewing me.
I'm supposed to be interviewing you.
- Any pointers on how to improve my style?
- Yes.
Always treat a famous person as if they're not.
And a person who's not famous as if they were.
And think of your interview as a seduction.
- A seduction?
- Yes.
How many times a year do you fall in love, Adam?
It depends on the subject.
I think anything worthwhile takes longer.
Working out, a relationship.
Maybe you're right. I wrote six articles a day for a newspaper.
- At least I'm going in the right direction.
- Which is?
Take some time off, write a book.
About what?
McKenzie, maybe. If this article is as good as I think it will be.
Maybe even the press.
They have gotten a lot of bum raps lately.
Yeah. And you? What would you like to do?
Right now? Or for the rest of my life?
You don't want to teach aerobics forever, do you?
No, there's a point when you're not the best, so you get out.
Is it important for you to be the best?
Yeah. Ever since I was a kid.
I'm trying to find something that means the same as going for the gold medal.
I always expected to win it.
I like breaking records.
I like setting records and breaking them.
I like winning trophies.
I like being the best.
You are the best.
You want to go break another record?
- Sure you're not too sore?
- Yes.
Let's go.
- Good luck, right?
- Yeah, right.
Come on.
- I've just the remedy for you.
- You do?
I really got turned on in that class.
It's sexy to watch people work out, don't you think?
Sure, because the sexuality is so free.
- Everything seems to be so legal.
- It's definitely a meat market.
Which is probably why you don't see many couples working out together.
I mean, if they pair off they fall out and you never see them again.
- They never come back.
- It's 'cause it makes sex much better.
The better your body looks, the more you want to take off your clothes.
It's true.
That's good.
Well, do you think that people that are in better shape have better sex?
Yeah.
- Definitely.
- Without a doubt.
All right, how can we expand on that?
I did.
- I mean, two heads are better than one.
- Jeffrey.
Yeah?
- Hi, Jess.
- Better than one, huh?
"What are you thinking about?" he says, hopefully.
I'm thinking about George Hathaway, to tell you the truth.
Who's that?
He's the reporter who wrote that piece in Inside Sports magazine.
What made you think of him?
I think about the press a lot nowadays.
Anything specific?
I was wondering if he has any idea what his article did to all of us?
What do you mean, exactly?
It's very hard for me to trust anybody, anymore.
On any level.
My mom and I didn't talk for a year.
See, she was the one who gave him most of his information.
Although, she says she didn't say what he printed.
It didn't matter because my coach lost his job.
His wife left him, took their kids.
And he and I...
I don't know, it was just never the same.
We went to one meet afterwards.
It was just too painful.
It was actually humiliating.
But was it true?
Did you have an affair with your coach?
What's that, Adam?
A tape recorder.
- Is it on?
- Yes.
Get out!
- Get the fuck out of my car, Adam!
- Jesus Christ.
- You fucking liar!
- Jessie.
You're a sphincter muscle, Adam!
She's mad.
She always swims when she's mad.
Hi.
- Hi, Mr. Lawrence.
- What's going on out there?
The kids think Boy George is staying here, and I'm trying to convince them he's not.
Your editor called and said it's urgent that you get back to him.
- Really? Thanks.
- Yeah.
We want Boy! We want Boy!
- Hello?
- Adam, it's Mark. Hold on.
Where were you these last three days?
Skiing, Mark. I've been skiing the beautiful High Sierras.
Skiing.
- What's that got to do with the story?
- Very little, I suspect. What's up?
The whole world wants to get that McKenzie piece.
- Like who?
- New York Times, Washington Post...
Wall Street Journal, Time,
Newsweek, the wires.
As you weren't in, all I could say was,
"Eat shit and die."
- You're a real phrasemaker.
- And McKenzie's lawyers called.
They want the story bad.
They offered me money not to run it.
Did you take it?
Adam, eat shit and die.
We want Boy!
- Yes, Mark?
- Then some guy calls and says... no health club will keep you healthy if McKenzie's story runs.
Sounds like I'm being followed.
God, wait a minute.
I think my room has been searched.
- What? Where are the tapes?
- In my bag.
Maybe you better get home.
I don't have anyone to hang a story on.
What happened to Miss Pied Piper in leotards? She was perfect.
- She's not. There's no story there.
- You sure?
I said there's no fucking story there, but I'll find one, okay?
Hold on. What's the matter with you, Adam?
Hey, do you think I like it out here?
I can't stand it here. I hate California.
Nothing ever goes right for me here.
Cherchez la femme.
Sounds like you're in love with a California airhead.
Eat shit and die, will you?
Hello? No, this is Sally. Who's this?
Yeah, just a minute.
Linda, it's for you.
It's that guy from Rolling Stone.
You're kidding.
- What do you want him to do?
- Take it off!
Isn't he wonderful?
Sally is so proud of him.
- How long has he been doing this?
- Ever since she met him.
- They met at the Sports Connection, right?
- Right. The first day we joined.
- She's so lucky.
- Yeah.
She had no idea he was a male stripper.
That's my lover who's out there.
Ladies in the back, move down to the front steps!
Move to the front with your tips for Roger!
- Can you see all right?
- What?
Can you see all right?
I'm sorry you have to watch from there... but Roger had to do some fast talking to get you in at all.
It's fine. I can see.
Now, watch this.
- Nobody knows they go together.
- That's great.
- Hi, Linda.
- Hi, Matt.
- How you doing?
- Good.
- How are you?
- Great.
- Can I get you another drink?
- Sure, yeah.
- Adam, you want a drink?
- No, thank you.
I'll be right back.
- God, you know everybody.
- He works out at the gym, too.
I know everybody at the gym.
It's like my home away from home.
He's real nice.
- He's been on Merv Griffin.
- You know, it doesn't surprise me.
- What?
- I say, it doesn't surprise me... that you know all the handsome men.
I bet a pretty girl like you gets hit on a lot.
Yeah, I do okay.
Excuse me...
I'll be right back.
I have to talk to Sally.
Sally. Sally, come here.
- It's going great, isn't it?
- Fantastic.
Listen, he is so charming.
I want to invite him to the party.
What?
Adam. He's so charming.
- I want to invite him to the party.
- Great.
I think he's trying to seduce me.
Hey, Sally, happy birthday.
No, Robert, not yet.
Not until the stroke of midnight.
- Sally, where's Linda?
- She's around here someplace.
She's with that Rolling Stone reporter.
Don't tell anybody... but he's going to make us the focus of the article, maybe.
So act natural, okay?
And this is Sally's bedroom over here.
- And this is my bedroom.
- Nice.
Just don't call me a male stripper.
I'm an exotic dancer. And don't forget it.
Are you sure you don't want to take off your coat?
- It's hot.
- Not really.
Do you mind if I use a tape recorder or take notes?
Not at all. You got to get it right.
I don't want to be misquoted.
Next question?
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Linda.
Hey, Linda.
Come over here and sit on my face.
Shut up. I'm being interviewed.
Tell him about the bachelor party.
- I was drunk.
- And the night in the back of a Mustang.
What night? I don't remember you there.
Were you there?
That was really good.
Remember that? That was great.
I hope everyone likes vegetarian food, because I'm a fanatic.
I wanted everything to be healthy tonight.
Except the birthday cake.
I made that with white sugar.
You can't have a healthy birthday cake.
Did you girls ever frequent singles bars?
Did you do that scene?
Did we ever.
For a while I think that's all we did.
Yeah, we had our own bar stools with notches on them... in every singles bar in the Marina.
Linda, stop talking like a sleaze.
We weren't that bad.
Why did you decide to join a health club?
Any one thing?
I got sick of drinks with parasols in them.
No, I just got so tired of waking up feeling crummy every day.
I kept meeting one jerk after another.
I wanted to meet a healthy man.
Linda, you'll give the wrong impression.
Not everyone joins to meet someone.
- Most people join just to work out.
- Now, speak for yourself.
A psychic told Sally she'd meet the man of her dreams at a health club.
Right, so that's when we joined the Sports Connection.
- And you met Roger the very first day.
- Yeah.
It was love at first sight.
I took one look at those tits and my whole body got hard.
You're terrible. He's writing that down.
Come on, Sally, you're just as proud of them as I am.
Actually, I am.
As a little girl,
I would go to Ann-Margret movies.
I'd come home praying for tits.
Now, I prayed for tits, too, you know.
God just didn't answer my prayers.
Yes, He did. God answers all prayers.
He just said no.
Do you see similarities between singles bars and health clubs?
Yeah, but I love health clubs a lot better.
Singles bars are really humiliating.
You're waiting there to meet somebody.
- You have an excuse to be at a health club.
- Right.
And it's a lot safer looking for Mr. Goodbody... than looking for Mr. Goodbar.
That's good. I'll use that.
- Really? You like that?
- Yeah.
This is so much fun.
I feel like I'm on Johnny Carson.
- I really like that cleft in your chin.
- Thanks.
"Happy birthday to you
"Happy birthday to you
"Happy birthday, dear Sally"
God!
"Happy birthday to you
"And many more"
Make a wish!
Okay.
Blow. Blow.
Somebody get the lights on.
Here, open this one first.
- Roger, not yet. She's got to cut the cake.
- Just this one.
What is it?
Linda, it's an engagement ring!
Do you believe it?
Congratulations.
I love you so much.
Look, you guys.
I'll go make coffee.
I'm dying. Wait, Linda,
I'm going to cut the cake!
- Linda.
- Hey, Linda.
Sally, you should have told me.
I'm your best friend.
- I didn't know he'd give me a ring.
- Roger, you should have told me.
- You know you can't keep a secret.
- What?
- Aren't you happy for me?
- I couldn't be happier.
- What's going to happen to me?
- For God's sake, I'm only getting married.
- Sally, won't you open your presents?
- Yeah.
Please, go now. Open your presents.
Linda.
God.
- God. I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
- Let's go, let's go!
- All right!
I'm happy for you.
I'm really happy for the both of you.
Go out and open your presents.
- I'm going to make some coffee, okay?
- All right, okay.
- Be sure to make a pot of decaf, too.
- Okay.
Okay, you guys, let's open those presents.
Hi.
God.
You know, it's so easy for Sally.
It's always been so easy for her.
- I can't wait until I have plastic surgery.
- You're having plastic surgery?
- Didn't I tell you?
- No.
Yeah, I'm going to have plastic surgery.
- You're kidding?
- No.
I'm going to have a chin implant, some cheek bones, and a different nose.
- Why? You look terrific. Are you serious?
- Yeah.
A doctor friend is going to do it.
And he knows the makeup artist from The Dukes of Hazard.
He's going to redesign my face.
Do you think there's a connection between your plastic surgery and your workouts?
- It's part of the same thing.
- Which is?
I want to be perfect.
The most perfect you can be.
That's what I want to be, the most perfect me possible.
- And you'll do anything.
- Anything.
If you perfect yourself, you'll be loved, is that what you're saying?
Yeah. Well, you put that really nice.
The most important thing as a reward for perfection is love. Right?
Yeah. Sally thinks I'm mentally unstable.
How many spoonfuls of coffee have I put in there?
I don't know.
I'm so drunk I can't remember.
Adam, are you going to make a pass at me or not?
You know, you can have me. I'm available.
Thank you, but it's against the rules.
Well, since when have you been so ethical?
Everybody knows you're seeing Jessie.
I'm sorry.
I guess I'll go and see if I can scare up a gang-bang.
These are really nice, Mary. Thank you.
- Mary, see if you can find Adam for me.
- Sure.
Yes?
- How's it going?
- Well, you got your story.
- What's the lead?
- It's just as I promised you.
Airheads, inflated bodies.
I call it "Looking for Mr. Goodbody."
- That's a good cover head.
- Yeah.
- How soon can we have it?
- When do you need to decide on the cover?
- I have to have it tomorrow.
- Yeah, well, I'm almost through.
Can't wait to get through with this and move on to something else.
- Got anything in mind?
- How about I go after Bowles in Morocco?
I'll think about it.
By the way, turn on your radio.
The McKenzie story's all over the airwaves.
Somebody gave UPI an advance copy and they put out a bulletin.
- You didn't give it to them, did you?
- Of course not. Did you?
- Hold on, someone's at the door.
- I'm on my way out. I'll call you later.
All right, 'bye.
Can I come in?
Want a cup of coffee?
It's not too hot.
This isn't for me.
This is for my friend, the coach.
He's back with his wife and has a new job.
Avoid using his name.
Hey, listen.
Here, I'm not using it. I didn't copy it.
I didn't use your name.
You're not in my article. Okay?
I give you my word.
Jessie.
You called me a sphincter muscle.
You are one.
- Who is it?
- It's Frankie. I just checked in.
I'll call you later, Frankie.
- I've got something for you.
- Forget it. I'll call you later.
Come on, Adam. Open the door.
What's going on in there?
You got somebody in there?
Do you ever.
Jessie, this is Frankie Smith.
She's one of our best photographers.
Not one of, the best.
Here's an advance copy of the McKenzie issue.
They used your horrendous photographs.
Even gave him credit.
Do I know you?
You look very familiar to me.
I don't think so.
Jessie's an instructor at the Sports Connection.
I see why you call it the Sports Erection.
I got to go. Thanks for the tape.
You look very familiar to me.
Great piece.
Referring, of course, to the McKenzie story.
- Frankie, get out of here. I got work to do.
- For sure.
- What time do you need me?
- I don't know, 1:30 or 2:00. I'll call you.
Good, that will give me enough time to find an assistant.
And anything else I need to get me through the day.
Jesus! I forgot to tell you.
I already shot the cover. It's amazing.
Mark had this great idea.
Christie Brinkley in a leotard. Sensational.
See you.
United Press International reports that it has an interview with Joseph McKenzie.
It's the only interview McKenzie's given since his arrest on drug charges.
In it, he claims the State Department framed him...
because he was negotiating to sell computers to an Iron Curtain country.
The interview will be published
in Rolling Stone magazine.
- Sorry they forgot to mention your name.
- Yeah, I'm not.
- So this is it?
- Yes.
- You know what you want?
- Yes. Exactly.
Great.
Okay, guys, I need a little ass.
- Okay, guys.
- Don't be embarrassed, just take them off.
It's okay, make me suffer. Come on.
- Come on.
- What's my mother gonna say about this?
I'm in pain. All right, good.
Be in love with yourself and look this way. All of you.
Let's go, you just sweat it. Great.
Four more!
Twos!
Singles!
Come on!
What are you doing?
She's not in the story.
- Why not?
- Give me a break.
- You got enough pictures.
- All right.
I'm flying to New York tonight.
Scott's taking me to the airport.
See you there.
- I want those that you took.
- You got them. Good shoot.
Five, six, seven, eight!
Over!
Five, six, seven, eight!
I'm glad I met you.
And I'm sorry I met you.
I'm glad that you're glad you met me.
I'm sorry that you're sorry you met me.
- I thought you put a "don't disturb" on it?
- I did. It must be important.
Hello.
It's the Associated Press.
I'd better take it. Yeah, send it through.
Hello? Yes, hello, Fred.
Well, of course I remember you.
I really can't do this now.
It's not a good time. Can I call you back?
All right.
Just for a few minutes.
Let me ask you something, first.
Do you have an advance copy of the McKenzie piece?
Really? Where did you get it?
I'm just curious.
Who?
I've never heard of him.
I can't imagine how he got it.
I've been working on the story for several months now.
What?
Yes. Persistence and patience, yeah.
No.
I don't think he was using me.
What?
Well, what tapes are you talking about?
No comment.
I can't talk about that right now.
How long?
I don't know, three, four hours.
That's right, in a limousine.
We went around the park.
Listen, really, I've got to go.
I'll talk to you at another time, okay?
Yes, thanks for calling.
Bye-bye.
Sorry.
- What are you doing?
- I read your little story.
You lied to me. I'm erasing it.
- You're not erasing it. Are you erasing it?
- Son of a bitch.
- Jessie, you're overreacting.
- Yeah?
- That's what the other reporter said.
- Don't compare us.
- I didn't mention your name.
- Do you think I care about my name?
You spoke of Emerson, baby-boomers, and physical great awakening.
All you did was write about people getting in each other's pants.
Everything I wrote is true!
Everything the other reporter wrote about me was true too, but it still hurts.
It's not the truth I'm worried about, it's the tone, and hurting and using people.
You're disgusting.
How can you be nice to somebody like McKenzie and shit on Linda?
What did she ever do to you or anybody else?
Nothing.
What's wrong with wanting to be the best you can be?
What is so wrong with wanting to be perfect?
What's wrong with wanting to be loved?
Nothing.
You're going to ruin her life.
Jessie!
Jessie! Jessie!
What are you doing?
Come on, Jessie, talk to me.
- Open up, Jessie. Don't do this to me.
- Fuck you.
I warned you not to put her name in that article.
Shit!
Okay, start stirring towards the middle.
That's it.
- Stirring.
- Just don't get carried away.
- You need a little more, honey?
- I think you're doing wonderfully.
Lauren, you've tipped it.
- How often do you do this?
- Pretty often.
- Honey.
- Yeah?
- It's Adam.
- Okay.
Stir down.
- He says it's important.
- Keep going. Keep stirring.
It looks good.
Hello? Adam? You all right?
You sound strange. Is something wrong?
This is going to take longer than I thought.
What? You told me this morning you were done with the damn thing.
It's called "deadline."
The best part is to eat it while it's still smoking.
What's going on there?
We're making ice cream with liquid nitrogen. In the morning, Adam.
You've got no more time because there is no more time.
Right. You got your story.
"The ghost of Emerson haunts all the clubs in the land...
"because they represent a return to his values.
"I seem to see old Ralph Waldo on a small stage, a kind of podium...
"almost preacher's pulpit.
But, he isn't preaching. No.
"He's leading an aerobics class and the whole country is joining in.
"America is shaping up.
Physically, mentally, emotionally.
"In all kinds of ways.
"'Do that which is assigned thee, '
Emerson wrote in Self-Reliance...
"'and thou canst not hope too much or dare too much."'
What is this?
Has he gone crazy?
It's not what he promised me.
This is not "Looking for Mr. Goodbody."
Mary. Get me Adam Lawrence.
What does Emerson have to do with singles bars?
- Has he gone nuts?
- Too many sprouts.
- That's very funny.
- Too much exercise.
Out there they call it bed aerobics.
- Who's she? She looks very familiar.
- Her name is Jessie Wilson.
- She looks familiar to me, too.
- She looks familiar to me, too.
He's got a "don't disturb" until 12:00.
The car's downstairs.
I'm going to Washington.
I can't print this shit.
I'm gonna kill the thing.
You can't kill the story, Mark.
You're already committed.
- You can't change the cover now.
- You re-write it. You make sense of it.
Get his notes, get his research.
Frankie was there, she'll help.
I'll give it an edge.
- Adam will be very upset.
- That's his problem, isn't it?
He'll be out of town.
I'm sending him to Morocco.
You do whatever you have to do.
He's an arrogant son of a bitch.
Hello. Yeah.
What?
When?
Hello. Yeah, just a minute.
Jessie, it's Adam.
I'm sorry. She won't talk to you.
Yeah, sure, I'll tell her. 'Bye.
He told me to tell you just to trust him.
Look what I found.
I knew she looked familiar.
Okay, now get at least ten copies.
- Do you need any money?
- No, I've got some.
Boy.
- We can place your call now, Mr. Lawrence.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Hello.
Nous avons ouvert la ligne avec Les Etats-Unis.
- Vous parlez maintenant.
- Oui. Merci.
Hello.
Jessie, it's Adam. I'm calling from Morocco. Can you hear me?
I can hardly hear you.
Have you read the article yet?
You are a sphincter muscle.
Jessie.
Operator. Operator.
- Dita.
- Yes?
It's for you.
- Hello.
- Dita.
- Adam?
- Dita.
Adam, where are you?
This is a terrible connection.
- Dita, do you have a copy of the new issue?
- Yes.
- Is my story still in it?
- Yes.
- Read it.
- What?
- Read it!
- Okay.
Okay, here goes.
"Coed health clubs are the new singles bars of the '80s."
No.
"They have actually usurped the sounds and energy of the discos.
"The aerobic jumps and..."
I got to go. 'Bye.
- Hi, Mark.
- Merde.
Sir, when Mr. Bowles comes, tell him that I had to go back to the States.
Tell him that it was an emergency.
May I have your attention, please?
Announcing the arrival of Pan Am flight 22 from Tokyo.
Passengers are going through customs.
They will be on the arrival level in one half-hour. Thank you.
God.
- Jessie Wilson, is she here?
- What?
- Jessie Wilson, is she teaching today?
- Nobody's here.
They're all over at the Beverly Hills Club for some kind of benefit.
Hey, Lawrence.
Lawrence!
You can't go that way.
Please welcome our Sports Connection models.
Roger of Chippendales, Little Taylor...
Eva, Myra, Sadie, Terry,
Debbie, Heidi, and David.
But no more as you can see.
You exercise better when you look better, because you feel better.
Great colours give you energy.
- Linda, there's Adam.
- I can't believe it.
There he is, behind her. See that?
- Yeah.
- Roger, there's Adam.
- What's he doing here?
- I'm glad he's here.
- Why?
- Because I'm going to castrate him.
There he is.
These clothes are designed to help you look your sweaty best.
Four, five, six, seven. Post now.
Here comes the cavalry. Let's go.
Jessie!
Jessie, I didn't write it.
You got to believe me, please.
Just let me explain.
Leave her alone.
Haven't you caused enough trouble?
Come on, keep it going. The side-saddle.
Let's go. Bend those knees, and breathe.
Just get out of here, Adam.
You got to let me explain to you.
I didn't write that.
- It had your name on it, Adam.
- Why would I do that to you?
Jessie, please, don't do this to me.
Just leave me alone, Adam. Leave me alone.
- Hey, Lawrence.
- Ladies, we're really sorry.
I loved your piece.
I don't forgive anyone shitting on California.
- Yeah, he called me an airhead, too.
- Son of a bitch.
The captain has turned on the fasten seat belt sign.
We are experiencing some unstable air.
Please remain seated until the captain has turned off the seat belt sign.
Is your seat belt fastened?
Please, fasten your seat belt.
'Morning, Adam.
Hi, Adam.
I thought he was in Morocco.
- What are you doing?
- You rewrote my fucking story.
- That thing was a lousy piece of crap.
- You rewrote my story, you little shit.
Put that thing down.
Who gave you the right to put my name on it?
You did, when you turned in...
Why didn't you put your name on that fucking shit?
- Get out.
- You eat shit and die. I quit!
You're pathetic.
Mr. Lawrence? We're from the FBI, and we have a subpoena for you.
This is Adam Lawrence.
Leave a message at the beep.
This is Joe Baker of the Associated Press.
I'd like to talk to you about whether you will comply with the subpoena. Call me.
Adam, it's Mark.
Listen, I want you to call me.
You got to talk to the lawyers.
We've got to decide what to do.
I know you're there, so call me.
Hello, Mr. Lawrence,
this is Steven Roberts of The Times calling.
I need to talk to you. Please call me.
Adam, this is Mike Jones of UPI.
We met down in Florida, remember?
I'd like to talk to you about the McKenzie tapes. Please call.
Adam, it's Frankie.
I feel real bad about this whole thing.
I'd like to talk to you, that is, if you're still talking to me.
Adam, it's Mark again. We've got to talk.
Your career is at stake on this one.
I don't care what you did at the office.
You must call today.
- He has no comment.
- Give me a break, no comment.
He's a reporter who can go to jail over the First Amendment.
Are you prepared to do that?
Will you go to jail over the First Amendment?
By refusing to talk,
Lawrence left unanswered whether...
when he appears in court, he will turn over the tapes of his interview.
If he does not, he could face contempt charges and a prison term.
Carla Maxwell at Los Angeles
International Airport for Eyewitness News.
- Mr. Lawrence, what is your occupation?
- I'm a reporter.
- You currently employed, sir?
- No, I'm not.
Directing your attention to June.
Were you employed?
- Yes.
- And who was your employer?
Rolling Stone magazine.
As a Rolling Stone reporter, did you ever interview the defendant in this case?
Yes, I did.
Do you recall when and where this interview took place?
In New York City, June 14. Central Park.
- Did you record the interview?
- Yes.
How did you record the interview?
It was a portable tape recorder.
- And how long was the interview?
- Three hours.
How many tapes did you use to record this three-hour interview?
Three tapes.
Did you bring those tapes with you, pursuant to the government's subpoena?
No, I did not.
- Are those tapes still in your possession?
- Yes.
So you could have produced those tapes, had you been so inclined?
Yes, I could have.
I move that you direct the witness to turn over the tapes... or find him in contempt for willingly and knowingly violating a court order.
Mr. Lawrence, if I were to give you until 4:00 this afternoon to produce... the tapes of your June 14 interview, would you do so?
No, sir, I'd have to decline.
I am warning you, Mr. Lawrence, that if you adhere to that position...
I'll have no choice but to find you in contempt... and I will imprison you forthwith.
Now, do you understand the gravity of your position?
Sir, I do, but I have no choice here.
I promised that no one would ever hear those tapes, especially the prosecutor.
- I gave him my word.
- All right, Mr. Lawrence.
I dislike doing this, but I have no choice.
You are in contempt of court and
I'm ordering that you be imprisoned until... you decide to comply with the subpoena... and surrender the tapes to the U.S. Attorney's office.
We'll take a 10-minute recess.
Excuse me, are you Jessie Wilson?
Adam!
- I understand you've reached a verdict.
- Yes, sir, we have.
Would you please hand the verdict to the bailiff?
Will the clerk please read the verdict?
"In the United States District Court, for the Central District of California...
"United States of America, plaintiff versus Joseph McKenzie, defendant...
"we, the jury, in the above action, find the defendant, Joseph McKenzie...
"not guilty."
- There he is.
- Mr. Lawrence.
- What are you going to do now?
- I don't know.
- How are you feeling?
- Good.
- Would you do it again?
- I would do it again. Yes.
What are you going to do next?
Was it worth it?
Adam, will you be going back to work for Rolling Stone?
I don't know.
Now, where were we?
Smuggler FM.
That's a wonderful new jingle, Gordon.
Someone's been busy in the back room. Eh, dan?
- Play it again?
- Why not?
Smuggler FM.
Smashing.
You know, Gordon...
- I hear an anecdote coming on.
- The other day, someone said to me...
"what's it like living in the last county in england?"
And I said, "cornwall's not the last county, it's the first."
Mmm... all right.
- Hey, what's that?
- That is our new window.
Our new window?
I just woke up and thought a window would be great there.
Chloe, we're going around the world... we don't need a new window.
JC... there's a sock on your, um... it's in mourning.
It's sad.
I mean, six weeks without love is a very long time.
But, now, all that's over.
No more suffering.
Yeah?
No more back pain.
Just you and me... and a whole lot of catching up to do.
So, just lie back and relax.
And let the jeepster do the work.
Breakfast?
Breakfast?
Trifles sound good?
You are feeling better.
Hey...
Crab:
Nice pinny.
Shhh!
What's going on?
- Surf.
- Surf?
Six foot and clean?
Come on!
Chloe... you're going to kill me.
I've really screwed up.
I've got a lesson.
What, now?
Sorry.
The kids, they're... waiting.
Crab, not again, man?
Moose, you dragged me out of bed for this.
- He promised.
- It's coming.
Oh, shape.
Yeah, two weeks, four days and every night.
- It's coming
- unbelievable.
What have you got there, shape?
Hawaiian seaweed.
Call upon the gods of the islands... to send waves, sprinkle it upon the water... and chant the sacred name of "makahee... kee".
How do you think you say this?
Shape, please, spare us the guru shit.
How many days good surf do we get in cornwall?
I don't know.
About one in ten.
- And how about hawaii?
- Endless summer, man.
Yeah, can't wait.
One perfect barrel after another.
All right for you. What have we got to look forward to?
Winter.
What a bummer.
We get gnarly waves.
When you've broken the ice.
Makaheekee. Makaheekee... makaheekee... makaheekee... makaheekee!
Makaheekee!
...smuggler fm.
All these young people seem to want to leave in the winter.
It does get quite bleak, round about.
Bleak's an awful strong word.
I won't hear bleak.
- "Damp", maybe then?
- "Fresh", I'll give you fresh.
Well, I've never been one for foreign travel... not with all the beauty of cornwall on my doorstep.
Well, it seems this young lady is going all around the world.
And we wish Chloe well on her trip to paradise.
Huh, with a special request from someone called...
...the jeepster.
(T.Rex song
"get it on" plays)
Wait for it, remember I don't want to see any dragging feet.
It's one clean movement, and... paddle, paddle, paddle, paddle, paddle, paddle... up!
Yeah.
When are we going in the water?
Listen, this is really good practice when there aren't any waves.
My mum paid you to take me surfing.
First rule of surfing... mellow out.
Hippy!
Hip-py! Hippy!
Chloe, that's... that's gonna burn.
I expect you had to tell the kids your shark story.
- Chloe, it's burning, honestly.
- It's supposed to caramelize.
Yeah, it doesn't mean napalm it, does it?
Look... really, pass me the cream.
Got any of that syrup?
Mm-mm.
What?
Nothing.
What?
I just... er... like watching you cook.
Yeah?
Nice pinny!
Chloe:
Out!
Chloe:
Okay, kids, what'll it be?
Trifle.
- Yeah!
- You're not old enough.
Sorry, only one portion left... and I promised the great shark rider that he could have it.
Yeah?
Yeah. Tonight.
And you'd better not have any other plans.
Oh, no, no,
I'm... all yours.
Oh, I know, I know, j c, it's been too long.
No worries, me and Josh can handle it.
Yeah... you, me, slim, Josh... all the boys together again.
Yeah, all right.
Sweet.
See ya.
JC's up for it?
Of course. I told you he would be.
- And he knows?
- Sure.
Do us a favor.
Bang that gong when I give you a green light... yeah?
Yeah? Sweet.
Hard as you can.
A nice one!
Fuck...!
Are you having a go at me?
Just having a laugh.
(crash) "fuck...!"
Excellent.
Do I get royalties?
What if some townie jerk buys this place?
- That's no drama, man.
- He's right, you know.
He'll probably turn it into a captain ahab's theme bar.
Where are we gonna hang then?
Crab... man, you're starting to stress.
Eighty-eight.
You did eighty-eight?
Eighty-eight.
What can I say, man?
You know... congratulations.
Ladies and gentlemen, the new king of the pipeline.
Would the old king like to present the crown?
Aughh!
Eighty-seven... come on!
Dig in, go on!
Eighty-eight!
Come on, one more... one more!
Eighty nine!
And still the king... yeah!
Ohh... thought you hated the press.
It's for my mum, all right?
Now, I know what you wear's important, Josh, so you choose.
Which balaclava... green or blue?
Josh:
He's dead.
They were only sleeping pills.
Just how many did you give him?
- Enough.
- How many's enough?
Enough.
Plus a couple of extra to be on the safe side.
Yeah... if we end up in court, remember, you're the one who drugged him.
Relax, I work a lot with pharmaceuticals.
Oh, I'm sorry, I must have missed your six years at medical school.
Look, I know what I'm doing.
The good stuff for my mates... and flu pills for the punters.
Told you he'd be all right.
I told you, no stag night, dean.
No getting pissed, and no old stripper... making me rub baby oil into her pink bits.
- It's not a stag night.
- No?
We're going surfing.
Oh, my god!
You can do this.
You can do this.
Painkillers.
Yeah... trifle?
I hope that's a 12-inch,
'cause this recipe takes forever.
And I want to hear you... beg!
Mmmm... please, Chloe... i love it when you beg.
Don't just lie there... i want to see wiggling.
Wiggling.
P-please, Chloe... you'll have to do better than that.
Ooohh...!
C-Chloe... please... good!
But it's not good enough.
Chloe...!
Ohhh!!
What was that?
- I'm not stayin'.
- You're stayin', Terry.
You can't make me enjoy myself.
Oi, this is it.
Number thirty.
The lights are still on, ring the bell.
Oh, no... no need.
No!
Dean...!
It'll be all right.
Six weeks without sex.
But that didn't matter, just as long as you stayed king of the pipeline.
Don't tell me... it's going off!
- Dean: Oi... oi!
- Oh, my god!
Who the hell are they?
They're mates from london.
Dean:
Oi, j c!
- Chloe, I grew up with them.
- You never grew up!
He'll be packing his bag!
Told ya!
I'll take them to the caravan and then I'll come straight back.
Don't bother.
What, you're throwing me out?
Oh, yeah, that's mature.
Yeah, go on, walk away!
Now you know how it feels.
You forgot something.
There's... um...
- there's a...
- there's a what, Josh?
There's a strawberry sticking out of your shirt.
You can't beat this cornish cream, can you?
So, what... you kidnapped him?
Well, it's the only way we could get him away from his tv.
- Why couldn't we stay at her place?
- Well, 'cause his bird freaked.
She didn't freak, dean.
She was a bit surprised... with the "apocalypse now" fireworks display.
I need a place to sleep or I'm gonna get a migraine.
I've got a much better place,
Terry.
You're gonna love it.
Oh, god!
The property boom just sort of passed you by, didn't it, j c?
Bastards! You kidnap me, then you expect me to sleep in this tin can with my sinuses!
It's a lot bigger than it looks on the inside, ter. I promise.
It's a bit like... you know, like the tardis.
I can't sleep here!
One life! No fear!
Why did we ever split up, man?
- Our musical differences.
- Musical inabilities.
I can't believe slim used to play the drums.
Whatever happened to him?
Running that pub. Thinks it'll fall down if he leaves it for ten minutes.
And now he's getting married.
Well, he has to, hasn't he?
Fit in with his timetable.
"I'm nearly thirty, time to get married."
Well, you're as young as you feel, right?
- You got any more coat hangers?
- What?
How many clothes do you need, Josh?
We don't all want to look like an agricultural laborer.
So, what's the problem with your bird?
No problem, dean.
Just try calling next time.
I thought you called.
Why do you always have to make a meal out of everything?
We're here, aren't we?
Here... have a beer.
Remember the first time we came down?
Yeah... just finished school.
You nicked your dad's van.
You stood up first time... total natural.
Now you're off 'round the world.
You've got it sussed, guy.
Yeah. One life... no fear.
Yeah, live for today!
...smuggler fm.
Now, it's time to join young bob, who's at the county livestock show.
Bob:
I am, Gordon... and one of the farmers has just told me to expect rain...
'cause all his heifers are lying down.
Well, the forecast is sunny with cloudy spells.
His cows are lying down.
My old mum used to swear by thistle dew.
I remember an old boy saying to me,
"frog spawn's best way of telling."
Well, I'm sure our listeners will want to...
Terry's done a runner!
What?
He won't get far, man.
So, he took the bike.
He has to go west.
Well, it's the only way out of here.
Problem is, though, it's gone half seven.
It's milking time.
So... he doubles back, you see, and takes the path to the left.
Now, he... he could go right, but that's uphill.
Terry's a fat git... so he takes the path of least resistance.
Downhill all the way.
Now, you see, he realizes there's no turning back... there's no stopping.
Which means I reckon he's gonna end up... right here.
Right, since it's nearly eight o'clock and the tide's coming in... he's gonna be cut off.
There's only one road in... one road out... we can't miss him.
- Morning, Terry.
- Morning, Terry. You're up early.
Bastards!
Well, it's not exactly, er... california, is it?
Where's the sand?
There isn't any sand, Terry.
It's reef.
Goes all the way out to sea.
You've just fallen onto the best break in england, Terry.
Excellent... snap.
Looks flat to me.
JC:
It takes a massive storm to set it off.
The swell... it rushes in... then, smacks against the rock... and, boom!
Biggest waves you've ever seen, man.
You see, the wave... it sucks up all the water... so you miss your take-off... it's gonna slam you straight into the slab.
We call it,
"the boneyard."
The boneyard?
If I don't eat soon,
I'm gonna get a migraine.
Twelve foot.
All time classic wave.
Twelve foot?
Wow... that's... big.
I sense doubt.
No, no, no... if you say it was twelve foot, then it was twelve foot.
Is there a system for measuring waves... like a pythagoras triangle thing or something...
'cause you were pretty specific about twelve foot.
- It was twelve foot, all right?
- Yeah, twelve foot.
- All right.
- That's, er... 3.6 meters.
- Hi, man.
- All right, essex?
- All right, man?
- How are you doing?
- Good, yeah.
- How are you? All right?
You're really a face, j c.
Hm...? Oh, yeah. Just... just remember i live here, all right?
What, you think we're gonna embarrass you?
No. Just don't ask for any beach boys records... and don't try using any surf-speak.
All right?
- Flat, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Can you just... sit down, dean?
Sit down, take a look at a menu.
I've just gotta go and sort some business out, all right?
Crab... what are you doing?
Chloe had to nip out.
Man:
Oi, Crab, where's my food?
That's my pinny.
Have you seen this?
"A little bird tells me, record producer Josh tambini... seems to have scored another hit with supermodel carla.
Let's hope his next hit doesn't come from her heavyweight boxer husband."
I mean, where do they get these stories?
Another one for your mum's scrapbook, Josh.
Everything's a joke, isn't it, dean?
No, it's shocking.
- It's true, though, isn't it?
- That's not the point.
So... who are the grommets?
Oh, they're... friends from london.
They're cool.
Dean:
Yeah, mike?
Good piece, wasn't it?
Help with our arrangement?
Listen, dean... what you've given me is tittle tattle.
Now, you wanna work for me, i want something big.
Something life or death.
Do you know what I mean?
- Well, I'll work on it.
- Well, good.
Yeah, all right. Bye.
I'm telling you, Terry... it's no "happy ever after" fairy tale.
Yeah, I know.
Your marriage didn't work out.
Exactly.
Just because men and women's genitalia happen to fit together... we think we're supposed to spend the rest of our lives together.
You know what marriage is?
De-sign... fault.
It's not like that.
Well, what do you and sarah have in common?
We watch tv.
Yeah, apart from watching tv?
- Watch videos.
- What do you talk about?
- Well...
- apart from tv... and videos.
Hm?
De-sign... fault.
Do you really think a screwdriver's gonna make everything all right?
Well, you see, this isn't any old screwdriver you see, Chloe... this actually is the king of screwdrivers.
Shall I tell you what's so tremendous about this multi-speed beast?
It's battery operated, which means you can use it... anywhere in the world.
I'm not going around the world.
What?
I'm sorry about last night, but it's ridiculous.
I'm buying this place.
You what?
This dump?
- They're selling it tomorrow.
- Twenty-four hours and counting.
- How are you gonna buy it?
- Thought I might try money.
Well, you can forget about the airline tickets, for a start.
I mean, they're non-refundable.
It says on them, "non-refundable."
- Then, take a friend.
- Oi, oi... surf's up!
Dean, dean... go away, go away!
Chloe... just... slow down.
Yeah, let's just... think about this.
I mean, it's... a bit like the bathroom.
You wake up in the morning, you have this brilliant idea... tear everything down... and then you lose interest.
Are you telling me i don't know what I'm doing?
Chloe, you are wonderful.
You're beautiful.
But, yeah, you don't know what you're doing.
Are you telling a woman with a pan of burning fat in her hand that she doesn't know what she's doing?
Yeah, all right... all right... yeah, right.
You know what'd happen if you did buy it, don't you?
What?
- You'd end up like Terry.
- Who's Terry?
- Terry's done a runner.
- Josh... in a minute, man.
- We need you now, j c.
- Josh, in a minute.
- Who's Terry?
- We'll talk about it later.
There is no later.
We're finished!
She just gets these crazy ideas.
I can talk her out of it.
Take some advice... worst thing you could do is go running after her.
What, you reckon?
Absolutely.
Just play it cool.
Wait for her to see sense.
Yeah, I mean, she's got no money.
What's she gonna do?
Yeah.
Sarah?
Sorry... i know, sorry.
At j c's in cornwall.
Oi, it wasn't my idea.
Listen, did you... what, you think I'm not worried about my sinuses?
Listen... did you tape
"arthur's knights"?
Hello? Hello?
The phones aren't too reliable down here.
I know you all think it's stupid, but I've got a wedding to arrange.
I've got responsibilities.
I've got people counting on me.
And I'm not gonna let them down.
Now... you say what you like... but I'm getting the next train out of here.
All right, Terry, if that's the way you want it.
That... is the way I want it.
Do you know what time the next train is?
Let's see.
That would be...
- Tuesday.
- Two days?!
It's a small town.
We're out of season.
Bastards!
Oh, come on, Terry. What can't you arrange on the phone?
- Josh, lend him you're mobile.
- You know how much the calls cost?
That's all right, he can use mine.
Nice model.
Now, I don't know about you lot... but I could use some blue juice.
Oh, yes!
Hello... hello?
Push the button, Terry.
Push the button, Terry!
Hello?
Where the hell are we going?
It's a short cut.
When you say the napkins are "prune"... are they more red, or purple?
No, saying they're more
"snapdragon" doesn't help.
Right, we're gonna start off over there.
- JC, the breaks are over there.
- These do keep things dry, don't they?
But you've got to start off slowly, man.
You've got to treat the sea with a bit of respect... dean, are you listening?
Dean!
I saw a turd!
- It wasn't a turd, Terry.
- What was it, a round brown fish?
All right, mate.
This wave's yours. Ready?
Remember what I said.
All the way in. Go, go, go.
Go, Terry!
All the way in!
Go on, ter!
What's happening?
Starting to pick up.
But nothing for a big wave rider like you.
Well, there's a storm coming, might set the boneyard off.
- You going out there?
- Well, you never know.
Some stupid townie tried it once.
He never came up.
What, he killed himself?
JC's the only one who's done it.
That's why he's a legend.
My wave!
Out of the way, out of the way!
Comin' through!
Piece of piss, this surfing!
You're not going in?
No.
Bury me anywhere... but don't bury me at sea.
My head hurts.
Oh, I've got just the pill for you, Terry.
Now, this... will make you feel much better.
Sorry about you and Chloe, man.
It's all right, man.
It's cool. It's nothing.
If you're going around the world, do you mind if I have a crack at her?
- We thought we'd do a collection.
- A collection for what?
- To help her buy the lease.
- She's not buying the lease.
She's coming 'round the world with me, all right?
Radio:
Now here's a fascinating letter... from one of our farmer listeners, dan.
Seems he found a way to farm at night.
- How's he go about that, then?
- So simple, it's brilliant.
Lights... massive industrial lights.
Simple as milking a cow, eh?
Just take a look at the productivity levels of his root vegetable crops.
Parsnips up, 32 percent, turnips, 37.
And carrots... a whopping 45.
Look, I live here.
I can't afford to rip people off.
It's good gear.
All right.
Sweet.
Cheers, guys.
Listen, Josh... i am not chasing after Chloe, all right?
I've just got to see a man about a board.
You can try and show Terry a good time, can't you?
Yeah... i suppose so.
- I know what I want to do.
- You name it, ter. Anything, man.
I want the biggest cornish cream tea you've ever seen.
Livin' on the edge, Terry.
If everything was in harmony... do you think I could levitate?
Save it for the tourists, shape.
JC, there's something i want to tell you.
Something a wise man once said.
"A man who chases fairy tales... might miss his own happy ending."
- Was this is in india?
- King's cross station.
But enlightenment often comes out of the mouths of fools.
Yeah, well...
I've got it all under control, man.
You know, all this staying in... all this saving to go around the world?
I've forgotten what it's all about.
We had our first date on this bike.
You were just kids, then.
I'm still young at heart.
And Chloe is, too.
Just gotta remind her.
Well, find harmony... and maybe I'll get to fly.
You just mind out for all those pigs coming into land, shape.
JC?
Yeah?
It's coming.
Course it is, shape.
What a broken down old wreck.
Where are you going, j c?
Oh, I'm just going down to the machine.
Started body surfing?
Hmm?
No board.
No, no... I'm just gonna go and meet the boys down there.
Oh.
We can give him a lift, can't we, Chloe?
- Ready?
- Yeah... er, wait a sec.
All right in the back, there?
No problem... what's with the lights, man?
She's throwing a rave.
To get some money for the lease.
One day the shaper's gonna get these brakes fixed.
If you're gonna do it, Terry, do it in style.
- My treat.
- Oi, oi!
Dean...!
You've given him shit, haven't you?
No, no... that's good "e".
"Good 'e"'?
Relax, will you? I know what I'm doing. I'm a professional.
Dean... lawyers are professionals.
Doctors are professionals.
Drug dealers are not professionals.
Whoo-hoo!
Remember our first date on that bike?
Yeah... remember that?
Mmm... i hated that bike.
You did?
Why do you think the carb was always failing?
If I hadn't busted it, you'd have never gotten rid of it... thinking how cool you looked.
You know what a lease is, don't you, Chloe?
It's a massive weight around your neck.
Good!
I'm tired of drifting.
But you work so hard, you don't have time to party.
And you know what happens when you don't party, don't you?
You get stressed!
It's stress and work, and work and stress.
And before you know it, Chloe, before you know it... you're gonna end up like Terry.
- Who's Terry?
- Terry is boring.
He's boring with a capital "b".
He used to have a life, then he got his pub.
And then... he changed, just like you're gonna change.
Yeah.
Well, maybe it's just you who thinks he's boring.
No way.
You've just got to see him for yourself.
You'll meet him at the rave tonight, Chloe.
Fuck it!
Come on, Terry.
Can you hear music?
Cakes... come and get your cakes, Terry.
- What is that tune?
- Those were the days.
I gotta find out.
Oh, thanks for your help, Josh.
Come on, Terry.
Come on.
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
I like it.
I really do.
Junior.
Call me "junior".
So I get the gig?
I'm sorry. Just not what the kids are into anymore.
"Lonely for you, baby".
Sam dees, 1968.
The label, sss international?
All right?
Does this look like a "mastermind" audition?
What else you got here?
Hey..."time will pass you by".
We used to close the casino with this.
They used to close wigan with "I'm on my way".
Listen, I was there when you were still wetting nappies.
And it finished,
"time will pass you by"...
"I'm on my way", and "long after tonight is over".
Every week, in that order.
- You went to the casino?
- Um-hmm.
Number 497.
Aw, a real stomper... ossie sands' "price of pain".
You know, I sampled this.
You're Josh tambini!
Yeah, but don't go treating me like a superstar or something.
It's no big deal.
- Mike?
- Yes, dean?
Somebody died.
Mike:
Really? Excellent.
I thought you might like that.
This is a life or death situation and we're gonna be there.
Dean, I'm looking at an empty chair.
You pull this off, and you get to sit there.
Yeah. Cheers, mike.
- I'll talk to you later. Bye.
- All right, bye-bye.
Terry... Terry...
Terry!
Sit down.
Bet you're feel a bit... horny, don't you?
Yeah... i do feel... i do feel weird.
All touchy.
That's not "touchy", mate.
That's horny.
Look around.
This place is perfect.
It's full of women whose husbands are on the golf course.
You see anything you fancy?
I'm getting married.
I'm not... that's mary fenton.
What, the actress?
Dean:
Nah...
- maybe... is it? She was, er...
- guinevere in "arthur's knights".
Yeah, monday nights when we were kids. Is it?
It is, it is.
She's a goddess.
She's smiling at you.
You've got to go for it.
I'm getting married.
If you don't, I will.
Guinevere's got a wet chastity belt.
Leave her alone.
Dean:
Well, come on, she's leaving.
Mary!
Come on.
Three top ten hits is no big deal.
I can hardly remember their names.
"Techno holiday",
"techno toyland"... and, "techno techno techno"?
Yeah.
You've got to come tonight, Josh.
I know so many people who'd kill to meet you.
Yeah, well, I'll try, but, er...
I'm kind of tied up.
Well, try hard.
Smuggler fm.
We're going right over to join young bob... who's out on the high seas with the fisher boys.
Yes, so I am. And we're being pitched and tossed from side to side.
The fishermen tell me this is the start of a major swell.
Hey, coming up pretty rough, is it, bob?
- Bob?
- He's throwing up.
Oh... well... I hope that bad weather doesn't head inland... because we've got some event news.
- Yes... do you like to rave?
- By golly, who doesn't?
Get along to whicker point tonight.
You'll not only have a great night out... but you'll be helping a local girl who's trying to buy the world famous aqua shack.
She's only got 24 hours to raise the money... but smuggler fm is right behind her.
Where's Terry?
- It's about time you got back.
- What's that mean, dean?
We come all the way down here... and you're more worried about chasing after some bird.
Chloe is not a "bird".
Dean, we're surfers.
- The word is "babe".
- Oh, yeah, sorry. "babe".
What I've been doing is checking out the best place for us to go tonight.
I've already sorted us.
It's the village hall, man.
I'm talkin' about a rave.
Rave? Oh, yes.
Oh, no.
Guess you're outvoted, Josh.
Anyway, where is Terry?
Oh, he's... he's outside.
I never saw him.
Maybe he caught one.
Oh, no, dean... you haven't!
E, e, e, e, e, e...
Terry!
I love you!
Dean:
Go for it, my son!
I love you, i love you... come here... come here!
Strong swell.
Gonna be big.
Real big.
Maka-hee-kee!
Yes!
Terry:
Oi, oi!
JC:
Terry?
Talk about the stocktaking.
Stocktaking?
Stocktaking.
Talk about... stocktaking.
See if there are any maps back there, will you?
Josh, we don't need a map.
Terry, tell her all about the paperwork.
She wants to hear about the paperwork.
- Headache pill, dean?
- A corset?
This yours, j c?
No... yes, it's mine.
I strained myself surfing.
Just acts like a big bandage.
Because, "you're as young as you feel"... granddad!
Will you fuck off, dean!
Getting sick of you, man.
You fucked Terry up, and you wanna take the piss outta me.
I'm having a laugh.
You're acting like a yob.
There's no sign.
Wait a minute.
If that's not a sign, i don't know what is.
We better follow him.
Oi... i know I'm not supposed to speak, or anything... but, can I just point out that Terry's missing?
Terry!
Terry!
Shit.
- What?
- Shit.
What?!
I've just stepped in cow shit.
What's wrong?
Too old to party?
I don't pretend I'm eighteen.
Wow!
Terry...!
Oh, no... excrement!
Music:
Toe-toe-toe... great lyrics.
It's based on futurist repetitive poetry.
But I wouldn't expect you to understand.
Terry, man...
Terry, get down, man.
- Go for it, ter!
- Thanks a lot, dean.
Dean:
Terry!!
That's Terry?
Chloe... he's not normally like that.
Must be the sea air, huh?
Chloe...!
Seen the weather, man?
It's gonna go off... big time.
Massive.
- Boneyard massive?
- Chloe!
Forget Chloe, man.
This is about the boneyard.
Surf it.
You'll be a hero.
- Leave it, dean!
- Come on, j c...
- you've got to do it.
- Don't gotta do anything.
- Fifteen quid a pill.
- I'll give you 40 for these three.
- Look, it's good gear.
- It's shit.
All right, all right.
I ripped you off... dean...?
What's up, man?
I fucked up.
Didn't you know?
That's what I do.
Dean, the professional fuck-up.
- Come on, man. It's not that bad.
- Isn't it?
Shit... your face...!
Dean...?
You know, it's so easy when you're twenty and you think... everything'll be all right.
And then... everything goes shit, and... there's no one there to help you out.
All you had to do was ask.
You were busy, remember?
The boneyard.
How's surfing the boneyard gonna help?
I sold the story to a paper.
I surfed the boneyard ten years ago.
I was in the best shape of my life, i came that close to killing myself.
But, you could do it, j c, i know you could do it.
You want me to risk my life so you can earn yourself a few quid?
Fuck the money, they're gonna give me a job.
That's all I need, a job.
To get my life sorted.
That bad?
Worse.
Dean... you're such a fuck-up, man.
One life.
What, you'll do it?
- You'll surf the boneyard?
- Yeah.
No fear.
Looks like you've got the best seat in the house.
This is really something, Chloe.
What did you expect?
A game of "pass the parcel", and coco the clown?
- Chloe, i...
- shhh...!
Can you hear it?
Listen... the blowhole.
All right, you first.
Don't lie to the blowhole if you want to stay dry.
Okay, fire away.
You know that wave you're always going on about?
Was it really twelve foot?
Yes, it was!
See? Really was.
Do you really wanna buy the aqua shack?
Yes, I do.
Are we really finished?
Yes, we are.
Won't your friends be missing you?
I wanna be with you, Chloe, not them.
Look, this is gonna sound silly, but...
- silly's good. I can take silly.
- But it's serious.
Serious-silly?
My favorite.
Will you listen to me?
I thought all you cared about was impressing your friends.
I thought that's why you wanted to go 'round the world.
I wanna go 'round the world with you, Chloe, not them.
Then every day can be like this one.
What made you realize?
I was there, j c.
When you told your friends you wouldn't surf the boneyard.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah... just got a twinge.
- You sure?
- Mmm.
JC, it's not going off.
Thanks a lot.
I'm sorry.
That was a stupid thing to say.
It doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter when you're 85.
Now, it matters.
You're just worried.
Worried?
What have I got to be worried about?
You're scared you might hurt yourself.
Scared?
I'm not scared.
Calm down, now.
Relax... everything will look different in the morning.
Are you sure this is the right way?
Absolutely.
Ohh!
- You're beautiful, dean.
- Cheers, Terry.
I'm beautiful.
You're many things, Terry, but beautiful is not one of them.
You're beautiful,
I'm beautiful.
Terry, slow down. This isn't the right way. The caravan's... we're gonna see guinevere.
No, no, no.
Let go, because when they lock you up and throw away the key, i don't still want to be holding your hand.
- I love her.
- It's not love, Terry... it's a massive amount of drugs.
In a couple of hours, they'll wear off, you'll look in the mirror... and you'll have the biggest anxiety attack of your life.
- I love her!
- You're making a mistake!
Guinevere!
I salute you, my brave knight!
I love her!
Ohh, shit...!
I'm going to a youth club.
"Darling, I went to sleep last night.
And when I woke up, i said..."
"you are the dream that woke me up."
"You're the cream in my coffee... a saucer for my cup."
"Whoa, I know, my baby... that I've slept too long."
"And I'm so glad, now... to have you home."
Ladies and gentlemen... let me introduce you to Josh tambini.
Look, what's this about?
It's about soul, Josh.
It's about everything that you've forgotten.
You know this record?
"...the price of pain..." ossie sands,
"price of pain".
Yeah...?
And what did you do with it?
"...pain, pain... hurt me..."
"you want pain?
I'll give you agony."
Look, it's not my fault the market changed.
Blah...!
Terry?
I just give people what they want.
- What's so funny?
- Don't you know?
It's not about money, or clothes, or guest lists.
I know... I know.
Do you?
Oh, my god...!
Woman:
Help!
Sarah:
Terry?
Help...!
Tv:
Where are you, my brave knight?
Where are you?
I'm coming.
Take care.
Need a lift?
No, I think I'll be all right with junior.
Let me tell you something about junior.
She left five minutes ago.
Just how big was it when j c surfed the boneyard?
Fuck-off big.
Well, can we get a bit specific?
I mean, how many
"fuck-offs" to a foot?
Well, a "fuck-off" is about the size of ten "full-ons".
I'd like to do something like this.
Something that makes people respect you.
So do it.
I am workin' on it.
Dean... now is not a good time.
It is always a good time for publicity.
Morning, morning.
What's going on?
Smuggler fm, bringing you the big stories as they happen.
Yeah, but what are you doing here?
Well, you... are the big story.
No... don't get up.
Breakfast in bed for you.
Chloe:
What were you doing?
Oh... just some tourist got his van stuck in a ditch... so I'm go and help him out... and I'll be right back.
Here you are.
Don't move.
Just stay there.
Far enough away?
Just a bit further.
Now, don't feel you need to mention me unless you want to.
Live in five.
Don't worry, boy, just a technical term.
So, a "reef break" means, you fall off, you land on rock.
Is that right?
Yes.
Yes, it is.
Radio on:
Well, it strikes me you're blinkin' mad, j c.
But I guess that's what it takes to surf the boneyard, so... good luck... dude.
Bloody surfers.
Can't string three words together.
Radio:
That j c certainly seems like a young man... out to make a name for himself.
Chloe... you must think i an such an idiot!
Hang on a bit, Chloe, you don't understand.
You just have to play the hero.
Chloe, listen, if I don't do this,
I'm going to let someone down.
Don't try and make a bigger fool of me, j c... just go off around the world, and let me get on with my life.
- You don't mean that.
- It's my life!
You don't mean that!
Go on, you go be mr. Cool in front of your friends... even if it bloody kills you!
Terry:
It's going off!
Better run, j c, i think it's one of your friends.
Chloe...
Chloe!
Chloe!
JC!
Not now, Terry.
Terry:
I've got great news.
Not now, Terry.
I'm not getting married!
Terry, man, how am I gonna get her back?
Forget her.
Go around the world!
What's happened to you, man?
Blue juice, j c, that's what I needed.
I could have wasted my life.
Yeah, but, I mean, what about sarah?
I've got to do what makes me happy, not what other people expect me to do.
One life, no fear.
It's not as easy as that, Terry.
I keep having this dream.
I'm out at the boneyard, and there's this monster wave... and I'm falling, and it's gonna crush me... you wake up, and your heart's pounding, and you think, "oh, my god!"
Yeah, what's it mean?
You're nearly thirty.
Yeah, but... what am I gonna do, Terry?
Whatever makes you happy.
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah!
Smuggler fm.
Skies may have opened, but one of our farmer listeners has phoned to say his heifers are standing up... and he thinks it's gonna be a lovely day.
My mum used to swear by thistle dew.
Hi!
I've been looking all over for you.
- Let me pay.
- I thought you'd got the message.
Yeah, well... i thought you and me, we could... what...?
- You're Josh tambini?
- That's what it says on the card.
Yeah, and that's what it said on the guy's card I served yesterday.
What guy?
About so tall, long hair.
Came here with me?
- Yeah, that's right.
- Dean.
- Listen...
- no, you listen... you ever think when someone's called "junior"... there's a "senior" around?
Like, in this case, the senior's ossie sands?
Sands is your father?
You used his voice, and didn't care what you did with it.
- Yes?!
No, this isn't dean!
What are you on about,
"photographer"? Who is this?
I'm gonna kill him.
Come on, you bastard... outside!
You're dead.
Don't be such a yob.
You stole my credit card.
I borrowed it.
Here, have it back.
Ow!
- You fucked up my marriage!
- I never touched karen!
But you told the papers about me and those twins.
Well, I didn't make you shag them!
No, dean!
Not the stick!
My stick...!
You all right, Josh?
He started it!
What is wrong with you, dean? Hmm?
I mean, you write that crap about Josh... you broke my stick... you fill Terry up with god knows what dodgy drugs... no, they were paracetamol, weren't they?
- Yeah, all right, I fucked up.
- Yeah, man, once too often.
You gave me drugs?
I was tryin' to show you a good time, Terry.
Fuck, if it wasn't for me, we'd never all be here.
Maybe that wouldn't be so bad, dean!
Sorry...?
I want you out of here, man.
What about the boneyard?
That's your problem.
Oh, show Terry a good time, and dean's your man.
Then, things go wrong, and I have to take all the blame?
Well, life's not a bloody fairy tale, j c.
By tonight, dean.
Where am I supposed to go?
I haven't got any money.
Lend us some dosh, Terry.
Hold on, j c.
I need a lift.
Josh...?
You are kidding.
I hear you've been asking where j c lives?
Oh, I'm Terry's fiancee.
Do you know him?
Do I know Terry?
That could be me, Terry.
I could end up a loser like dean.
Nah...
I'm nearly thirty... and what have I got to show for that?
A poxy caravan, a bad back... and two tickets to go around the world.
So, sell 'em to me.
All he wanted to do was get married.
JC's just the opposite.
I said, "wedding" to him once, just to see him squirm.
I'm not kidding.
Sweat... real drops of sweat, on his forehead, and this... hunted look in his eyes.
All the time he was trying to tell me that I hadn't frightened him.
It was Terry's idea, not mine.
Really?
Why do they think all we want to do is settle down?
Are you sure, Terry?
It's two thousand pounds.
No problem.
As long as my loan payments haven't gone through.
- Terry!
- Just kidding.
Mike:
You have a slight problem, do you, dean?
I'm terribly sorry, it must be an awful line... because for one moment i thought you said... you didn't ever want to work in this business again.
Now, listen to me, dean, darling...
I've just driven all the way down from london to this god-forsaken, disease-ridden dump... and I want to see somebody out there surfing!
Look, everyone makes mistakes.
I mean, even your dad made mistakes.
Have you heard his version of "old shep"?
So, what happened to your face?
JC:
I finally get why you want to buy this place.
It's a bit late for that.
- Is it?
- Yep.
Way too late.
I'm not gonna do it, Chloe.
I'm not gonna surf the boneyard, and I'm not gonna go 'round the world.
Aren't you scared of what your friends may say?
The only thing I'm scared of is losing you.
It's easy to say, huh?
I've heard it all before, j c.
I've got an auction to get to.
Listen, the rave money will never be enough.
- Well, it's all I've got.
- No, it's not.
I'm selling the tickets to Terry.
As soon as he gives me the money...
I'm gonna go straight to the auction.
I can't believe you anymore.
Do you know where Terry is?
He'll be back soon.
Have a seat.
It's really blowing.
Oh, yeah... gonna be some big waves, massive.
So, which one are you?
Oh, did Terry tell you about us?
What did he say?
He said j c was a brilliant surfer, but I know you're not him.
Josh was this really big record producer... go on.
And dean... i can take it.
He said you had lots of unfulfilled potential.
Did he?
That's a very nice way of saying,
I'm a never done anything fuck-up yob.
- He didn't say that.
- Well, he should have done.
You gonna be all right on your own?
Only I've gotta go and fulfill that potential.
Dean?
Terry's not... with another woman, is he?
Nah... all he does is talk about you.
Hello?
Sorry?
He said, "if you look out of the window... you'll see king arthur has returned, mrs. Fenton."
- Guinevere!
- Oh, my god.
Guinevere, I... just hold it with the "guinevere" shit.
You think I'm mary fenton, don't you?
Well, it's not the first time.
I might look like her, but I'm not
- her.
So you might as well just clear off...
- lancelot.
- I'm supposed to be arthur.
Whoever.
Sorry.
So, what were we gonna do if I had been her?
Ride off 'round the world?
Fly, actually.
Go on.
Giddy-up.
- I'm looking for j c.
- Sorry, I'm waiting for Terry.
You don't know if he said anything about surfing the boneyard?
That's where dean's gone to surf.
- You mean, j c?
- No, dean.
Come on, we gotta go and find j c.
Man:
It's getting worse.
Where's j c?
Sarah!
Where's j c?
Bank.
There he is!
You're enjoying this.
You don't enjoy things like this.
Hang on!
Terry... as soon as you've dropped us off... get to the bank, get the money... and get to the auction.
Understand, Terry?
- Yeah.
- I'm counting on you, mate.
The brakes aren't working.
- Stamp on them!
- I am!
Need a lift?
Come on, we've got to get to the bank.
- There's a bike in the back.
- Oh, no!
Man:
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen... can I ask you all to please take your seats?
I'd like to welcome you here on behalf of foster and davis... for this afternoon's auction.
I'm going to explain to you to begin with... stop the car.
What?
Stop the car!
There's no time to go to the beach!
Oh, no... that's too much!
How else am I gonna catch him?
What's he talking about?
Cliff hop.
Where are you, j c?
Full fucking on!
No!
What's he gonna do?
Ride it to him, flip 360 off the lip so he doesn't come down on the slab.
Now, listen, you... you get me a couple of chicks to pose with those two... and this... is yours.
There goes twenty years of non-violence.
Terry... are you sure this is the way to the bank?
Whoa!
Where's the sand?
Don't ask!
Excuse me... excuse me, what lot are we on?
Ask him.
- Have you sold the aqua shack yet?
- Yes, we have.
- Who to?
- Miss... no, mr. Toshack.
Shape, this isn't the way to the station.
Scenic route.
Trust me.
I wanted the old one.
The way I see it, Chloe... the aqua shack is wherever we are.
All:
Yeah.
This isn't just gonna be a place for your friends to hang out?
What, this lot?
They're not my friends, they're customers.
Beg.
What... now?
Beg.
I'd do anything.
Pathetic.
I'd run down the street, naked.
Yeah?
At four o'clock in the morning?
No. High noon.
I love you, Chloe.
Radio:
It's another beaut day, in the high eighties at manly beach.
And a listener's phoned to say the sticky buds on his eucalyptus means rain's coming our way.
My mum used to swear by koala droppings.
Terry:
What a beautiful girl.
Isn't she beautiful?
- Maybe one day...
- us?
You all right, Terry?
You look kinda pale.
No... fine, fine.
Come on... surf's up.
Oh, light shines on... how was that?
Ossie, that was beautiful.
Straight into the techno mix.
Do we have to?
Gotta pay the bills.
It's going off!
Come here.
What?
You're gonna miss it.
No, I'm not.
Do you want a board?
You come and see me when the old man's gone.
- You and I can do some business.
- Did you really surf the boneyard?
You know what
"triple overhead" means?
Shaper:
Get on with it!
Harmony.
Camp Hope
Holy Mother, the soul of my father rest gives Romeo Garbollato.
May the tortures of purgatory spared him ... and must be received in the bosom of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
Amen.
- Amen.
Praise the Lord.
Are your things packed up, boy?
- I have your asthma medication.
Yes, I'm almost done.
- Is grandpa in heaven now?
I hope so, sweetheart.
But, every day ... we should count our blessings and say our prayers ... so he can leave purgatory and can go to Heaven.
What is purgatory?
- Tell your sister what purgatory is.
Purgatory is a place where those suffering that sinful dead.
Or who have not atoned for their actions.
I do not understand what he just said.
Thank you, dear.
Neither do I.
Purgatory is like prison.
A place where you go to cleanse his soul ... so we are ready to meet God.
I also have to purgatory?
- Everyone goes there.
No, honey, you're a good girl.
You are God's girl.
In the world outside people want take away from you.
Your right to go to heaven.
Therefore, every day kneel ...
Tommy goes to hell.
- Rose, that's not nice.
It's true. If he needs me to fit if you were to meet ...
I asked him to bed so
He can talk with his girlfriend.
And the community says it's a sin to have a girlfriend.
He does, I swear.
- Shut up, Rose.
Do not say 'shut up' to your sister.
And no cursing, young lady.
It's no sin to a friend to have.
Your brother is just too young.
When can I go to camp?
- If you're older, but now to bed.
I have yet to pack.
I hate you.
Hello, Father Phineas McAllister,
I come to see Daniel Jacobs.
Yes, Father.
Father McAllister is here, for his appointment with Daniel Jacobs.
 Department of Psychiatry
Unit 3 </ i>
Hello, Daniel.
How did it go this week?
Have you eaten?
Daniel?
You can not hide forever for me.
It is now more than six months.
Daniel?
Can you hear me, son?
The next two weeks I am gone.
I go to camp with the kids of the community.
Daniel? May I see?
May I see your book?
Please?
Daniel, listen to me.
There is hope.
I told you several times offered.
Take help of which you are.
I'm doomed, Father.
And you, my priest, have failed.
As you have always failed.
No.
- Yes, you have failed.
You have failed.
You leave no impressions on the world, only scars.
You have failed yourself and your sister betrayed because you do not trust in God.
Are you happy with your life, Father?
Are you proud of your achievements?
I am a servant of the Lord.
Nothing happens on earth without
God's permission?
Nothing.
I hate God.
That you should also.
I read the Old Testament, the book of Tobias.
The devil, Asmodeus, seven killed men's intervention before God ... archangel Rafael and sends Asmodues stop.
Seven men.
That is the will of God.
There is no hope.
There is only the will of God.
Daniel, please.
Your time is over.
And you will see me, after today, no more.
That is the will of God.
It is God's will.
Goodbye, Father.
Daniel?
Did you this, folks?
These extremist, Islamic fascists ...
Using children as a distraction ... to pass military checkpoints light, and then their car bombs.
These are the kind of animals we face.
And it gets worse every day.
Do not ask me, just look ...
Thank you.
Go to hell.
God is a loser.
Welcome
Camp Hope
Okay, we're there.
Come here, I will pray for you.
Jesus, You are our hope.
Please find your way to the heart my son.
Make a man of him, a fighter for your Kingdom.
Keep the Devil and all his demons far away from him ... and protect it for sin of meat.
We ask all this in Your name.
- And, please, Dad, watch over him.
I'll give it to the nurse.
You do not go to jail.
What's going on?
It goes well.
- Just try to have fun.
It is simply camp.
Concentration camp.
They still have the camp party, right?
Maybe one can dance with Melissa.
I love you.
Hello Brother Jack.
John.
Hey, brother, how are you?
It goes well.
How are you, John?
- I've lost all my clients ... tell your friends about us.
- I'm sorry for you.
Thank you, Dad.
Behave you.
-Be good, boys.
We love you, sweetheart.
I'll sit back saddled
Jimmy.
Is that a problem, brother?
It looks as though we bunk areas, Tommy.
There would appear so.
Hallelujah, brother.
- Hallelujah.
Welcome again to serve one year and learning at Camp Hope.
I'm Christian Bonderman,
I am your pastoral service.
Some of you know me already, as a youth leader from home.
Everyone here has high school completed.
Everyone has done volunteer work for young adults.
We all know the rules that we should stick ... but just to be sure.
Signs or symbols of youth culture are not allowed.
Rock music is not allowed, nothing that looks like.
No magazines that are related with youth culture.
Your cell phones, better known hell if phones are strictly prohibited.
When I hear such a popular ring-tone,
I turn your neck.
There are no special boy-girl relationships allowed.
No one-on-one time with someone the female sex, ever.
And you wear a pair of trousers, at any time.
Except during ... swimming, then neat swimwear allowed.
The girls do not worry, be to do the same.
They should wear dresses at all times.
And finally, leave the camp is strictly prohibited.
Violation of these rules leads to expansion of this camp.
Is that clear?
Yes, no food, no fun, no girls.
I get it.
I'm here to help.
And if you live according to those rules ... in the time you're here, bring your closer to the Lord Jesus.
Say Amen.
- Jack ...
To begin with I,
Check all your stuff ... to ensure that we all same thing.
Unity, brothers.
Open your bags and keep them ready for inspection.
James, we start with you.
What do you have on you?
Just off this road.
What have we here?
Let's see.
Why do you need it?
You do not even shave.
It's ...
Wait a minute ...
What is this?
The Haribo factory.
That's nice.
This is not a good start.
- I sometimes get hungry.
Jesus got hungry in the desert, for 40 days and 40 nights.
I'm disappointed. - Sorry.
- I am also sorry for you.
Tommy, what about here?
You read this? From yourself?
- Yes.
That's great. Very good, Tommy.
You would also have to read Dante.
Jack, how about you?
What is this?
- No Spawn nine. Very good.
Look at this.
- It's Angela. Very tasty.
I can not let this hold.
This is a sinful place.
I take this space.
- No, you can not make.
You know what else I can do?
This.
What are you doing?
Are you going to test me?
Pick it up and pray for God's grace.
Pick it up.
Christian, my things are here, if you want to take a look.
Sit down, my brothers and sisters.
This is the day.
Which we are at war, brothers and sisters.
At war with the world.
At war with the body.
And at war with the Devil,
Satan and his dominion.
From all indications show that the end of the day is near.
And make no mistake, the Devil is real.
And what is worse, he knows he lost.
So if a cornered, wounded animal ... will increase and possible strike of you grabbing ... before descending into the pit of fire, forever.
The beast moves.
And what do we know about Satan and his demons?
He rules the world with all its much better than we know.
So he'll imagination against you.
And he'll like that against you.
He will proudly use to trick you and your sharing.
And why are we so blessed, brothers and sisters ... to be here in this camp, at this time, this moment.
The Kingdom of Heaven is yours, if you seize the opportunity.
Do you think not, you are incredible torture your destiny, for all eternity.
Jesus gives us no choice.
So, rise up brothers and sisters.
Arise children of God and take what He offers you.
Help me, Jesus, protect me.
Protect me.
Jesus, protect me.
Protect yourself ...
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, Amen.
Breakfast, morning at seven o'clock, exactly.
Brothers and sisters, go in peace.
You okay?
- Yes.
Has Tommy back candy from the liquor cabinet?
You said that time had been.
Are you okay?
- Yes, why?
I do not know, it looked fierce from net. I was worried about you.
Yes, it was strange.
It's good now.
- You are fortunately not injured.
We need to clean chairs, not socializing with the sisters.
Jimmy, it's good.
- He has an attack.
Jimmy, is this a joke?
Open his mouth.
- Somebody get Christian.
From what the guys tell me ... it was probably a slight clonic seizure.
What is that?
An attack, caused by sudden light and a startle response.
Apparently they wanted a joke with him prosecuting.
We contact with his parents to to see if he already had ... and we take him to the hospital,
Just to be sure.
I'm sorry Jimmy, that I had never imagined.
I'm sorry. It was very stupid of me,
I just wanted to scare him.
You should know better, Tim.
Remember next time to ensure for your brother.
Yes, of course.
Father?
- Yes, Thomas, what can I do for you?
I was hoping we could talk, I have ...
We have time, I seek you on.
Yes, sir. Thanks.
Brothers,
I have our schedule for today.
Immediately after the morning prayer, we divide us into groups.
The distribution is done based of you sleeping.
And after lunch we have recreation time.
The game today 'Stratego Alive'.
Thus, group A
Timothy, Jack, Thomas and Jimmy.
We gather as a group, at the baseball field.
And because Jack thought a sarcasm good way ... the kitchen crew to thank for breakfast this morning ... do you have maid service this evening.
The sin of one affects many.
- The sin of one.
Does anyone have anything that he wants to share?
What about your vows, this summer?
What? Do you have enough time to make them all to discuss?
I have a confession,
I've broken a vow.
I found a CD, a rock album.
I do not know why, but I
Listened to 100 times.
Did you still have it?
- No, I'm wasted.
I noticed the effect on my mind.
- Good.
It is good that you recognize that rock music you can influence.
I mean, before I found the Lord and came to this community ... rock music is me along dangerous roads.
It started with going to concerts ... those concerts were drugs and alcohol.
And people who had sex, without being married.
He wanted that fixed too.
- What did you say?
Nothing.
- I have a question for you.
I understand why your comic
I torn?
Frankly no, but you established a very good explanation.
Is it not clear to you that this comic a part of youth culture?
And it contributes nothing to with to get closer to the Lord.
No, but even if it is ... gives you no right to my personal belongings destroyed.
Jack, if you give in to the temptations of this world ... makes it easier for Satan to find a weakness, a vice ... and then he crushed you.
Why has so much power?
Who gave him that power? God?
- Of course not.
Why does God allow Satan to exist?
Why does He allow us to risk?
Why, if he loves us?
It is because of us. Our sin.
The sin of Adam and Eve.
We have given power to Satan.
It is because of us.
My deceased grandfather last month.
- I know. I'm sorry.
It does not matter.
I just want to know where he is now.
Is he in hell?
He dies?
We suffer in purgatory so we are cleansed of our sins.
Before he died, he told me way to go here ... away from the community, as fast as I could.
He loved me.
Perhaps we should call with your parents there, after this camp.
What he, Christian.
What do you do in this forest?
My name is not a Christian,
I am of the camp.
Yes? The Christian camp?
What's going on?
Take care, Christian.
And remember to whom this forest.
Inbreeding acorns.
- Jack, your language, please.
Tommy, let's hang the flag back.
Well you have one.
Even Judas was popular for a while.
I have joy in my heart.
Where?
- In my heart, in my heart.
Good work. Really.
- How you doing, guys?
Christian, how likely is that we allowed to park in that city?
Zero point zero.
I like corn on the cob good.
It's been years since I went to an amusement park have been.
You hear that, Christian?
Tommy has not been there for years.
The last time was with my grandfather.
- His dead grandfather, Christian.
It's pretty funny because he always said tell my parents we went to mass.
But then we went to Coney Island.
And they still do not know.
Is this the same grandma that you said here far as possible to stay away?
I understand now what impact
He had on your life.
Stop, it goes too far.
- Should it be encouraged? Shame?
I did not say it, it is his grandfather, have a little compassion.
Why are you so negative, Jack?
Maybe
I know what your father's bitter new psyche.
It's not just my father.
All the leaders agreed.
And not just here.
Communities around the world adapt to the new rule.
That is best for the community.
-But misery for us.
Jack, it's ...
- Look over there.
The statue was moved.
The first was to the right.
Scary things are happening here.
Let's go.
The last wish of an important figure is difficult to overcome.
We need guys like Thomas.
We can not let him go.
Protect your.
This happened when my grandmother was with us.
My father's mother.
She was dying.
She had Alzheimer's.
My father spent every night at her rosaries and prayed.
She then became worse,
They spat and cursed.
Such things.
One night he took holy water to sprinkle on her.
Just when he wanted to do ... the phone rang.
He recorded and heard a voice he did not recognize.
It was the voice of a child.
High-pitched, excited.
As if marbles were in his mouth.
And the voice said:
Leave her alone!
My father asked who
I spoke.
There was only one grudgingly sound.
And the voice became even more excited.
She said: "We warn you.
Leave her alone. "
My father hung up the phone.
He blessed the room with holy water.
He sat down and began a Rosary.
And when he did this the phone rang.
I let it ring.
It rang and rang ... until I became frustrated and threw the phone against the wall.
And then it was paused.
And he sat down.
And once he made the sign of a cross ... the phone rang.
I was in my life has never been so scared.
It happened every night.
My father disconnected all phones
Before entering her room.
And once he made the sign of the cross ... the phones were ringing.
All of them.
This went on until she died.
I have felt them earlier.
What?
Brothers, time to get up and serve the Lord.
Let's do it, guys.
The Lord must be served.
I'm excited.
Come, Holy Spirit
Blessed Creator and in our hearts ...
Take all of your retirement
Come with your grace
Heavenly and air ... our hearts heal that you have made our hearts heal that you have made
Brethren, I can not do enough stress.
If your sexuality is not subject the will of God ... can and will be your downfall.
It starts with your imagination ... fantasies that ultimately lead to masturbation.
For you to completely dominate resulting in sexual perversity.
These are serious, reprehensible sins.
You're not welcome
In the Kingdom of Heaven ... if you masturbate, even if only once, without to confess.
Or if you intimate caresses with a sister ... or a brother.
If you're an orgasm is the same as sex before marriage.
Stay on your guard.
Stay chaste.
Your very souls are at stake.
Hi, how are you?
Let us thank God for this delicious meal ... prepared with love.
Give each other hand.
Dear God, thank You for this meal is here.
Thank you for the person who prepared for us.
Bless them for selfless sacrifice they make.
And bless this congregation, this community ...
Now as we celebrate your goodness.
Amen.
Amen.
Father, I ...
- You wanted to see me.
Yes, I wanted to talk ...
Come to the chapel after dinner.
Thomas ...
Come inside.
This is the cup of my blood.
This cup was a gift.
The thirteenth birthday of my initiation.
Come on, hold it.
Stick with it.
It is the divinity.
In your hands hold up the holder of the divine.
The blood of our Lord.
And the altar, God is here manifested.
His flesh, His blood.
Through me, His priest.
It's pretty intense.
- It's a well-chosen word. Intense.
A good word.
How does it feel?
In order to consecrate the Eucharist?
It feels like when shared a secret with you.
A glimpse of the sublime.
Something that we do not fully understand ... but we know that it's bigger than us.
Humbled to be part this piece of magic ... this mystery.
Every day when I do my part in the consecration of the Eucharist ... is new.
Like the first kiss of a couple.
This is the miracle of the priesthood.
It's a wonderful life, Thomas.
Have you ever thought?
- I?
No, I do not think me that she would be admitted.
What is it, Thomas?
You'll think I'm crazy.
- I think not.
I have these dreams ... actually nightmares.
It's like I'm being ... a demon.
This is in your dreams, you say?
But when I wake it's still just me.
It's like my sense loss, Father.
I know of cases of demonic possession.
It's rare but it happens, and it can be frightening.
If this happens again, you come to me immediately.
No matter what time it is, you understand?
Yes, Father.
Bend your head.
Come on, let those two beat.
Do more.
Come, walk like you mean it.
And then, what then?
That's it, come on.
Here.
Come on.
Everything okay?
- Your turn.
It hurts.
I go to the infirmary.
Do you want me to go with you?
- No, I got it.
I go for it, Jimmy.
You can get a little rest.
Here you can be a little sleepy.
But the dance is tonight.
You will be there.
Rest now first.
Lord Jesus, bless this child.
Heal him, Lord.
Welcome to the dance.
Brothers and sisters, tonight will you are so happy because ...
Tonight we
The folk dance.
Shortest to longest. We put David's here, and Goliath's there.
Jack, put your shirt into your pants.
Jack, come on.
This will be great.
Where's Tommy?
He came to the ward.
Folk dance evening.
Smile.
Do you like the Folk?
I know you love.
Tommy ...
Give everything!
Where were you?
I had another asthma attack and I fell asleep.
Is it going?
I missed you.
It looks like you have a good time.
I would do anything for me you have fun.
Lets make a deal.
Tonight.
How?
Come to me.
Jack lets your alibi.
Are you crazy? You know what happens when we are caught?
I know.
I do not care.
I want to see.
Come to me.
Okay, at half past eleven.
See you at the stables.
What are you doing here in the dark?
We were talking.
He was sick and ...
Just go back to your cabin.
You're acting like a tramp.
Excuse me?
- A whore.
You're acting like a whore here in the pitch dark, with a young man.
People will think you
're a whore.
Good night, Melissa.
I am extremely disappointed in you, Thomas.
I thought I would not make it.
A few judges were on the balcony and blocked the road.
I thought the horses would betray me.
Where's Tommy?
I think the nurse.
Have asthma, you know.
FYI, Jesus is your savior, not your friend.
Funny. How would the Inquisition you, Christian?
My father told your parents about thought of leaving this place.
Is it true?
How do these rumors as soon as the round?
Oddly, this community, with all her dedication, gossips more ... than people in a supermarket.
So it is true?
Yes, I mean, they just think about it.
Let's sit down.
But why?
Nobody knows this but,
My father is in the AA.
Really?
Before his conversion
He was a real alcoholic.
My parents were so almost divorced.
I did not, sorry.
With this new rule they've ordered not to go ... and my mom would not.
But if you leave ...
- I know how it is when someone leaves.
How they are treated.
It means that my parents lost in this world.
The flesh and the devil.
And how will their slutty daughter perish?
I can not believe he called you so.
Neither do I.
Why did you say anything then?
By Father Phineas?
Are you crazy?
No, not if you believe that he was wrong.
It was so wrong to me so to speak.
I know, I had something to say.
Sorry, Mel.
Remember how much fun it was?
When we were kids?
There were prayer meetings, followed by picnics that lasted and lasted.
We had so much fun.
It was fantastic.
I met you for the first time in such a picnic.
You were eight or nine years.
Something?
Yes, I think eight.
You were so cute.
You always had such an effect on me.
Oh God, Mel.
Oh God, Mel.
Tommy ...
Stay with me.
Stay with me.
Father miserable ...
You failed.
As you've always failed.
Time's up.
God is with me.
I can not believe this happened.
Neither do I.
Are you ...
What?
Sticky.
We have this summer barely touched each other.
It was intense.
Did you hear that?
- Yes.
We can not caught in this way.
Stay here, stay.
I can not believe we just did.
Say this to anyone.
Tommy, I have no regrets.
Please, do not it feels bad.
I give a lot to you.
I will not tell anyone.
I can not even imagine
I would say to them.
I'll wait here a few minutes and then I follow you.
I do not want them coming home to see us together.
That is a bad girl.
That is a bad girl.
That is a bad girl.
Why are not you with your campers?
Because someone is missing.
Who?
Thomas Leary.
- Come on.
This is the path.
This is the path.
Sister, what happens?
I get nothing but tatters.
They have the same nightmare.
- Father, what happened?
Sisters, keep the peace.
Be calm, nothing will happen.
Father, protect these Sisters.
Take all the bad thoughts away.
All fear of the enemy.
Melissa, why are you still dressed?
Tommy?
Tommy?
Tommy, stop.
- Stay here.
My God.
Okay?
The inhaler.
- Where is he?
In the infirmary.
- I'll get him.
Carol, is he okay?
He is better. He was afraid.
Asthma can be very frightening.
Yes, it is.
I must see him.
Sure, but he is very weak and can not speak.
The drugs must do their job.
Can not this wait until tomorrow?
I do not see why not.
Thanks for your help tonight.
God bless you.
I will stay here with him and go pray for him.
Then I'm gone.
Good night.
Good night, Father.
Do not speak, Thomas.
If you're better tomorrow we should talk.
I know you're not responsible are for the desecration of the chapel ... but there are certain things happened tonight.
You know what I speak.
You will tell me.
Got it?
This is my body that you will be sacrificed.
He took the cup, saying 'Thank You'.
He handed the cup to his disciples and said ...
This is the cup of my blood.
The blood of the New and everlasting covenant.
Do this in memory of me.
This is Melissa. I received it via one of the girls from her cabin.
Gotta go, the mass begins.
Are you okay? What happened?
Everything is fine.
I'm going to shower.
We'll talk later on.
Yes, I'll tell it later.
Can I read?
- No.
Goodbye.
Tommy, if you're ready ... and if you can, come back to me.
What were you doing outside your cabin tonight?
- I was sick, I had asthma.
I know but there was a girl not in her cabin last night.
Were you with her?
Who?
- Do not play games with me.
I do not know what you have it, Father.
All right.
What were you doing in the chapel tonight?
I saw it, Father.
- What did you see?
The demon.
When did you first felt?
I do not know, it started after my grandfather died.
Is this the grandfather you brought to amusement parks ... instead of going to church?
Yes.
Were you good friends?
- Very good friends.
My condolences at the loss.
Am I crazy, Father?
I've seen this before.
And what happened to him?
Where is he?
He stays in a mental institution.
He tried to commit suicide and his sister to murder.
Why would God allow this?
God can not be questioned our weak minds.
And this is God's will?
Nothing on this earth is done without
God's permission.
He tests us within our own borders.
He gives us the resources, sacraments and the grace to fight enemies.
Because the enemy is cruel.
But you choose whether you accept what he offers.
I can help, but then
You listen and do what I say.
I do what is necessary.
Here, sit down.
- Yes.
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned.
When was the last confession?
A few months back.
- Go on.
After my last confession, I lied.
I've lied to my parents.
- And the sins of the flesh?
Yes, Father.
I have impure thoughts.
- You masturbate?
Yes, Father.
- How often?
So every day.
I do not know.
You invite the Devil in your imagination.
Every time you masturbate you open a door.
Do you understand?
- Yes.
And Melissa?
Were you with her?
You can not honestly confess if you suppresses a sin that you know ... thus reach forgiveness.
So, were you with her?
Yes.
- This is a serious offense.
Got her a sin?
A kiss, that's all.
She is a good person.
Are you sure, others not?
Sin remains if you do not confess.
I know.
Good. If you take more punishment not participate in the camp.
The remaining time you spend here to pray and serve ... and I have to tell your parents what you did.
But as you said in this a confession ...
I must ask your permission.
Can I tell them?
- Rather not.
Thomas, none of this will easy, nothing.
You're disgusting.
Do you have any idea about the shame
You've caused me ... in my name, your mother? Well?
I'm sorry.
- That means nothing. Just empty words.
You sorry means nothing, these are empty words.
Empty words.
Listen now to the Father.
You must change, otherwise ...
Stand up for God.
Your mother wants to talk to you.
I'm here.
- What did you do?
Mom?
- Yes?
Mom, please ...
Tommy ...
- Enough.
Try not to get sympathy.
That you will not find here.
None.
You did this.
Listen to the Father.
Be a man or you will not come home.
No Hope For You
I'm so sorry.
I've got my glove needed.
- What is happening, friend?
Nothing.
Maybe I'll sneak into the park
During the stage tonight.
I love the cream waffles and they have a crazy rollercoaster.
Go you, "Padawan?
- I'm grounded.
Really? What?
I am caught.
- By Melissa?
Was Father Falic evil?
Yes, you could say.
- Damn.
It's not fair.
- What?
Only if it is against the rules.
- Calm down.
Are you okay?
Pray for me, Jack.
Can I help you, officer?
Is this one of your campers?
- Yes, what happened?
He came into contact with a pair of our local young people at the park.
A few elements of our poorer.
They've beaten him properly of what I understand.
He was lucky.
A good Samaritan intervened.
He caught some of those guys, and she quite frightened.
One of them known vandalism.
Agents are looking for the stolen stuff.
That's good news.
We made our concerns. One child his age, outside unattended.
We called his parents and who told him to bring back here.
Thank you so much.
Help me with the latter.
I'll let you go for tonight.
It'll be fine.
She put me and marked me with this clip.
- What happened?
Inbreeding which figures you encountered in the forest.
Who jumped me in the park and beat me up.
Now you know why we have rules that we use.
Those idiots had earlier problems experienced one of the brothers ...
In a restaurant one year ago.
They wait for us until we came back ... because their parents said they would go to hell.
There will be nothing much to do here.
- You should be happy ... the fact that you could sacrifice yourself for your brothers and sisters.
Are you kidding?
I do not care about them.
How can you say that?
After all we have done for you.
What have you done for me?
You turned my back on family and made my father a sort of medicine?
For years, demanded the leaders of these community, his father, my father ...
That's not fair.
- Fewer people outside the community helped.
So he had more time for the brothers and sisters.
But when you decided to go brainwash.
What are we now?
What should my family now?
Jack, you're going too far.
- Shut up, Christian!
Should I listen to you?
Are you my example?
A 23-year-old follower who does everything what he said.
You have no fucking idea of yourself.
Look at yourself, look at your nails.
Come on, show them.
You bite it like a little girl.
You allow yourself as influenced by their use ...
Chris, stop it.
Jack, stop.
What are you doing?
Okay?
Get out of here.
Go away.
You belong here.
- Since you're absolutely right.
What time is it?
- No idea, about two hours.
I'm outta here.
What? How?
My father is here, my parents ...
I think we are tired of this camp.
Really?
Shut up there.
You come through here.
Is it right?
- Yeah, right.
They can beat me down but I come just back stronger than before.
Take care of yourself.
See you on the other side.
Yes.
The world is us, use our pride, our greed ... secular humanism is his church.
And the flesh is weak for us ... lustful temptations.
But the Devil uses both our brains to attack.
The devil knows our psyche, and how it works, better than we do.
He uses the weakness of our brains, for us to drive to anger ... to fear, to despair.
John of the Cross ... was often oppressed by the Devil.
And in his dark night, he discusses the tortures of the devil.
This is what he says ...
If the spiritual communication is not fully provided to the mind ... but also on the senses ... then the easier the Devil mind disrupt and irritate ...
Terrors by the senses.
The pain and anguish it causes are enormous.
And sometimes impossible.
Since direct transfer takes place between mind and spirit ...
The evil spirit causes a horror in the right spirit ... sometimes for the good spirit intolerable.
Holy Mary, Mother of God pray for us sinners ... now and in the hour of death.
Amen.
Father?
Thomas ...
I came here looking for you.
Are you free from sin?
Yes, Father.
No more masturbated?
No.
Wonderful, you are a sincere and faithful servant.
I'm proud of what you have achieved.
Thank you, sir.
Go back to the prayer,
See you later.
Hail Mary, full of grace,
The Lord is with You ..
You are blessed among women.
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Hail Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners ... now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.
Hail Mary, full of grace,
The Lord is with You .. blessed is the fruit of thy womb ...
I'll get it.
- Wait for me, Rose.
And Dr. Jack. John there.
- Thank you, sweetheart.
Hi, John.
- Patricia.
Jack, what happened to your face?
Why are not you at camp?
My son has something that you need to hear.
When Tommy first told that
I thought he was crazy.
I do not always agree with community ... but I still believe in God and the Devil.
What do you mean, Jack?
Jack, wait for me in the car,
Please.
Tommy is my best friend and
I'm really worried about him.
You must first listen to me, Michael.
I've seen this before.
Phineas is a good father and husband done a lot for the community, but ...
I fear that he is here to participate faces.
I know you have problems with the leaders at this point ...
Michael ...
- But it suggests ...
Please let him speak.
There was a boy, Daniel, an altar boy for Father Phineas.
He looked a lot like Tommy.
But the boy had problems, serious problems.
Phineas father sent him to me ... because the boy claimed he chased by a devil.
Our brains can be amazing things.
But what I saw was this guy ... it was something I never want to see.
Then I knew that the torment of Daniel ... far more psychological than anything, it had to be spiritual.
So when working with Father Phineas the spiritual part and I helped him greatly.
The way he took care of Daniel, how he focused on debt ... sin, but only gave the demon more power.
More control.
- What happened to the boy, Daniel?
Your Tommy is a good boy and he has both of you.
What happened to Daniel ...
- Just tell us.
One night, he shut himself and his little sister ... that was not older than Rose, in the bathroom of their home.
He cut her wrists and then ... their own.
And only by some miracle,
They were found on time.
That never forgive myself.
And the church?
The church could do nothing?
No ghost exorcism?
She did not.
Daniel was suppressed.
He was not possessed.
The church has very specific definitions for possession.
Certain criteria for Eviction to take place.
Daniel did not meet these criteria ...
So he was left to the care
Father of Phineas and me.
And we failed.
What does this have to do with my son,
John?
I fear that the same demon success wishes to obtain, such as Daniel ... the same strategy to for Tommy.
Father Phineas and he found an unwitting accomplice.
Open the door.
Rose.
Rose.
Honey.
What is it, honey?
It is good ...
It's OK ...
Brethren, I know that the last day, in this camp have been difficult.
It is now clear that the Evil his work is doing in our lives.
Tonight we will fight against him.
Tonight we will expel him.
Let us pray for one another.
Choose a brother and ask him to pray for you.
Lord, banish Satan the name of Jesus.
Dispel Satan in the name of Jesus.
Pray for me, Tommy.
Pray that I will be strong ... let me holy.
We drive out Satan in the name of Jesus.
We drive out Satan in the name of Jesus.
We drive out Satan in the name of Jesus.
No, stop.
Tim, what is it?
- Make it stop. No, stop.
Timothy, what is it?
- God, what is that smell?
I saw the Devil, a demon ...
I do not know what I saw.
It was so real.
A prediction of the Lord.
Fear not my children, for I am with you.
I make sure nothing happens to you.
I love you.
But evil has no ...
What happens?
Stop.
- I hate ... you.
What was that?
What happened?
What happened?
- I do not know ...
Go to my room.
Now.
Calm down. I'll protect you.
Why did you not tell me?
Father, I lied.
You gave us all at risk.
You go with your sin, without taking account of the Devil.
But he keeps in mind.
He does.
I wanted to hurt anyone.
I blame myself.
- Confession.
What happened to you and Melissa in the woods?
You did not tell me the truth.
What happened?
Have you had sex with her?
- No, Father.
Tell me.
We gave each other an orgasm with our clothes on. That's all.
That's it?
You accept a sin in your life.
You ... devils spawn.
James teeth are broken.
Timothy is in his own feces.
Daniel is in a lunatic asylum.
And all those roads lead back to you.
Tell me now, when ...
If you had to sin in your life?
Was it your grandfather?
- No.
He put the door?
- No, he was a good man.
He gave you to the devil.
- He loved me.
I love you.
Tommy, stop.
Calm down.
Where is Father?
Where ...
It must be so.
You promised to protect me.
Protect me.
Be my servant.
Tommy ...
Help me.
A sinner.
I do not want.
Enough.
Can you hear me?
Tommy?
You hear me, Tommy?
There you are.
Where?
Do not talk.
You're in the hospital.
You had a severe asthma attack ...
We were almost lost.
Where is Father Phineas?
- He is also here.
He had a stroke, he ...
How are you?
You got me scared.
You look good.
Father is here, I found it on in the hall, he makes his rounds.
Would you thank him the blessing?
- Of course.
The body of Christ.
Tommy?
Tommy, get it, son.
- No.
Maybe I should ...
- No, Father.
Please.
Your son has been through a lot tonight.
Maybe it's better him alone order.
It's okay.
I want to anymore, Mom.
If it is really the body of Christ ... it is too much to suggest.
And if not, it's all a big lie.
I can not believe Mom.
I can not and will not.
I can go to your school, and I can follow your rules, but ...
You can not make me believe.
It's too terrible.
I need them redeemed.
My God ...
Enough.
Sweetheart ...
Enough.
We can not pull the plug.
God can heal him.
See you soon.
Based on a true story.
Stay away!
What's going on here, hell!
Drop the gun! Now!
Drop the gun!
Vanguard here first

- The doctor Miller.
It is our healer.
Recently, we lost contact with our patrol.
Base they were here,
Meyer on the island...
... 35 miles to the west.
This island has become a primary testiralište Altracorpa.
What is tested?
Their camp is located here communications are disrupted.
The whole area the no-fly zone...
... And radio links are blurred, in the best case.
The island is covered with a thick layer lišæa...
... But there's almost no animals.
Our mission is search and rescue.
ProèešIjati island and find those missing.
If that fails, the task is to pick up any info...
... To explain what happened.

I wish we go survive.
Because you are there.
But the mission comes first.
Mr. Kane will provide transportation to and from the island.
Others know.
Kreæemo at dawn, because a good night's sleep.
Hello, Miss!
No way we're not there to finish the conversation.
Not now, I'm going to bed.
Wait, wait now.

Want to see?

We remain in communication.
Here you go... When you should be.
What is it?
Why do you expect tribal drums now?
- Do not touch!
- It looks fresh.
- 2, maybe 3 days old.
- Is it oil?
Better question is...
Who is this done?
These are the scarecrows.
And already something of intimidation.
This is a warning.
- What would the "no animals"?
- The birds are coming through the wind.
Looks like organic decay, but I have never seen anything like this.
When you put things can do a few tests.
- It's not a bird, Ray.
- Alena, stay here.
Help Dr Miller on everything.
- So you go back?
- Yes, before it gets dark.
Your boss has my number.
Well, I guess I'll see you when I see you.
Yes...
I hope you'll find your team.

What's wrong with him?
MIEE... just calm down.
We have come to the rescue...
- We must go! There it is!
- Do not move.
Here is...
Everywhere!
We have to leave the island.
MIEE, what is it there?
What happened here?
I killed a lot of birds.
But there were not enough.
It's okay.
With us.
- We need to go to this island.
- It's OK MIEE, we'll go.
But first we must find out what happened.
It is a doctor, can you help.
You're not listening.
Leads me to this island, now!
Vile!
- Blank said.

That's it.
Let's go back to the boat.
We must take him to hospital.
All we want you to know as soon as I calm down.
But now, all you have to take from this island.
You are all my responsibility.
We have not yet found his partner Walsh.
Dead. He's dead.
All dead.
Well... go!
Sophie...
You're not a captain on the island.
This is my mission.
We remain where we are.
You want maybe to vote?
Maybe she's right, Ray.
I can take care of MIEE and here.
Trying to understand...
Well... Sophie... Alene
Take MIEE back to camp.
Rachel and I'll continue searching.
Villas, I'd like to stay.
This is your team, obviously that is not mine.
I'll be on board until you need them.
You'll all die!
- There could preæi trees.
- Line ravens...
You must be joking!
Where is your ship èovece?
Damn, what we do now?
We must find him!
Maybe... maybe in the bay.
We could swim to it.
We will not swim anywhere.
We would not have withstood the twenty minutes in the icy waters.
Well sir!
What is the hell was that thing?
What they did on this island, and what we actually do here?
Well.
Be honest, we stuck here?
Can we use your satellite phone to send a call for help?
Yes, now razmišijaš reasonable.
- Let it switched on.

The no-fly zone are!
No one listens to the conversation has over the radio here.

Altracorpom.
I'm not right back there.
Falls.
- Here we are safe.
- We can go in the morning.
- Završiæemo search...
- Your search is over!
You saw what it did your man.
I am sure that neither his partner did not have much more luck.
There are a lot of important information that we have to pick up. Especially now.
So what do you want to do?
To sit and we wait The boat fishing?
We have a schedule of 48 hrs.
No one would not suspect anything, at least 36 hrs.
See... if we can turn on the transmit...
... Spasilaèki team will come here for about 20 minutes.
When we look at the situation, it seems to me that we do not have much choice.
Still nothing.
Do not.
Says nothing.
Just sitting there.
It may not be manifested kroy inorganic matter.
Sand.
Sand is a dead zone.
Can not preæi beach.
Or water.
Therefore, it is like to Mièel leave the island.
Captured here.
Just like me.
Pretty good, right?
It seems quite complicated for doctor.
Well... I knew exactly what to pack so I packed everything.
Yes, women usually make it.
So...
Clarify me.
Do you know what are they doing here?
Not quite.
Some kind of biological research.
48th Test
Ray is worried that the team neèime infected, so...
Rachel understand...
It is like a razor.
But you, why did you bring?
Jingo!
Just have nice properties.
Yes, that's what I, at least you get what you see.
Maybe you do not like, but at least is honest.
But all of this... And Ray...
I'm not sure.
Add to paranoid traits.
- At least a traitor is not entered in the list.
I? You're wanted to leave us all here!
- "Call me when you need it";
- I was there when I needed you, did I?
Forget it, ma'am... Doctor.
I have not signed up for this shit.
I also dream about the future disappears this family.
Listen Villas, you have to pull together.
This is a profession we have chosen.
You were his superiors.
It was your responsibility.
This is not the first time that I lost a man.
And they will not be the last.
It seems that things gledas's different since you got these lines on the shoulder.
- Published by're Briggs.
- Who brought everyone else!
You were not allowed to bring us into this situation!
We did not have any information, no support...
Watch what you are saying, soldier!
It seems to me that you're happy because you progressed on the list.
Well congratulations... Sergeant.
No matter is that one of your people returns home in the ark.
It could be worse.
I could be your mother's front door.
You can thank me on it.
Do not enter.
Find his own transportation.
Reje!
What happened?
- It was all around him.
- Get away.
Ray, what was it?
I'm really sorry.
We are not even supposed to come here.
There was no possibility to know what's in the woods.
This is not true.
Raymond!
What is it, reje?
What is going on here?
All this is a setup.
Rachel and I work for Altracorp.
At least not anymore.
So what do we do it here reje?
I worked in biological research in Altracorpu, renewable energies.
I am a scientist.
Funding we abolished when they find deeper pockets.
They took my work...
... And use it for things that
I did not want uèestvovati.
Biochemical weapons is much better of the virus.
And is it there?
Some kind of biochemical weapons?
I do not know what it is!
I'm not sure even that Altracorp know.
Something went wrong with their tests there.
Mièel gave me some information recent months.
48th Test
I knew something was wrong.
I had no idea...
- And we're dragged into it!
- I had to get back at MIEE.
You saw why!
See, whatever it is there...
That thing...
... Nesreæni the case.
Consequence of the enterprise in bad faith.
And now you know.
I'm sorry.
And what can we do?
Beach is not safe and do not have no way to defend ourselves.
We need information Mièeve how would we know we are against What for...
... First we need weapons.
If the organic...
... In any way...
... Then he will not appreciate this.
Not at all.
Come on! Accelerate it!
- Do you work?
- I do not know. No antenna.
We do not need. Povezaæemo it with Vilovo satellite phone.
We have it.
Rachel, you and Will you return to the beach.
Run it engine.
Prepare it.
- I want to stay with the radio.
- I need you for the PC.
Stay here.
I found it!
- Do what you need.
- I do.
- What is it?
- Nothing.
Continue to walk.
Let's see if that works.
Goal!
- Find test 48th
- I know, I know...
If you watch this video...
... Test 48, did not go according to plan.
Here, Vanguard 1,
Do not come here.
I repeat:
Do not come!
Mièel.
I suppose you this message never arrived.
Can we go now?
I have to stop.
We must not stop.
We have to move! Come on!
I'll overtake you.
L'll these ice from the refrigerator.
'll Be right back.
Rachel!
What's happening?
Well, if you do that?
It would be good to have the original...
Forget the torch, let's go!
Where are they?
Where the hell!
Rachel! Where is she?
Where is it?
Where the hell?
Something happened to her...
- What happened?
- Is infected!
Let me go!
Hey man,
There was nothing I could do.
Reje is infected.
Some sort of weapon.
Dispersed.
In order... Now we can defend ourselves.
Poèeæu Mièelovim to work on files.
I'll see what I can piece down.
There it is.
Part of the miracle... Somewhere.
Iskoristiæe her to come here.
We must be vigilant.
Do you think it's gonna be okay?
I was guilty of this.
Have you all taken?
Should be sufficient to think to work for Altracop.
Were there any problems with the provision?
Nothing that I could not fix it.
What files?
Did you take them?
Mièel had done his part.
You have a lot of reading ahead.
Go take a shower.
This is...
This is an SOS.
Please check and reply.
Reception.
Wait.
This is a call for help.
Called at intervals.
Just keep an open channel to hear if someone replies.
Be there and listen.
This is an SOS.
Please reply.
Please.
Have you solved the mystery?
Seems to have worked on Altracorp new kind of biological weapons.
On a live weapon.
And this one that destroys all other living creature.
So the goal and the infection spreads Cells like a virus.
The infection is supposed to be reserved isotope which...
... Is similar to that found in raspršivaèu.
Good soldiers can be move freely...
... Bad soldiers, become black and sticky.
- It is obvious that something went wrong.
- Very.
Disease has not only infected Cells, completely took over.
It'll be a living is like hives in which
All Cells are working together...
... This disease is the same principle.
But just as it fulfills its purpose ..
... Which is it?
To infect and destroy?
That is expanding continuously;
That's about it to.
- What kind of doctor are you?
I am a toxicologist.
Specialist I for reverse engineering.
It is pretty specific to the field of for a rescue mission.
And you are in this from the beginning, right?
See, I did not know what happened here.
We have not told you about your safety,
We know you'll stay with us.
And when I saw how you reacted
Rejevu the story last night...
... I just did not want to just think about me.
- And Allen?
- We knew the same as Ray.
To test something Altracorp horrible here.
Something that must be stopped.
These are experiments that are not allowed to continue.
Someone has to take on that responsibility.
See how much it cost.
I tried to protest.
To do something.
But instead I... released.
They did so in order take my research.
... To do this.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this Villa.
But do not blame her.
I am the job.
And God knows that I paid a high price...
... But I have to finish this.
Now more than ever.
I must not let this thing beat.
You know, Captain Ahab said the same thing.
You know how to take care of yourself,
It is pretty and you're good at it, Villas...
... But as you are in a broader perspective?
Did you used to be sacrificed because of little something for what you knew was right?
This is called purpose.
Something you believe.
Something to fight, regardless of price...
... Because you know that this is the right thing to be done.
I believe that we're doing the right thing.
Do you believe that you did the right thing by telling me this information?
Yes, sir.
- But the mission was successful, right?
- Not for my men, sir.
Your people?
You think people sergeant Cutter.
Its mission, his decision.
Whatever the motives that had,
In your mišIjenju...
... Will remain just that.
Your mišIjenje.
Success is measured in this world the two things.
Through perseverance and dedication.
Are you devoted razogu, rows?
Do you think that doing the right thing?
There. We found the reason.
Sergeant Kater has released its people by you sent them...
That's enough!
Faces I have a dilemma soldier.
Your word against your word superior officers.
Yes, Sergeant Kater was already here...
He explained his work...
... And your reckless disregard his orders!
I will not tolerate disloyalty!
Neither the army, nor our purpose.
As of this moment is dismissed, the soldiers.
The decision is effective immediately.
Do not say anything because
What for are you going to repent, my son...
I want to be the Next helicopter here! Do you understand me?
You go... civilian.
What about crows? With coffee?
Completely collapsed.
Dead. In order to reverse the process
I need a live specimen.
I doubt that this thing will want to cooperate.
Maybe a little something to testiralištu we could use.
We must try something.
Rachel is still there.
It is not Rachel.
Now a part of it.
Infected. As Mièel.
But not dead.
Exactly!
If infected, and if the live...
... I might have with the help of her blood could create a serum.
It could work.
Mièel said all the chemical elements...
... And I could use the pollen from raspršivaèa one that you have found.
What do you need from me, reje?
Let us go and we find Rachel.
There is somewhere.
Watching us.
I know. Keep walking.
That's it.
I made a similar device based on their designs.
This is an underground station.
Injects a toxin into the center of the island.
Should we reverse the process if we use the serum.
Then keep scrolling.
There you go. There is no one around to we share with them.
Do you see anything?
Still nothing
Rachel!
Ray will not come.
I have it!
Holds it firmly!
Sorry about that.
Postaviæemo machine drain.
Right back up before dawn.
Call us through this if you manage to make a serum.
I did it! Functions.
- You serious?
- I think.
I used her natural antibodies doskoèim to infect...
... Using a similar chemical mixture that of a gun...
Molecular... irrelevant.
It was successful in small doses.
We need a bigger sample.
Throw it on the enemy and hope that will not expand.
Does not sound like a smart idea brilliant minds.
We plan a way of control.
A similar spray from that weapon.
Soldiers would take a pill, a bookmark...
... Which would then developed resistance the infection.
- How is it changed?
- Everything has changed for the worse.
Ready.
Hurry!
I know... I try!
Rachel?
O God!
What the hell?
What happened?
- This thing...
- How do you feel? Are you okay?
I do not know.
Why am I tied?
- I do not believe it!
- Works!
It's quick, but you returned to normal.
You need water.
Alene, she does it.
- I need to call Ray.
- It is? Thank goodness.
- I'm sure you this is surprising.
- What are you doing?
And now we are alone.
I have to admit Doctor, impressed
I. I did not think you'll succeed.
And now... Give me the rest...
We both know that this is not the whole sample.
You think I'm stupid?
Let's... the tent.
To take it all.
Take...
Or do you want me to ask?
I have other plans, but...
This can be useful.
- You're pushed boat.
- I'm guilty of this.
I could not allow anyone to go here before I finish.
I even saved the life of Rey,
I really needed it to complete its mission.
Why?
I have to finish their testing.
49th Test
Latest invention, the control group.
- Keep them at bay
- You were not in danger.
No.
I was just a good actor.
Now you just need one more thing to do.
Should I put my sample in Rejevu gadget.
He came to my turn to infect.
Sorry for this doctor.
Nothing personally,
All this is just a job.
Is that what you think it is?
Potpredsednièe, I know that your time is valuable...
... Because I'll be brief.
Doctor Raymond Hua I was just contacted in connection with one mission ..
Ray is planning a trip to the island Meyer.
Wants to shake up things a bit.
This is not good for you sir potpredsednièe Vesler?
I want to help, but require protection Altracorpa.
No doubt you want the money.
It would be very nice of you.
May undermine its operation from the inside...
... And can provide you what you want.
What I want to?
49th Test
Allen is a radio set in the dead zone.
He now works.
Someone will soon appear.
In this case, we'll begin.
Thank you.
What for?
No one has saved his life so far.
- And how was it?
- It was very nice!
Here SES 1, we receive a call for help on this channel.
- Here we are!
- Hello!
Here, Dr Sophie Miller.
Can you hear me?
- Loud and clear Dr Miller.
Thank God!
Signal are read your site Alfa 9th
In the forbidden zone are.
Prepare for evacuation.
Arrive in 20 minutes. Reception.
We have them.
Wait! We do not have too much time
To start the test.
Are you kidding? Tell that to the guys when they come.
They will not understand.
We need to do now.
But they come in 20 minutes Ray.
Then do not waste time anymore.
Ray, spasiæe us.
His struggle to carry Altracorpa, to the media...
... Tell them what happened here.
You do not have to take the chance your life...
To take the chance?
Look what I've been lost.
Nothing will not to mean if you do not finish what I started!
What we've begun.
I can not afford to reje they have done.
Stop!
It's your fault...
Do not leave Rachel...
- Is The vial!
- There is something much worse.
Going to testiralište.
But the soldiers come in 15 minutes!
Sophie, wait back here.
The team is coming very quickly.
Go to Allen.
Villas...
... I could use your help.
Yes, it is always the case.
Listen...
Let's go.
This way, we're going.
You end launch and stop Allen.
And you?
I'm going to play around with the locals.
Hey, Roršak!
I'm here!
Run!
It is almost Alene!
Not yet...
It's over!
Not until I tell you!
You should know something about the persistence of Ray.
But one should know when to quit.
Back to work.
Provide the beach!
Faster, faster!
Check the tent!
Tent was empty.
Contact in 12 hours.
Go!
I'm sorry Ray. 're Just late.
What did you do?
Something the release here.
Something much stronger than what they thought...
... And now it's mine!
You can not control it.
Come with me.
Come with me!
I feel better.
What's happening?
I do not know. Come on.
Where the serum?
With Allen.
Run!
My move.
We go from here?
Alfa time,
What's your status?
Command, Alpha team leader here.
Saved as we move back.
Air support may take.
Again, air support can go!
Alfa understand, start with Clay.
Air support is coming.
The boat enters the!
All you all right?
Here they are!
We still have not finished here.
Where is Sophie?
I told you.
Good. Very well.
Talk with her...
Same as with you.
Story?
Does this so called?
Tell me again why I can not let from here? Why I am here a prisoner?
It is very pesimistièan view.
And you call me that?
A detainee in the fight.
Uèestvovali you are in a very unusual event.
We have to take precautions.
I told you everything.
I am not infected.
Does not work like that!
Look at us as enemies.
I do not blame you for that.
If I were in your place, as I thought!
Someone watching us?
Yes, it is always the case.
In whatever you believe,
And do you believe...
... We are not the enemy.
Then why are my hands tied?
And where is Sophie!
I want to see it.
The victims in this life must always submitted, Mr. Kane. For the greater good.
Do you ask me to join you?
Are you kidding?
I will not do it!
Can you hear me there?
I will not be part of this!
I will not be part of this!
You've been...
So there are no side effects?
None.
Are you sure about this?
There are no side effects.
Mr. Kane has already infected 72 hours and shows no adverse effects.
It is completely healthy.
I did not ask on the subject of testing.
I asked you about the infection.
Test 49 was a complete success.
Congratulations, doctor.
{117}{168}What's the matter?|ls it me?

{21784}{21902}Yes. Now, as soon as all that's done,|we'll hoist sail and take off.
{21906}{21987}Sir, shouldn't we motor out|past the reef first?

{22966}{23012}We're waiting.
{23393}{23433}Help! Help!
{24026}{24129}lt's all right. l promise you.|l promise you.
{24133}{24205}l promise you you'll be fine.
{24267}{24341}Okay. lt's okay.|lt's okay. You're safe.
{24352}{24435}Better safe than dead.|You saved my life.
{24448}{24499}-My pleasure.|-lt hurts.
{24503}{24584}-Can l take a look?|-Yes, please. lt's the other one.
{24608}{24650}We should get you a doctor.
{24654}{24696}-Aren't you a doctor?|-No.
{24700}{24805}-You're not a doctor?|-No, but l'm a dentist.
{24809}{24918}-You're a dentist?|-Dr. Leo Bell, D.D.S. at your service.
{24923}{24991}Hi, l'm Beverly.
{25101}{25172}ls everyone clear|on today's activities?
{25176}{25242}The volleyball tournament|on the beach at 2.
{25246}{25330}The Mr. Muscle contest at 4:30,|l'm judging.
{25334}{25383}And the new reggae band at 8...
{25387}{25504}...which means they might arrive by 9,|so try to keep the guests happy.
{25508}{25639}And tomorrow night, don't forget|the annual Fish Fry Beach Festival.
{25643}{25753}And, Anne, l'd like you to give your|little speech about the spawning.
{25757}{25884}We have some new people. Perhaps you'd|like to explain about the spawning.
{25888}{26009}Well, it's an excuse|to get drunk and rowdy, basically.
{26013}{26152}This sweet little fish called the|grunion swims up out of the ocean...
{26156}{26300}...onto the beach, for a moment|of privacy for his mating ritual.
{26304}{26440}And human beings swoop down on him,|scoop him up, and fry him for dinner.
{26448}{26496}How do you know it's tomorrow?
{26500}{26608}lt's always the first full moon|after the spring equinox.
{26612}{26664}But how do the fish know?
{26950}{27008}Better put something on,|we're heading into port.
{27012}{27039}Aye, aye, captain.
{27060}{27171}Listen to this, Loretta.|'' Log of the Circe, day 26.
{27175}{27260}lt's been 1 8 days since we ran out|of our rationed supply of money.
{27264}{27340}Traveling from island to island,|we must live by our wits...
{27344}{27484}...raiding the ports for provisions and|trusting our sturdy craft for escape.
{27488}{27608}We're sea bandits, taking what we want,|giving no quarter and asking none.
{27612}{27720}l think we can continue indefinitely,|until Daddy takes the boat back.''
{27724}{27756}Not bad for a Yankee.
{27760}{27900}We've made landfall at Elysium,|just in time.
{27904}{27975}-Shall we take a shot at it?|-Aye, aye, captain.
{27979}{28003}Okay.
{28389}{28442}l wanna talk to one of you.
{28451}{28512}-You! Come down here.|-What's the matter?
{28516}{28604}-l've been keeping to the right.|-l'll take care of this.
{28870}{28916}l tried to reach you.
{28935}{28987}l tried to get ahold of you.
{28991}{29048}Your radio was off.|You know better.
{29052}{29155}l know. You scared the shit out--|You scared Mr. Dumont very badly.
{29159}{29208}l have to call him Captain.
{29212}{29314}You tell Captain Dumont to keep|the radio on because of the storms.
{29318}{29430}-Where are you going?|-Around the cays, south of Buck lsland.
{29434}{29518}Dad, can we go fishing|when we get back? Marlin fishing.
{29522}{29605}You catch one 800-pound marlin,|you've caught them all.
{29609}{29685}-Boring.|-Take me fishing, please.
{29689}{29762}-She's pretty nice.|-Who?
{29772}{29822}-Well....|-She's cute, huh?
{29826}{29920}Okay. She's okay.|Not that bad, anyway.
{29936}{30023}-What's the matter?|-Nothing. Nothing.
{30042}{30084}Okay, let's go.
{30268}{30336}-What did he want?|-He thought you were a smuggler.
{30340}{30431}Wanted to strip-search the boat,|but l talked him out of it.
{30680}{30714}Hey, Annie.
{30868}{30916}-How you been?|-Okay.
{30920}{31001}-You know. How about you?|-Same.
{31014}{31050}Routine.
{31091}{31170}-Putting on a little weight?|-l don't know. Maybe.
{31174}{31240}l have to go.|l'm gonna be late for class.
{31244}{31333}Wait a second.|Do you recognize that dinghy?
{31342}{31443}-lt's an orange and blue caravel.|-Do you know who it belongs to?
{31447}{31532}You think l sneak down here at night|to memorize boats?
{31536}{31600}Don't they pay you to do that stuff?
{31604}{31727}l found it tied to the channel marker|out by the Fitzgerald wreck.
{31731}{31843}Since you take innocent tourists|out there for their drowning lessons--
{31849}{31905}Drowning lessons?
{32968}{33052}-Throwing a party?|-You scared me half to death.
{33060}{33133}-l'll have to call the manager.|-Don't do that.
{33137}{33194}-Why not?|-Because l'm starving.
{33198}{33310}Come on, l saw you and your friend|pull in on that great rig.
{33317}{33432}We're in a jam. We ran out of food and|all our money was stolen yesterday.
{33436}{33480}-Really?|-Yeah, really.
{33484}{33562}Listen, we'll make it up to you.|What's your name?
{33566}{33596}Mal.
{33600}{33674}Mal, why don't you|come by the boat later on.
{33678}{33764}Have a nice dinner,|cruise around the bay for a while.
{33768}{33829}Maybe get stoned.|Know what l mean?
{33833}{33922}l'm sure that Loretta and l|can keep you entertained.
{33957}{34019}-And this is dinner?|-Yeah, that's it.
{34023}{34045}l don't know.
{34057}{34144}Listen, Loretta's hip.|She trusts my judgment in men.
{34158}{34240}Mal, have you ever made it|with two girls?
{34283}{34308}lt's a date.
{34312}{34400}Good. We're docked up at the point.|Six o'clock all right?
{34404}{34511}Wait. Let me bring the dinner.|l'm an amateur chef.
{34515}{34600}l'll make something|really special. Okay?
{34610}{34650}Gotta go.
{34666}{34731}See you later, alligator.
{34758}{34853}Today's dive will take us|to the wreck of the Dwight Fitzgerald.
{34857}{34954}lt was a Navy supply ship that went|down a couple of months ago.
{34958}{35052}We received permission to dive there,|but we can't go inside.
{35056}{35160}You're kidding. Our first big dive|and we can't go inside at all?
{35164}{35261}No. Don't worry,|there will be plenty of things to see.
{35265}{35325}We're gonna swim all the way around.
{35329}{35405}There are hundreds of fish|using the boat as a reef.
{35409}{35452}Boring!
{35456}{35497}Hey, come here.
{35513}{35574}You go to asshole school|or something?
{35579}{35667}Okay. Are there any questions?
{35671}{35745}Get your equipment:|masks, fins, snorkels only.
{35749}{35851}The tanks and regulators|are onboard the boat. Let's get wet.
{36108}{36163}-l have a question for you.|-Yes?
{36167}{36260}Seemed like you were a pretty good|diver. Why take the class?
{36264}{36403}Mainly l was bored, and l heard|that it was part of the package deal.
{36407}{36478}Also, l heard the instructor|was very cute.
{36482}{36520}Thank you.
{36596}{36648}Do you dive on the first date?
{42688}{42716}-Steve.|-Yes?
{42720}{42805}We've got a deader on the docks.|They brought him up.
{42809}{42880}-Drowned?|-l'm not sure.
{42888}{42960}Steve, it's one|of your wife's students.
{42964}{43070}Man, you gotta be kidding me.|Let's go.
{43551}{43585}Drink that.
{43616}{43656}Are you all right?
{43803}{43848}Can l ask you a few questions?
{43852}{43902}-Do you feel up to it?|-Okay.
{43906}{43951}Alone, please.
{44042}{44109}Do you know the name of the deceased?
{44113}{44199}Yeah. Robert Hayward.
{44203}{44307}Hayward. Was he enrolled|in one of your diving tours?
{44311}{44335}Yes.
{44339}{44441}This incident took place on one|of your regularly scheduled dives?
{44471}{44514}Yes.
{44549}{44609}Did you see what happened?
{44618}{44706}He just swam away|from the rest of the group.
{44710}{44765}He was only out of sight|for a second.
{44769}{44846}-Did you see a shark at any time?|-No. lt wasn't that.
{44850}{44902}-A school of barracuda?|-No, but--
{44906}{44996}-A moray eel?|-Would you listen to me for a minute?
{45000}{45118}lt wasn't a shark, or a barracuda,|or a moray eel, or a jealous lover.
{45122}{45216}-Then what was it?|-l don't know. That's the point.
{45220}{45309}l'm familiar with the marine life|in this area, and l don't know!
{45313}{45422}Give her a break. She's had a shock.|She's upset. Can't you see that?
{45426}{45465}Who's this?
{45472}{45552}-What's his name?|-Sherman. Tyler Sherman.
{45556}{45641}l've gotta look at the body.|l only saw it for a moment.
{45645}{45708}Out of the question.|That's the coroner's job.
{45712}{45740}Steven.
{45744}{45869}l was responsible for that boy. That's|my job. l have to know what happened.
{45873}{45934}That's right.|You were responsible...
{45938}{46019}...and that's precisely why|you can't touch the body...
{46023}{46121}...because it may be used in evidence|in a case of negligence.
{46125}{46194}You are still the most|pigheaded person ever.
{46198}{46276}That may be true, but|l'm in charge of this investigation.
{46280}{46380}And if l need any information,|l'll ask you.
{46503}{46530}What do you think?
{46534}{46659}lf l had a little spiffy outfit like|that, maybe l could be in charge too.
{46693}{46744}You know that robot?
{46758}{46812}Yes. He's my husband.
{46910}{47007}Here he is. You will not believe|how weird this guy is.
{47011}{47075}The word is|he hasn't been laid in 1 0 years.
{47079}{47139}Wait until you see him,|you'll laugh.
{47143}{47196}He doesn't look so bad from here.
{47200}{47281}-Hi. Here l come.|-That's what he thinks.
{47285}{47364}-Wait until you see what l made.|-l can't wait.
{47380}{47487}-Should l jump onboard now?|-Yeah, but pass me the box first.
{47491}{47526}Okay.
{47568}{47613}Okay, now, untie the rope.
{47665}{47694}Okay.
{47754}{47833}Boy, this is going to be fun.
{47848}{47894}-Hand it over here.|-Okay.
{47898}{47948}And don't forget the other one.
{48059}{48089}Here.
{48096}{48140}Okay.
{48145}{48192}Now, jump!
{48221}{48376}lt's a little too far away.|Can you bring it a little closer?
{48380}{48451}Come on, it's just a couple of feet.
{48501}{48554}Okay, wait.
{48617}{48710}Watch this.|Here l come. Oh, boy.
{48955}{49023}So long, asshole.
{49204}{49262}Hey. You awake?
{49266}{49319}-Hey.|-Of course.
{49323}{49416}l just wanted to tell you|l'm really glad you came with us.
{49420}{49539}So am l. The way your father drives,|we'd have probably hit a reef by now.
{49543}{49624}-That's not what l meant.|-l'm sorry.
{49628}{49736}lt's just such a drag my daddy|made us go to bed so early.
{49740}{49822}Well, why does he make|you go to bed so early?
{49826}{49887}l think he's just trying|to be cool with me.
{49891}{49981}You see, it took him a whole bottle|of wine to get to sleep.
{50214}{50276}Need a guide?|Work's incredibly cheap.
{50280}{50341}-Hi, Tyler. No, thanks.|-How about dinner?
{50345}{50438}lf you're going for a restaurant,|that's the wrong direction.
{50442}{50496}-l'm not.|-That's all right. We can just...
{50500}{50545}...stroll and talk.
{50561}{50632}Tyler, can you give me a break?
{50636}{50739}l would like to be by myself.|l don't want to talk to anybody. Okay?
{50743}{50794}You need to talk to somebody.
{50798}{50855}Why not me?|l am your best friend.
{50859}{50913}l just met you five days ago.
{50917}{51007}And all that time l thought|we had this incredible rapport.
{51011}{51100}-Okay. Would you do me a favor?|-Sure. Anything.
{51104}{51149}-Leave me alone.|-Except that.
{51153}{51252}-Let me just buy you one drink.|-Okay. Tomorrow you can buy me a drink.
{51265}{51328}You can buy me two drinks.|Feel better?
{51336}{51364}Nope.
{51392}{51418}Anne.
{51456}{51556}How can we have a love affair|if you keep walking away from me?
{51562}{51597}What do you want?
{51601}{51692}l just want to spend time with you.|l don't care where you're going...
{51696}{51824}...or what you're doing. l just|would like to be with you. Okay?
{51828}{51869}-Okay.|-Great!
{51879}{51949}-You sure?|-Yeah.
{51986}{52013}Follow me.
{52051}{52084}Yeah, man.
{52287}{52358}lt's kind of dark in here.
{52362}{52448}You did say that you wanted|to be with me. Didn't you?
{52452}{52569}Yeah.|You come here often?
{52710}{52792}-Hey, this is the morgue.|-Very good.
{52815}{52918}Yeah. l'm kind of|a perceptive sort of guy.
{52922}{53008}No. We're not going to be|breaking in here, are we?
{53012}{53084}Jesus, we're breaking in.
{53125}{53181}Don't leave home|without it.
{53365}{53463}Anne, what the hell are we doing|in this place, anyway?
{53521}{53624}l'm trying to get a good look at the|body before the coroner gets to it.
{53628}{53707}Boy, you are one|fun chick, you know?
{54526}{54577}Where do you think|they put him?
{55106}{55181}We're gonna have|to pull him out to take pictures.
{55185}{55231}Help me with this thing.
{55635}{55690}Take this, l'll get my camera.
{55840}{55925}Your method|is pretty scientific, lady.
{55952}{56021}l studied marine biology|before l met Steve.
{56235}{56293}-Don't try anything funny!|-Nothing funny.
{56297}{56356}Mrs. Kimbrough,|what are you doing here?
{56360}{56384}Well, we--
{56388}{56443}-Came to pay our last respects.|-My ass.
{56447}{56531}Nobody's got any respect anymore.|Not even for the dead.
{56535}{56633}l almost lost my job letting in a guy|because he said he was the bereaved.
{56637}{56732}Then l catch him having a party.|Sure isn't going to happen again.
{56736}{56781}No party.|Just on our way out.
{56785}{56842}Damn right you were.
{56983}{57068}Shit. The bike. Keep going.|Keep going. Keep going.
{57081}{57164}Come busting in|as if it's a playground.
{57194}{57307}No damn respect.|lsn't that right, love?
{57408}{57473}Oh, hell.
{57760}{57814}Jeez.
{58716}{58792}Tremendous jaw pressure.
{58807}{58870}lt sheared cleanly through|bone in places.
{58899}{59013}-You got any wine in the house?|-Only Coke, if there's any left.
{59047}{59110}l don't know anything|that could do that.
{59114}{59184}Maybe it's a new kind|of species, you know.
{59188}{59256}Something that|never existed before.
{59260}{59364}Like a mutant strain|or genetic engineering?
{59368}{59459}Yeah, l guess.|Anybody doing stuff to fish?
{59490}{59584}The Army was,|but that was several years ago.
{59588}{59698}They developed a sort of killer fish|to screw up the rivers in Vietnam.
{59708}{59800}-Apocalypse Two.|-And Three and Four.
{59808}{59885}They escaped from their tank|and killed a lot of civilians.
{59983}{60028}-Maybe it's the same fish.|-No.
{60032}{60107}They were experimenting|with a freshwater fish...
{60111}{60184}...from the piranha family,|l think. Serrasalmus or....
{60188}{60254}Whatever it was,|it couldn't live in the ocean.
{60258}{60282}Piranha?
{60286}{60388}Well, they changed it a little,|made it nastier.
{60392}{60461}What have you been reading?|National Enquirer?
{60465}{60588}No. We get the news here too. You're|the one who brought up the new species.
{60592}{60648}Yeah, but that was|just a joke!
{60688}{60744}Christ.
{60814}{60865}l'm sorry.
{60869}{60996}l know l've been lousy company, but|l just can't stop thinking about it.
{61000}{61102}l know. l understand.|lt could have been you.
{61106}{61159}Or even worse, me.
{61171}{61267}-l'm glad it wasn't you.|-Yeah. Me too.
{61271}{61397}Well, thanks for dinner,|the show.
{61401}{61484}lt was terrific.|We should do it again.
{61491}{61520}Tyler.
{61575}{61684}Would you stay?
{61688}{61738}Just to be here.
{61753}{61816}We wouldn't have|to make love or anything.
{61849}{61987}Make love? Anne, that was|the furthest thing from my mind.
{62374}{62483}Boy, these guys, they buy you dinner|and they think they own you!
{62487}{62554}But that was still|a pretty mean thing to do.
{62558}{62643}-lt was not.|-But he was so cute.
{62647}{62743}You'd think a snake was cute.|l always miss that.
{62747}{62850}-l'm going below to clean up the mess.|-Okay.
{63788}{63888}-Loretta, what was that?|-l don't know.
{63892}{63983}-Well, go look up front.|-Yeah.
{64324}{64374}l don't see a thing.
{64384}{64427}Okay.
{64864}{64960}Loretta! Loretta, what is it?
{64966}{65047}Loretta! Jesus, Loretta!
{65097}{65228}Loretta. Oh, my God, Loretta!|Try to grab onto this.
{65232}{65334}Jesus Christ,|what's happening? Loretta!
{68760}{68825}Annie, are you here?
{69061}{69197}That was your husband. Tried to gnaw|my arm off, but there just wasn't time.
{69341}{69416}You came here to talk. Talk!
{69460}{69520}-You see this?|-Yes. l see it.
{69524}{69594}-Where did l find it?|-All right. l was there.
{69598}{69682}-l have an answer if you care to listen.|-l'm listening.
{69686}{69766}-The Army has a strain of fish that--|-Fish?
{69770}{69828}See what's on the back|of this? Blood!
{69832}{69924}l found the nurse at the morgue|with her throat torn out, on dry land.
{69928}{70007}l got another girl right next|to her in the same condition.
{70011}{70084}This is my conclusion: l got|three bodies on my hands...
{70088}{70168}...and my wife was the last one|to see two of them alive!
{70172}{70266}There's nothing left to talk about.|Stay the hell out of this.
{70270}{70342}l don't want to hear more|of your cockamamie ideas.
{70346}{70444}Go home and sit on your hands.|And the next time, lock your door!
{70718}{70816}You really ought to learn how|to release those pent-up feelings.
{70882}{70976}You know, my ears popped a little|from that vacuum you left...
{70980}{71046}...when you ran after Steve.
{71072}{71132}l have a few things to do.
{71142}{71256}There's some food in the refrigerator|if you care to have some breakfast.
{71300}{71348}Terrific.
{71515}{71620}l'm canceling the dive tour today,|tomorrow and as long as necessary.
{71624}{71678}Anne, l'm booked solid|on the dives.
{71682}{71755}People like the dives.|They like you.
{71759}{71853}You're sticking a red-hot poker|up my ass by canceling now.
{71857}{71972}l advise you to stop water activities|until we find out what's going on.
{71976}{72051}-You're just upset.|-No boating, jet-skiing, windsurfing...
{72055}{72138}-You're being ridiculous.|-...snorkeling, swimming, or anything.
{72142}{72192}Anne, you're fired.
{72219}{72244}What?
{72298}{72372}Unemployed. As of now.
{72376}{72510}And l could use your suite.|So please vacate by tomorrow morning.
{72923}{72980}lt's Tyler. l'm still here|on Elysium.
{72984}{73069}That attack yesterday,|l'm pretty sure that it--
{73073}{73168}Well, now what else|could it be, huh?
{73172}{73276}Listen. l ran into a woman here who's|starting to put the pieces together.
{73280}{73348}l think she could be|pretty helpful to us.
{73352}{73454}Yeah, l know that.|Very risky. l realize that.
{73458}{73574}But if she blows the whistle, we don't|have to put our asses on the line.
{73578}{73650}Look, just relax.|lt's gonna be okay.
{73655}{73778}l'll take care of it. l'm gonna get|a specimen. l'll get back to you.
{77889}{77915}Did you see them?
{77919}{77987}One of them came so close|l could have touched it.
{77991}{78047}-Scared the shit out of me. You okay?|-Fine.
{78051}{78175}l gotta get my camera before it gets|dark. l don't think they like light.
{78206}{78284}Anne? Anne!
{78302}{78332}You can't go down.
{78336}{78392}lf l can get a picture,|that's proof.
{78396}{78482}They're not the same piranha|you talked about last night.
{78486}{78584}-They're more vicious than anything.|-What are you talking about?
{78588}{78676}Four canisters of fertile|piranha eggs sank right there.
{78682}{78760}-Three were found.|-How do you know that?
{78813}{78925}l worked on the project for about|two years. l'm a biochemist.
{78951}{78996}-You knew?|-No. l didn't know.
{79000}{79053}l suspected.|That's why l came.
{79057}{79112}You knew and didn't say|a goddamn word.
{79116}{79226}-l couldn't. lt's all classified.|-Oh, ''classified.'' Bullshit.
{79230}{79297}You tell me what you know|about those things.
{79301}{79350}l can't do that.
{79371}{79420}-Fine. l'm going.|-Wait a minute.
{79424}{79494}Just sit down|for one second. Okay?
{79498}{79568}All right. l'll tell you|everything l know.
{79572}{79656}My ass could end up in jail|for this, but l'll tell you.
{79660}{79782}We spliced genes from different species|to create the ultimate killer organism.
{79786}{79840}Grunions that could|live out of water...
{79844}{79921}...the common flying fish|you see in the bay here...
{79925}{80007}...so it could live in all|environments. Understand?
{80011}{80095}My God. We've got|to tell somebody right now.
{80099}{80150}You have to come with me|to convince them.
{80154}{80249}-l can't. l'm not supposed to be here.|-Tyler, people are dead.
{80253}{80327}You've got to go and tell them|what you know now.
{80331}{80395}-l've got to get more information.|-God.
{80399}{80510}Then l can fill out my report and|submit it to the proper authorities.
{80514}{80570}People on this island|are not qualified.
{80574}{80625}lt's gotta go through|proper channels.
{80632}{80748}Fuck the proper channels. Help me now,|or you get the hell out of my way.
{82169}{82317}Turn your radio on, you jackass.|Six. Channel six.
{82420}{82528}-Hey. Hello?|-Are you Dumont?
{82533}{82643}Yes, this is he.|What have l done?
{82658}{82717}Let me speak|to Chris Kimbrough.
{82768}{82876}They're both gone.|They must've taken the dinghy.
{82880}{82962}-Chris and my daughter.|-How long ago?
{82966}{83106}-l don't know. l was sleeping.|-Dumont, listen to me...
{83110}{83202}...very carefully. l'm only gonna|say this once, slowly.
{83207}{83261}l want you to stay put.
{83265}{83372}When they come back, l want you|to call me on channel six.
{83380}{83443}Do yourself a favor.
{83508}{83576}Find my daughter.
{83588}{83688}And when you do,|let me know at once.
{84169}{84242}Okay, honey, this one's for the den.
{84246}{84309}Great! Okay, let's see you.
{84313}{84350}All right.
{84354}{84421}-That's for the girls in the office.|-Hey, Ralph!
{84425}{84502}Come on, Myrna,|this one's for your mother!
{84506}{84533}Okay.
{84537}{84572}Great.
{84576}{84635}l hope you're coming|to our fish fry tonight.
{84639}{84676}lt's something special.
{84680}{84762}ls it in our package?|We're on the modified B plan.
{84766}{84803}Of course, of course.
{84817}{84907}The music, the hor d'oeuvres|and the first drink are free.
{84911}{84980}And dinner is a gift from the sea.
{84992}{85017}Sounds great!
{85061}{85126}Oh, you might want to have a snack.
{85130}{85205}Things don't start happening|until after midnight.
{85209}{85305}Oh, honey, l just know we're|going to have a great time!
{85309}{85391}-More pictures now.|-Do l have to?
{85395}{85443}All right.
{85907}{85972}This is all we caught last night.
{86009}{86061}And the nets like this.
{86201}{86270}But this is what l wanted to show you.
{86311}{86413}They must be getting damn hungry|to eat each other like this.
{86661}{86727}Please, Raoul....
{86731}{86792}l'm not just being hysterical.
{86796}{86856}l'm trying the best way l know how...
{86860}{86982}...to convince you that these|things exist. l've seen them.
{86990}{87089}-Piranha?|-l told you what Tyler Sherman said.
{87093}{87222}What they are, where they come from.|According to him, they can fly.
{87226}{87335}l wonder what has triggered|this paranoid delusion?
{87339}{87450}Really, l'm quite concerned|for your health, Anne, dear.
{87454}{87537}You've been breathing too much air|from those musty tanks.
{87541}{87681}Look, the things are here|and they've killed people.
{87685}{87749}You both have a responsibility!
{87753}{87788}Of course.
{87792}{87854}Let's be quite practical, shall we?
{87858}{87933}l can't cut all my beach activities.
{87937}{88001}Fiscally, l'd be cutting my nuts off!
{88013}{88074}Kimbrough, perhaps you can explain...
{88078}{88157}...to her how this island|survives financially.
{88161}{88242}As usual, Raoul, you're full of shit.
{88462}{88512}The bastards fly.
{88609}{88633}That's it.
{88653}{88753}lf you'll excuse me,|l've got business to attend to...
{88757}{88793}...back on earth.
{88819}{88871}Bitch.
{92965}{93011}Hey, come back here!
{93015}{93048}l'm gonna maroon you!
{93052}{93140}-l'm gonna black and blue you!|-Part of that sounds great!
{93144}{93207}Oh, you wretch!
{93218}{93259}Come on.
{93263}{93312}Push!
{93316}{93363}Hop in!
{93899}{93943}-Did you locate Chris?|-No.
{93947}{94000}l know he's in the cays|south of Buck lsland.
{94004}{94045}-Take care of this.|-Relax.
{94049}{94127}Aaron, take her back to the hotel.|lf anything happens...
{94131}{94216}...close the place down|even if it's at gunpoint.
{94220}{94322}l've heard this twice, Steve.|lt's under control.
{94355}{94416}-Why can't we close it now?|-l'll tell you.
{94420}{94479}l called the Defense Department|about Tyler Sherman.
{94483}{94556}After bureaucratic bullshit,|l got ahold of a colonel...
{94560}{94612}...that admitted he existed.
{94616}{94705}lt seems he was fired from|this unnamed government project.
{94709}{94796}That he was unstable,|that anything he said was nonsense.
{94800}{94866}They said do absolutely nothing.|Nothing.
{94870}{94919}They would send a team in tomorrow.
{94923}{95028}Well, that sounds real convincing.|They're contradicting themselves.
{95032}{95115}Tyler Sherman came here|because he wanted to warn people.
{95119}{95216}-That's what he was using me for.|-l knew l didn't like him.
{95220}{95316}We'll talk about him later.|Right now l'm concerned about Chris.
{95320}{95420}You know how l feel about Chris.|l'm not coming back without him.
{95585}{95638}Hey, Kimbrough.
{98251}{98288}Listen, everyone!
{98292}{98426}l just want to remind you that|no one is allowed on the beach early.
{98430}{98544}We'll scare them off if we|don't wait until they're all ashore.
{98548}{98667}One person can spoil it for everyone,|so l really must insist.
{98693}{98740}Aaron.
{98744}{98795}Come in, Aaron, over.
{98804}{98834}This is Aaron.
{98845}{98950}-See anything?|-No, nothing. How about you?
{98954}{99028}lt's okay so far.|Stand by this channel. Out.
{99356}{99421}Open up, sugar.
{99531}{99612}Hi, Mrs. Wilson.|ls there something l can do for you?
{99616}{99736}You bet. You can help me kill|this Mumm's and eat these oysters.
{99740}{99807}Better watch out,|they're an aphrodisiac.
{99811}{99860}What is it, honey?
{99885}{99917}Hi, Mrs. Wilson.
{99922}{99967}Anything wrong?
{99971}{100049}No, l guess l have|the wrong room number.
{100053}{100101}l'm sorry. Bye!
{100105}{100163}-Bye.|-Bye-bye, Mrs. Wilson.
{100609}{100719}And no one knows what forces|bring them to these beaches...
{100723}{100812}...year after year, to find a mate...
{100816}{100889}...and spawn in the dark of the night.
{100893}{100989}-Sorry l'm late.|-l know why you're late.
{100993}{101084}-What a waste.|-l don't think so.
{101169}{101295}And remember, whoever catches|the most fish wins a two-day trip!
{101300}{101387}Air search to unit one,|come in, over.
{101391}{101484}Steve, this is Anne.|Did you find Chris yet? Over.
{101488}{101588}Not yet. l'm gonna refuel at|Buck lsland and stay out for a while.
{101592}{101701}Okay. Everything's calm here.|Good luck. Over and out.
{101869}{101926}Aaron, this is Anne. Come in.
{102717}{102776}Aaron, come in!
{102897}{102961}You're wonderful!
{102965}{103061}You're great!|You're my dream come true!
{103276}{103305}Hi, lady.
{103334}{103462}There's only one way for a fat guy to|be first when running for the beach.
{103466}{103513}Cheat!
{103575}{103607}Light the torches.
{103637}{103672}Don't burn me.
{103676}{103830}Now, we must call to the fish|in the traditional style.
{103840}{103942}To lure them from the sea|with the ancient rhythm.
{104284}{104414}All right, we must have total silence.
{105098}{105137}They killed my son.
{105201}{105315}l'm going to kill them fish.|l'm going to kill them in the wreck!
{105329}{105451}No, Gabby, please, no.|You'll never get down to the wreck!
{105525}{105565}Can you hear the sound?
{105748}{105777}Everybody ready?
{105782}{105853}Let's go get them!
{105859}{105951}We want fish.|We want fish.
{105956}{106069}We want fish.|We want fish.
{107679}{107704}Help!
{107907}{107932}Where are you?
{108262}{108385}lf l didn't have so much to drink|tonight, l'd swear l was seeing things.
{110309}{110385}Allison, wake up. Wake up!
{110485}{110531}We're lost.
{110535}{110595}Lost at sea.
{110667}{110718}How romantic.
{110722}{110746}Oh, my God.
{110750}{110797}Allison!
{110801}{110906}Words cannot describe|the trouble we're in.
{112566}{112612}l was expecting Gabby.
{112655}{112712}Gabby's dead.
{112729}{112778}So are a lot of people.
{112849}{112922}-You got the charges he made?|-Yeah.
{112951}{112983}One's mine.
{113017}{113090}You don't have to go. l can handle it.
{113144}{113229}l might as well,|l got the damn suit on.
{113363}{113398}We've got one hour.
{113537}{113620}What about those lights over there?
{113624}{113687}-Where?|-Those. Right there.
{113722}{113805}The red one could be|the channel marker by the hotel.
{113854}{113915}Okay, that's where we're going.
{114236}{114317}Steve, just be sure|you're clear by 6.:30.
{114321}{114403}These detonators are electronic|and the time should be accurate.
{114407}{114530}Anne, don't do this. All we have to do|is walk away from this in one piece!
{114534}{114609}l can take care of myself.|Just find Chris. Over.
{114613}{114641}Annie, listen to me.
{114646}{114709}-Annie!|-Don't answer.
{122766}{122833}-Hey, look! lt's Dad!|-Hey! Here we are!
{122837}{122872}-Dad!|-Over here!
{122876}{122933}Down here! Dad!
{122984}{123099}-Mr. Kimbrough! We're here!|-He's coming. Over here!
{123263}{123314}Chris, can you drive the dive boat?
{123472}{123545}All right, son,|stay right where you are.
{124953}{125011}Come on, baby.
{126591}{126621}Throw me a rope!
{126647}{126678}Throw me a line!
{126767}{126816}-Come on.|-Dad, what's going on?
{126820}{126894}Come on! Move your ass.
{126976}{127008}Go, go, go.
{127041}{127086}-Where's Mom?|-Put that on!
{127090}{127152}-Here.|-What's going on, Dad?
{127161}{127193}-Go below.|-l can--
{127197}{127244}Go below!
{127349}{127425}Annie, Annie, Annie.
{131381}{131427}Kimbrough.
{131431}{131465}Kimbrough!

[doorbell]
- 'Morning, Uncle Scrooge.
- So there you are, Gladstone.
Right on time.
I like punctuality.
And a free newspaper.
Thanks.
Still a cheapskate, I see.
Bite your tongue, lad.
I'm simply thrifty.
A quality you could work on a wee bit.
I don't need thrift.
I've got luck.
Money will get you through times of no luck, my boy.
Better than luck will get you through times of no money.
But I've never had any times of no luck.
I'm always lucky.
- Whoa!
- [Crashes]
[Laughing]
Did you say "always lucky"?
Yech!
Yep. Always lucky.
Otherwise, how do you explain why
I just found a dollar bill?
I still don't understand, Gladstone.
Why on earth would you treat the richest man in the world to breakfast?
It's simple, Unc.
To sell you this gold money clip that I won in a raffle.
- I need to pay my rent.
- Pay your rent?
You mean you have no money?
Not a lead cent.
What are you going to use to pay for breakfast?
- Luck.
- Oh, Gladstone, I'll pay.
I cannot let you embarrass yourself like this.
That is customer number 999,999.
And you, sir, are our one millionth customer!
[Music and cheering]
Thanks.
Your prize is a year's free meals at our restaurant for yourself and a friend.
I don't believe it.
You see, Uncle Scrooge?
I live on my luck.
I never worry about money.
Well, some of us do.
Come on. You're worried about money?
That witch, Magica De Spell is in town, and I just know she's thinking of ways to break into my money vault.
- [Plop]
- What was that?
Someone must have accidentally dropped this silver dollar in the pot.
I do wish you'd cut that out.
I don't believe in luck.
Oh, yeah? Then how do you explain your number-one dime?
Uh... Well, I suppose it's possible.
From the moment I earned it, my fortune has skyrocketed.
[Gladstone] Now that's a lucky charm I'd love to see.
[Scrooge] So would that witch Magica.
That's why I've just installed a set of intricate traps in the money bin.
Traps! That ruins everything.
I'll tell you what, Uncle.
I'll trade you the money clip for a peek at the dime.
- Deal?
- Deal.
But you'll have to promise not to tell anyone about my new traps.
Hey, no problem.
No problem, indeed, Mr. Lucky.
You have solved my problems at last.
[Zoom]
So, Scroogey.
You have filled your money bin with clever traps to keep out Magica De Spell?
Well, that lucky friend of yours will soon betray you.
Then I will have your number-one dime.
With my magic, I will turn it into a charm of great strength.
And then all the power and wealth in the world will be mine!
Mine! Mine!
[Evil laugh]
[Thunder]
Not bad for first thing in morning.
[Gladstone] That dime must be the most powerful good-luck charm in the world.
Don't exaggerate, Gladstone.
Stop right there.
Step where I step.
Why? What is this, hopscotch?
More or less.
Because if you step on the wrong spot...
...the game's over.
Holy horseshoes.
So that's what they mean by inflation.
And if a thief somehow managed to make it this far, he'd still have to get through these light beams.
[Alarms]
Oh! Beam me up, Scotty!
And if anyone maneuvered through that, they'd still have to deal with this.
I don't think you have anything to worry about.
No one could get through all this.
Don't be too sure, Gladstone.
Magica is a tricky old witch.
And she has more powers than you might suspect.
Even if someone was lucky enough to get through those traps,
- they wouldn't know the combination.
- No.
I'm the only one who knows that.
Is that the number-one dime?
Aye. There she glows.
So your fortune is based on a lucky charm after all.
Nonsense.
It was blood, sweat and tears that earned me my cash.
Sounds soggy to me.
I'll keep trusting in my good old luck.
Thanks for the peek.
He'll never learn.
[Gladstone] What a lucky day.
I won three contests, a vacation to Ducko de Janeiro and a new wardrobe.
Wonder what's gonna happen before bedtime.
- [Phone ringing]
- More good luck, I'll bet.
Hello.
- [Woman] Mr. Gladstone Gander?
- Yes.
This is the Duckburg Broadcasting Company, and you've won a chance to be on the million-dollar game show,
Truth or Crunch-equences.
Of course I have.
Why don't you come down and see our talent coordinator for an interview?
You could be on the show tonight.
Hold onto your rabbits' feet.
I'll be right over.
Fine. We're at the Duckburg Palace Hotel, suite 412.
- And don't forget to bring your luck.
- I don't leave home without it.
That goose is in for the night of his life.
[Evil laugh]
This is terrific.
A million-dollar game.
Now Scrooge will see how lucky I am.
- Luck be a lady tonight
- Hello?
- [Magica] Come in.
I mean...
[disguising voice] Come in, sweetie.
Are you the talent coordinator?
Bingo.
And you're Gladstone Gander.
If you'll just come over here and sign these forms, we'll get you ready to break into Scrooge's money bin
- and steal his number-one dime.
- What?
Magic powers take this knave.
Make the goose my willing slave.
Duh...
That is better.
It hurts throat to talk like that.
Now then, little goose, you are in my power.
And I am going to use your good luck to get me past Scrooge's nasty traps.
Nasty traps.
Good.
Follow me.
Here it is, Scrooge's money bin.
Now then, darling, you hear what I tell you you hear.
You see what I tell you you see.
- You see?
- Yes. Whatever you say.
Fine. And what I say is that you are on game show right now!
[Gladstone] Truth or Crunch-equences.
Now, listen, pumpkin.
See doorway?
On other side is maze that leads to door number one.
Open Jiminy!
[Zap]
I'm on TV.
Now look.
See, is host of our show,
Bill Barker.
- [Howling]
- [Crowd cheering]
Hello and hi.
And me, I am Bill's lovely assistant,
Vanna Black.
Now at the far end of the maze is the grand prize.
And it's yours if you can get to it.
Sure, I can get to it.
Luckiest goose in the world.
All right, Gladstone Gander, come on down.
[Magica as Vanna] Beat that maze!
Beat that maze!
[Crowd] Beat that maze! Beat that maze!
Beat that maze! Beat that maze!
[Laughing]
Sorry, Mr. Barker.
I didn't see you there.
[Gladstone] Beat that maze.
Beat that maze.
[Crowd] Beat that maze! Beat that maze!
[Crashing]
- [Applause]
- Thank you. Thank you.
Isn't he great, folks? [howls]
Very good, Mr. Gander.
Now on to the next trap... maze.
This, I think I can help him.
The disco limbo competition.
I can do this.
Luckiest goose in the world.
Press the red button, honey.
That's phase two he's completed, folks.
Now on to phase three, Mr. Gander.
For luck.
[Applause]
Now what?
[Bill Barker] Well, Mr. Gander, you've made it to door number one.
Let's see if your luck holds out now as you spin to win. [howls]
Spin... to... win!
I did it. Door number one is open!
Oh, my prize.
I won! I won!
Powers of magic, ancient laws, leave this goose the way he was.
- Thank you, darling.
- What?
Wha... Where am I?
You just stole Scrooge's number-one dime for me, silly goose.
You're Magica De Spell!
- No!
- Yes.
And because you have used your good luck for a wicked purpose, your luck is now and forever cursed.
[Evil laugh]
So bad luck, old chump.
Bad luck?
No. No!
No!
I couldn't have lost my luck.
No. I refuse to believe it.
Some money. I still got the touch.
- [Bam]
- Give that back to me, you thief!
Help! Police!
[Yelps]
- [Growling]
- Nice doggy. Sit. Sit.
[Barking]
- [Screams]
- [Crashes]
I don't believe it.
I've lost my luck.
No food. There's no money.
I'll have to get a job like normal people!
[Crying]
Breakfast!
I want my free meal.
Oh, it is you.
Sorry, but there was a clerical error.
The winner was really the gentleman before you.
Uncle Scrooge?
No! It's not fair.
I'm the lucky one!
I won the food.
And stay out!
I gotta get my luck back somehow.
Maybe if I went to Uncle Scrooge and told him what happened.
[Scrooge] I don't know what's the matter.
- Everything seems to be going wrong.
- [Phones ringing]
- Hello!
- [Man] Mr. McDuck?
This is your copper mine in Argentina.
What's your problem?
If you want to stay in business, we're going to need scuba gear.
Oh, come on now, lad.
It cannot be that bad.
Send those people some water wings.
- [Phone rings]
- McDuck here. What's your problem?
[Man] A freak accident, sir.
One of your grain ships has dumped oats all over Lake Michigander.
Well, see if the locals like oatmeal.
Look, sir.
The bottom's falling out of the market.
I don't believe this.
Where did all these problems come from?
[Gladstone] I think I know.
Gladstone, my boy.
What's happened to you?
You're not gonna like this.
Come, lad, tell me all about it.
I won't get upset.
OK.
[Scrooge shouting] My dime's gone?
No wonder my business has gone to pot.
That miserable, rotten, low-down sorceress has got my dime!
How do you think I feel?
She's got my luck.
And the only way you're gonna get that back, bucko, is to recover the dime you took from me.
That's right.
Then you'll get your luck back too.
[Growling] Come on.
[Gladstone] We almost there,
Uncle Scroo...? Whoa!
[Scrooge] Ow! Get off me.
Gladstone, if you're really cursed, go stand somewhere else!
[Gladstone] Do you think she knows we're here, Uncle Scrooge?
She knows, all right, my lad.
But it won't do her any good.
[Magica] So you have come at last,
Scrooge McDuck.
And you brought a bad-luck charm too.
This should be good for a cackle.
Well, well, a very rich duck and a goose with no luck.
Give me back my dime, you loudmouth cloud.
Come and get it, if you can.
I got past your traps using good luck.
Let's see if bad luck gets you past mine.
Luck has nothing to do with it.
Tell me about it, darling.
[Evil laugh]
- You think this is the right entrance?
- It looks likely enough.
You know, I don't mind darkness, as long as it's bright.
Ow!
[Rumbling]
Come on!
I wish you'd watch where you're going.
I never had to before.
Hey, was that one of Magica's traps?
Could be, or maybe it was just you.
Why would Magica want to live in a place like this, anyway?
She's a sorceress, lad, not an interior decorator.
- Yeah, well, this place gives me the...
- Shh!
What? What is it?
What do you see?
- A rabbit's foot.
- Why, rabbits' feet are lucky.
We don't have to be afraid of those.
No, Gladstone, wait!
- [Snort]
- [Scrooge] It's a fire-breathing bunny.
[Stuttering] Nice bunny.
- [Roar]
- [Gladstone shouts]
[Shouting]
I'd hate to see the Easter eggs he'd deliver.
Get out your lunchbox from your backpack.
Bad time for a picnic, Uncle Scrooge.
[Scrooge] No, the carrot sticks for the rabbit. Hurry!
Yeah, got it.
- Sorry.
- Jump.
Enough is enough.
[Roar]
- [Roar]
- [Splash]
[Gurgling, choking]
Go steam-clean something.
Come on. We've got to stop Magica before she melts down my old number one.
Soon stars will be in proper configuration, and I will be making Scrooge's dime into part of my amulet.
Then it will control all other dimes in the world, not to mention all dollars too.
One dime to rule them all.
One dime to bind them.
[Evil laugh]
Only doing my job.
We've hit some kind of maze.
We must be close to Magica's lair.
Which way should we go?
Which way do you think?
- Left.
- Fine. We'll go right.
Why?
[Crash]
Your rotten luck, remember?
We're getting close to her lair now.
And the traps are going to get a lot worse.
Help!
What is this, a fun house?
Why? Are you having fun?
That fall must have scrambled my brains.
The ceiling looks like it's right on top of us.
Kilt McTartan!
It is right on top of us.
Oh! We're gonna be web-footed waffles!
Quick, give me your pack.
We've got to smash a mirror.
No way. That's seven years' bad luck.
Not if we're squashed today.
Good point. OK, which mirror?
Quick, McDuck, think.
There. That one.
- [Whack]
- Oops.
You lug nut.
Scrooge, you are more resourceful than I thought.
Drop that dime, De Spell!
Well, if that's what you really want.
No!
Did I frighten you, Scroogey?
Well, you should be.
For soon I will be richest, most powerful woman on planet, and you will be reduced to selling flowers on street corner.
Well, all plants need sunlight, Magica.
Even a poison ivy like you.
Ow!
Now's your big chance, lad.
Stand behind her.
- Huh?
- Trust me.
[Growling]
Powers of darkness, heed my call.
Blow this jerk into that wall.
[Whirring]
No. Stop!
Turn around! Go back!
I must have put too much spin on it.
Not at all, Magica.
It was Gladstone's bad luck that did it.
Scrooge, I am going to knock you into next Tuesday!
Quick, Gladstone, find my dime and let's get out of here.
- Right.
- Powers of darkness on the loose, send me rocks to cook their goose.
[Zap]
Uh-oh.
- Hurry, Gladstone, hurry!
- I found it! I found it!
Let's get out of here.
No time. Give me back the dime.
Got it.
[Magica laughs]
You are finished now, McDuck!
Through! Over! Kaput!
[Scrooge] Not quite, Magica.
The instant I got my dime back,
Gladstone's curse was lifted.
And then I luckily knocked us safely beneath the rocks.
Then luck your way out of this, hotshot.
- [Zap]
- [Yawns]
I don't believe it.
The warranty just ran out.
- Ta-ta, witchy.
- Better luck next dime!
[Laughs]
No! Is not fair!
Curses, you hear me?
Curses!
- [Yelling]
- [Thud]
[Scrooge] Here we are, safe at home again.
And good fortune smiles on your financial empire once more.
Aye. My ship full of oats soaked up an oil spill.
Which the government is paying me for.
And my flooded copper mine is full of mineral water, worth more than the copper is.
Plus the market is back up.
I'd call that a streak of good luck.
Luck?
I would think after your recent problems you'd quit trusting in luck.
Why don't you get a decent job?
Well, maybe I will, Uncle Scrooge.
But not till after I use this ticket for a one-year world cruise!
All right, Gladstone, I give up.
How much do you want for your four-leaf clover?
Come on, Unc.
I'll let you take me to breakfast today.
A temple whose study is more than other schools it dont only make promises.

You cant understand one thing you saw whatever happened there thats why we have to do this resignation is not the solution of problem if principal will take action against us then?
Atleast talk positive if they take resignation then?
It wont happen if all teachers resign together than how a school will run?

Can I have somethin' to remember you by?
And I don't want you smoking pot.
Ma, I might just experiment.
Well, don't pay for it.
Hey, are those alive?
No, they're stuffed.
You mean like cashews, bread crumbs, raisins?
How much you want for one?
Hey, they're pets.
Psst.
You need a fix?
What have you got?
What's your thing, man?
And remember, boys only want one thing.
What's wrong with that?
They never want it when you want it.
Camp, go.
Four-wheel drive, man.
Four-wheel drive, you numbskull.
Looking good, young trooper.
Cease, ho.
That's it.
Double time, young troopers.
Get to those or die.
Pick up that fork-nosed rifle.
Come on, lunge, twist and hold.
Hee-yah.
Hee-yah.
Rip 'em from across the craw, boy. That's it.
All right, move 'em out, trooper.
Fine bunch of campers this year, Foxglove.
Mmm-hmm. Hmm.
I tell you, they're naturals.
You'd put a pig sticker on the end of a rifle and a boy knows just what to do with it.
Hmm, God,
I love it so.
Hmm.
Let's go.
Young whippersnapper.
Get outta here.
This place sucks.
Sally Friedman?
Here.
- Tula Washington?
- You're lookin' at her.
Nancy Lamon.
Okay now, Cabin six.
Which one of you boys is Armand Carducci?
All right, I'll repeat myself.
Who's Armand Carducci?
The name is Flash and it's the only one I answer to.
Okay, Flash.
Now, I'm Giddy.
Uh, Coach Giddy.
I'm the head counselor here.
Damn. I'm in charge here.
I got the picture.
Good. Now, we're not comfortable with trouble at Sasquatch.
So don't give me any.
I hear what you're sayin'.
Now I know your reputation, Flash.
There's only one thing
I like about it.
Yeah? What's that?
How open are you to the concept of pugilism?
What kind of weird shit goes on around here?
I'm talking about boxin'.
The sport, fighting with rules.
I don't do rules.
I hear you're pretty good with your hands.
Yeah? So what if I am?
Well, we got a tradition around here.
It's called Champ of the Lake.
It's us against Camp Patton.
Camp Patton. That's the camp across the lake, the other side there?
Sort of like a summer
Golden Gloves.
Now we got a fighter, it's Boomer. He's great.
But he needs a little help, Flash.
He needs a sparring partner.
A real two-fisted talent, somebody like you.
What do you say?
Listen, Mr. Coach, I'm not what you call a team player.
What if I said I'm tellin', not askin'?
Are you?
No.
So then, why don't you back off my case, huh?
I don't do volunteer work.
You wanna give me
Cabin six? I'll take it.
The judge says that's my sentence.
That's the total picture, all right?
You know, if you change your mind...
Forget it.
Trade you my goalie stick for a Clark bar.
Hey, cool it, Butterball.
I don't do exclusives.
I gotta build up a clientele.
That watch quartz?
Yeah, but my dad gave it to me.
You always get the bed by the window.
But I'm the oldest.
That's mine.
It's mine.
Who does Mom love best?
Me.
So you wanna take the shirt, too?
All right, you turkeys.
Shut up!
Oh, my gosh.
The name's Flash.
Mr. Flash.
And I only got one rule.
Don't bug me!
You got that, you little twerps?
If you got a problem, tough, don't bring it to me.
I don't do problems.
Mr. Flash, can we...
Hey, one more thing you should know.
I don't do questions, either.
See that, Foxglove?
Morons, wimps and losers.
Same as last year, sir.
This summer we're gonna crush 'em.
That's the spirit, sir.
Is that a lisp?
Did I hear a lisp, Foxglove?
A lisp, sir?
Goddamn homo talk.
Impossible, Colonel, we're alone.
Cover my back.
Yes, sir.
I was seein' this guy, real cute, but they hated his guts.
And they were drivin' me crazy.
Well, I was drivin' them crazy.
So they decided the best thing for me was camp.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, I know what you mean.
This one
I just couldn't resist.
What do you think?
They're really nice.
I couldn't make up my mind.
Hey, you, uh, wanna borrow one?
Gee, do you think that'd be okay?
Oh, sure, I got tons.
What about shorts?
You got shorts?
Well, not exactly.
Here, try these.
Oh, and this goes really cute with that.
Oh, Nancy, I couldn't.
Listen, we're sisters, right?
It's us against the pinkies.
Go on.
Okay, thanks.
But you...
You like me or not?
Yes, I like you.
But I think we should set a good example.
Oh, well, look, nobody knows we're here.
This is a great place.
Not like that spot last summer?
Uh, no, no, no, no.
All those kids, all those flash bulbs?
No, no, no, no, no.
Or that time down at the lake?
Oh, Fanny, look, snakes only come out like that once a year.
Are you sure we're alone?
Sure, look around.
You know, it's just getting so foggy that I think we should go back to camp.
What do you mean, it's not that foggy.
Oh, we'll do it some other night.
Mom, it's really creepy here.
I wanna go home.
But you'll like this camp.
Sonny, you'll see.
But it's not even in our solar system.
Hey, don't you want to earn your Earth Merit Badge?
Yes, Dad.
Then what's to talk?
Now, Sonny, it looks like rain, so be sure to wear your little raincoat, dear.
But I don't want to wear Earth clothes.
That's nonsense, Son.
You're going to be just fine. You'll see.
Listen to this.
Who spent 325 jamochas on
English lessons for you?
You, Dad.
So, kiss your mother goodbye.
Goodbye, dear.
And be careful from the poison ivy.
Okay.
Good morning, Rene.
Ah, big day ahead of us, huh?
You under control in here?
But of course.
Uh-huh.
Some little adjustments maybe, eh?
Listen to me, you crazy frog.
I want food we can eat.
Burgers, doggies, home fries, eggs over easy.
I'll go as far as French toast, but nothing, nothing fancy.
You know where
I'm comin' from?
Oui, monsieur.
I don't.
Come on, will you?
Open up.
Come on, open up!
I'm going first.
You always go first.
Who was born first?
Me.
So gimme a break, will you?
I gotta go!
Both of you?
At the same time?
That's sick.
What's the problem?
I think somebody died in there.
Here, take this.
Let her rip.
What is it?
I don't know.
That sure is no pet.
- Ted's right.
- He's afraid.
He's not the only one.
Do you think maybe, like, maybe he's from...
Are you from space?
Did you see that? Did you?
I mean, wow! It understood.
Yeah, it did.
It really did.
That sure is a great trick.
Do you have a name?
Where are you from?
Me, Ted.
Who are you?
Me Ted.
What did he say?
I think he said meathead.
Meathead.
Meathead?
Meathead's what he said.
Meathead.
Listen, uh, Meathead, we won't hurt you or anything.
We're just, well, you know, curious.
We've never seen a...
A something like you before.
Look, we gotta go for breakfast.
Do you want us to bring anything back?
Uh, Big Mac.
How does he know about
Big Macs?
Think he's got a guidebook?
Right.
But he does, seriously.
Okay, ladies...
On the toes.
Come on.
Hurry up, we're late.
Just put this.
Hurry. Will you hurry?
Put your head back.
Hi, girls.
What's happening?
My name's Flash.
What's yours?
Don't talk to him,
Cheryl, he's a dork.
I'm not a dork,
I'm Italian.
Other way.
Hey, Flash.
Nah, I'm just lookin'.
Come on, come on, come over here.
Did you ever put the gloves on?
Where I come from, fighters don't have time for dressin' up.
Besides, I'm just lookin'.
Kick 'em high, ladies.
Up, up, up.
Hey, Boomer. Boomer.
This is Flash.
The kid with the reputation.
Oh, yeah.
Uh, hey, Flash.
How's it goin'?
Uh, pretty slow.
I can believe it.
What is that, some kind of crack, uh, Bash?
Flash.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, you know, Mash, you got a pretty good sense of humor.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna knock it right outta your head.
Wham, bam. Wham.
What do you think of that?
You wanna try?
Sure. I love fightin'.
Put 'em on.
All right.
Kick 'em high, ladies.
Up, up, up.
Raise those thighs.
Well, you take it easy.
Keep your guard up, huh?
Nothin' fancy.
Come on.
Right here.
Right here.
Come on.
You gotta do better than that, Bash.
That's all for today, ladies.
Let's go.
Hey, Trash.
Hey, didn't anybody ever tell you boxing and broads don't mix?
That guy really is a dork.
A what?
A dork. You know, dork.
Oh, yeah, sure, a dork.
Hey, like, you know, you know, you're a pretty good fighter, Crash.
Thanks. You're not so bad yourself, Bloomer.
My name is Boomer.
What are you, makin' fun of me again?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Nancy, will Flash always be a dork?
You really don't know what it is, do you?
A dork.
You know, like in, joystick?
Heater, wang, pud, equipment?
Uh, pinkie.
Oh, that's what it is.
So you didn't know, right?
Well, I mean, I knew...
You ever seen one?
Sure. Lots of times.
What, you got a brother or something?
No.
A boyfriend?
Well, not really.
Well then, who?
"Who" what?
Whose did you see?
Oh.
Look, come with me and I'll show you a couple of real doozers.
Oh, my God.
Try not to have a heart attack.
Ooh, boy, he is really somethin'.
I've seen bigger though.
You mean, they come in different sizes?
Haven't you ever seen one?
Hey, guess who's never seen...
Oh, nice going.
What did I say?
What'd I say?
Whoa!
I've never seen one that big before.
You've never seen one period.
Have, too. My brother.
Yeah, but he's five.
No, he's six.
You know, Tula didn't mean anything by that.
It's just that...
Well, you act like you've been in a convent your whole life.
Well, I haven't.
It's just that we don't discuss those sort of things.
And nobody ever even talked to you about it?
You mean S-E-X?
Don't tell me, like, they always spelled it out?
Always.
Oh, brother.
You don't know anything, do you?
Come on.
Okay, you guys, listen up.
You know, like, there was a time, not so long ago I might add, when all of us were just as deprived as Cheryl here.
So I say that we gotta help her.
I say that we take a pledge that before camp ends...
She sees a pinkie!
All right.
Are you sure?
Yes.
What's goin' on in here?
Nothin'.
Is that a fact?
Oh.
Whose is this?
No matter.
It's confiscated.
Just remember, ladies, that this is a cabin for proper young women.
There will be no talk of pinkies.
They're not play things, you know.
They're weapons.
Dangerous weapons.
Like loaded guns.
They can go off when you least expect it.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes, Fanny.
Good.
Oh, what a beautiful day.
You really think so, do you?
Boomer. Boomer. Boomer.
Boomer!
Uh, hey, Giddy, that you?
I can't see. I got a canoe on my head.
I noticed. Boomer, please, the lake's the other way.
Oh, thanks, Giddy.
Don't mention it.
Giddy.
I'm going lose...
Oh, oh!
I think I got a fish in my pants.
Oh, no, wait, it's just me.
Oh, what's it called?
Kybo. K-Y-B-O.
Keep your bowels open.
They were supposed to burn them when they switched over to what we have now.
I mean, no one will come here.
It's totally safe.
Yeah, I can believe it.
So what you think,
Meathead?
Kybo, huh? Okay.
That one.
I like that one.
Quarter-moon.
Good choice.
Thank you.
Oh, did somebody fart?
Oh.
Move 'em out.
Ten, hut!
Two fingers off the bridge of the nose, young trooper.
Ten, hut!
Chief Rawhide's here to see you, sir.
Hmm. Is he wearin' those damn feathers?
Yes, sir. Accented by some lovely little beads.
A lisp.
God damn it.
Foxglove, I heard a lisp.
I'll check into it, sir.
I hate feathers.
Bitch.
How?
Who?
Where?
Here.
What?
Rights to lake.
No acid rain.
Good.
No PCBs.
Great.
Clear like mountain stream.
I love it.
Many fish.
Hmm.
Wind surfing potential.
Ah-ha.
Good deal.
Hmm.
You make fair trade.
I'm a fair guy, Chief.
Honest Injun.
Injun.
Attention.
Good morning, Colonel.
You call these ankle biters campers, Giddy?
My God, it's worse than last year!
It's a goddamn waste of human potential.
Listen to me, you pipsqueak pistol packin' package of paramilitary paranoia...
How do you say that so fast?
I hear what you're saying, Colonel.
Well, of course, you can hear me.
We're only six inches apart.
No, no, no, no, I mean, I mean, I...
I respect your space.
I know where you're comin' from.
Oh, don't give me that communication bullshit, Giddy.
I'm here on a mission and I will not be heard!
I mean, you will not hear me.
You... Well, I'll tell you where I'm comin' from, Giddy.
I'm comin' from my lake!
Show him the papers, Foxglove.
Yes, sir.
It's mine. All mine!
From shore to shore.
Men!
You mean, the Chief sold you...
But I... Wait a minute.
Well, what good is my camp without a lake?
Exactly my point, Counselor.
This year's Champ Sunday is gonna be your last.
Foxglove!
Wait, Colonel, Colonel, Colonel, Colonel.
Please, please.
Let's...
Could we discuss this over lunch?
Lunch? You're nuts.
We're gonna pave this place, Foxglove.
We're gonna wall-to-wall concrete it.
We're gonna flank it with howitzers, and we're gonna bring a whole goddamn division of T-47s right here.
Relax. Relax.
I can handle this.
I can.
I hope he's okay.
It was your big idea.
Oh, I'm sorry, guys.
It's only me. Sorry.
What are you doing here?
I came to tell you
I'm okay.
Hey, what's goin' on out there?
Uh-oh, be cool, guys.
Be cool.
Sorry, Mr. Flash.
Easy, Barry, tell him you're just scared.
Just...
Scared.
Scared.
Your mothers will be a whole lot sorrier if the Flash misses out on his sleep.
Uh, yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Hit the sheets.
Meathead, you gotta start using the door around here.
You okay?
Was that close, guys, or was that close?
Oh, I've seen closer.
Well, maybe not that close.
What the goddamn hell is that, Foxglove?
Sounds like tambourines.
Whoa, Marcel.
Whoa, Havoc.
Colonel, what a pleasant surprise.
Don't give me that bleeding heart routine, Giddy.
I wanna know...
Wanna know what those... Priests.
Priests.
What are they doing?
Praying. Praying?
What are they praying for?
Likely a new home.
Home? Home, what home?
God's truth, Giddy.
What have you done?
Like I said, Colonel, what good's a camp with no lake?
But a temple.
Huh, temple? No.
No!
Yeah, I'm goin' back to the urban ghettos.
Poverty, crime, trash, disease, honest work.
Look, you can't do that.
I've had good years here.
Wonderful kids.
Some success stories.
I wanna give something back.
These people need a place to let their sheets down.
Hey, Giddy, no, you can't do it.
You can't do it.
You can't!
These people,
I hear they wipe with their bare hands.
That's just it.
They don't use water.
Giddy. Hey, Giddy, look,
I'll be the first to admit I've been rash.
Oh, now, wait.
Here comes one of them now.
Hi, Your Excellence.
Come in.
Oh, Giddy, are you outta your mind?
Your Excellence, please shake hands with a good friend of mine, Colonel Hershy.
I love you.
Oh, get him...
Get him outta here, Giddy.
Your Excellence,
Your Excellence, five minutes and then we'll finish the paperwork. Okay?
Giddy.
Giddy, Giddy, please.
You've got to listen to me.
Part of me hears what you say and then part of me doesn't.
Jackboots and marching tunes are a thing of the past.
Bare feet and mantras are taking over the country.
Oh, no, not you, Giddy.
Now listen.
There's gotta be some way.
There's always
Champ of the Lake.
Champ of the Lake?
What are you talkin' about?
Make sense, Giddy.
Our last fight, Colonel.
How about I hold off the sale?
Would you like that?
You're damn right
I'd like that.
You raise the stakes on Champ of the Lake,
I'll put a hold on their deal.
Raise the stakes?
Sure I'll raise 'em.
Christ, Giddy, you name it.
My camp for your water rights, all or nothing.
The whole shootin' match?
Kit and caboodle.
Lock, stock and barrel?
The works.
From here to eternity?
The whole enchilada.
Damn it, I'll take it.
I'll take the whole goddamn thing.
Foxglove!
Hook, line and sinker.
All right,
Mr. Dumbjohn.
Yeah?
I know what this is.
What does this mean?
This one's for you, this one's for the horse you rode in on.
Hey, hands off that horse.
That's my horse.
Ah-ha, I knew it would feed an army.
Why, you...
Didn't I tell you campers, no smokin'?
Didn't I?
Didn't I?
I should hope so.
Filthy habit.
The Colonel's expecting you.
Despot.
You called, sir?
Of course,
I'm called "sir!"
I'm a bloody colonel, aren't I?
Yes, sir.
Sergeant Paladin, your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to sound off like you got a pair, move out like you had a purpose, grab your squad, hit that assault craft, cross that lake and neutralize this idiot with extreme prejudice.
The ancient Sasquatch Indians used to boogie to this one and now so can you!
Are you gonna be okay here?
Yeah, I'll be fine.
Okay.
I wanna dance.
Oh, yeah? With what?
I want somethin' tall, lean and mean.
There's a horse outside, why don't you go get it?
I ain't into that sort of thing.
That's not what I heard.
Have you been talkin' about me again?
I don't care. Those guys are always talkin' about me. So what?
So what?
You wanna dance?
Shit.
Cheryl, uh,
I, uh...
Can you talk?
Yes.
Oh, it just seems like you're not that heavily into conversation.
Oh, well,
I'm just not used to it.
With boys, I mean.
Well, you can practice on me.
Okay.
Flash, people, they talk, you know, and...
Well, they say you're sort of mean.
Oh, yeah?
Just tell me who it is and I'll...
I mean, did they really say that?
About me?
Nah, I can't figure that out.
I mean, how many mean altar boys have you met?
You're an altar boy?
Are you kiddin'?
Me and the rabbi are like this.
Rabbi?
Oh, uh, well, see, that's what I call...
As a matter of fact, he can't kiss nothin' unless the Flash checks it out first.
Like the robes and the cups and the crosses and shit like that.
Listen, uh, you wanna get some holy water or somethin'?
Okay.
All right.
Yep, that's him all right.
You want me to drop him?
Get a grip on yourself, we got orders.
Okay, men, let's move out.
Psst.
Hey, come here.
Hey, who is that?
It's me, Boomer!
Oh.
Hey, I'm Boomer.
So will you do it?
I don't know. I mean, streaking's not such a big deal anymore.
Believe me, for some people it'll be a major deal.
So, uh, what do I get for pullin' it off?
Okay. You talked me into it.
Don't forget, it's Cabin 10.
Come on, Fanny,
I got the perfect place.
You seen Boomer?
Hi, Jamie, Fanny.
Have you seen Boomer?
Boomer?
No, he's not here.
No, he's not here.
Oh, Fanny, I'm sorry.
Okay, here you go!
Give me the other one.
Okay, okay.
Fanny?
Fanny?
Jamie?
Ta-da!
Oh, shit!
Hey, Meat, what you doin'?
What's happenin'?
Lookin' for somethin' to do.
Why the raincoat?
Oh, it's gonna rain.
Good, Meat, be prepared.
Hey, look!
Hey, he's doin' it again.
Hey, Meathead, come on.
You gotta act sorta normal around here.
You can't walk through stuff or people are gonna know you're, uh, different.
Yeah, you're right.
You guys go ahead.
I'm gonna practice walkin' around stuff.
So long, Meat.
See you later.
Okay.
Gee, I wonder when I'm gonna get to play basketball.
Or use a bow and arrow.
Somethin'. Anything.
Hey guys.
Uh, uh, excuse me.
Here.
Flash, why are you a dork?
Are you for real?
Yes. Are you for real?
No, no. I meant...
Forget it.
Flash, don't be afraid.
Me afraid?
Hey, I'm heavily into rockets and saucers, and well, creatures.
You guys know about this?
I mean, him?
Wait a second.
How long has he been here?
A few weeks.
And I didn't notice?
Uh, I guess I wouldn't have.
Nobody else has either.
I don't know.
He's no trouble.
We promise we won't let him bug you.
Flash, call me Meathead.
Okay, Meathead.
I'll take a shot.
Uh, you know, you're not such a dork, Flash.
Hey, Boomer, what gives?
He's goin' bozo, Crash.
I told him
I still got a right.
You gotta stop him, Crash.
They're gonna hurt him worser than me.
You don't mean he's gonna...
Yeah. You gotta tell him, Flash.
See, I don't need no knuckles to fight.
I don't need no hands or feet either.
You know why?
Because I'm gonna beat him with my brains. That's right.
I got more brains in my little finger than I do in my whole head.
Take it easy, will you?
I gotta think.
Yeah, you're lucky that way.
Look, I wanna fight.
What?
Champ of the Lake.
I'll take it.
Thanks, Flash, but it's my fight now.
I'm your fighter.
I thought the Flash don't do volunteer work.
Yeah. Well, that's a fact, but sometimes a situation comes up that calls for a little of the Flash's specialty.
Hey, I'm talkin' to you.
You?
Yeah, me.
Champ of the Lake?
Yeah.
I think I like it.
All right!
All right!
All right, Giddy!
Way to go!
Here you go, boy.
Ooh, yeah, Mad Dog. Ah!
Ooh, Mad Dog, Mad Dog.
Bad Mad Dog.
Get outta here.
I wonder what Giddy's got up his sleeve.
We need information,
Paladin.
Sir?
I want a prisoner.
Yes, sir!
Not one of ours, you tank tread!
One of theirs!
A goddamn red-blooded Sasquatch!
Yes, sir!
Hey, Flash.
What do you want?
Listen, I feel sorta funny about doin' this.
Doin' what?
Cheryl would kill me.
What for?
But I'm doin' it for her.
Of course you are.
What are you doin'?
Well, she wondered if you'd...
Oh, I shouldn't.
Yeah, she wondered what?
If you'd go skinny-dipping tonight.
Me?
I knew I shouldn't.
Me and her?
Yeah. Alone.
Tonight?
Down by the cove?
Okay.
Tell her I'll meet her there.
Tonight?
The shooting stars.
He wants you to watch with him.
The stars?
You know, like the Big
Dipper and stuff like that?
The Big Dipper?
Now remember, men, this is not an ordinary mission, this is the mission!
You all got your cyanide capsules?
Mmm-hmm.
All right. Now you people are the finest counterinsurgency team
I've ever trained here at Patton.
I don't want you screwin' it up!
You read me?
Yes, sir!
Move 'em out!
I want you to go through those Sasquatch creeps like crap through a goose!
By God, you pull this off and there'll be ice cream for dessert tomorrow!
A great night for shooting stars.
Yeah, and, uh, shooting moons?
Well, where do you ever see a shooting moon?
Mostly out of car windows.
We got the best view.
Hey, you guys, here comes Cheryl.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm glad you came.
Well, I didn't wanna miss it.
Yeah, me neither.
What's happening down there?
Shh, you want them to hear us?
No.
Look at there!
Lookie, quick. Look, look.
It's all new to me, you know?
Yeah, I kinda guessed that.
Do you mind explaining as we go?
Sure. No problem.
Oh, good.
This is called first base.
Where? I don't see it.
Sorry.
Look,
I thought I was gonna see the Big Dipper.
Yeah, we'll get to that.
Well, where is it?
Oh, my God.
Okay, this is it.
It's a nice spot.
Really secluded.
Are you sure it's safe?
Does a bear shit in the woods?
So you ready?
For what?
To go in the water.
The water?
Can you see better from the water?
Absolutely.
Oh, please.
You go over there and I'll go over here and I'll meet you in the water.
Okay.
I trust you, Flash.
Water?
Shh!
What is this?
Oh, what is that?
It's my compass.
It always points north.
Boy, what a show.
What's he doin'?
He just dropped his drawers.
Did you hear somethin'?
How can you see better from the water?
Flash?
Stop pushing me.
You stop shovin' me and I'll stop pushin' you.
Oh, Fanny.
It feels like a rock!
Oh, it is a rock.
Flash, is that you?
What the...
Flash?
There's a bear!
Uh, maybe we should find a new place.
Hi.
Hi.
Have you seen Flash anywhere?
No, not since last night.
Where is he?
He's ready, Paladin.
He's ready, aren't you, big fella?
Where is he?
He's ready.
Where is he?
Paladin, where is he?
Hey, Giddy! Come here.
Come here.
I want you to meet Mad Dog.
All right, heel, back!
Where's your boy?
He'll be along anytime now.
Oh, sure. Oh, sure.
I'm sure.
That is my dress.
Easy. Easy.
Flash look pretty.
Put 'em on.
Where have you been?
Some kind of private party?
Who am I fightin'?
It.
You're dead.
Yeah.
You're dead.
Why is he wearing that?
I don't know.
You're lookin' good,
Flash.
All right, listen up!
Now, this is gonna be a fair fight.
Throw any weird punches and I'm gonna be forced to get physical with you.
Any questions?
All right, shake hands.
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Get mad, Mad Dog!
Come on, kill, kill, kill!
Kill him.
Stop him! Stop him!
Get him, Mad Dog!
What are you doin'?
Disgusting!
Flash!
Get off of me, you fruit, and fight like a man!
Foul! Make war, not love!
Flash, look out!
You all right?
Look, stay away from him.
I'm stayin'.
Keep movin'.
I'm movin'.
Come back in here! You can't get away with it.
Come on, get back in here!
Come on, get in here!
I'm gonna kill you! Come on!
Yeah, little fruit, get on back in there!
Take your medicine!
One, two, three, four, five...
Okay, Mad Dog, I want you to stop fartin' around.
I want you to put him away, you hear me?
Get mad.
Get mad, Mad Dog.
Yeah.
That's a good boy.
Where am I?
Hey, come on, Mash.
Hey, Bloomer!
Uh, Fanny,
I know a place.
Please, I got it all figured out.
Whatever you have got figured out does not include me!
Fanny, please, I love them.
Them?
Uh, I mean, you.
Jab, jab, jab!
Keep runnin'.
That's it, move, move, move!
In the la bonzai!
Do you think he'll get up?
One, two, three, four...
Come on, Cash, kid, get up!
Yeah. Come on, Flash!
Wow!
Wha...
What kind of bull is this?
Come on, Flash!
Attaboy, Flash!
Come on, Mad Dog!
Sic him!
God, he really is a fairy.
What's goin' on?
You didn't tell us he could fly.
Come on, Flash, come on!
Come on!
Come on! Get down.
All right!
Hey, Giddy, how come you never taught me that?
Come on, big boy.
What you gonna do now, huh?
Come on, come on.
Hey, get down from there!
Hey, Ref!
Get outta here!
Get down!
That's against the rules!
Don't you dare tear that dress, buddy!
Come down from there!
Hi, Cheryl, what's happenin'?
Ref, get him down! Get him down!
It's illegal! No flying!
It's against the rules of war. No flying!
Get him down!
Foul! Foul!
Get him down!
Get him down!
You can do it!
Aliens.
Oh!
One, two, three, four...
Oh, Flash, Flash, come up!
Hey!
Hey, Ref!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Ha, ha!
I knew it!
I knew it!
Now that is what you call a pinkie!
It's all right, Flash.
No wonder they call him Flash.
Giddy, be reasonable.
What good is a camp without a lake?
Colonel, I'm sensitive to your needs, but a deal's a deal.
Oh, deal!
Hold it, hold it!
I hear where you're coming from, Giddy, but I've ordered a submarine for next year.
Colonel, you really have to refocus your energies.
Now, look, this winter
I'm offering a workshop.
New directions in lifestyle orientations.
You can't do this to me!
Giddy!
I'm warning you,
I'll be back!
Next summer, Giddy,
I'm gonna be back!
And I'll be back, Giddy!
So you like your present,
Meathead?
Oh, yes, Steve, it's really great.
Hello?
Anybody home?
Hey, Meathead, they're here.
Well, goodbye, guys.
Nice knowin' you,
Meathead.
Goodbye, Meathead.
Goodbye, Meathead.
Come on, Meathead.
Meathead!
Meathead!
Oh, I know.
Hmm.
Well, so we say at home, goot-a-bye, mulas.
Well, Mr. I-don't-want-to- go-to-summer-camp, did you have a good time?
Oh, it was really great, Dad.
Did you have a good trip?
Um, the usual.
Comets, meteorites, space junk.
Boy, it's a mess out there.
Sorry, Dad.
Where's Mom?
She makin' a big fuss over you.
She make your favorite.
Hot ginipganabs.
Bye, Meathead!
Bye, Meathead!
So long.
I was lookin' for you after the fight.
Yeah, well,
I was kind of embarrassed.
You've got nothing to be embarrassed about.
Come here.
I wanna give you something.
What?
Will you visit me?
Sure.
But what can we do at your house?
There's a pool out back.
It's a good place to see the Big Dipper.
Sounds good to me.
Yeah.

I met
Bob Howard today.
My old sweetheart
Clyde brought him over.
It's Clyde.
Keep that joker outside.
Hey.
Hi, Clyde.
Why don't you sit down?
No, I can't stay too long.
Bob and I are headed up to Cross Plains.
May I?
Bob who?
Howard.
You wanted to meet him?
Your writer friend?
Ooh, possibly.
Yeah, I want to meet him.
Why don't you bring him up to the house, and I'll go get another chair?
Can't you just come out to the car?
Bob's...
He's scared of your grandmother.
What did you tell him?
Only the truth.
Ah, forget it I'll bring him by another time.
Wait I'm coming.
- Howdy.
- Hi.
Bob, I'd like you to meet Novalyne Price.
Novalyne, this is Bob Howard, also known as Robert E. Howard.
Bob's the greatest pulp writer in the whole world.
Clyde tells me you write.
I try.
I haven't sold anything yet.
You going to
Daniel Baker College?
Mm-hmm, every other year.
I teach for my tuition money.
I was too dumb for college.
So, what kind of yarns do you write?
I've sent a couple stories to the confession magazines.
I think the editor meets them at the post office and throws them right back in the return mail.
It's tough getting started.
How'd you get started?
I had lots of other jobs,
None of them any good.
Clerking in a store's got to be one of the worst damn jobs a man can have.
I decided the only way I could keep from working was to start writing.
That's working, isn't it?
You're damn right it is, only I stay at home.
I'm the boss typewriter's the employee no arguments.
Do you practice?
I read the magazines I write for.
- The pulps.
- Yes.
They don't pay much.
Half a cent a word mostly so I stretch my yarns.
That's easy for me though I'm verbose.
I got plenty of words.
Do you try to write like the guys in the magazines?
Hell, no.
Let them try to write like me.
Bob's got a character going now called Conan.
Conan's the damnedest bastard there ever was.
Where can I find your stories?
Weird Tales publishes most of them.
Novalyne would never pick up a copy of that.
How much are you willing to bet?
What kind of magazines do you read?
In high school I read
Smart Set, Cosmopolitan,
Saturday Evening Post, what?
H.L. Mencken's rags.
Man who looks in the mirror.
Thinks he's shaving the face of God.
Thank you.
I've enjoyed meeting you, Bob.
I'd looked forward to it for a long time.
Thanks.
I've enjoyed it too.
Keep writing.
Bye.
Bye, bye, now.
Good afternoon.
As most of you know my name is Booth Adams.
I'm the town mayor at least for the time being.
I take a great interest in Cross Plains High.
We've got a great school, and we're gonna have a great school year.
You as teachers are responsible not only for the education of the children entrusted into your care, but for their spiritual welfare as well.
These children must have good examples, and teachers are their examples.
Now, that is a man, Ethel.
Oh, my, yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
Mrs. Smith will be right with you.
Oh, look they've got pecan pie.
Sorry, Ethel, the school board won't allow us to have pie.
That's enough, Novalyne.
- Who's that?
- That's Dr. Howard.
Do you know Bob Howard?
- I know Robert Howard.
- That's the one.
Robert Howard, the writer.
That's his daddy.
Does Bob ever come in here?
No, he doesn't.
I'll see him in the post office sometimes.
I've been told that he's kind of odd.
You got that right.
Well, I've met Bob and he's very nice.
Well, I'll tell you one thing he's not very friendly.
And the stories he writes, well
Well, what?
Well, Dr. Howard brought one in one time.
It was filthy not something a young lady would read.
Do you have a telephone?
It's right over there.
Operator.
Yes, Howard residence please.
I'll connect you.
Hello, who is this?
This is Novalyne Price.
I'm a new teacher here in town.
Is Bob there?
Robert's in Brownwood.
Can you have him call me when he gets in?
I'm boarding at Mrs. Hemphill's.
He can call me there.
I'll tell him goodbye.
Is he still writing?
Of course he is.
Oh, well, I'm interested in writing too, so.
Sure you are.
Have you heard from that young man?
You mean Robert Howard no.
Well, he's shy I hear.
Shy?
I'm the one who's supposed to be shy, and I've called him about a zillion times.
Every single time his mother tells me,
"Oh, he's writing he can't come to the phone", or "He's out of town but
I'll tell him you called."
"I'll tell him you called."
You know, I bet she's never told him that I called.
I bet that's it.
I'm sorry but that just makes me so damn mad.
Oh, God, Ethel, you've never said damn on a Sunday?
Well, Lord, no.
Think of the children.
What children?
Do you see any children in here for me to defile with my damns?
Good, let's get going.
Morning, cousin.
Girls and I are gonna take a little ride after church.
Would you like to join us?
Yes, yes, I would.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ethel.
There's not room for you maybe next time.
Shouldn't go running over to a man's house, especially one who's not returned any of your phone calls.
He's not interested in you, Novalyne.
Enid, I'm only gonna ask
Bob a question that's all.
I'm not gonna ask for his hand in marriage, and I'm not throwing myself at him.
How do I look?
Well, to ask a question you look just fine.
He stepped closer as if impelled by a powerful fascination.
Without the slightest warning he grabbed her up in a bearlike grasp.
She screamed a very ungoddess like scream, and there was a sound of ripping silk as with one ruthless wrench he tore off her skirt.
Goddess, ha.
You're Muriela,
Zargheba's dancing girl.
This crescentshaped birthmark on your thigh proves it.
I saw it once when
Zargheba was whipping you.
A year ago I saw you and
Akbitana with that swine.
I don't forget faces or women's figures.
Yeah?
Uh, hi.
I'd like to see Bob, please?
Bob.
Yes, I'd like to talk to Bob.
Mama, somebody out here wants to see Robert.
She can't, can she?
Who is it?
It's Novalyne Price.
Well, Robert's busy.
Hello.
Hello.
Come in how you been?
Hi, fine.
Well, come on in and meet my folks.
Mother?
This is Novalyne Price.
How do you do?
How do you do?
This is my dad.
- How do you do?
- Hi.
Well, I guess we'll go into the other room.
Have a seat.
Have a seat.
Thank you.
- I can't.
- Would you like something to?
Go ahead that's all right.
I was just gonna say that
I can't stay very long.
I've got some people waiting for me in the car.
Well, tell them to leave I'll take you home.
- Would you?
- Hell, yes.
All right.
Be right back.
Really, Novalyne.
You girls can go on.
Bob says he'll take me home.
So, what brought you over?
Writing.
I wanted to ask you a question.
I'm still getting notes and rejection slips.
Oh.
Well, everybody gets them.
I still get them.
Yeah, but you sell.
Well, a man's got to make a living some way.
I was writing when you knocked on the door.
Didn't you hear me?
Do you always tell a story as you're writing it?
It's a hell of a noise, ain't it?
I find if I talk them out, hear the words, the yarn goes a little smoother.
Oh, so the voice brings the words to life.
You're absolutely right.
Absolutely.
Listen, why don't I take you home now?
We could ride around a while.
Okay, I'd like that.
Well, let's ride.
All right.
So, how was Brownwood?
Brownwood I don't know.
I haven't been in months.
- You haven't?
- No.
I called last week your mother told me you'd gone to Brownwood.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
I could have misunderstood her.
That must be it.
I might have been working right then and couldn't talk.
Oh, I see.
My folks are pretty good about me staying at home all the time.
Just pull right there.
That's it.
Every bastard in this twobit town thinks I ought to be out working.
That's hard on my family.
Ha, I say to hell with what they think.
When I'm writing I am working.
You know that.
I get to going on a yarn,
I can't be disturbed.
You just misunderstood.
I'm sure I did.
It's a pretty night.
Yes, ma'am.
Things are in the sear and yellow leaf.
That's a beautiful harvest moon.
I suppose you're responsible for it.
By all means I designed that specially for you.
Oh, you knew I was coming over.
You're damn right I did.
I was going along with old Conan and suddenly you popped out of the typewriter.
I said to myself, "Robert
Howard, you big, ugly lummox,
"there's a girl who's gonna appreciate your moonlight."
I think you're a poet.
Well, girl, there's not many women that can appreciate a thing like that.
I do.
Well, you're one in a million.
One in a million.
Why don't you tell me about your character, Conan?
Conan?
Conan is the damnedest bastard there ever was.
He's got a long black mane of hair, crystal blue eyes.
He's a fighter.
Born on a battlefield.
To him combat's a way of life.
It's all he's ever known, all he ever wants to know.
He's no soldier who was taught to fight.
To him fighting is an instinct.
It's a part of him, like his legs, his arms, his chest, his bull neck. and believe me he don't take it from nobody.
He'll fight man, beast, devil, or god, and when those women feel those treetrunk firm arms around their waist, well, they melt like butter on a hot skillet.
Aw, hell.
I've been blabbing all night long.
Hey, girl, why don't you tell me to shut up?
Let you talk for a while.
Tell me about teaching school.
Those kids ever give you any trouble?
Never.
Not if they know what's good for them.
I don't take it from nobody man, beast, devil, or student.
I'll bet you don't.
Novalyne, I want to ask you a question.
If it's none of my business, you tell me pretty damn quick.
Don't you worry I will.
I want to know about you and Clyde.
I was wondering if...
Well, you might still be carrying a torch for him.
Clyde happens to be married, in case you haven't heard.
He's a good friend of mine, and he always will be but that's all.
You're not heartbroken?
I've got a strong heart, Bob.
Well, good.
Now that's settled how about tomorrow night?
Well, I don't have a date for tomorrow night.
Well, girl, you've got one now.
I'll be by about 7:00.
Okay.
About that moon I'll order another one for you.
Okay, sure do appreciate them.
Hey.
Your publisher called from New York while you were out with that girl.
What did he say?
He wanted to know how your story was going and if you were going to meet his deadline.
Did you say I would?
Well, I told him he was foolish to think otherwise.
You've never missed a deadline.
That's right.
Hang on.
They're thinking of using it for the February cover story.
As well they should.
Oh, son, I hope I did the right thing.
Mr. Wright wanted to know if it was okay to give out your address to a Mr. Lovecraft?
He said that he was a big fan of yours and wanted to write you.
H.P. Lovecraft?
Yes, I believe that was his name.
The gentleman was from Rhode Island.
Well, Jesus, yes.
Did you say yes?
Yes, of course I said yes.
Hey, you'd better hurry up he'll be here any second.
Calm down.
He can wait.
A girl has to look her best on a first date.
He's here.
How do I look?
Just beautiful.
Thanks.
Have a good time.
I will, I hope.
Oh, he's fine.
He's working hard as usual.
- Oh, he's a great doctor.
- Pardon me.
Well, I didn't know.
I at least thought you'd have on a coat or a tie.
Well, I got on a clean white shirt by God.
I brought this for you.
You said you wanted to read some of my stuff.
I brought this.
It's called The Devil in Iron.
Thank you I sure do want to read it.
Well, okay, there it is.
I'm sorry I didn't get all dressed up.
I didn't think we'd go to a show or anything.
I just thought we'd drive around a while, and I'd shoot my mouth off some more.
If there's one thing I'm good at, that's driving and blabbing.
When I got a pretty girl with me, it makes it that much better.
What's that story about the one that you gave me?
The Devil in Iron.
Yeah.
Well, what do you think it's about?
I don't know a devil made of iron.
Bullseye.
Evil lord baits a trap for
Conan on this desolate island.
Guess what the bait is.
A pretty girl.
You read this yarn before, girl?
No, swear I didn't.
Conan, he finds this fantastic city which has been mysteriously rebuilt overnight.
Now, he creeps in
No, don't tell me.
I want to read it.
It sounds exciting.
Excitement's my specialty.
Your specialty, huh?
Uh-huh, that's right excitement and adventure.
That's what the readers want.
That's what I give them.
What kind of stories you been writing lately adventure, romance, teaching school?
I write down conversations that I hear in my journal for practice.
Sometimes I try a confession.
You got a lot to confess?
It depends whether I write about what I do or what I think about doing.
No luck, though it still all gets sent back.
Thank you.
What was your last one about?
It's a little hard to explain.
It was called I Gave
My Daughter Movie Fame.
What did you say?
It's for the confessions.
Aren't those stories a little bizarre?
What's it called?
I Gave My Daughter Movie Fame.
Really, what's it about.
I'm not gonna tell you until you stop laughing at me.
A woman has an illegitimate child a daughter.
The child is adopted by her aunt, but the mother can't give her up, so she keeps helping her in secret and...
What?
Eventually she helps her become a movie star and very famous.
Stop laughing.
It's not that silly, is it?
Don't pay any attention to me.
I don't know a thing about illegitimate daughters or movie fame.
Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time.
Well, I haven't seen any giant snakes or big-busted naked women frolicking through the West
Texas hills lately.
Oh, but I have.
You look more closely next time.
I try to write about people with ordinary problems, real people.
No, that's where we're different.
I write about another age, another way of life.
Man struggling to survive that's my formula.
Well, you know those tiny farmhouses we passed on the way out?
Those are the people
I wanna write about.
Not me.
I can't write about men who toil along on a farm, get drunk, beat up a wife who can't fight back.
Uh-huh, I can't write about hate like that.
Well, just 'cause you're poor and you work hard doesn't mean you're hateful.
You've lived a sheltered life.
You don't know these people out here I do.
Well, your stories sell, so people must wanna read about muscle men who wrestle monsters and girls in skimpy dresses who don't do a darned thing but sit around and watch.
You stick with me, girl,
I'll teach you about writing and men.
Although
I was completely disappointed by his appearance, there was something appealing about him.
Maybe it was the way he laughed at my story.
He's asked me to go to the picture show this Sunday.
I think I might go.
How's my best gal?
You ready to go?
You look great.
Well, this fool hat kind of bothers me.
Ain't the kind of hat
I ought to be wearing.
Why not?
Well, you take those hats the Mexicans wear sombreros.
There's a hat.
Keeps the sun off real good.
Yeah.
Well, are you ready?
You look mighty pretty today.
I like that perfume you're wearing.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, and I hope you'll have your picture made for me in that suit.
- You mean with this hat on?
- Yes, with that hat on.
You look very handsome.
I got a weak chin you see how it recedes into my neck?
- You do not.
- Yes, I do.
My friend, Truett, he's got a really weak chin.
One little tap he'd be out cold.
Mine's weak but it would take a hell of a blow to knock me out.
Well, do you know many people in Brownwood?
Well, I know a few.
I know some girls.
You do?
Name one I might know her.
I know this girl foreign gal Jasmina Divine.
Never heard of her name someone else.
I don't know.
Let me see.
Oh, I know most the beautiful girl I've ever seen.
Who?
Miss Dolores of the House of Dalton.
Yeah, she rings a bell.
Listen old Clyde and I were in Woolworth's shopping.
We saw this stunning girl.
Blonde hair, sparkling eyes, flawless skin it was
- Dolores Dalton.
- That's right.
I just dropped dead right there in the aisle, thump.
She walked like a queen.
Shoulders straight, golden hair bouncing down her back.
Yeah, I've heard she was pretty.
The most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
Beautiful big bosoms.
This girl she was the most beautiful.
Hey, girl.
Hey, hell, you be careful with that.
That thing is loaded.
Give me that.
- No. No.
Why do you have a gun, Bob?
Let go.
You never know who you'll run into around here.
Now give it here.
I've been around guns before.
I have.
You carry it all the time?
Hell, yes.
You think it's just for Sundays?
Look here.
See how dressed up I am?
I look like I got a lot of money, right?
Well, you look like a million but I don't think
Suppose we got a flat and I get out and fix it.
Some half-baked gunman drives by.
I'd gotta be ready to shoot first.
Oh, I got you.
This is a dangerous part of Texas.
Those outlaws and vagrants they're all here.
Yeah,
I've got a gun.
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
You got it with you?
No, I don't have it with me.
Well, good I'd hate to try and kiss you and get shot.
Novalyne, look.
Only in Texas do you ever see a sunset like that.
Girl, I hope you appreciate everything I've done for you today.
Now, that's a beautiful sunset if I do say so myself.
- That crazy guy?
- He is not crazy.
He's a writer.
Enid, you're an English teacher you should respect that.
Not what he writes.
I wouldn't touch one of those trash magazines.
He uses words beautifully.
He read me one of his poems the other day.
It was so amazing.
I can't believe how he can
Hey.
Look at that guy across the street.
What on earth is he doing?
Novalyne, come here get a look at this.
Come on.
Now, isn't that the strangest thing you ever did see?
What do you suppose he's doing?
I guess he thinks he's Max
Schmeling or something.
Hey.
Jesus, girl, I almost walloped you.
Yeah, you sure did.
Why ain't you teaching school?
I am I'm on my lunch break.
I just thought I'd say hi.
You almost got a broken nose for your trouble.
Yes, I did.
What were you doing just now with that punching thing?
I got this boxing yarn
I been thinking about going in my head.
Come with me I wanna show you something.
Come on.
So this is your stomping ground, huh?
For now.
Whoa.
How's that after-school play coming along?
Good, we're gonna perform it real soon.
Do you wanna come see it?
Maybe, if I'm not too busy.
Still more a fool I shall appear by the time I linger here.
With one fool's head I came to woo, but I go away with two, sweet adieu.
I'll keep my oath patiently to bear my wroth.
- Very nice.
- Thank you.
You ever directed any Shakespeare?
We do a couple scenes in class, but he's a little bit heavy for this neck of the woods.
You know, when I read his plays,
I can't see that men have changed much since the 1500s.
Men still hate other men.
Well, in the civilization we live in, men become more depraved and demonic all the time.
Oh, it's not that bad.
Girl, when they discovered oil in Cross Plains, you wouldn't believe the scum that moved in here.
- Novalyne, I...
- Thieves, drunkards, wifebeaters, sex deviants not a decent man among them.
What about your father?
He's a good man, isn't he?
You're damn right he is.
He's the only one I know.
What about your friend Clyde and your other friend Truett?
Well, you don't stick to the subject.
You bring up a bunch of irrelevant nonsense to keep yourself from seeing the truth.
Maggots of corruption are all around you.
Hospitals and schools.
- What?
- Hospitals and schools.
They heal, they teach you use them, but you don't give society credit for them?
We men made a hell of a mistake when we sent women to college and gave you the vote.
You just watch it.
See you Friday.
Now that's beauty that's the kind of beauty my ancestors love.
Novalyne, do you think it's possible for a woman to love just one man forever?
I don't know, Bob.
But you know this is the first time I've ever talked about love in the middle of a field during a thunderstorm.
Whew, I'm in the mood to write a love story.
We're here.
Hey, mama.
- Oh, baby.
This is Bob Howard.
Bob's the writer I've been telling you about.
Mama, Mammy.
Howdy, Mammy, nice to meet you.
You too, Bob.
Nice to meet you, too, Mrs. Price.
Welcome, Bob.
Take a seat.
Thank you.
I understand you've been lending a hand with Novalyne's writing hopes.
Well, I been holding it out, but so far she ain't took hold of it.
That is not true.
I listen to every word you say, Bob.
Well, your ears must be keeping it a secret,
'cause your hands ain't been typing it out.
I think Novalyne should teach.
That's what she's good at.
Well, maybe I'll do both.
Well, it don't work that way.
Hey, something smells good in here.
Good deeds in this house do not go unrewarded.
Yes.
Thank you for bringing
Novalyne home, Bob.
Hello, honey how you doing you feel alright?
Hi, my throat's a little sore.
Well, goddamn if you just stayed home like I told you, you'd be feeling fine now.
When will you be up and around?
By Saturday I hope.
And what happens then?
Mayor Adams is throwing a Christmas party, and, Bob, I want you to come with me.
I'm sorry I can't go.
Why not?
I don't have time for some tea drinking, cookie pushing party.
That's not what it is, you bastard.
A bastard.
You calling me a bastard after everything I done for you.
Don't I wear a tie and that goddamn full hat every time we go out.
Bob, you're gonna have to learn how to mix with people.
You can't just...
- If I listened to you my writing would go to hell.
It would not.
Sure it would you're not a writer.
If I wrote like you ill be wasting my damn time.
Scribbling down conversations of every Tod, Dick and jackass I met.
That ain't writing that's copying.
I still want you to go with me.
Aw, Christ I'll see those sons of bitches in hell before I make one of their parties.
You wanna learn to be a writer
I'll show you what it takes.
Mama, the car won't start.
Goddamn bastard.
Dear Novalyne, the French have one gift the ability to gild decay and change the maggots of corruption to the hummingbirds of poetry as demonstrated by this volume.
Hey, what you got there?
It's a book.
Bob sent it to me.
Next time I see him
I'm going to kill him.
You needed to act like whores I swear it.
Why you sacrilegious little hussy.
Do you not fear God's craw?
Is there no honesty anywhere?
And she danced just like the spin of a desert whirlwind, like the leaping of a quenchless flame.
Her white feet spurned the blood-stained deck.
Sweat beaded the forehead of the man facing her, and his eyes were like burning coal.
Smite as he would, he could not break past nor beat down her guard.
She stepped back to draw him out, felt her thighs lock in an iron grip.
His breath came in gusty gulps.
Bob?
You have a phone call.
Hi, it's me.
Novalyne, are you back?
No, I'm still at home.
Merry Christmas, by the way.
Merry Christmas to you too.
Are you still mad at me?
Yes, but not as much.
Hey, Bob, the
Pierre Louis book...
What are you doing now?
Well, not much.
I'm coming over.
Oh, Bob, you don't have to.
Now, you read that book.
No, that book is horrendous.
I can't imagine the fool who wrote it.
A fool?
My Conan yarns are full of sex.
They are?
Hell, yeah.
That's what he did.
Drinking, whoring, fighting what else is there to do in life?
I'm sorry, but I don't see anything sexy about a naked woman dancing around a pirate ship.
You don't?
No.
Well, for God's sakes
I mean she was dancing the mating dance.
I mean what could be more sexy than that?
God I thought she was crazy like you.
Then what do you think would make a sexy story?
Naked women aren't sexy what is, naked men?
I'd look the other way.
You probably would.
A few years ago,
I had a hard time selling sex yarns.
Now I got to work double time just to keep up with the market.
Before long there won't be nothing held back.
Sex will infest everything books, radio, newspapers.
Everything.
Hell, yes.
That's the way it was when Rome fell.
Rape and murder took place on the stage.
Damn people loved it.
I'm sorry I can't come in my mother's...
Expecting her medicine I know.
Here's another
Christmas present.
- Thank you.
- I hope you don't stick this one under the house.
I walked around the
Santa Anna mountains a few days ago, beautiful.
I believe that we carry around the lives of our former ancestors deep in our memories.
You ever read something in history and felt you knew it?
Yeah.
Maybe something bet involving Indians?
Oh, yeah I had this vision of an Indian girl gazing out over the prairie all the time.
Well, there you go.
That's an ancestral memory.
I don't understand why would I have ancestral memories about Indians if there are such things?
Remember during the
Christmas holidays my mother saw you shopping.
She asked me if you had any Indian blood, maybe as much as half Indian?
I wonder why she'd think that.
It's the shape of your face.
Do you know how much
Indian blood you have?
None that I know of.
I bet you got a drop or two.
We are human because our ancestors were human.
That's one thing that persuades me the bible was right.
I can imagine a lot of things, but I can't imagine man was once a monkey.
Hey, have you heard from that writer friend of yours
Lovecourt?
- Lovecraft.
I did get something in the pouch.
Read down in the middle there.
What's it say there, Novalyne?
He says that you are the modern master of fantasy.
Well.
A letter like that makes it worthwhile to be a writer.
Yeah, I see it does.
The next best thing to a Texas sunset is a Texas rain shower.
One of the things life does have to offer a simple thing but a good thing.
Yep.
If you ask me you spend too much time getting them kids ready.
You look worn out.
- I'll be alright.
Well, hell I've got to go out to Temple at the end of the week for my mother's operation.
I don't need another sick girl around.
So soon when are you gonna be back?
I'll stay as long as I have to.
Thanks for the time you've given me, Novalyne.
I've enjoyed every minute with you knowing you.
Well, I look forward to having you back.
Come on wake up.
Come on hard head wake up.
Dr. Howard.
How's Mrs. Howard?
Yep, she's holding her own.
Robert will be alright now.
- Has he been sick too?
- No, no he hadn't.
You really like my son, don't you?
Yeah.
But Bob he...
Robert's real close to his mother.
We're all real close to our mothers.
But we manage to get along without them eventually.
We do.
Robert's a stranger to me, Miss Price.
He's in his own little world most of the time.
I'm not privy to it unlike you.
This one went smooth as silk.
Hell, I can write shoot-em ups.
I got a hankering to write something bigger.
Yeah, a novel, maybe.
Hey, girl.
Let me walk ahead here.
Why?
I got to keep an eye out for rattlesnakes.
- Rattlesnakes?
- Yes.
Don't worry I can handle reptiles, especially giant diamond-back rattlers, two-foot fangs dripping with poison.
Oh, yes.
That is a, oh.
Ah, just joking that's all.
That's enough.
Robert E., you lead on and keep quiet.
It's beautiful.
You can see the whole world from up here.
And others as well.
There you are.
Why don't you tell me about that novel?
Set in Texas.
It's gonna be about the hardships of the early pioneers, and their conflict with the Indians who were trying to save the land they loved.
I figure it'll be the best damn book ever written about frontier life.
It sounds fascinating.
I know what I can do.
No one can write about this country like I can.
I'll be nicer to the
Indians in this novel.
Thank you.
I'll have this beautiful, fully-dressed Indian girl.
The hero will fall in love with her.
He'll be this morose, ungainly misfit among men.
Why does he have to be a misfit?
Why can't he be handsome and kind?
You're still a dreamer, girl.
He's got to be handsome, huh?
Well, to hell with it.
He'll be the most handsome man in the west, with the fastest gun boom, boom, boom.
Christ Almighty slow down, girl.
If you were Mojave I'd have to shoot you for wasting water.
You'd shoot your best girl for that?
I can't help it that's the law of the desert.
I swear why do
I go out with you?
You got me there.
If I was you I'd a high-tailed it away from me a long time ago.
You don't give yourself enough credit.
You have some wonderful qualities.
- Is that so?
- Yeah.
Like what?
Well, your thoughtfulness, your loyalty, your intelligence, humor, imagination.
I could go on and on.
If you don't think a woman is attracted to that you're mistaken.
That's what I see in you.
Well, I...
I appreciate it, girl.
Don't be fooled.
I'm the kind of man that needs to be free.
I can't be tied down.
No, the road I walk I walk alone.
It's funny how women are attracted to that quality as well.
Hi, I'm here to pick up a package.
The name's Truett Vinson.
V-I-N-S-O-N.
Oh, yeah here it is.
Thank you, sir.
Excuse me.
Hi.
- Hi.
Did you say your name was Truett Vinson?
Yes, ma'am.
Well, hi, I'm Novalyne Price.
I believe we have a mutual friend.
- Oh, who's that?
- Bob Howard.
- Bob, really.
- Yeah.
How do you know Bob?
Well, I teach in Cross Plains.
We're friends.
So do you see a lot of Bob up there in Cross Plains?
Off and on whenever he has time.
But you two weren't serious or anything?
Oh, no, no.
He's made it very clear to me many times that he is not the marrying kind.
He has to be free.
The road he walks...
- He walks alone.
Yes.
That's what he says, alright, isn't it?
How often did you go to the movies?
Every now and then.
You think Bob will ever go by himself?
Only if the picture was some wild action movie with lots of sword-fighting and stuff like that you know?
Who is it?
It ain't no tramp.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
I thought you might like to take a ride.
It's
5:30 in the morning.
I know.
Come on, get dressed I got something special to show you something you might appreciate.
Come on.
Hold on.
So, how's your summer been going?
Okay.
We had some rain about a week ago.
Yeah, the farmers sure needed it.
I met Truett
Vinson this weekend.
Oh, yeah, how's he getting along?
Good.
You know, he and Clyde work for the same company.
Poor fool's a bookkeeper.
Pushing papers all day long that's a job you'd never catch me doing.
When's the last time the three of you were together?
Long time.
Too long I ought to give them iron heads a call, see if they don't wanna go out on the prowl.
What exactly do you do out on a prowl?
Drink beer and talk about girls.
Lie about them is more like it.
Don't you talk about any serious subjects?
That is serious.
Sure we do.
We argue plenty.
I wanna wring Clyde's neck sometimes he makes me so mad.
What do you argue about?
You ever read The
Vicar of Wakefield?
Did you like it?
- Yes, I did.
Well, that's too damn bad.
I thought it was the sorriest book I ever read.
I wonder what you'd do if a student told you that.
If he told me I didn't know what I was talking about?
- Right.
- Well, it depends on his attitude.
The vicar was a lousy old bastard.
The villain seduced and raped his daughters, and the old fool took it piously.
No, he had a sweet and generous nature.
He forgave and then he repented his mistakes.
You know I thought you'd say that.
They offer you a spoonful of manure, and you gulp it on down.
- What?
- I know exactly what you'd if a kid disagreed.
You'd bawl him out.
If he was being rude, I would, but if we were just talking about something...
Sure you would.
It's thanks to teachers like you that there's no room for individual thought in schools today.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
Oh, really?
Well, yeah, that's right.
Thanks indeed thank God.
If it wasn't for teachers like me, there would be more individuals like you socially inept, hating the world, prattling off pompous ideas that nobody wants to hear in the first place.
Bob Howard, if you do not take some initiative, you are gonna end up a miserable old man sitting at home with no friends and no life.
And another thing.
Don't you ever, ever imply that I do not know how to teach, because then you really are talking about something that you know nothing about.
Now, why don't you run on home?
Your mama's waiting for you.
Novalyne.
Novalyne, get in the car.
- No.
- Get in the goddamn car.
No.
Hell, come on, girl, get in here.
Go away.
I'll keep chasing you all day long.
Now, get in the damn, get in the goddamn car.
Ugh, men.
All men can go to hell.
We are.
Every damn one of us.
Guess who came by my house this morning?
- I don't know who?
- Bob.
He wants me to go down to New Mexico with him.
Do you think Bob knows we're dating?
Mm, yeah, he does now.
Really?
Yeah, I mentioned to him that we met at the post office, and we'd been to the movies a couple times.
What happened was he mad?
No, I don't think so.
Well, Truett, either he was or he wasn't.
Well, he kind of ignored me.
He didn't say a word.
He didn't seem mad.
He asked me if I'd read
The Vicar of Wakefield.
Dear Novalyne, the weather is good.
The beer is lousy.
Hoping you are the same, Bob.
Dear Bob, summer's flying by as it always seems to do.
Where have you been?
I hope you're not still mad at me.
If so, I apologize.
Let me know the next time you'll be coming down, hopefully at a reasonable hour.
Love, Novalyne.
Dear Novalyne, thank you for your invitation to call, but you honestly can't expect me to enjoy ridicule and contempt so much that I'd come back for another dose.
You understand me I think, but I'll make myself clear.
You and Truett haven't played fair with me, concealing the fact that you were going together.
Both of you had plenty of opportunities to tell me, but instead you made a secret of it, and no doubt laughed at me because of it.
Taking advantage of a friend's trust to try and make a fool of him seems a poor triumph,
Robert E. Howard.
- Robert E. Howard.
Obviously, I made a grave error in befriending a pathetic man like yourself, and I now consider my association with you over and finalized.
My only regret is the time wasted spent in your company.
Sincerely, Novalyne Price.
Well, say something.
Seemed like such a nice man.
It's a shame he won't be coming over any more.
Mama, what do you think?
You said it now tear it up.
Why after that hateful letter,
I should tell him to go to hell.
Don't end the friendship, Novalyne.
He's been a good friend.
Why don't you write another letter?
Say what you really wanna say.
Dear Bob, although you leave nothing for me to say, being a woman I'll say something anyway.
During the time I went with you,
I realized perfectly how you felt about women.
Freedom was the first law you recognized.
Strange as it may seem,
I too demand my freedom.
I didn't think you'd resort to middle-class melodrama, and I can't believe that you really in your heart feel that we've betrayed you.
In my last letter,
I was of the opinion that we were still friends, and invited you to call, assuming that our friendship would continue as it had in the past.
I apologize for having made that mistake.
Please know that you will always have my sincere wishes for your continued success and happiness.
Sincerely, Novalyne Price.
Mr. Howard called.
Dr. Howard?
No, Robert Howard.
What'd he say?
He said he'd be over tonight.
Hm, did he want me to call him back and confirm?
No, ma'am.
Well, I am gonna call Mr. Howard and tell him where he can really go tonight.
Mmhmm.
I am.
Believe me straight to hell.
Howdy.
Hi, Bob, how you doing?
Fine.
Everything's fine.
So, what do you think of my buttermilk catcher?
You remember that Kipling yarn you told me about?
Yes.
What was it that girl said?
She said kissing a man without a mustache was like eating eggs without salt.
You like your eggs with salt, don't you?
No, I'll have mine plain.
How are things at home?
Not good.
My mother's getting weaker by the day.
I can never repay her for all she's done for me.
Well, she's not expecting to be repaid.
She believed in my writing from the beginning.
She had faith.
You made her very proud, Bob, but now you've got to lead your own life.
I lead my own life.
Don't think for a second I don't.
I'm thirsty let's go into town.
I made some lemonade.
I want something more substantial.
You got something better to do?
Last month I sold yarns to Action Stories,
Top Notch, and Weird Tales.
I sold a grand old Conan yarn to Mr. Wright.
I think it's the best work I ever done.
Conan is after this hardheaded warrior woman, a real spitfire of a girl.
They find a city that's inhabited by two tribes.
One's ruled by an evil sorceress.
She drains the youth from young, nubile women
Good heavens.
Which the tribe sacrifices in an orgy-like ceremony, stripped naked, chained to a bloody altar.
I would like to go home now.
Orgies and chained naked women my God, Bob.
Aw, hell, you pay too much attention to what people think.
If they don't feed you or put clothes on your back, then what they think ain't worth a damn.
That's right I care.
I care what those people think.
Why did you come here tonight?
Huh, why?
Miss Price, imagine meeting you here.
Hey, how about it nice?
Hey, girl.
- Oh, God.
Jesus, girl, wait up.
What are you in such a hurry for?
- I have to be somewhere.
- Yes, he does.
Well, I'll walk you home.
Heard you and Truett are saving lives these days.
What?
Yeah, I heard you took some people to the hospital after they'd been in an accident.
Yeah, that's true.
Good heavens.
I also hear you took off your jacket so nobody would bleed on it.
It was my new white pigskin jacket.
I didn't wanna ruin it.
Well, I've always said we're really an advancing society when we're so willing to save lives we don't want to endanger our white pigskin jacket.
You make me sound like a monster.
I am not a mean person.
I just didn't want somebody who wasn't really badly hurt bleeding all over my new white pigskin jacket.
If he was bleeding he was hurt.
Oh, shut up,
Bob, just shut up.
Hello, Hemphill residence.
Miss Price, please.
Bob?
Oh, it's you I didn't recognize your voice.
Hi, how've you been?
Good, good.
Hey, would you like to see a show tonight?
Well, I've got an awful lot of work to do tonight.
Come on I just took my suit out.
I'm all dressed up.
Have you shaved that mustache?
Son,
I need you in here.
How's my mama?
Okay, all right.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Come on.
Come on.
Okay.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Okay, I'm setting you down now.
Okay.
Thank you.
All right.
Don't you run away.
I'm cold.
Okay.
Let's get this wet thing off.
Okay.
All right, mama, let me get this.
Arms up.
- Okay.
There you go.
Okay, now, you can go ahead and lean back.
Here you go.
Here you go.
Here you go.
Here you are.
Thank you.
There you are.
Are you going out with that little Indian girl tonight?
No, what and leave my best gal?
I don't wanna spoil your evening.
You ain't spoiling it.
Where our life this forever, you'd only too little to give.
But here tonight we sever for life loves life to live.
And the higher a man may travel the lower may he fall.
And the scheme that I must unravel it was never meant for all.
I'm gonna miss you, son.
I'm gonna miss you most of all.
You ain't going nowhere.
Will you stay with me until your father gets home?
And bring that girl around the house sometime.
I'd like to meet her again.
Hi.
So you made it, huh?
I'm sorry.
Something came up.
We're gonna miss our show.
That's all right.
We could drive around for a while if you want.
Okay, that'll be good.
So, what you been up to?
Same old thing.
My students have been a little restless lately.
Oh, yeah?
Well, when you're young you feel the lust for adventure buried in your subconscious.
You don't want to be bothered with dreary things like school.
I see.
How's your mother?
Not well at all.
I can't write or do anything except take care of her.
What do you mean you can't write?
My mother requires my constant care.
She has these terrible night sweats.
I changed her gown three times last night.
That's not your job.
Aw, damn it, you do what needs to be done.
I can't let her lay there wet and uncomfortable.
Why don't you hire a nurse?
You've got the money.
You are not required...
- No, you can't...
- to give up your life.
- Listen to me.
I'm required to give up anything and do whatever needs to be done.
Not your work.
Not your livelihood, Bob.
What's work?
A man can do any kind of work.
Work ain't worth a damn unless you do it for somebody you love.
I'm losing her damn it I know that.
I want a woman to love, a woman to believe in me.
Is that so much to ask?
No, it's not.
It's not.
And I'm sure you'll find one.
You're an extraordinary man.
If you don't love me, say so.
I know you loved me once.
I believe in you, Bob, I do.
I do.
And do you love Truett?
If it's Truett you love, say so.
Say it, goddamn you.
Say it.
I don't love anyone.
I don't love anyone at all.
I don't love anyone.
I did love you but you weren't ready.
You told me so yourself.
You said, "I can't be tied down."
You said so yourself.
- Well, I didn't know what I was talking about.
I know but there's other reasons too.
We have all these differences and they're gone be there.
But differences can be overcome, can't they?
Yeah.
Yeah, they can.
Tell me that you'll change your attitude.
Tell me that you'll get out once in a while, and that you'll try to let go of your mother.
Tell me that now.
Bob, tell me that now.
I'm going to Louisiana
State this summer.
I've been accepted.
You made good with your writing, and I'm gonna make good with something too.
I'm gonna teach.
Oh.
You dedicate yourself to kids in some small, apathetic town what will you get out of it?
Not even a thank you.
I'm not doing it to be thanked.
Well, you got a great cause.
To make life worth living a man or a woman you got to have a great love or a great cause.
I have neither.
Don't say that that's not true.
That's a colorful sweater you got there.
It's an LSU sweater.
The other teachers gave it to me so I'd be ready when I got there.
Hell, I know you'll be ready.
Question is will they be ready for a spitfire like you?
I'm sure they've seen their share of spitfires.
I don't know about that.
Texas spitfires and
Louisiana spitfires are two entirely different breeds.
Hmm.
Come on get in I'll take you for a drive.
Suppose you were a lonely, beautiful girl who came out here to take in the sunset.
While you were watching it a handsome Indian brave stepped out of them trees there.
Now, what you do about it would be the yarn that you'd write.
See I can imagine the sunset, and I can see the Indian brave, but that's as far as I go.
That's where the story ends.
Why stop when it just gets interesting?
Because the next thing you know,
I'd be telling him to wash off the war paint and get a good suit of clothes and accompany me to Sunday School.
Something tells me he just wouldn't wanna do that.
When I saw that house,
I thought about the yarns that you write.
Your dream.
The dream that brought you over to my house that day.
Bob.
Thanks for bringing me out here, and thanks for telling me what's wrong with my stories.
I mean that.
Well, you're welcome.
It's only my opinion you don't have to listen to it if you don't want to.
I'd be a fool not to listen to the greatest pulp writer in the whole wide world,
Robert E. Howard.
Well, that you would by God.
That you would.
- Uh-huh.
- Let's ride.
Now, you be sure to write.
You know my address old lock box 313.
I'll write as soon as I get settled.
Don't you get into any trouble with those wild ideas of yours.
You run into any of that voodoo, you make sure you find a Catholic, hold up a cross say a prayer for you.
Okay, I will.
Hey, girl.
Take a look at that sunset I ordered for you.
I sure do appreciate it.
That morning the attending physician,
Dr. Dill had told us that Mrs.
Howard would never recover.
Robert looked at me, and he went to his room and he began to type.
A minute later our cleaning lady saw him walk through the back door to his car.
She said he raised his arms and began praying, then she heard a shot and saw him slumped over the steering wheel.
I carried my boy back into the house.
He lived for eight hours.
His mother passed away the next day.
Thank you for the time you gave my son, Miss Price.
I know how much he cared for you.
Fiveminute stop, folks.
You've been doing a lot of crying.
Who you crying for?
A friend.
Gone, is he?
Passed on?
Yes.
He took his own life.
That's tough.
He was a writer.
He made his living writing stories.
Could spin a yarn, could he?
That's what he called them.
What's your name, dear?
Novalyne Price.
Let me ask you something, Novalyne.
Are you glad you had the chance to know him?
And even though you won't see him for a while, is he still your friend?
Yeah.
Yeah, he sure is.
Novalyne, look.
It's gonna be a beautiful sunrise.
- Oh, I have a reservation.
For Caroline Brace.
- I don't see it here.
- Would you try Shelby please?
- Oh right, so who are you, Shelby or Brace?
- Brace until I married
Shelby and then Shelby again,
Brace again after the divorce.
I don't feel like Shelby anymore.
- Okay I'll change the reservation to Brace.
- Thank you.
- That's right,
I'll take care of that for you.
Please show Miss Brace to fourth floor.
- Caroline!
Caroline!
He's over there.
Oh Caroline, darling!
Oh.
Did David ask you here?
- Yes.
He didn't tell you?
- Oh no that boy never tells his mother anything except goodnight.
Are you gonna get back together?
- Oh, you had to ask.
Let me see, I have to think about that one.
- Don't think.
What is this, some obscene proposal?
- There's a lot of ground to cover, it's all we--
- This person is called McDade.
- Hello.
- It's nice to meet you.
- He works here.
I always forget what your job is.
- Bookkeeper.
Excuse me, you really should--
- He's a bookkeeper.
Hardly a VIP escorting the great man's mother around.
No offense, McDade.
I like you.
- Thank you.
There's a lot of ground we have to cover.
- Let the heart guide the head, McDade.
And have you got a fella?
- Two or three.
- Holy cow, are you gonna turn into a swinger?
- (chuckles) Am I, let's see, could be.
How is the great man?
- Up to his ass in celebrity.
- Hey Gary, what brings you to this opening?
You said you were gonna quit competition.
What decided you to turn pro?
- I just want to be part of this whole fantastic thing going on here.
- We assume that Mr Shelby--
- Hey Gary.
- Very attractive?
- Well she certainly help.
Besides, I've never done the Golinda before.
- Try the suicide jump?
- Sure, why not?
- What about you, Bruce?
Are you gonna break that downhill record of yours tomorrow?
- It wasn't part of the deal but I'll do my best for you.
- Bruce, from the beginning you seem to thrive on risk.
Have you ever known fear?
- Well I never thought about it.
I ski like I breathe or talk or make love.
- Oh, kinda makes me wonder what you do best.
- Boy, I'll say.
He's established a record of that.
- How are you?
- Bruce!
- You look fantastic!
- Oh thank you.
Kathy, come and get in the picture.
Come on!
- Hey Kathy come on.
- You go ahead.
- How you doing?
A little nervous?
- A little.
- Wow, I can dig that, let me tell you.
- That skier is too fast for Tina.
- How do you girls feel about?
- Well I admit,
I do have my eye on the Show Me Awards.
- I just wanna do the best I can.
- It's terrific to see you.
The two of you together.
- Hello dear.
- How are you today?
- Fine, sir.
- Mother, you and McDade have a full schedule, there's an awful lot to see around here.
- Can't we sit together awhile and have a drink and talk?
- I would like to have some time with Caroline.
- Come on, McDade.
Thanks for the tour.
- See ya.
Hi.
- Looking so good.
Hold the elevator!
- You're looking well, maybe a little tired.
- Excuse me, Mr. Shelby?
- Yeah.
- Any chance of us getting the shot of the Shelby trophy?
- Sure, get all the boys together, meet me in my office.
- [Man] Excuse me.
- Come on, there's something I wanna show you.
- Susan.
- Yes David?
Mr. Shelby?
- This is Mrs. Shelby.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- Susan Maxwell, my secretary.
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, did you get ahold of Marty Brenner?
- Not yet.
- Try again.
- I just did.
- Well keep on trying.
- Okay!
- David.
It's just incredible what you've done.
All of it, incredible.
- Yeah (sighs).
Took a lot of time, a lot of effort.
(chuckles) You know.
Through the whole thing I used to think a lot about how we used to lie around on Houston Street and talk a lot.
Quiet elegance.
Planet, remember?
Well.
- Well.
I guess you got it.
- Oh, hell, Caroline.
Okay.
You registered as Brace.
- Yes?
It's who I am.
- I wanted to change it back to Caroline Shelby.
- You can't do that.
- You could.
I wanna talk.
I don't even know what I wanna talk about,
I mean, can we just talk?
- Sure.
- This is the big one.
Four years ago I came out here and I saw that mountain out there and I knew, I'm climbing it.
I opened up this magnificent country for myself and for anybody who wants to join me.
I fought like a son of a bitch.
I fought the bank, I fought the government.
I fought even my own corporation.
Hell, I built an empire for them.
And then the environmentalists, they say I'm destroying the environment.
Come here, come here, let me show you something.
Here.
Look out here.
Does this look like I'm destroying?
I'm creating a beautiful life here.
It's a good thing that's happening.
- What's wrong, then?
- One of the planning commissioners I had to deal with is under investigation.
- What, about this?
- Oh no.
There's some other corporate connections.
- Yeah, and?
- (sighs) Well, I bought some of this land from one of those corporations.
- Isn't that a matter of public record?
- Yes, and so is a sizeable contribution I made toward his senatorial campaign.
Hello?
Well keep trying.
Damn it!
- So what are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna take you to lunch, I don't wanna talk about this mess, you're here, I...
I love that you're here.
I love you.
- Lunch, huh?
- Right.
And, how is your life, are you still working for Harper's Bazaar?
- Vogue--
- Oh yes I mean Vogue.
Hello.
Right, send them in.
(chuckles) Press.
I'm David Shelby.
Mr. Cavelli.
- I know, she's a little off center, like she wasn't twirler last year.
She's getting it together.
Thatta girl, Kathy!
- You all right, Kathy?
Need anything?
It doesn't mean anything at all.
It's all right, it's okay.
- No Leo, it's not.
I always do that to myself.
When I saw her.
- Yes, she'll get to you.
You forgot how beautiful you are.
Love yourself.
And when you're doing that spin, you'll find your center and you'll let go.
And don't let anything in the world guide you off your center.
- So miners are digging for silver in the 1880s, and the mountain avalanched.
Buried everybody.
No one's dared touch it since.
- Until David.
Of course.
David is amazing.
How did he ever convince all those bankers?
- He didn't.
- He didn't?
- Nobody else would follow him up here.
He's all alone this time.
- Alone?
- Yes, he's risked everything he has.
All his personal holdings.
- In case you haven't noticed, not only are we out of doors--
And knee-deep in snow, but we are also going uphill!
- Always uphill.
You get to the top.
- Oh, if I had the strength,
I would write that down.
Oh!
- Well, this is important.
You can see.
Mr. Shelby shall ice fish.
He'll have an absolutely clear view.
- Well, he's just like his father was.
He has to be king of the mountain.
- [Pauly] Hey Mr. Thorne!
- [Nick] How ya doing, Pauly?
- You were right about that salt lick, getting low.
The mountain carried down from Big Face ever since the high wind.
- All right, I'll bring you up one tomorrow.
Your boss say your captain's low?
- Yes sir.
- Mr. Shelby and the architect decided it was desirable.
We want an absolutely unimpeded view.
- I see.
- [Pauly] How's that stick, Mr. Thorne?
- What are you doing this for, Pauly?
- Man's gotta eat.
- What's the gimmick?
- There is no gimmick now.
That was the reaction of one stable snow to the sound waves made by that saw.
In addition, Mr. McDada, the slope is not stable.
With those trees missing, it's dangerous.
Good day.
- Who's he?
- I'm sorry, his name is Nick Thorne.
He's a photographer.
And well-known.
Got all the time in the world for nature.
None for its development.
- Are you kidding?
- Oh!
- Very neat.
- Ah, piece of cake.
- You got lucky.
- [Bruce] Yeah.
- What are you doing up here,
I thought you were skiing Big Face?
- Just felt like practicing on my own away from the crowds.
- I would check conditions.
- I just did.
- Artie, don't argue with me, get your ass up here, damn it.
Well something is going on!
All right.
This morning, some snot nose reporter started asking about
Maybrook and the clearance of the land and I don't like it.
Well it could mean a lot!
I want you to get on that plane with a file and be up here by tomorrow night.
God it's hard to come down from that guy.
And don't give me that
I don't approve look.
- No, mm.
I don't approve or disapprove.
David, you're like weather, you just happen.
I came to collect that lunch.
- My god, lunch.
Forgot.
- Supremacy tactics.
- One day it'll work, watch.
- Shelby!
I wanna talk to you.
- Oh, Nick.
Good to see you.
Someone I want you to meet, John.
- You're crazy to cut down those trees.
- Caroline, this is Nick Thorne.
You know his work.
- Oh yes, of course.
- And this is my wife,
Caroline--
- Mrs. Shelby.
Look, let me put it to you this way.
Without that cover, everything below that place you're building is open to a slide.
- Oh Nick, we'll talk about it later this afternoon.
- Oh, that's what you said last week.
I wanna talk now.
- (sighs) I'm sorry, honey.
I have to talk to Nick.
20 minutes, a half an hour at the most.
Then lunch--
- David, I'll see you at dinner, okay?
Nice to meet you, Mr. Thorne.
- But it's next to the banquet, we won't have any time.
- At least I know you'll be there.
- There's just not enough hazard up on that salt to carry on about cutting down a few trees.
- There is a hazard, David.
Look, these mountains have gotten along without you for a long time.
- Oh, hello Tina.
- Hi.
- Go easy, huh?
- Okay.
- These mountains have gotten along without you for a long time and you come barreling in here with big plans to rearrange the whole thing.
- No, Nick.
Sharon.
- Sharon?
- Harry.
Scotch on the rocks, you want a drink?
- Nothing.
You're risking the lives of everyone you are inviting here to Sharon.
- That man works in front of the commissions, but now you have to deal with me.
I want people to enjoy this land, not bury them in it.
- Oh Dave.
- Philip.
- How you doing, Nick?
Listen, David, I'm gonna need the rosters for--
- Will you, as a professional, tell this lunatic about the reports?
- What reports--
- All of them, the snow reports, the whole damn thing.
- Okay.
They just finished skiing the entire area and all our data says it's fine.
- I don't wanna hear about the surveys, Phil,
I know what they say.
What I'm asking you is why are you having cleaned off old (mumbles)?
- Oh come on, Nick, I settled that corners day ago.
- It's building.
You got a storm coming in tonight and people all over that slope, and
I don't know how you can ignore that hazard.
- Hey now wait a minute.
I'm not ignoring anything.
Now there isn't a procedure in the book I haven't covered.
- [Nick] You're stuck in the book, Phil, you always were.
- That's right because it's my job.
- [Nick] Look, before the slopes are open at least fire a shell into that ledge before it pulls the mountain down on us.
- Now you listen to me.
I love this place as much as you do and you damn well know it.
And that storm should be over by morning, and right now everything says we're fine.
- When was the last time you went up on that mountain and just sat?
- Oh bullshit, Nick.
I work up there--
- Just go up there and sit, Phil.
- Ridiculous.
- Just sit, Phil.
Things aren't normal, there's a heaviness and it's growing.
I can feel it.
- Oh for God's sake.
You want to panic the whole population because you feel a heaviness?
Well let me tell you something,
I don't move with your premonition,
I move with my judgment.
Come on, Philip, I'll get you your God damn papers.
- [Caroline] Hi there!
- Hello, Mrs. Shelby.
- Huh?
- I say, hello, Mrs. Shelby.
- Brace.
We're divorced.
- I knew I'd seen you someplace before.
- In the lobby.
- No, it was before that.
- Ah, on David's desk in a frame.
- That's right.
He's a tough guy.
- Yep.
- Do you like him?
- Let me see, I have to think about that.
I don't know.
I love him.
(chuckles) You know.
- Sure.
- Gosh, I hope there'll be a snow storm.
While I'm up here I wanna see the whole works.
I love snow storms, they make the world look entirely different, don't you think?
- Different is better?
- What do you think?
- No, I think things look pretty good from right here.
It's cold out here, aren't you cold?
- Yep, I'm freezing.
Come on inside.
Oh.
You coming to the party tonight?
Or do you hate that sort of thing?
- No, I don't hate that sort of thing.
I'm just not sure I can celebrate all this.
- What do you celebrate?
Well.
Maybe I'll see you sometime.
I hope you change your mind.
- [Radio Announcer] Six inches of fresh snow.
12 degrees at the top.
Wind's at 40 miles per hour.
Chill factor, minus 16 degrees.
(mumbles) 114 inch base, 11 inches.
Fresh Powder, 20 degrees at the summit.
Cameron, 105 base, eight inches Fresh Powder.
Icy conditions prevail Red Mountain.
- Sure wish you could come tonight, Bud.
- Oh I'd like to, David, but I better go across to White Ice station.
My boys called me about some conditions.
I weren't sure what they're talking about.
The earliest I could get back is tomorrow.
- Hey there's Mark Elliot.
Excuse me, Philip.
Mark, good to see you.
- David.
Well it's good to be here.
- Well come on, let's get you settled.
Sammy, would you get Mr.
Elliot's luggage please, room 509.
It's great, isn't it?
Gonna do a little skiing while you're here?
- I'll try.
When does your TV crew arrive?
- Noon tomorrow.
- Oh good.
Is Scott here?
- Everybody's here.
- Great.
- Including your wife.
- Tina's here?
- She arrived with Scott this morning.
Nobody knew she was coming.
- Kinda surprised.
Couple of months, that's a long time for Bruce.
As a matter of fact, it's a long time for Tina also.
- Yeah, well I'm embarrassed.
- Well there's no reason.
- And.
She'll be sitting at our table tonight.
With Bruce.
- That's showbiz.

- It won't be your show if you do.
- But what would I say?
- You'll think of something.
- We're just gonna talk about exactly what we're talking about.
- I really would prefer to be on the show tomorrow night.
You got a terrific accident yet you're still personal with the people you talk to.
- You hear that?
I'm gonna have to kiss you for that.
You're gonna have to repeat exactly what you said just now tomorrow night.
- Well I don't know.

- Pleasure--
- And Tina Elliot.
- Nick Thorne, you did that layout in the National Geographic.
- Recent?
- About a month ago.
- Smithsonian.
- That's right, on the grizzlies of the Aleutian.
- Kodiaks.
- Would you like to dance?
- Why?
- Oh (chuckles).
- Please.
- Thank you.
Look, I don't know how to do this kind of dancing.
- That's okay, we'll think of something.
David is staring at me.
- I don't blame him.
- You dance very well.
- Considering.
I think you have this idea I'm some kind of wild man of the mountain.
- Wild man of the mountain.
- Well, I wish you wouldn't think of me quite that way.
- No, I rather enjoy that image.
- What?
- David is staring at Susan the more he stares at me.
- Does it bother you?
- No.
It liberates me.
- Do you ever have a really bad fall?
- Not since I was 15.
A fantastic instructor taught me the art of falling.
- Did he ever explain, when you're sure you're not falling and you know you can't stop it.
You just have to go with it.
- He taught me never to resist.
- Aloha!
- Mother, this is not Hawaii.
- It is if I say so.
- You have to decide how to land.
- You mean the position of your body?
- Right, position of the body is very important.
- I rather like it on my back.
- Sideways (mumbles).
- You fall sideways?
- Makes for a change.
- Far out.
- Good night everybody,
I'm gonna hit the sack.
It was a great party.
- Aloha!
- Good night, Mr. Elliot.
I'm looking very forward to being on your show tomorrow.
- I'm looking very forward to having you.
- (chuckles) Good night.
Good night.
- Let's dance, honey.
- (sighs) Very good dance.
Took my breath away, oh.
Huh, what is this?
You hate dancing.
- Wait.
What's going on with you?
- Nothing, I'm fine.
- You just met the guy this afternoon.
- So?
- Don't give me so.
You'll never get him away from the buffalo and the deer and the antelope.
Who asked you, and who asked you?
- I just don't want to see you screw yourself up.
- Don't worry, I won't.
- Won't though?
- I won't.
- Aloha, naughty Lloyd.
- Thank you.
- Do you even know what you're doing?
You must be tired of all this crap.
It took us years to grow up.
- About whom are you speaking?
- What's going on, I only asked you to dance.
- You didn't ask me to dance, you told me to dance.
You got to run the whole show.
You panic if you haven't got complete control.
It's always the same thing.
I got to the point where
I didn't know what I felt about anything.
- I just want to be with you.
What's wrong with wanting to be with you, or you wanting to be with me?
- You stifle me!
I need some space, I need some room.
I've gotta make my own decisions.
Just leave me alone.
- I don't wanna leave you alone.
- Well that's a problem I can solve.
- Caroline!
- Enjoy yourself, gonna hit the sack.
Thanks.
- Aloha!
- Oh--
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, are you leaving?
- Yeah, I'm ready to escape.
- Let's.
- Yep, better bundle up.
- Uh-huh.
- You got your storm coming.
- Feels good.
- Does it make everything seem different?
- No (chuckles).
Thank you.
- Watch your step.
- [Caroline] Boy, what a wild place to live.
- [Nick] You think so?
- It's exciting out here.
- Careful.
Right here, be careful.
- Freezing.
Boy.
- Hot chocolate, beer?
- Beer, please.
You built this house yourself, didn't you?
- [Nick] Yeah.
- Figures.
I like it.
I don't know if I could handle the isolation though.
What is this thing?
- What's it look like?
- A goat?
- That's a ram.
- A ram.
I like your pictures, I really do.
- Thank you.
- Oh I see you have a, what do you call it, you do your printing here?
- Yeah.
Wanna take a look, go ahead.
- Yeah, thank you.
- That whatcha-ma-call-it is--
- Enlarger.
- Thank you.
I don't know what to say.
- Can I give you a big hug?
- Did you ever see me do my flying (mumbles)?
- I don't think I've ever seen you do one more graceful.
- It's a spin that won me the gold medal.
- Oh it did.
- I did everything they told me.
- That sounds real kinky.
- And a wonderful old fashioned lay back.
- I love it.
- [Woman] Marvelous.
Marvelous.
Spread eagle.
- [Bruce] What other heavy moves you gonna lay on me?
- [Woman] Have you ever seen My Lady?
It's too fast for me.
- [Bruce] You gotta be fast to stay on top.
- I like to go forward.
Taking moves one by one.
By one.
- Bruce, honey.
Bruce!
Bruce honey.
- Let me go--
- Tina.
- Let me go--
- Tina.
- Let me go!
- Baby, baby.
Tina!
- Hello, yeah.
What?
Well get a caterpillar up there, we gotta get her fixed by noon.
That's right, I said by noon.
I'll be right there.
Good morning.
Morning.
We had a little trouble with the rink last night.
- Would you like your orange juice?
- Yeah.
- Mhm.
Hello?
Ugh.
Yeah Marty, what?
I don't care about your pilot in those weather conditions,
I want you and that file on a plane up here tonight.
No, Marty, you.
Not the National Guard or the Marine Corps, you, and that file in your hot little hands.
Marty!
We are talking about a 10 year multi-million dollar project and you are telling me about clouds.
Well give another $500, see how his vision improves.
- Nick?
- [Radio Announcer] News from Colorado and the west.
A blizzard that hit southwestern Colorado last night is nearly over.
- Good morning!
How do you feel?
- Pretty good.
- Sleep well?
I want you rating that on a scale of 10.
Seven?
Eight?
Nine?
Was she that good?
- Tina, either put that apple down or throw it at me.
- It wouldn't hurt you enough if I threw it.
- My ass hurts enough already.
Jealousy's the biggest pain in the ass.
- God damn you!
Stop acting as if you didn't get away with anything, you son of a bitch!
- This is what you usually threaten to kill yourself.
- I'll cut you to shreds, you bastard!
- Why can't you play it the way your husband plays, he's got real style.
- Stop it!
- (mumbles) Kill yourself.
- No, no, no, no.
No, no.
No.
I love you too.
- Tina.
Please.
- There he is!
- Morning, lady.
Have you seen Caroline this morning?
- No.
- Oh.
Well, I gotta get the world rolling.
Wanna come along?
- What?
- I'm going to work with the wonders.
Do you wanna watch?
- What are you going to do, freeze the Red Sea?
- (chuckles) For you, anything.
- But not outdoors.
- Next year, indoors.
- Give me a little bit.
- Hey.
- Don't you drink too many of those things.
- Right on!
- [Announcer] We're just about to start our first event.
The first international snowmobile invitational, featuring the Norwegian nutcracker.
(mumbles) Challenging Colorado's own--
- Bye.
- [Announcer] The man who made snowmobile racing a dirty sport.
- Get back.
- Bitch.
- [Woman] Bastard.
- Try this.
- Goal!
- [Woman] Come on, baby!
- [Announcer] You are seeing some of the bravest jumpers assembled here today.
Here in (mumbles) Sun Valley.
That sky dive (mumbles) sheer guns of nature.
Once you take off at 60 miles an hour, you just start flailing your bowls like--
With the ground when you hit it.
An early take-off, he's in the air, off-center.
He's trying to regain his balance.
What the heck was that?
All the way down the mountain.
All the way to (mumbles).
- Woo!
Thank you.
Thank you, folks.
All right.
All right.
Well now that you've cut the ribbon, Bruce,
I feel that it's only appropriate that you be the first man up.
One.
I really don't wanna test it.
And two, I mean it's quite obvious from your record that you need some kind of a head start.
I feel like Bruce Scott is one of the finest athletes in the world.
His skill and dedication to skiing have brought a new kind of excitement and given a very special meaning to (mumbles).
I just like to say for all your friends up here, Bruce, and all your friends all over the skiing world that we owe you a great deal.
- Mark, thank you.
Let's go up the slopes!
- Hey Bruce!
- Ella.
- Can we have your autograph?
- Sure, ladies.
- All right.
- Right up on a chair--
- Right?
- I think you're gonna bring a lot of pleasure to a lot of people.
- I now wanna thank everybody for making all of this possible.
Have a good day.
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- You did great.
That was really great.
- Thanks.
- What are they, asleep?
- No, Mr. Brenner, we're under the MRA.
We can't contact either end because of the terrain.
- Oh for Christ sake.
- Stay here and watch
Mommy and Daddy speed down.
- And finally, we have the 10th (mumbles) who are patrons of the Colorado Cup.
Well ladies and gentlemen, this new lift is now officially open.
So let's do some skiing!
How 'bout it, pal?
Gonna go up?
Miss Courtney!
Is it all right?
- Well if you really want to!
- And on, heh.
Well, I'm Mark, who are you?
- Jason.
- Mr. Shelby I've made this trip 100 times.
It's never been this bad.
- Could we have flown past?
- [Ed] No, I'm scared we're a lot closer than we wanna be.
- What does this mean?
- [Ed] We're losing power.
Our fuel's starting to fluctuate.
- Ed, find a place to sit this thing down.
- How old are you?
- Got an ID?
- Uh-huh.
- [Man] See you at the bottom when I get down.
- Look there's Bruce Scott!
- [Announcer] Lake Champlain is next.
Coming up now, Gary!
For Gary, rated number two ski jumper in the nation.
This is the first time on the (mumbles).
- What is it?
- Hey!
Can you hear me?
- Easy.
Easy now, easy Jason.
Move your arm, move easy.
I've got you.
Turn, turn.
Atta boy, it's okay, easy.
Good.
- Bill!
Bill!
You all right?
- Yes.
My neck.
- How's it feel?
- I think it's okay.
- What are you doing up here?
- I was on my way up here, worried about that crazy thing when it broke.
- With an air plane that started to slide.
Looks bad.
- All right look, if you get down there, the rink,
I'll get the hotel.
As quick as you can, yeah?
- You bet.
- Both doors are jammed.
- Oh terrific.
Ah.
Hey!
- Gas.
- The worst.
- The power's out and there was an explosion in the kitchen and the dining room's blocked off.
There may be some people trapped.
- Outside.
- Some guy's working on that right now.
- Right, have you seen my mother, where's Caroline?
- No but David, there's a gas leak in the kitchen, it may be going into the dining room.
- [David] Well then we get the boilers going full blast.
- David, the power is out.
- Steve, I want you to take whoever you need, get up the last rig, work on that back up generator.
I want it operating.
- Yes, sir.
- Get blankets, sheets, all you can carry.
- Right.
- Get above the skating rink as fast as you can.
Can't anybody get through to Cedar Falls?
- [Woman] We're completely cut off!
- Get her out of here and see if you can make that thing work.
- Been trying, boss, we can't get through anywhere.
- Well keep on trying!
You got any dynamite?
- What's going on?
- We're gonna have to blast from the other side of the hotel, people trapped inside.
- Oh Nick, you son of a bitch.
- [Steve] David!
You know, if we blast too close, the whole damn thing could cave in.
- Well if we don't, we'll asphyxiate.
- Well what do you wanna do?
- Blast.
- [Henry] Mrs. Shelby.
- Florence, God damn it.
- That will do any good?
- I'm not gonna sit here.
I'm gonna dig us out.
- What's going on?
- Well, we can blast maybe one more time.
And we better just dig.
- David!
David!
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
- Have you seen my mother?
- No, I don't know where she is.
- Oh my God.
- [Man In Blue] What are you gonna do now?
- We're gonna set up.
- What?
- We're gonna shoot this God damn thing.
Haul that stuff up here.
- Are you all right?
- Has anyone seen my Jeanette?
- I'll see if I can find out.
Harmon, it's Harmon's hat!
- Bruce!
- Hey!
Hey!
Can you hear me?
- Oh.
McDade, we're...
Hm.
♪ If you were the only boy in the world ♪
♪ And I was the only girl ♪
- No!
Don't go to sleep, Mrs. Shelby.
- Go, Phil.
- Okay.
- [Henry] You all right?
- What is it, I bring down the house again?
- I think they're dynamiting the snow from outside.
- [Florence] Yeah?
Oh, it's cold.
- Well that's it, come on, we gotta dig.
- Florence.
- [Steve] Take some of this, David.
- I'm over here!
I'm over here!
Mr. Shelby.
- Oh my God.
- Philip!
I got her.
Okay, easy, easy.
- Anything?
- I don't think so.
- Over here!
- She's starting to breathe.
- Now you behave, huh?
- Get out of here, McDade.
- It's Henry, God damn it.
- Please, sir.
- Mom?
- I don't want that.
I want a bloody Mary.
- Put that back--
- She's all right.
And keep it on.
You had a scare.
- [Man] Please let's not crowd the lady.
- Please!
Charlie, get there with the chair lift.
- He can't be dead.
He can't be!
- [Man] We'll take the snow caps.
- Come on, grab ahold.
- It's slipping.
I've got it.
- Come on boys, we've got no time to lose.
Come on.
Come on guys, hurry up.
Move it!
- It's gotta run like clockwork, guys.
You and you, start getting the net out.
Virgil, get us as close as you can.
Get right under and be ready to move.
Now let's go.
- I can't hold it--
- Just hold on.
No, no, no, no, Jason.
Hold on, hold on, sweetheart.
Easy, easy.
Now listen to me, listen to me carefully.
You see that there's a net down there?
- Yeah.
- Okay, now, all you have to do, you just have to, you just have to close your eyes and just jump and they're gonna catch us, all right?
- I don't want to.
- I think that this is gonna be the only way down right now.
Because I'm a little more scared than you are, would it be all right if you jump first?
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna come right down after you, okay?
- You promise?
- Oh yes.
Oh I promise.
Okay!
Now just close your eyes and jump.
- He okay?
The boy is safe!
Let go!
- David!
- Just let go!
- Mark, come on!
- All right Jason!
- [Man] He'll live.
- [Man] How many?
- We don't know yet.
Hey.
What happened?
- There were slides all along the route.
We got cut off from near the unit.
We had to turn around but we sent the plows out last street.
- Do you have Mrs. Shelby in there?
- No sir, she's in the lead unit.
- Do you know if she got through?
- [Bearded Man] The radio there headed toward this bridge.
- Nick, let's go!
- Yeah.
- Hang on, Caroline!
- [Nick] Dave, got a line coming.
Here it comes.
Grab hold.
- That's it, now the other arm.
That's right.
Now hang onto the rope.
- Here we go.
Keep coming, keep coming.
Got you.
Good and chilled.
- How is he?
- He's all right, considering.
He's a fighter.
- Yeah, my God.
Look at this place.
- Yep, take years to reclaim it all.
I'm glad you were here.
It was important.
- Yeah, thanks.
- I like you.
Just the way you are.
- Take care of yourself, huh?
- Goodbye, Caroline.
- [Caroline] Hi.
- Hi.
I have nothing to say.
- Would you like some champagne?
- Sure.
What shall we drink to?
- We survived.
- Yeah.
We survived.
And I always thought survival meant being king of the mountain.
Well.
How is this for a quiet elegance?
- Nice view.
- I do have something to say.
I caused all of this.
I am responsible.
- You've never said that.
David, I love you.
- [David] I know.
- A lot.
- Thank you, my friend.
- I have to go.
- Of course you do.

1964, a crucial moment in American history...
Lyndon Johnson is re-elected to the presidency by a landslide,
The New York WorlÔs Fair introduces a bright new future.
And after five scintillating years on the air...
Presto!
The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show is abruptly cancelled.
- Cancelled?!
- Cancelled?!
Uh, sorry about that, boys.
A lothas changed in 35 years.
Velcro has replaced the zipper.
Sneakers have lights on them.
The Cold War is over.
And The Rocky and
Bullwinkle Show... is still cancelled.
Frostbite Falls, Minnesota, once the beloved home of Rocky and Bullwinkle, had been a thriving cartoon town.
Nowit was crippled by years of reruns.
The beautiful
Frostbite Falls Forest... decimated.
The once majestic falls above Veronica Lake...
...devastated.
While the narrator... thaùs me... down on his luck and out of a job, was forced to move in with his mother where he was reduced to narrating the events of his own life.
"With the speed and dexterity astonishing in a woman of her advancing years,
Mother bastes the chicken, tosses the salad, and mashes the potatoes."
Oh, sonny, shut up!
Ow!
And in a little house at the top of a stump forest,
Rocky and Bullwinkle themselves, were forced to subsist on ever-diminishing residual checks from reruns of their oldshow.
World famous television stars whose adventures once took them all over the globe, now their exploits were just a memory.
Yes, it was a melancholy time indeed.
Rocky the flying squirrel hadn't flown in years.
Whaùs the point?
I guess the world just doesn't need us anymore, Bullwinkle.
Say, where are you going?
All this exposition is wearing me out.
I'm going for a walk in the woods.
But, Bullwinkle, there aren't any woods anymore.
You don't have to tell me.
I'm the chairman of the Frostbite Falls Society for Wildlife Conversation.
You mean wildlife conservation.
What did I say?
You said,
"wildlife conversation."
Somebody's going to start talking about these things.
Yes, even their wordplay had become hackneyed and cheap.
No, it was always like this.
But times were just as tough half way across the drawing in the former Soviet satellite of Pottsylvania.
Where Rocky and Bullwinkle's archrivals,
Boris and Natasha, and their fearless leader...
Fearless Leader... were cooking up their latest scheme for taking over the world, when their plans were crushed by the fall of the Iron Curtain.
Whaùs going on?
But, while the citizens of Pottsylvania rejoiced in their new found freedom...
Yay!
...Fearless Leaderand his cohorts went underground, where upon they embarked upona terrifying plan, a plan that would take them to a strange new land where the line between cartoon and reality is so thin, thaùs iùs hard to tell one from the other.
A place where with the right special effects, it might just be possible to break through... to the otherside!
It was a beautiful and smoggy day at Phony Pictures Studio, where an ambitious junior executive named Minnie Mogul was busy searching for a hot new script.
Too intelligent.
Too intelligent.
Hello, Minnie.
Holy mackerel!
Who areyou?
Three ofthe most terrifying villains in the history of children's television.
How do you do?
Nice to meetyou.
What do you want?
We were wondering, how would you like toproduce the Rocky andBullwinkle movie?
I'd love to.
I love it.
What is it?
Iùs classic American cartoon from early '60s.
Mm-hmm.
Listen, Minnie... we're stuck in reruns.
You're looking for a project.
Maybe we can help each other out.
This contractgives youallrights to The Rockyand
Bullwinkle Show.
All you have to do is sign right here andyour fiirst producing endeavor is as goodas gold.
Whaùs the matter?
I can't sign a contract that will help three ruthless villains take over the world.
I just can't.
Why not!?
My pen's out ofink.
Use mine.
Okay.
And then through the miracle of computer-generated digital technology...
Minnie reached into the televisionset and signedthe contract.
But when she tried to pull the contractout... the expensive animated characters were instantly converted into evenmore expensive motionpicture stars.
Hey... how did that happen?
We're attached to the project.
But even though thepun was weak, the contract was ironclad.
And the three villains walked out of the studio and into the real world, while Minnie marched straight into the offiice of Phony Pictures' C.E.O.,
P. G. Biggershot.
But unfortunately for her, when she pitched her project to the powerful executive, she ran into an unexpected snag.
I don't like moose pictures.
So while Minnie's motion picture plans were stymied, back in Frostbite Falls,
Bullwinkle got a rare flash of inspiration.
It is kinda hot in here.
I've been inspiring for hours.
- Hey, where areyou going?
- I'm going to the White House, to talk to the president about the trees.
So Rocky and Bullwinkle set off on the road to Washington.
I don't know, Bullwinkle, it looks a little jammed.
Horsefeathers!
How bad could it be?
Rocky:
Look at all the red tape!
Don't worry, little buddy.
I'm sure the president will send for us after all the letters
I wrote him.
Why, I bet any second now... or two... or three... or four... or two... or three... or four...
There the matter seemed destined to rest... until six months later, in Washington, D. C., when idealistic, warm hearted, and beautiful FBI agent,
Karen Sympathy, was summoned to the office of hard-boiled FBI director,
"Cappy" Von Trappment.
Agent Sympathy, given all your bungled assignments in the past,
I suppose you were wondering why I picked you for this mission.
Yes, sir.
Sympathy, allow me to be frank.
Thisjob requires the ideal FBI agent... someone tough, someone hard-bitten, someone emotionless.
Do you understand?
Yes, sir. Tough!
Hard-boiled! Unemotional!
Good.
Are you familiar with
The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show?
Oh-hh!
I mean... ahem...
I've heard of it.
171/2 short minutes later...
Cappy:
Mr. President, this is a regular networkTV station.
Announcer:
PresidentSignoff, standing firm lyin the middle of the road.
But lookwhat happens when we switch to cable...
For the last six months, a cartoon villain from the old
Rocky and Bullwinkle Show named Fearless Leader has been buying up every single hour of cable programming in this country, forming asingle gigantic network called RBTV, or "Really Bad Television."
According to our sources, three days from now
Fearless Leader plans to broadcast TV shows so terrible, they'll turn anyone who watches them into a mindless zombie, incapable of independent thought.
Totally different than regular TV.
The RBTV broadcast starts at noon on Saturday.
By 8:00 that night,
Fearless Leaderwill have hypnotized enough viewers that he can go on the air and make the whole country vote for him as president.
Well... thaùs no good...
No.
No, I mean...
I want to be president again.
Yes.
We all know that, sir.
Can't the Pentagon do something about this?
Any recommendations?
General Foods?
General Store?
General Admission?
We can't think ofanything,
Mr. President.
Can't the FBI do anything, Cappy?
We've already sent three crack agents to infii ltrate
RBTV...
They've disappeared.
Iùs almost as if there were a mole in the White House.
Thaùs just ridiculous.
Yes, sir.
Mr. President, our only chance is to call on those two gallant heroes... who successfully foiled
Fearless Leader's schemes forworld conquest... backwhen he posed a threat in the 1960s.
If anyone can stop him, they can.
Rocky and Bullwinkle!
Rocky and Bullwinkle, sir.
Sympathy, you've got exactly 46 hours... to get Rocky and Bullwinkle to New York and shut down
Fearless Leader's broadcast.
Thank you, sir.
I won't fail.
Just be careful.
We've already lost three ofour best agents.
So good luck.
Oh, sir, just one thing...
How do I get Rocky and
Bullwinkle out ofreruns?
I don't know.
Fearless Leader and those other two got out somehow, didn't they?
Figure it out!
And, Sympathy, remember, we only care about results.
Within the hour, Karen was enroute to LosAngeles.
She was determined to give the Rocky and Bullwinkle movie the green light.
Rocky:
Whaùs happening?
Cobs and shuckins, Rock!
The president must be beaming us to Washington!
Thaùs not the president,
Bullwinkle.
Thaùs agreenlight from Hollywood.
Those TV people musùve changed their minds.
Whoa!
Goodbye, sonny!
Narrator:
I'llbeback forhiatus, Ma!
Bullwinkle:
Hang on, Rocky!
Narrator:
Mama!
Oof!
Hokey smoke!
Areyou all right?
Yeah, but I think we're on the wrong show.
Look how well they drew that girl!
Iùs you.
Iùs really you!
Rocky... and Bull...
Bull...
- Bull...
- I believe the word... you're searching for is "winkle."
Bullwinkle.
Hey, what network areyou from?
I'm not from any network.
Agent Karen Sympathy, FBI.
Listen, you guys.
I've been sent here because...
Somebody's coming.
We gotta get out ofhere fast.
Quick!
Leùs go to a commercial!
What is this,
PBS?
Come on!
Leùs go!
- Hold it right there, lady!
- Just a second!
Er... this way!
Hey, wait for me!
Ow!
Ow!
Bullwinkle, I don't think we're on television anymore.
Bullwinkle, can you rappel?
Sure! I've been repelling viewers foryears!
Never mind.
Get on my back.
I'll carry you down.
What about Rocky?
He's a flying squirrel.
He'll manage.
Er...
Bullwinkle:
Aah!
Ooh!
Hurry up, Rocky!
Fly down!
Just like old times.
Aaah!
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?
Rocky! You okay?
Sure, just out ofpractice.
Moments later...
Agent Sympathy, can I ask you something personal?
Didyou watch ourshow?
Did I watch your show?
I lovedyour show!
- You did?
- Sure!
Ever since I was a kid
I wanted to have adventures like you guys.
Thaùs why
I joined the Bureau.
Rocky and Bullwinkle:
Really?
But that little girl doesn't exist anymore, Rocky.
They don't want her kind in the FBI.
I do exist! I do exist!
Let me out!
- There's something in your eye.
- No, there's not.
Ow!
All right, we need to get to New York and stop Fearless Leader's broadcast within 40 hours.
Rocky:
Waitaminute!
Why don't we take an airplane?
Because then it wouldn't be a road movie. Whee-ee!
Karen:
We don'tknow how, but Fearless
Leader, Boris and Natasha escaped from the cartoon world into the real world.
- So the president sent me to...
- Ofcourse!
The president got my letters about the trees!
What trees?
The Frostbite Falls Forest.
I knew he would respond.
- Look, we don't have time...
- Bullwinkle, this lady isn't here about the trees.
- She's from the FBI.
- FBI?
Didn't they take our show off the air?
- You mean the FCC.
- Didn't they like it either?
Look...
Can you believe we used to get paid for this routine?
Would you listen to me, please?
Finally, in a crisis of conscience,
Karen decided to tell... an untruth.
Okay, you're right.
The president sent me because he wants you to head... the... er...
Committee for Animated
Wildlife Preservation.
Ooh!
Okay?
Thaùs not whatyou said before!
I was building up to it.
Gee, what kind ofmusic is that?
- Hip-hop.
- Okay... but I'd still like to know what kind ofmusic it is.
Thaùs funny, the radio's off.
Oh, thaùs just Bullwinkle.
His antlers pick up everything.
Bullwinkle, cover up your nose!
Okay. I was just gettin' jiggy with it.
They sure don't have music like that in Frostbite Falls.
Agent Sympathy, have things changed a lot in the last 35 years?
Karen:
Just you waitandsee.
Karen:
Just you waitandsee.
As dawn broke over the City ofAngels, our valiant protagonists boldly rocketed toward the beckoning horizon toward the beckoning horizon of a strange new three-dimensional world, and the unimaginable perils that lay on the road ahead.
While on the otherside of the country, at Fearless Leader's headquarters,
Really Bad Television...
Fearless Leader:
My fellow Pottsylvanians, this is the quality control.
It will enhance or degrade the quality of what ever you run through it.
If the input show is bad enough, the quality control will exaggerate its mind-numbing properties... until the audience is completely hypnotized.
So, Badenov, these shows had better be terrible!
Don't worry,
Fearless Leader.
We are ready to test the machine.
Ready to test machine!
Put on your protective glasses!
Put on protective glasses!
Fearless Leader:
Badenov, proceed with the test!
Badenov, proceed with test!
Sometimes, iùs not so easy being Fearless Leader.
Announcer:
Coming toyour TV, brand new exciting shows of the highest fun!
So, if adventure is your best ingredient, try the action with...
Clever Spies Crush the Enemy On Monday!
And the laughter never gets away... with Three Funny and Wacky
Spies & Their Horse,
Who Will Also Be a Spy.
It works!
Yeah!
Silence!
Iùs a message from my mole at the White House!
Moose and squirrel!
Moose and squirrel.
How many times in the past have they stood between me... and my dreams ofglory?
How many times have they foiled my plans... with their bungling interference?
Er... 28?
Quiet, idiot!
They must never reach
New York alive.
I want you to destroy them personally.
After 30 years of waiting, one more chance to crush moose and squirrel!
Oh, Fearless Leader, you are so good to us!
There has never been a way to actually destroy a cartoon character... until now!
What about in that movie,
RogerRabbit?
Shut up!
This is totally different!
There has never been a way to actually destroy a cartoon character... untilnow!
This is the computer degenerating imagery.
Show them, Sydney.
The "computer degenerating imagery" or C.D.I., as I like to call it, is totally user-friendly.
Just index the binary codes of the animated image you're gonna degenerate and the C.D.I. 'll dismantle the digital image on your film stock. 'Kay?
Bring in the test subject!
No, no!
Oh, this is what
I was afraid of.
I've been tricked!
Please, don't send me there.
Please don'tsendme there!
Now I know what happened to my friend Freddy the Ferret and those cute little bunnies...
Okay, now all you gotta do is type in an address and send him where all worthless cyberjunk ends up... the Internet!
Let go of my paw.
You broke my nail!
Aah!
So, thaùs all there is to it.
Here's the manual and she's all yours.
I assumeyou're both computer literate?
We don't need computerweapon to kill moose and squirrel!
We've been trying to kill moose and squirrel for 35 years.
And we've never even come close.
Exactly.
Andso, armed with the C.D.I., and a truck load full of really silly cartoon weaponry,
Boris and Natasha set off to blast Rocky and Bullwinkle from the face of the Earth, and immediately got stuck in traffic.
While back at RBTV...
Dear Diary, soon the presidency will be mine.
As for this FBI agent,
Karen Sympathy,
I will deal with her the same way I dealt... with the three agents before her.
At the moment oftruth, she'll be plugged directly into the quality control current and turned into a helpless... mindless... vegetable.
Vegetable.
...A barrel ofmoney
Maybe we're ragged and funny
Bullwinkle:
But we'll travel along
Rocky:
Singing a song...
Karen:
Youknow, lusedtobe justlikeyouguys.
Cheerful, optimistic.
But if there's one thing
I learned in the FBI, iùs that life is not a cartoon.
Whoa!
Look out!
Whoa!
Aah!
Out ofthe car!
Whaùs the rush?
All right, I'm going,
I'm going!
Are you all right?
Ofcourse.
Guess I should have figured.
Boris:
Butnotforlong!
Hey, Rock.
They look kind offamiliar.
Yeah! Haven't we seen those two somewheres before?
Whaùs with the cannon?
Iùs traditional!
Run!
Karen:
Boris Badenov!
I've seen you on TV.
You're a crooked, creepy, no-good rotten worm.
Oh, thank you.
You're slimy, sneaky, sleazy...
Please! You'll turn my pretty head.
You're asadisticspy anda... and a... really, really bad person!
Stop!
You're embarrassing me.
Where is boom?
Boris, darling, maybe iùs time to update our technique.
Fearless Leader!
We're so happy you called!
Haveyou liquidated moose and squirrel?
Did you use the C.D. I?
Yes?
Are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me?
Er...
Then who else are you talking to?
Are you talking to me?
Well, I'm the only one here... soyou must be talking to me... and you are lying!
Now catch moose and squirrel and next time use the C.D.I. On them!
Rocky:
ButKaren, we can'tride to therescuein astolen truck.
Yeah!
Why couldn'tyou steal something with bucket seats?
Bullwinkle!
Just kidding, Rock.
Iùsjust not right.
Iùs not right?
What are you talking about?
They wrecked our car!
They were trying to kill us!
But we're supposed to be the heroes.
Rocky, iùs not 1964 anymore.
You're in the real world now.
Rocky's right, Karen.
And two rights don't make a wrong.
Bullwinkle, thaùs not what you mean.
You mean two rights do make a wrong?
No!
I always thought two rights made a U-turn.
I don't know how much more ofthis I can take.
Well, leùs fii nd out.
Two U-turns make a circle, two circles make a figure eight, two figure eights make a butterfly...
Look, all I want from you guys are results. Okay?
It was their first fight.
Andso, racked with internal conflicts, they made their way across the Great Divide and onto the great plains.
Bullwinkle:
Hey, look at that, Rock!
What a strange looking town!
Andwhile Bullwinkle ponderedthemodern world, severalstates back,
Boris andNatasha... were still tramping along theroad.
Ifonlywe had a helicopter.
Butsince they were in themiddle ofthe desert, there was obviously no chance whatsoever of finding a helicopter.
Boris...
Look!
Oh, damn!
Nevermind.
Natasha, quick.
Natasha:
Whatluck!
Great googly moogly!
Holy cow!
What the?
Hey, listen, gol-darn it!
Thaùs the third time this month.
I'm sick and tired of shopping for helicopters.
Boy, ifl had a missile,
I'd blow your buns right out ofthe sky!
Yes, Boris and Natasha were back in business, but they had no way of discovering the route our heroes had taken...
Hey!
You can'tdo that!
Interstate 1, just outside Red Bait,
Oklahoma, darling.
- Cheaters.
- Thankyou!
And high above our unsuspecting heroes...
Natasha:
- Statepolice?
- Yes, ma'am?
This is FBI Agent
KarenSympathy...
All right,
I'm sorry I yelled.
Butyou don't understand.
I can't mess up this time.
"This time"?
Was there a last time?
Tell us about yourself, Karen.
Leùsjust say
I've made... mistakes.
Look, I can't blow this one.
The whole world depends on it, and I can't do it withoutyour help.
Agent Sympathy, you can count on
Bullwinkle and me.
- We won't letyou down.
- No.
Thanks, you guys.
You know,
I'm glad Cappy picked me for this mission.
I think we're gonna make a great team.
- Huh?
- Oh, no.
And just as this sentimental moment had mercifully come to a close, our heroes were pulled over by two state troopers and a cameraman from the hit TV show, and a cameraman from the hit TV show,
Made Up Stories From the Real Highway Patrol.
Step out of the vehicle with your hands up, please!
Iùs okay, Officers,
I'm with the FBl...
Step out of the vehicle now!
Hey, Rock, your face is all blurry.
So's yours.
This truck matches the description... ofa vehicle reported stolen outside Red Bait, Oklahoma, just a couple ofhours ago.
You are under arrest for grand theft auto and for impersonating
FBI agent, Karen Sympathy.
I am FBI Agent
Karen Sympathy!
Like fun you are.
We both know Agent
Karen Sympathy... has a heavy
Pottsylvanian accent.
We heard her on the radio.
But she really is with the FBI!
Yeah, and I'm really john Goodman.
Leùs get in the car.
Just one minute, Officer!
Wherever she goes, we go.
Yeah, thaùs right.
We're a team!
Well, she's going off to the federal pen... to break rocks for the next fiiveyears.
Okay, well, don't forget to write.
I guess we could always appear atyour trial... as animated character witnesses!
No!
Rocky, Bullwinkle... iùs your duty to get to New York by 8:00 PM tomorrow.
Rocky:
Karen, we can't leaveyounow.
Hey, I'm an FBI agent, remember?
I'll straighten this out, and catch up with you later.
But we've never been in the real world before!
Oh, you'll do great.
I know it.
Hey!
What about our faces?
Oh... sorry.
Wait, you can't just leave them on the side ofthe road like that.
They don't even know where they are.
Don't worry, ma'am.
They're animals.
They'll forage.
Bullwinkle:
C'mon, Rock, time's a-wastin'!
We owe it to Karen to see the president about the trees!
Trees?
Bullwinkle, we have to go to New York.
We don't have time to get to Washington!
This is no time to worry about getting the washing done.
Not "washing done."
Washing-ton!
A ton?!
Well, that is a lot oflaundry.
Bullwinkle, that joke just won't wash!
Well, you can't blame me for drying!
I think I'll fly ahead.
Butit was just no use.
Faced with the utter hopelessness of their predicament, the razor-sharp mind of Bullwinkle quickly formulated a daring plan.
Help! Help!
Somebody please help!
Help!
So on they walked, two lone figures... making their way through a foreign and hostile live-action landscape.
I thought you said we were in Oklahoma.
Would you like to narrate this movie?
No.
And so on they walked, two lone figures... making their way through a foreign and hostile live-action landscape.
They walked until their thumbs ached, but no one wanted to take a chance... ona 6'7" talking moose and a flying squirrel who couldn't fly.
I could f-fly if I had to!
Whoa!
Ow!
Kinda makes you feel discouraged.
Maybe we should be a little more aggressive.
Stop!
This movie's gettin' kind of...
Don't say it!
Two-dimensional.
Yes, things were beginning to look mighty dark... for our intrepid heroes...
It is gettin' kinda hard to see.
Bullwinkle, he means our situation.
Oh!
Wait a minute, boys, there's a couple of headlights.
I think iùs...
Yes! Yes!
It was a couple of fresh-faced college students... named Martin and Lewis.
Come on, Rock!
Iùs a convertible!
All right, buckle up now, fellas.
Yeah, safety fii rst!
So where doyou boys go to school?
We're undergrads at Wossamotta U.
Rocky and Bullwinkle:
Wossamotta U!
My old alma mater!
Bullwinkle was a big football star at Wossamotta U.
- Quarter-buck!
- I thoughtyou looked familiar.
Where are you fellows coming from, anyway?
Thankyou!
We've been on the road, looking for America.
Lewis:
We've been looking forAmerica all day.
Martin:
We just can't find it.
Lewis:
Man, we're exhausted.
Bullwinkle:
Gee, fellas, perhaps you've been looking too hard.
Maybe America is all around you... in a thousand different beautiful manifestations.
Wouldn't you say so, young people?
Yeah, right.
Rocky, haven't we passed this town before?
Following ominously above them in the Midwestern sky,
Boris conceived a sinister plan.
Flying ahead to Wossamotta U... the two villains made asizable donation to the college... in Bullwinkle's name... prompting the college president to bestow upon Bullwinkle... an honorary moosters degree.
And when moose is at podium for acceptance speech,
I'll be on water tower with C.D.I.
There was only one problem...
Wossamotta U. Had no watertower.
Can't even find water fountain.
Their entire scheme seemed to be on the verge ofcollapse, until they hit upon an incredibly ingenious plan...
Together:
What?!
Dawn brokeat 6... 00AM.
The day of Fearless Leader's deadly broadcast... had finally arrived.
And there was Karen, toiling away under the watchful eyes ofa tall, blond, incredibly handsome,
Swedish-American prison guard named Ole.
Several states away, our hitchhiking heroes were doggedly making their way to New York, but little did theyknow they were driving... straight into Boris Badenov's sinister snare.
Heavens to Betsy!
The car is sticking its tongue out at me!
No, iùs not.
Iùsjust a fax.
- A what?
- A fax!
Don't you guys know about faxes?
Yeah, don'tyou know about E-mail?
Sure. A fax is a little red critter... that steals geese and chickens.
Half of them are males and the other half are e-males.
No, iùs a way of transmitting computer-generated information across great distances in the blink of an eye.
Well, I was close.
Lewis:
Oh, hey! Iùs for you.
Hokeysmoke, Bullwinkle!
Wossamotta U. Wants to give you an honorary degree.
And the ceremony is today!
Bullwinkle, we don't have time to go.
We've gotta get to New York!
Oh, woe is me!
I must have my degree!
I'll put it on the wall... for everyone tosee.
I guess if iùs in the name of education...
Oh, it was a happy day at Wossamotta U., scene of Bullwinkle's football triumphs years ago.
Gee, it looks so different.
Everything's in the same place, but...
Well, Wossamotta U.'s been a live-action university since the show went into reruns back in '64.
I thought the buildings looked a lot more realistic.
Say, whereyou guys been all this time, huh?
Reruns.
You know thaùs never gonna happen to us, right?
Well, anyway, there's still a lot... ofanti-cartoon feeling on campus these days.
Hokey smoke,
Bullwinkle!
Iùs some kind of demonstration.
What are the kids protesting these days?
Is it a civil rights march?
Not really...
Is it an anti-war rally?
No, not exactly.
Tell 'em, fellas.
Iùs a anti-moose march.
Yes, itseems that araging controversy had broken out among the students that very morning over the decision to give
Bullwinkle an honorary degree...
Gee, Bullwinkle,
I guess iùs true.
You can't go home again.
Why, Rocky!
Whatever doyou mean?
Wossamotta U. Is home!
Rocky:
Oh, brother!
Look! There's the animated freak now!
My fans!
Bullwinkle, these aren't fans.
This is an angry mob.
Butin the face of danger, our insipid hero... bravely made his way through the angry crowd.
You mean "intrepid hero," don'tyou?
No-oo...
Hundreds of miles away, in RedBait, Oklahoma, it was time for the prisoners' daily helping of disgusting slop.
ButKarenSympathy hadsucceededin making Ole, the simple-minded but incredibly handsome prison guard, fall madly in love with her.
Presently, Karen promisedto let him take her to the movies ifhe would help her break out of jail.
Could we hold hands in the movie theatre?
Of course we could, Ole.
But how would we eat our popcorn?
Well, we could eat our popcorn with one hand... and hold hands with the other.
But what ifl want a soda?
Look...
I'm sure we can work this out.
Good morning, students.
Today Wossamotta U.
Honors one of our own...
As the students vented their collective spleen at Bullwinkle,
RocketJ. Squirrel anxiously surveyed the raging crowd for signs of danger.
And suddenly, his sharp little eyes picked out the terrifying figure of Boris Badenov near the top of the watertower.
Hey! That guy's not a college student!
...that we present this honorary degree... to Bullwinkle J. Moose.
Good morning, children!
Today's lecture is about trees.
Bullwinkle, look out!
Iùs a trap!
ButRocky's voice couldn'tcarry overthestridentshouts ofthestudentbody.
With no alternative in sight,
Rocky tried one more time to summon up those faded aeronautical skills that had once made him a household name.
But just then, Boris managed to turn on the C.D.I.
Aha!
Yes, it looked like curtains for Bullwinkle...
Got to... save...
Bullwinkle!
Rocky:
Whoa!
"Bad command or fii le name.
Press any key to continue."
Which one is "any" key?
Rocky:
Look out!
Oh, no!
With asingle blow,
Rockysent the C.D.I.
Hurtling through thesky... where upon Boris single-mindedly reached out to catch the catapulted computer, forgetting as he did, one vitally important piece of information...
I ain't a cartoon no more.
Aahh!
Darling!
Ow!
Rocky:
Mayday!
You like me!
You really like me!
I guess I've lost the knack.
I'll never fly again.
Yes, without trees, where would the birdies live?
Forced to migrate to the cities, they would take jobs away from local pigeons.
Bullwinkle, they're listening!
Yes, Bullwinkle's speech was soinane... that thestudents couldn'tunderstand a wordhe was saying, andconsequently found nothing to object to.
So RockyandBullwinkle bade a fondfarewell to thehallowedwalls ofWossamotta U.
Don't forget to write, oldbuddy.
Bullwinkle, who are you talking to?
I don't know, but iùs like talking to a wall.
I want to thank you fellas for bringing unity back to this troubled campus with your ludicrous remarks.
Martin and I would like to wish you guys luck against
Fearless Leader.
Yeah, and we would come help you guys, but... we don't wanna get hurt.
Yeah, man, we're not going near him.
Yeah, until we metyou guys, we almost totally lost faith in America.
Lewis:
Youknow, andwe lostfaith in our car.
I used to think our carwas really cool, but now iùsjust always dirty.
And running low on gas.
Yeah, but since we met you guys, we love it again.
Yeah, the car is totally back.
So, as a gesture of our appreciation, we want you guys to have it.
Yeah, so, take the car.
Really?
Iùs yours.
Whoa!
Rocky:
Gee, fellas, thanks.
Yeah, thanks!
You do know how to drive, right?
Please!
What moose can't drive a automobile?
Rocky:
Oh, brother!
Never said I could drive it well.
Andjustas Rockyand
Bullwinkle got back on the road,
Boris and Natasha emerged from the student infiirmary, ready foraction.
Meanwhile, in Cow Tip,
Oklahoma...
Ole, why don't you go get the tickets, and I'll park the truck?
Gosh, Karen!
I've never had so much fun in my whole life.
Iùs like...
Iùs like there was always a little boy trapped... somewhere inside me, and now that I've met you,
I can finally let him out.
Please, two for the love movie.
There you go.
Tack.
Now, thaùs not verynice.
Shut up.
As for Rocky and Bullwinkle, they were gently motoring along an Illinois interstate...
Hey, Rock, there's that same town again!
Areyou sure we're going the right way?
Bullwinkle, look out!
Whoa!
Rocky:
Sorry!
Bullwinkle, we're not going to Chicago!
We are now.
We are now.
As our heroes found themselves racing toward Chicago, little did they realize that only a few miles behind...
And back in Cow Tip,
Oklahoma, the only person in this movie more clueless than Bullwinkle faithfully waited for Karen to get back from parking his truck.
But our heroine was already passing through Indiana... where she was about tomake an ominous discovery.
Announcer:
For watching miserable people suffer in daytime, iùs The Jenny Spy Show.
Are you sorry that you called her fat?
Yes! Yes!
Oh, no!
Not already!
Yes, Fearless Leader's hypnotic broadcast... was already underway.
Announcer:
You are watching premiere broadcast of RBTV.
Ah, I love my RBTV.
Fearless Leader!
The zombombidor shows that 30% of despised, decadent Americans are already total zombies!
Good!
I'll address the nation at exactly 8:00 PM
Eastern standard time.
Back at the RedBait
Prison Farm,
Karen's daring escape had not gone unnoticed.
Meanwhile on the bustling boulevards ofChicago,
Illinois,
Rocky and Bullwinkle were about to discover they had considerable troubles of their own.
There they are!
Motorist #1:
Hello!
Motorist #2:
Look out!
Smush them!
Duck!
Well, mercy me!
Excuse us!
Bullwinkle!
Mamma mia!
Iùs Rocky and Bullwinkle!
And you thought
I couldn't drive.
Bullwinkle!
Look out!
Hold her steady, poopsie.
Is time to say goodbye... to moose and squirrel.
- Ahh!
- Oh, no!
Hasta la vista, baby!
Boris:
Hey, poopsie... whaùs happening?
I think you degenerated wrong special effect.
And while Rocky and Bullwinkle were making their getaway,
Boris and Natasha were still high above the Chicago streets, but with one small difference.
Boris and Natasha:
No helicopter.
And as luck would have it, a travelling mattress salesman just happened to be passing bybelow.
Matresses for sale!
How do I do it?
Volume!
Ouch. Oy.
Now thaùs a soft mattress.
Temporarily outofdanger,
Rocky and Bullwinkle breathed a sigh of relief.
At the same time,
Boris and Natasha were forced to rent... an econoclass Chevy Metro from the Cheapo Rent-A-Car Company in order to resume the chase.
This slight delay gave our heroes the opportunity to effect a not her beautiful, if implausibly coincidental, reunion.
Whoa!
Whoops.
Hey, you lunatic!
Why don'tyou watch whereyou're...
Rocky!
Bullwinkle!
Karen!
Guys, I missed you so much.
I was so worried about you...
I didn't mean to...
I mean...
Good work,
Agents Rocky, Bullwinkle.
Lookit, we have six hours to get to New York.
- The Big Apple!
- Bullwinkle, please!
RBTV is already turning people into zombies.
But Karen, why aren't you injail?
Oh... er...
I was pardoned.
Freeze! Freeze!
Must be some kind of clerical error.
Officer:
You're under arrest.
Keep your hands high above your head!
Andjust to think...
Iùs the opening of moose season.
Iùs the opening of moose season.
Bailiff:
The states of California,
Arizona, NewMexico,
Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma,
Missouri, Illinois,
Indiana and Ohio, versus KarenSympathy,
Rocket J. Squirrel and BullwinkleJ. Moose.
Judge Cameo presiding.
Who speaks for the defense?
BullwinkleJ. Moose, attorney at law.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey!
The defendants are charged with grand theft auto:
One count; breaking outofjail... one count, .
Impugning the character of a prison guard...
- Ooh!
- One count... reckless driving:
Four counts; talking to the audience...
- What?!
- Five counts, .
Criminally bad punning:
18 counts.
And three dukes and seven earls!
Make that 19.
Hey! Hey!
Counselor, call your first witness.
Yes, Your Honor.
As our first witness, the defense calls...
Karen Sympathy!
Oh, please, no.
Doyou, Karen Sympathy, swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so helpyou God?
I do.
Ha!
A little late!
Oh!
Ms. Sympathy, isn't it true that when our convertible was destroyed in Monument Valley... the first thing you did was to steal... somebody else's truck?
Um...
That depends on how you legally defii ne the word "steal," because I believe...
And didn't you escape from prison... by telling that poor trusting prison guard that you would let him takeyou to the movies?
Well, I thought we might have time ifwe went to a matinee...
Isn't it true you never meant to see a film at all?!
Yes... iùs true.
And didn't you tell
Rocky and me... that you got out of prison because you got a pardon?
Yes...
Yes...
I did do that!
Isn't it true you have no respect for the law or anything else?
No!
I was just trying to complete my mission!
I was only supposed to care about results!
And how come Rocky and me are still cartoons... and Boris and
Natasha aren't?
I don't know!
I didn't write the movie!
I'm only one ofthe characters!
Your witness, Counselor.
What are the teams again?
Bullwinkle, you're supposed to be the defense attorney.
You just proved we're guilty.
Yes, but now our consciences are clean, and the healing can begin.
Your Honor, iùs time the court showed the world that no quarterwill be given to celebrity defendants.
- Celebrity?
- Mm-hmm.
Did you say celebrity?
Where are myglasses?
Oh, my Gawd!
Oh, my Gawd!
Iùs Rocky and Bullwinkle!
Oh, my God!
I love, I loveyour show!
Your Honor!
And you,
Mr. District Attorney,
I'd like to point something out to you in the penal code, section C, paragraph22.
"Celebrities are above the law."
This case is dismissed.
Moments later, our heroes were back on the road, with a mere three hours to get from Rabid Froth, Ohio to New York.
Three hours!
If only we had an airplane.
Hokey smoke!
Look!
Gosh!
Another wild coincidence.
Afternoon, folks.
Together:
Hi!
You got any planes left?
Well, leùsjust kinda give a look-see...
I thinkwe have one left.
They've got tobehere somewhere, Boris, darling!
Keep the change!
Oh! This is gonna get my stepson a new trial.
Boris:
Bingo!
Natasha:
Goody! Goody!
Hey! Hey!
Y'all can't get in there.
She won't hold the weight!
You'll never reach the end ofthe runway.
The wings will come off.
Oh, God!
Oh, crap!
Boris pushed the little Metro for all it was worth...
We've got them, Boris, we've got them!
They've got us, Rocky, they've got us!
But at that very moment,
Boris and Natasha's rental agreement suddenly expired and they were immediately blockaded... by the dedicated agents ofthe
Cheapo Rent-A-Car Company.
Come on! Come on!
Come on, you can do it!
You old bird!
Come on!
Come on!
Although Boris and Natasha tried feverishly to complete the necessary paperwork...
Look!
It was too late.
- Stop! Stop!
- Stop!
Stop!
That certainly was a close one.
Leùs just hope this thing makes it all the way to New York.
Where did we go wrong, Boris?
We tried to blow them up.
We tried to have them arrested.
We tried to degenerate them.
We tried to smush them.
Yes, and we never even came close.
Oh, Boris, what are we doing, darling?
We been trying to catch moose and squirrel... ever since we first got drawn.
We tried to stab them, shoot them, smash them, smush them, crush them, bash them, mash them and they don't even know our names.
I'm tired ofall this, Boris.
I don't want to be spy no more.
Leùs faceit, darling, we suck.
We can never catch moose and squirrel.
Boris... don't you want to have little Boris? Hmmm?
Little Natasha?
Wouldn't it be wonderful?
We could rent cottage by sea of Pottsylvania and teach them how to lie, and cheat and be rotten.
They would be worst children in world!
They'd be monsters.
It would be awful!
We could be so happy.
Telephone.
Hoboy.
Saved by bell!
Well, Badenov, did the C.D.I. Work?
Oh, it... it works all right!
So moose and squirrel are dead, then?
Well, is funny you should ask...
Yes, Fearless Leader!
We killed moose and squirrel!
Excellent!
Wait there for my private jet.
I want you both beside my side for the big broadcast.
- Natasha...
- Yes, darling?
Why did you tell him that?!
Because, Boris!
Moose and squirrel can't reach New York... by 8:00 PM in that little plane.
And what ifthey did?
So what?
How could they stop us now?
Practicallywhole country is zombifiied!
We've won, Boris!
We've won!
Just the way
I planned it!
On their way to New York, our heroes were soon to discover... that old Jeb was right.
She won't pull up, we're too heavy!
Rocky, can you fly Bullwinkle down?
I don't think so,
Karen.
He's a huge moose!
I beg your pardon!
I'm as trim as a young fawn!
You weigh 400 imaginary pounds!
Yeah, but iùs all "mooscle."
Bullwinkle, can you fly an airplane?
What moose can't fly a aeroplane?
Rocky, you'll have to fly me down.
I can't do that, Karen.
I can't fly again!
I've lost the knack.
Bullwinkle, take the controls.
Okay.
Listen to me, Rocky.
- You can do this.
- I can't!
- I knowyou can do this.
- I just can't!
This is everything you taught me since I was a little kid.
All you have to do is believe in...
Rocky:
Karen!
Look out for the sign!
Aaah!
Here goes n-nothing!
Gotyou!
Rocky!
Uh-oh!
Together:
Bullwinkle!
Never said
I could fly it well.
See you in New York!
Hang on, Karen!
Hang on!
If I couldjust...
Rocky!
You're flying!
- You're flying!
- Yes, I am!
I certainly am.
Look at me!
I'm flying!
New York City, here we come!
Yahoo!
Yeah!
What a day, a year, a life it is!
You know
Well, you know you had it coming toyou
Now there's not a lot I can do
Dreamer
A stupid little dreamer
So now you putyour head in your hands, oh, no!
Whoo!
Boris, darling, how can you be so rotten?
When I stop moose and squirrel from saving country,
I don't kid around!
Karen looked upon the brave little squirrel with a new admiration.
However, she couldn't help but wonder, were they too late?
Soaringprecipitously overRockefellerCenter,
Karen and Rocky found the entire city of New York completely zombifiied.
Rocky, whatever you do, don't look at the screen!
Touching down outside RBTV, the daring duo was soon to discover that something else was terribly wrong.
Where's Bullwinkle?
The speech starts any minute!
I knew we shouldn't have lefthim.
Bullwinkle and I have never been apart in 35 years!
Quick, Rock, follow me.
Come, Natasha.
Follow me to Fearless Leader.
Go! Go!
Oh, Fearless Leader!
We're back!
You are so-oo happy to see us!
Well, Fearless Leader, he did it!
Boris Badenov is now offiicial number one killer... ofmoose and squirrel.
Excellent, my faithful minions!
Excellent!
Hail, Pottsylvania!
Hail to the black and the blue!
Hail, Pottsylvania!
Sneaky and crooked,
Through and through...
Down with the good guys,
Up with the boss,
Under the sign of the triple cross! Hey!
Hail, Pottsylvania!
Hail, hail, hail!
Thankyou, Fearless Leader!
Well, no one can stop my broadcast now!
FBI! Freeze!
No one but these chocolate-chewing idiots!
All right, I want anyone in this room... who's a Pottsylvanian spy to putyour hands up now!
That means you, too,
Fearless Leader!
Let me see your hands!
All right,
Agent Sympathy.
We don't want anybody to be hurt, now do we?
And whatever you're holding, drop it!
Gladly.
Don't look, Rocky, iùs a trick.
Iùll turn you into a...
Rocky!
Rocky?
Oh-hh!
Peek-a-boopsie!
Fearless Leader:
Well, Agent Sympathy,
I have waited manyyears to face an enemy
I could respect... and I'm still waiting!
No, that was just a little joke.
But I'm afraid that you and this flying rodent have reached the end of the road.
Now get ready for a taste of
Pottsylvanian hospitability.
Thaùs ability to put you in hospital, darling.
Andso, Rocky and Karen's onlyhope in the whole wide world was BullwinkleJ. Moose.
In other words, they didn'thave aprayer.
For Bullwinkle hadmanaged to miss New York altogether and had flown instead to Washington, D. C.
Gee, New York sure has changed a lot since my day.
They even moved the White House here.
Couldn't fii nd the brakes.
Well, as long as I'm here,
I might as well talk to the president about the trees!
Anybody home?
With onlymoments left before thebroadcast,
Fearless Leader hadreleasedRocky... from thegrip ofzombifiication sohe could... share.
As foryou, my friends, we have planned... something quite special.
We are hooking you directly into the quality control.
As soon as we g olive, the current will pass throughyourbrain and you will be turned intoahelpless, mindless vegetable.
But don't worry... it won'thurt.
At least, I never heard a complaint from the other vegetables.
I think your ecognize your three missing colleagues from the FBI?
Help us! Help!
I'm sorry, Rocky,
I've really done it this time.
Don't worry, Karen, you need the most faith when things look the most hopeless.
Thanks, Rocky.
And, Karen... this is pretty hopeless.
Look, we don't care what you do to us... just leave America alone!
Ah, America...
I'm proud of you, Karen.
Listen,
Fearless Leader:
If there's one thing this plucky squirrel has shown me, iùs that you have to be who you are, no matter how much pressure there is to change!
Yay!
Anddespite this inspiring vindication ofKaren's innerchild,
Fearless Leader was unimpressed.
So Karen, Rocky, andthe entire nation... werepoisedon thebrink ofunimaginableperil.
And there is no one...
I said no one... who can stop me now!
Or, in fact, was there?
Soyou see,
Mr. President, all the trees in
Frostbite Falls are gone.
The birds have no place to put their things.
The children have no place to build their tree house.
I built them a stump house, but they say iùs just not the same.
Please help when you have time.
But Gorka, the horse has swallowed the transmitter!
Not again!
They certainly enjoy theirTV at the White House.
Bullwinkle!
Don't watch!
Bullwinkle!
Oh, no!
Notyou, too!
Not a bad show, eh, Mr. President?
Yes, cheap as itmayseem... anditcertainly does seem cheap...
Bullwinkle's head was so thick that Fearless Leader's mind-numbing programming had absolutely no effect on him whatsoever.
Come here!
At least one thing hasn't changed!
TV's as good as ever!
Bullwinkle, allow me to be frank.
Okay, Frank, allow me to be
Bullwinkle.
I'm Cappy
Von Trappment, FBI.
I thoughtyou said your name was Frank.
- Shut up, Bullwinkle!
- Okay, Frank.
As we speak,
99% ofthe country is slobbering in front ofthe television.
- Whaùs so strange about that?
- Listen to me!
We haven't heard from Karen,
I think she and Rocky... are in terrible danger.
You've got to get to New York!
I thought this was New York.
No, Bullwinkle, thaùs Washington out there!
Thaùs Washington!
Really?
Where's that little white wig he always wears?
Iùs no use.
Fearless Leader's speech starts in less than two minutes.
There's no way anyone could get there in time now.
Oh, butterballs!
If only there were some way of transmitting computer-generated animated characters across great distances in the blink of an eye.
Bullwinkle!
Thaùs it!
It is?
Yes, iùs our only chance!
We're gonna E-mail you to Karen in New York.
Well, okay, but don'tyou think... she'd rather get flowers?
Just shut up and hold on!
- Okay!
- One... two... three!
And squeezing into the scanner drive...
Bullwinkle found himself inside the presidential computer.
Butback atRBTV,
Fearless Leader's deadly countdown hadjustbegun.
And thaùs when Bullwinkle snapped into action.
Look, Frank, solitaire.
I'm sorry, Bullwinkle, we don't have time for that!
With the coolagility ofajungle cat, our heroic moose grabbed the corners of the E-mail envelope and hung on for the ride ofhis life.
Eight, seven, si-i...
While time stood virtually still at RBTV,
Bullwinkle surfed the information super highway onhis way tosave the day.
Look, I'm hangin' four!
S-S-Surf's up, dude!
Hang on, Rocky!
I'm coming!
Bullwinkle found himself inside the RBTV computer...
Five...
Computer:
You've gotmail!
...with only seconds left to spare and no idea how to get out.
Four!
Bullwinkle, hurry up!
Click on something!
- "Mine sweeper"?
- Three...
Print! Print!
Andusing his brain,
Bullwinkle activated the 'print"icon... but was hein time?
One...
Fearless Leader!
My fellow Americans.
Say hello to Fearless Leader!
Hello-oo!
You are tired, America.
You are getting verysleepy.
Your mind is mush.
You need help.
Yes, America, you need me to run your country.
Youreallyneedme!
So vote forme asyourleader!
Vote for Fearless Leader!
We will vote for Fearless Leader.
I will vote for Fearless Leader.
Yes, America, I will bring order to the government.
This country will finally have a president you can respect.
Look, iùs moose!
And no sooner had Bullwinkle emerged from the printer than his might yantlers momentarily jammed the quality control signal, reversing the vegetation process and bringing Karen and Rocky miraculously back to life.
Fearless Leader:
Yes, eversince I was a little sketch growing up in Pottsylvania,
I dreamed of ruling the world.
Fearless Leader, moose is loose!
Get them!
Go! Go!
Now, where were we?
Yes. I always knew
I would rule the world someday.
Thaùs exactly whatl'm going to do.
Ouch!
So vote for Fearless Leader and make a little boy's dream come true.
We will vote for Fearless Leader.
Once I am elected, there will be an end to chaos.
There will be discipline.
Because I'm going to run this country... like a well-oiled machine...
I guess you could call me a neat freak, but we all have our little foibles...
That tingles!
...l'll be the president.
And with a single voice,
America will say...
Aaah!
Come on, Rock!
Wrap it all up!
Okay, Karen!
Bullwinkle, finish the speech!
Ahem...
Good evening, America.
Bullwinkle Moose here, saying...
Forgot my line.
Just tell 'em to turn off the TV and vote for whoever they want.
Turn off yourTV and vote for whoever you want!
And whoever wins the election, replant the forest in Frostbite Falls!
And sure enough, all across America,
RBTV viewers turned off their sets and faced the diffiicult question of who they actually wanted to vote for.
And the moment the machine had been destroyed, the three vegetables from the FBI immediately resumed their human form.
Thanks, Agent Sympathy.
Freed at last from
Fearless Leader's evil grasp, even the Pottsylvanian spies rejoiced.
Well, we won't be needing this anymore.
Yeah!
Oh, that reminds me!
I should E-mail that nice Frank an dthank him for his help.
Bullwinkle, no!
Ooh!
Aaah!
Aaah!
Andso the three villains were launchedup into the Internet, where they wouldbe heardfrom nomore.
Aaaaaugh!
And so it came to pass that the election took place as planned.
Yes, Rocky and Bullwinkle were stars once again.
RBTV changed its name from "Really Bad Television" to "Rocky and Bullwinkle
Television."
Whaùs the difference?
Sir, there's one thing
I still don't understand.
Why did you pick me for this mission?
I mean, I'm clearly not FBI material.
FBI material is what gets thejob done, Ms. Sympathy.
If you needed an agent to work with a cartoon moose and squirrel, who would you send?
Someone tough, hard-boiled and cynical?
Or one ofthose soft, squishy, lovey-dovey, idealistic types?
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir...
I think.
Affirmative.
Oh, by the way, good work.
Well, I really want to thank you guys for everything.
And I really...
Well, I really...
I'd really like to say that I thinkwe made a great team.
I'd really like to say... that I think we made a great team.
And if it hadn't been fo ryou,
I never would have learned...
And if it hadn't been for you,
I never would have learned...
That what you believe in when you're young, can still be true when you grow up.
Please don't make me say that.
You gotta say it!
Who is she talking to?
You got me, Rock.
That whatyou believe in when you'reyoung, can still be true when you grow up.
Anyway... thanks for the adventure.
So long.
Where areyou going?
Um... the movies.
Ofcourse!
The movies!
Hi. Um... sorry I'm late.
Oh... thaùs okay.
And as Karen and Ole finally went to the movies, back in Frostbite Falls the president carried out the post-hypnotic suggestion to replant the animated trees.
Mama!
Sonny boy!
Meanwhile, all was well with our heroes.
Rocky was his oldself again...
Aw, I'll never forget our trip to New York to visit
President Washington!
Andso was Bullwinkle.
Yes, glad to be homein their revitalized little town,
Rocky the flying squirrel took a well-deserved joyride through the sunny skies of Frostbite Falls!
- Bye!
- Bye-bye!
When you're feeling like you're...
Out of touch
All alone and lost
And drifting through the night
Just think back toyounger times
And you'll fii nd the light
See the world for a while
Through the eyes ofa child
You will see so much wonder
In your days
All thatyou believed
When you were small
Are still the dreams
That guide us all
The mirror shows you've grown
But reflects the child in you
If you're lookin' out
On stormy skies
And empty fiields
Afraid to give it one more try
See yourself above the clouds
Spread your wings and fly
See the world for a while
Through the eyes of a child
You will see so much wonder
In your days
All that you believed
When you were small
Are still the dreams you carry on lmagine what could be
If you just believed in you
When you were young
Who did you wanna be?
What is stopping you
From that dream?
This is whoyou are
Don't be afraid
The child in you will never fail
The power to believe is yours alone
No one can ever take that child away
See the world for a while
Through the eyes ofa child
You will see so much wonder
In your days
All that you believed
When you were small
Are still the dreams
That guide us all
The mirror shows you've grown
But reflects the child in you lfthere's one thing I could
Say toyou
It would be to try
To makeyour dream come true
You can do almost anything
If youjust believe...
If youjust believe...
If only, only, only
You believe...
This is Report 105 from Xeno
Archaeological Expedition, Team Seven.
Documentation Officer
Kate Carson reporting.
The past two months of survey and research
have resulted in the discovery of a vast, tomb-like complex.
This structure was unmentioned in any report
made by the previous and abandoned expedition to this planet.
Entry to the tomb has now been made,
and examination of the inner chambers may reveal
vital information about the extinction
of the previous race that inhabited this planet.
Despite the planet's two suns,
the surface temperature remains a constant 89 degrees below zero.
However, life-support systems and electrical installations
in the underground headquarters are fully operational.
Safety factor: 60 per cent.
Conditions:
tolerable.
Wait a minute.
Will you take a look at that?
Dean, shine your torch over here for a minute.
This is terrific.
Looks like there's another section through here.
Listen, Dean, don't wander off too far.
No, don't worry, I won't.
- I wanna be able to hear you at all times.
- Yeah, I'll keep in touch.
- Hey, this looks interesting.
- Dean, what have you found?
- Dean?
- Some kind of wall carving.
Can you read it?
Can you make it out?
Means nothing to me.
Can you recognise anything on it at all?
No. We'll have to get Mitch to figure this one out.
Well, listen, don't...
don't stay there too long.
Come back, and we'll have it checked later. Come back now.
- There's something here...
- Dean!
Ricky?
Dean, can you hear me?
Dean, what have you found?
Ricky?
Ricky, can you hear me?
- Yeah, what's the matter?
- Ricky...
Move it!
- Hang on.
- How long have we got?
I don't know.
Can you hear me, Ricky?
Can you hear me, Ricky?
- I'll take him. Come on.
- Sandy, get his legs up.
- Okay, get him up. Come on.
- Come on, Sandy, let's go.
Easy.
Okay, Sharon, come on, move it.
What happened?
What about Dean?
- I don't know.
- Is there much damage?
One sector's knocked out out there.
Okay, you'd better get back there, too, and see what you can do.
The voice communicators don't work in there.
Gary, this is Holly. Respond.
Gary, will you answer me?
Yes, what is it?
Did you check the communicators in the suits like you were supposed to?
I did.
Well, we've had a problem with the tomb,
and the communicators are all dead.
It sounds to me like a frequency block.
Damn it, that can't be right.
Get your ass up here on the double.
I want to know why we have this communications problem.
"Get your ass up here on the double."
I know what I'd like to do with her arse.
- How is he?
Okay, let's get his suit off, please.
How is he?
- What's that in his hand?
- No, don't.
- Get me an isolation unit. Come on.
- What is it?
Holly, give me half an hour, then you can talk to him.
Okay.
I want to know what kind of crystals these are.
- I'll run some tests.
- Okay.
This is Xeno Sub-satellite
Research Team Seven,
Archaeology Team Documentation Officer conducting Interview... 273 with Commander Holly McKay.
Holly, what can you disclose about this accident?
We have no idea what caused the explosion.
Our photographer,
Ricky Williams, was there, and narrowly escaped serious injury.
Dean White has yet to be located.
- But does this mean we have to extend?
- There's no way we can extend.
If we miss the pick-up, there's no telling how long it'll be before Xeno can slot us in again.
- That's all I can say for the moment.
- Well, thank you.
Holly? We've got Dean.
Is he dead?
Technically, he's still alive.
Anything you can do?
I've done everything I can.
I'll just keep him alive until we get him back.
Holly, we must get back into that tomb.
That may prove unfeasible.
Mitch has a theory that the planet was ruled by twins.
That's right.
The inscriptions indicate a very interesting belief in mythology.
Now, everything seemed to happen in pairs.
I've never come across anything like it.
The planet has two suns. Maybe that's the reason for the duplication?
You know, the creation of the previous race fascinates me.
There seems to be a chemical intelligence present.
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
I want to know what caused that explosion first.
Look, we're not gonna change our departure time, but Mitch is right.
I mean, this obviously needs to be investigated.
Sharon, do you have any more information about those crystals?
Well, I've only just started the tests, but there seems to be some sort of... energy force surrounding the crystals.
Look, this team isn't prepared for the contingencies we're facing now.
If it was up to me,
I'd say abandon and get taking off.
But it could be years before anybody was sent back here. Perhaps never.
All our work would be wasted.
Listen, I'm not feeling too hot.
I think I'd better get some rest.
Take care of yourself, Rick.
There's still the question of what caused the explosion.
I think we'll leave it for someone else to find out.
Unknown energy fields are beyond the range of this team.
Barbra, let's tell Xeno to take us off, please.
Can't for 72 hours. They're in orbit.
Well, as soon as you can, then.
In the meantime,
I don't want anyone going near that site without my direct permission.
- Mm-hmm?
- Gail here.
Sorry to bother you, Mark,
but I'm getting an electrical disturbance coming from the lab.
- Right, I'll hurry down there and check it.
- Okay.
- Gail?
- Yes?
Would you do me a favour?
Er... would you ask Sandy to meet me down there?
- Yes, okay.
- Okay, thanks a lot.
Hello.
I love you.
Mmm. I love you, too.
What's the matter with the lights?
I don't know, but I think it's kinda great.
Erm...
What exactly have you discovered from the inscriptions inside the tomb?
I found some very disturbing elements which, at the moment,
I don't fully understand.
Now, the previous inhabitants were obviously highly intelligent, but there seems to be a form of, er... self-destruction...
Mitch, sorry. Er, Kate...
Holly wants to have some photographic evidence of the damage caused by the explosion.
Well, what's that got to do with me?
You and I have been assigned to do it.
Yesterday, Holly said she didn't want anyone to go out there.
Yep, that's more like it.
We should get some evidence.
Do you want to take some photographs, honey?
Oh, I don't know.
I'll be glad when we go home.
Yes, I know what you mean.
Hey, Ricky.
Well, what's wrong?
Hey, what are you doing?
- I've got to find Dean!
- Ricky, come here.
- What's up with you?
- Get out of my way!
Ricky, it's all right. It's all right.
Listen, Ricky.
Listen to me, Dean's not in there.
Let go. Let go!
No!
Stop it!
See to him.
Ricky!
Ricky!
Hey, Ricky.
- Are you okay?
- No, no, no, let's go.
What's down there?
- Where does it lead to?
- I don't know but I'm gonna find out.
- Will you be all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- Where does it go?
- The track.
- I'll check the other route.
- We'll get back to the monitors.
Get to Operations, Barbra.
Oh, no!
He's left that outer door open.
Well, he can't stay out there for long.
Gary, do you see him?
Yes, I can.
He's just wandering around, as if he's lost his sense of direction.
I've lost him, Holly.
Ricky?
Gail!
Get over here, quickly!
I... can't.
I can't, Holly, my foot's stuck.
Gary, any way to override the lock on this door?
I'm not sure. I'll get Barbra to check the main computer.
If Gary can get that inner door open, you could get out there, right?
- That's right.
- Okay. Get this off.
- How long have we got?
- Only two or three minutes, maybe.
- Let's do it slow. Come on. That's it.
- There must be a way of overriding that lock.
Gail, you must get here quickly.
We need to close the airlock.
My thermal unit's gone.
Okay, Gail? Gail.
This is Gary. Now, listen to me.
You must connect the blue and yellow leads.
Repeat, connect the blue and yellow leads.
That will bypass the thermostat.
We can't get to you, Gail.
You have to do it yourself.
Come on, Gail.
Oh, Gary...
I can't do it.
You've got to help me.
I can't help you, Gail.
You've got to help yourself.
The blue and yellow leads.
Oh, Christ, I'm freezing.
Gary, her body temperature's dropped.
Connect the leads, Gail!
- Bloody gloves!
- Down to 36.5.
Gary, I can't do it!
"Can't" is a word
I don't understand.
Now do it, Gail!
You can't give up now.
- Oh, Gary,
I'm gonna die out here.
- She'll go into hypothermia at this rate.
- I can't help you, sweetheart.
- It's up to you.
- Help me, Gary.
35.6.
35.5.
You must do it, Gail. Connect the wires.
The blue and the yellow.
Gail! Listen to me!
She'll go unconscious any minute.
Gail!
No, Gail. Gail!
Reconnect the life-support!
Reconnect the life-support!
- Gail!
This is Gary. Listen to me, Gail.
Gail. Gail!
Bypass the thermostat, woman!
Damn you, woman!
Kate, come here and shut the door.
Oh...
Kate, come over here.
That's an order!
Oh...
Ricky, out of my way.
Ricky, get out of my way.
Ricky!
Well, what would you have done?
You didn't see him in that tomb. He was...
Then I just...
I...
- I just freaked.
- Did you have to kill him?
It's very easy for you to talk here in the operations room.
He was out of his mind.
That outer door was open.
What would've happened if he'd opened the inner one?
Look, any of you could've found yourself in the same situation.
What would you have done?
All right, Kate. All right.
Calm down.
What do you make of Ricky's behaviour?
Well, he was obviously exposed to something out there.
What it is, I've got no idea.
There is a chance it has something to do with the crystals.
- Ah, so a contamination problem?
- No, not necessarily.
You see, the crystals have been in the station about 24 hours, but Ricky was showing symptoms long before that.
No, I think whatever it is must break the skin, as in Ricky's case, or at least have some form of close physical contact.
My tests don't show any organic matter.
What do you think they could contain?
Well, we're gonna have to get samples of that stuff, because people are gonna want to look at it.
Holly, surely there's no obligation to continue with any of this?
I know, Kate, but it's my job.
You want to be careful with that, Mitch.
Yeah.
You know, there's something about these crystals that we just haven't discovered yet.
Now... their energy must have something to do with a life source.
Do you mean there might be something out there feeding on them?
- We'll lose audio here.
- Okay. Stay close, huh?
Don't worry, I will.
Sandy! Sandy!
It's okay. It's all right. Come on.
Sh-sh-ssh. Sandy, Sandy.
Come on.
Okay, that's enough.
Come on. She's calming down.
What happened out there?
We shouldn't have brought him in here.
- Sharon, I have to examine him.
- No!
Give her one of your shots, and clear her head.
Sandy, do you hear me?
- She's in no condition to talk.
- I'll put her in condition.
She needs to rest.
Sandy, we have to know what's out there.
Try, Sandy.
- Try.
- Leave her alone.
She can't hear you.
Listen, Sandy's in a deep trauma.
No...
I think she's been literally scared out of her senses.
No...
How do you feel?
- Thirsty.
- I'll get you a drink.
- You got any pain?
- No.
Thanks.
- I feel sick.
- Hang on.
Come on.
Back we go.
Get your legs up.
- Sandy, I want you to take these.
- Oh, I couldn't.
- Does that arm hurt?
- Yes.
- You gave me an injection, didn't you?
- Yes, I did, but in the other arm.
- Let's have a look.
- Ooh.
Come on, Sandy, come on.
It's all right. Come on, come on, back you come.
There we are, it's all right.
It's all right.
Now listen, Sandy, we're going to give you a thorough examination, hmm?
Holly?
Yes, Karl?
Problem?
- Yes, it's Sandy.
- Oh, how is she?
Well, she's fine as long as
I keep her sedated.
But do you remember the marks
I found on Ricky's hand?
- Yes?
- She has one on her arm.
- Oh, Christ.
- Yeah, and that's not all.
As you know, Holly, I perform certain prescribed medical duties...
- What are you getting at?
- Including quarterly injections to restrict...
- Are you trying to tell me she's pregnant?
- Two months.
That can't be.
We had our injection the same time.
Please! No!
No! No!
Jesus.
Now we'll never know what happened.
That's the end of our project.
All right, what's
Xeno's position, Barbra?
We should be able to make contact in six hours.
Well, then all we can do is wait.
Mm...
Ah...
Hi. Feeling better?
I tell you, I can't wait to go home.
Don't know about you but I've had this mission.
Don't know what's going on but whatever it is, it's weird.
I agree with Kate completely.
We should abandon and go home.
Can't wait to go home.
Go away.
Go away!
I said, go away!
Holly, go away!
Go away!
- Hey, there's Sandy.
- What are they up to?
Sandy?
Mmm...
Ah!
Ow.
Ooh.
Pay attention, please.
Secure all stations.
Remain just where you are.
Secure all doors.
Do not admit anyone.
Do not admit any personnel.
- Mark?
- Yeah, Holly?
- Mark?
- What's going on?
Sandy's killed Barbra.
- What are you talking about?
- Listen, she's killed Barbra.
- I don't understand this.
- No time to explain.
You gotta reach Sharon right now.
- Well, where's Sharon?
- In her quarters, I hope.
Mark, please be careful.
- Who is it?
- It's Mark.
- What do you want?
- Open the door.
No.
Hey, quit screwing around, Sharon, and open the door.
We've all had instructions to keep our doors locked.
Sharon, I'm ordering you to open this door.
My instructions came from Holly.
Well, get Holly on the damn communicator, then!
Control?
- I've got Mark outside the door, and...
- Well, open it!
Come on, Sharon.
- Are you there?
- Yeah. Hello?
- Mark, you with Sharon?
- Yeah, I'm here, she's here.
Bring her up here now.
No, no, no...
- Go to the mess hall first.
- What for?
We may need food.
Okay.
- Be careful.
- Yup.
- What's going on?
- Come on, I'll tell you later.
Number three scanner's gone dead.
Damn it, four's gone now.
At least she's nowhere near those two.
What's that?
I don't know. Come on.
I'll take that.
Can't you fix it?
I'm trying, Holly, I'm trying.
Is there something wrong with the videos, Gary?
You've got it. We've lost six.
- Did Sandy do that?
- Yes, she did.
Why would she knock out the videos?
I'll take care of this, Gary.
That was a smart idea.
Switch on emergency.
Where's Kate?
Kate?
- She's very strong!
- What weapons have you got?
We've got to stop her, not hurt her, Kate.
There's only one way to stop her, and that is to kill her.
What do you suggest?
Do you know anything about that, Kate?
Explosives.
You wouldn't know where to detonate.
With the videos out, she could be anywhere.
- Unless you were on the spot.
- We could use the touch burner.
- What's that?
- Used for heat sealing.
Burn right through her brain.
- What do you suggest?
- Keeping her alive!
He's the doctor.
Ask him how to keep her alive.
- I could inject her with a drug.
- Shall I hold her arm while you do it?
She's pregnant, Kate.
That'll look great on the report.
"The team were terrorised by an expectant mother."
She's blowing up the place.
Transmitter's out.
She's thinking fast.
- What about Xeno?
- We're out of contact.
- Someone help me.
- Sandy?
She's in the exercise room.
- Holly, I'm going to her.
- Don't be a fool, Karl.
Holly, I'm a doctor, and she's in pain.
- She might have gotten hurt in that...
- I'll decide who goes!
Well?
If I can restrain her with the burner, can you sedate her?
I'll get my things.
- Where's the touch burner?
- Preparation chamber.
- Stay here, Gary, please.
- Yes, sir.
What's happening to me?
Help me.
Someone, please.
Help... please.
Come on.
It's all right, Sandy, it's all right. Come on.
- It's all right.
- Now, Sandy...
Now come on, take it easy.
I'm here, okay? Just relax.
Give me your hand. That's it.
- Now take it easy, come on.
- Ssh.
- That's right. Now...
- It's okay.
- Come on now, just relax.
- Don't worry.
Take it easy, that's it.
- Don't worry. It's all right.
- Hold her, Sharon.
- Just relax, come on.
- It's all right.
It's not going to...
No!
Come here, Sandy. Come on.
Come on!
- You've got to keep steady, Karl.
- Holly!
- Out of my way!
- Holly!
No! No!
No!
Sharon! Help me!
Sharon! Sharon!
Sharon!
No! No!
Help!
Watch it, Mark.
Okay, come on, Sharon.
Watch your leg.
Put your arm around me.
- Please, help me.
- Are you okay?
Come on.
Come on. Kate?
Get her to the chair.
Have you seen her?
- What is it?
- It's her leg.
Let me have a look.
Where are the others?
- Come on, it's all right.
- Gary, I don't know.
She'll be okay, it's not broken.
How are we gonna stop this?
Well, if we can get to the space preparation chamber, we've still got picks there.
- It's no good.
- Look, we've got to try something.
- There are chainsaws.
- She's too strong.
You can't get away from me, you know.
It doesn't matter what you do, you'll have to come out sometime.
There's no other way.
So why don't you... all just come out now?
Mark?
Mark.
I'm waiting for you.
This is our chance.
For you.
You needn't be like the others.
What do you think?
You keep her occupied, we'll get the equipment.
Why don't you just... open the door?
It would be so easy.
Mark?
Mark.
I'm waiting for you.
Mark?
I'm waiting for you.
Our best bet's the derelict passages.
She won't look for us there.
Mark!
Mark, I'm waiting for you!
Mark!
Please, help me!
Sandy?
Sandy, can you hear me?
Sandy?
Mark...
I need you.
Sandy...
I promise you, I'll help you.
I promise you.
Can you hear me?
Oh!
Kate!
What was that?
Mark?
- No...
- Kate! Quiet, woman.
Sa...
Sandy?
- Sandy?
- You can't escape me.
Is that out?
Sandy?
- Is that off?
- I don't know.
Sandy?
Quickly, let's get out of here.
Oh!
Oh!
Kate!
Move, woman!
Ohh...
- Mark?
- Yeah, Gary. You all right?
Where are you?
Outside the airlock.
What the hell are you doing out there?
She chased me out.
I'm okay, but I don't know how long I can stay out here.
Is your air system functioning?
It's fine.
You worry about yourself, Harvard.
- Oh, no.
- Gary, what's the matter?
She's... she's breathing the atmosphere.
She's... she's what?
Oh, no.
Gary! Gary!
Help me.
Help me.
Gary!
Gary?
He's here with me, Mark.
Damn it! We're dead!
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
I'm going to kill her.
I am going to kill her. No!
- Get those lights... get the lights on!
- Don't leave us.
No! No!
No!
No! No!
Mark!
- Kate, what the hell are you...?
- Jesus, what have you got in there?
- Come on, Kate!
- In there.
All right, Kate, get her in here.
Can you carry...?
I'll get the door. Let her go...
Over there.
- She's gonna come looking for them.
- That's right.
Lock the door.
Lock it, Sharon.
No!
Ah...
Ahhh!
Mark!
Sharon?

Adios, amigo
Oh, no.
Some of our investments are plummeting.
Why can't your plastic surgeon give the stock market a lift?
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
Dear Lord, no, no, no, no, no.
That's--
Oh, my God!
- What?
- I think I found another line, is what!
I can't believe this.
This is horrible!
I'll tell you what's horrible.
Even pork bellies are sagging.
Oh! Nope, nope, nope.
It's just a little eyelash on the mirror!
Never mind.
Never mind, never mind.
Lizzy, bring me two aspirin and some warm milk.
Anything you say, Mr Flint.
- You want somethin'?
- I want... four dozen Ding Dongs and a giant Ho Ho.
Bring Mrs Flint two carrot sticks and a mushroom.
What would they do without me?
Is that her?
Wow. she's an ugly old broad isn't she?
You'd think with all her millions, she could afford a plastic surgeon.
Rich people are nuts.
Let's be one of 'em.
Who is it?
I know karate.
Lizzy are you milking the cow?
Mulcer's doing a tango up here
"Cheerful faces.
Smiling hellos.
"Neighbours who don't knock when they come over!
"The kind of town that has a really nice feed store.
"Everyone says,
'Have a nice day' still.
"Hot dogs.
Apple pies.
"Quiet, tree-lined streets named after rodents:
"Squirrel Lane;
Chipmunk Square;
"Badger Bend.
"Apparently Snow White lived here at some point.
"This is my home, a world of bake sales, hoedowns and barn raisings.
"Even our cable sucks.
What's a hoedown?
- Sounds like yard work.
- Seriously.
"It's as if this town has the power!..
- "To suck the very brain right out of your head.
- Patti--
- And with some people, you wouldn't even notice."
- Patti!
The assignment was to give a report on town pride.
There must be something here you like.
"I like my cat.
The end."
Hey, DC.
Come to walk me home? Huh?
Patti, honey.
DC, I told you to leave the mother at home.
- I see you
- Don't look at her!
Maybe if we ignore her, she'll go away.
I know it's not cool to let your mommy pick you up... but the town council meeting let out early and-- Oh, Christmas.
Honey, why do you always wear black?
Because it matches my soul.
Well, it doesn't do much for your eye colour!
- So how was your day?
- Mind-numbing as usual.
Mom, can we please move to Boston?
Now, sweetie, I think that you  just don't take advantage... of all the wonderful things that this town has to offer you.
- Like what?
- Well, I don't know.
But when I was in high school, we kids just had so much fun.
I was in glee club and spirit association.
Why don’t you go out for cheerleading?
Oh, my goodness, look.
Fish sticks for dinner!
DC!
That cat is a delinquent!
Uh,just lemme get these lug nuts off.
Ever wonder where the expression
"big lug" came from?
How long will it take, Dusty?
Oh, about 15 or 20 minutes, Mrs Randall.
- Is that all?
- Twenty minutes?
My grandmother could do it faster than that.
She's got replacement hips.
I'll do it in ten.
Oh,yeah? Well,
I'll do it in nine.
Eight and a ten-percent discount!
- Twelve and a free battery charge!
- Seven...
Fifteen percent off, free oil changes for a year and free gum!
- Now top that, doofus!
- Doofus, huh?
- Ooh.
- I'll doofus you, buddy boy.
So you heard nothing?
Oh, my wife keeps a tape of jungle noises going in the bedroom at night.
It's like a Tarzan movie in there.
Lizzy polished the pygmies' pot so beautifully.
I'm so upset, I'd-I'd cry. But my tear ducts haven’t worked since my last eye job.
We'll try to find Lizzy as soon as we can, Mrs Flint.
Oh, it's so important.
You really have to f--
Do you know what it is that baffles me? I-I-I--
How could anyone mistake Lizzy for me?
You know, I mean, we're both thin and hopefully pretty.
But I spent a quarter of a million dollars to look like this.
Excuse me.
Captain? Captain!
Captain.
I been collectin' hair and lint samples from the Flint's bedroom.
Uh-huh.
Uh, Kelso,you know that the-- the kidnapping happened...
- downstairs in the kitchen, right?
- Yes, I know this.
And the Flints were in the bedroom at the time of the crime.
- Now you're with me here?
- Uh-huh, 100 percent.
Okay, don’t you think that the really good clues... would come from, oh, say, the place where the crime was committed?
Unless, of course, the crime did not happen in the alleged kitchen.
The kitchen is there.
It's not alleged.
It exists. We have proof.
Captain, these people are liars.
Now, how do we know that?
S-See that lady over there?
She told me she was 39.
I'm tellin' you, cover-up.
Okay, Zeke.
Here’s what I want you to do.
Walk into the kitchen... grab some coffee and bring it to me.
Good. Then what?
Then get some cream.
Y-You're not serious, are you, s--
I like my cream.
I'm watchin' you.
Oh, thank you.
- Yoo-hoo, Mrs Randall!
- Hello there!
Hi, Patti!
The Candy Cane, where young Edgefelders go... to get a sugar buzz and then go day-tripping.
Oh, Patti,you are so dramatic.
- Streets look clear!
- Mm-hmm.
Quiet day.
Yeah. Quiet can be misleading, Melvin.
- Quiet does not necessarily mean safe.
- Yep.
Yeah.
There! You see what I mean?
That's a 524 right there.
Girl in street chasing cat.
Drive, Melvin. Drive like you've never driven before. Drive!
Don't hit the girl.
Don't hit the girl or the cat.
Oh, honey! Lord in heaven, you could've been injured!
- Are you hurt? Are you bleeding?
- No.
How's DC?
Well, he's got fleas. But I think he had those before you got here.
Well,you ladies have a good day now.
We will, thank you.
Goodbye, boys. Patti!
- Bye.
- Those are such nice boys.
Sure wish we could do somethin' about those fleas.
We're just men, Melvin.
Not gods.
- Let's go.
- Ow.
Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!
Mom, eyes forward, head straight. Don't look up.
- Patti, where are your manners?
- Who's down there?
Hello, Mrs McCracken.
- Hi.
- Now I'll never get out of here.
- Who's that with ya?
- That's Patti.
Patti? Who's Patti?
I'm her daughter!
Um,you've only known me 16years.
It'd help if ya dressed in colour!
DC, it's not time for dinner!
Get over here.
What's that, Tweety?
Ah! Tweety says hello!
Look, Mom, the bird talks.
Oh, Patti, sometimes I wonder who snuck in in the middle of the night and raised you.
Mrs McCracken, could we get you anything at the butcher's?
I could use half a pound of ground chuck.
All right. Bye-bye.
Thank you very much!
Why is it so painfully hard for you to be nice?
I think you wound up with all the "nice" in the family, Mom.
I swear, Patti,you can be such a pain in the--
- Say it.
- No.
- Oh, come on, Mom. Say it.
- You will not make me swear!
You will not make me swear!
Yeah, I know.
She's a hard one to crack.
Yoo-hoo, Lu!
Hello, Mrs Randall, Patti.
Hey, now,you've done something new with your hair!
- Oh, it's a bun.
- Turn around.
Oh, I think that is nifty.
- Very becoming.
- Thanks.
Well, I need half a pound of ground chuck and a watermelon rose.
- Okay, Mrs Randall.
- Did you do this?
Yes.
Lu, that’s wonderful.
You’re very talented.
Thanks. Yeah, I once built a castle out of Spam.
- No.
- Yeah. Had a spiral staircase up to the turret.
Really? Oh, wow.
Hey,you know, if you are free on Saturday... you really should come to our annual cat show.
There'll be a lot of eligible men there.
Oh, I don't know.
Saturday's my big TV night.
Well, try, okay?
Because it is gonna be fun.
Our head judge this year!..
Has the cat food with the dancing cats on the label.
You know-- Chow, chow, chow.
I am not exaggerating.
It is gonna be an extravaganza.
Ooh, an extravaganza in Edgefeld.
Patti, shush.
Teenagers.
Just put that on my tab, okay? Thanks, Lu.
Oh, DC!
I don't know what to do with her, Peter!
She refuses to even try to get along with people.
Well, I say we sell her, get enough to cover that orthodontia.
- I am serious,you.
- Ow.
Honey, there are two... very important things lacking in your personality:
- tolerance and empathy.
- Hmm.
Now,you showed an awful lot of disrespect for Lu today.
- I was just agreeing with her!
- She is a sweet gal.
And she takes her work very seriously.
Mom, she moulds meat.
You push me,young lady. And you enjoy it. Admit it. You enjoy it.
- Oh, no. I derive no joy from it.
- Um, ladies--
Despite the maid's net worth of$2388..
the kidnappers are demanding one million in ransom.
Boston police have brought in the FBI
- So far there've been no leads But Boston police--
- Boston?
It's always Boston. Why can't anything like that ever happen here?
...quick apprehension of the perpetrators
This is of course the same Chief
Fitzwilliams who expressed optimism...
for the quick apprehension of the perpetrators..
of most of Boston's crimes in the past year.
There he goes, just like clockwork.
Why do you think he leaves here every night at 8.00?
- Because he can.
- Fitzwilliams swears it will be different.
And we at Channel 11 support him.
This will teach ya to steal my customers.
Doofus!
Quiet night.
Whoa! Did you see that?
No, I didn't!
Don't get involved.Just drive!
That guy needs new tires.
- Ooh
- What you want
- Baby I got it
- Ooh
What you need
Do you know I got it
- Ooh
- All--
Yes.
Come here, kitty. Come here.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Come to Mama. Come on.
Come on!
Good boy.
Run along.
Oop, 7.20. Better get down to the bookstore.
- A new Danielle Steel coming in today.
- Whoo.
- I wonder if it'll be a romance.
- Hmm.
I'd read it myself, but the TV movie's always better!
- Bye-bye, honey.
- Bye.
Honey, would you pass me the front page, please?
Thank you.
Hey, DC, what ya got there?
What is this?
- How weird.
- Hmm?
Mom, read this.
You will not make me swear, young lady.
I was not trying to make you swear, Mom.
DC was wearing this.
That's ridiculous. Why would anybody give a watch to a cat?
This looks like the same Timex.
- Honey, would you pass me the margarine, please?
- Oh, my God.
- I know who gave DC the watch.
- Who?
Her.
Hillary Clinton?
No, Mom.
Below the fold.
See? That's the maid that got snagged.
I'm telling you, it's the same watch.
Yes, but honey, it's a Timex.
Thousands of people wear that watch.
DC, do you know this person?
See?
DC, do you know this person?
That's totally not fair!
Drink up your juice.
It's good for your skin.
As you can see, we've isolated a partial fingerprint.
But it's not enough to identify the kidnappers.
- Oh.
- Now, sir, before we proceed... we need to be clear on one thing: are you prepared to pay the ransom?
Um, look, I-I have to be blunt right here.
You see, I-I love Lizzy like a member of my family.
But there is a problem.
Now s-some-- Uh, I--
I'm fat broke.
You’re what?
I'm sorry, sweet cakes.
We're broke.
What?
We're broke. It was the stinkin' '80s.
The stock market was calling to me.
I-I made time like a drunken sailor on leave.
I jumped in bed with every leveraged buyout,junk bond... rumoured corporate takeover there was.
Right now
I'm $17 million in debt.
- Seven--
- I wouldn't be able to raise 50 bucks..
Even if they had kidnapped my wife.
So much for Plan A.
The only thing I don't understand is why her watch says "hell."
Oh, Patti, please. I can't take any more of this.
- Help me Rhonda, help me get her outta my heart
- Okay, so I'm kidnapped.
I'm trying to get a message to the outside world.
- And I write--
- Help me Rhonda
Help, help me Rhonda Help me
Rhonda Help, help me Rhonda
- Help. Duh, I write help.
- Help me Rhonda Help, help me Rhonda
- Help me Rhonda Help, help me Rhonda
- God I'm really good
Those Charlie's Angels reruns are really starting to pay off.
Oh, Patricia, please.
- Help me Rhonda,yeah Get her outta my heart
- What?
You're trying to tell me that your cat walked 60 miles to Boston... bumped into the kidnappers, got the watch and came all the way home... on the same night?
- Isn't he amazing?
- And you are basing this entire theory... on the fact that a part-time alley cat came home... with a watch that says
"hell" on the back.
- Rhonda,you caught my eye
- What did you say?
And l can give you lots of reasons why
- You've gotta help me Rhonda
- Nothing.
- Help me get her outta my heart
- You said, "hell." I heard you.
- I did not. I did not.
- You did too. Oh, Mom, I'm so proud of you.
Listen,you just forget about that watch, okay?
It is your job to be a student.
Let's let the policemen solve the crime, okay?
Help, help me Rhonda Help me
Rhonda Help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda
Help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda
Help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda
Yeah
Get her outta my heart
My cat saw something, okay?
Hey, I've got proof!
Look, the kidnapping took place in Boston. This is Edgefeld.
So obviously their hideout is here.
That's absurd. Why would the kidnappers do that?
Because they know the local police are idiots!
- Teenagers. Come on.
- I know.
- Grandma, I feel sick.
- Ohh.
Can I have a Big Mac on the way home?
Sure, honey.
Is anyone here?
Why aren't you at school gettin' an education, Patti?
Because I'd rather be getting cavities.
Could I have a chocolate soda, please? And
DC here will have a dish of whipped cream.
Nice outfit.
Going to a funeral?
Yeah. My youthful enthusiasm just died.
Aww. Why so glum, chum?
Oh, I'm sick of being ignored.
Now, actually, it can be a blessing not to be noticed, honey.
Not when you want to be noticed.
And I'm tired of living in a town that gets excited...
-when a new stoplight is installed.
- There's a new stoplight?
A couple of years, you can leave old Edgefeld.
Yeah. I live for that day.
But unfortunately I'm stuck here for the foreseeable future.
- Just like us.
- You guys feel stuck too?
- Mm-hmm.
- We'll be okay.
Yeah. So will I.
Excuse me, sir.
I'm sorry to interrupt.
But I've got a little girl outside who claims... that her cat witnessed the kidnapping.
I'd love to talk to her, but a couple of dogs have already come forward on that one.
Yes, sir! Um, she would, uh, like to file a report.
- So?
- I-I'm up to my neck. Please.
- You?
- Please, I've got--
- All right. Dismissed.
- Thank you.
- I'm Patti Randall.
- Hello, Miss Randall.
How are you? Nice to meet you.
Please, uh, have a seat.
- You can call me Zeke.
- That's some picture you got there.
Oh,yeah, that's my father! He was an FBI agent under J Edgar Hoover!
He looks really serious.
He never laughed one time in his entire life.
Unless, of course, it was an order!
He must've been, um, a real fun guy.
They used to call him the 24-Hour Man because, uh... there wasn’t a case that he couldn't solve in less than 24 hours.
That's amazing.
How long does it take you?
So, Miss Randall, I understand that you witnessed the Flint kidnapping?
Oh, well, uh, I didn't witness it, actually.
Um, DC sort of stumbled onto it.
- Where's DC?
- At home, uh, sleeping.
Well, how come he didn't come with you?
Well, I wasn't sure if you allowed pets in the building.
He's a cat.
It's-It's-- He's my cat.
As in--As in
Morris the--
Yeah.
- DC's actually a big fan.
- This is real funny.
Ha, ha, ha!
Joke's on me, boys! Ha, ha!
Send Zeke the kid with the cat!
I bust my butt to be taken seriously in this place. This is how you treat me?
And in front of my father, no less!
Agent Kelso, my cat did see something, okay?
I'd appreciate it if you'd try to take this seriously.
You know,you-you send me a-a-a-a witness... that doesn't have four legs and use a sandbox, and I'll go to work.
Look, this is what I got off my cat, okay?
Look it, see, it says, "help" on the back. I think it's from her!
Okay.
I-I-I know this looks a little odd,you know--
Odd? It sounds like you’re 12 short of a dozen, Kelso.
- It's not even a hunch.
- It's more than a hunch.
Look, I-- I checked this, uh-- this sales record for this Model 705 Timex.
Now, this was a promotional line... meaning there were only a couple sold in the Boston area.
I checked with the Flints. They bought one for their maid for Christmas.
I mean, it's a genuine gut instinct!
Well, far be it from me to interfere with a gut instinct.
Zeke... go tail the cat.
Good one. Good one, sir!
Good one.
Oh, oh, I'm gonna need a team for this one. Mm-hmm.
- A team?
- Please?
- Pretty please?
- Okay.
Take four men, one evening.
But you better come back with more than a whisker!
Another good one, sir! Thank you, sir!
I could-- I could kiss you, sir!
You could.
But I wouldn't recommend it.
Kiss me.
Cats.
Hey.
Hey!
Now, this is going too far!
So every night at 8.00, the cat goes out.
Yep.
- Hmm. Well, then, I'll be over at 7.00.
- Pretty nifty wheels.
Not every day you see a car with shag carpeting and a bobbing dog head.
- Thanks. I did it myself.
- Never would have guessed.
- Two chocolate sodas.
- Thank you.
Don't drink'em too fast.
Your head'll freeze.
Uh, here we go, Pa.
The afternoon rush.
- Patti! What are you up to?
- Nothing. I'm not up to anything.
- I just came to see you.
- Okay, thank you.
I did. Can't I miss my mom and dad?
- Mom, come on.
- Patti, what’s wrong?
Nothing.
She just came to say hi.
Actually, I came to surprise you guys.
Two tickets to C-- Cats.
Oh, honey, look.
The Community College Road Company at the Oaken Bucket Dinner Theater!
Oh!
Well, I know I've been kind of a pain lately, so I wanted to make it up to you.
Ohh!
So this is for tonight.
There's dinner with the show.
All the prime rib you can eat, so go.
- Ohh!
- Thank you, honey!
Ah, what a little gal.
She is gonna be okay.
First thing I have to do is photograph the witness.
- Hey!
- Oh, be careful. He scratches.
- Are you sick?
- No, I'm allergic.
Could you just put him on the table, please?
Okay, but usually we yell at him when he gets on the table.
Hey, what's that?
A clue. It's a twig, but it's a clue.
It's red, and it's sticky.
- Maybe blood.
- Blood.
I need to bag this, label this and catalogue this.
Do you have a bag and a label?
I have Saran Wrap and masking tape.
Desperate times call for desperate measures.
Who's that?
- It's my team.
- You have a team?
Of course I have a team.
Every agent has a team.
- What's the point?
- I’d just be happy to get home early tonight.
Gentlemen!
Tonight you’ll be tailing informant X. And
I hope that leads us to the kidnappers.
Now it's important that informant X not be aware of your presence.
He’s very--very skittish.
Here are his stats.
Eyes: light brown.
Hair: grey.
- Weight: ten pounds.
- Ten pounds?
- He's a cat.
- Aw, come on, man. What's the joke?
- What?
- He's a cat?
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!
I will coordinate all activities here at command central. That's the cat's home.
Cat-quarters.
- Come on,y'all, this is serious.
- Zeke.
It's a cat.
Come on, come on!
This is serious!
This is Kelso.
Does everybody read?
- Blue team in position.
- Tabby patrol in position.
Red team in position.
Sorry, man.
Just coughed up a hairball.
They're good men, my team.
Excellent senses of humour!
I-It helps to ease the tension.
How'd it get so cold all of a sudden?
Stand by! Informant X is leaving the house!
Weird.
What's the deal?
Why isn't he moving?
He's supposed to be moving.
Okay. Go!
Hit the road.
He's off.
He's movin'. He's movin'.
It's 8.00.
You're not a cat person, are you?
Oh.
Okay, men.
Here he comes.
He's on the move Here he comes.
Yeah. He just turned rght.
I don't see anything.
No, wait. I got him.
- After you.
- You're taller!
- Go first.
- Uh, thanks a lot.
- Yeah.
- Great.
- Come on. Let's get this done.
- Okay.
Come on. Give me your foot.
Here we go.
- Ready?
- Yeah, I got it. I got it. I got it!
- You forgot this.
- Fine.
Perfect.
What the hell's out there?
Oh, n-n-no! No!
Oh, get him off me!
Get him off me, please!
P-P-Pete, it's Kelso!
What's goin' on out there?
- Swing him around and l'll shoot him!
- The cat?
- Get him off me!
- No! Do not shoot the cat.
Do not shoot informant X.
I repeat, do not shoot informant X!
We weren't gonna shoot informant X
It's a dog It's a rabid bulldog
The bulldog's Smokey.
And he's not rabid.
He’s just senile. You have to sing to him a little bit.
- He's a Motown fan.
- Do you know any Motown?
- Get him off me!
- Come on!
- He's got my butt! Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!
- Come on now! Ooh!
Big dog!
The cat just jumped from a roof onto a terrace.
Proceed with caution.
Two down.
- A quiet target is an easy target.
- Using the siren was a good idea.
Okay. I got him now.
Okay, Dusty. Let's see what you keep hidden in the trunk.
Holy smokes!
- Weird town, man.
- He's not talking about Edgefeld.
I believe he is, Miss Randall.
And these men have seen it all.
Darn cat!
Try driving that away, sucker!
Hee-hee-hee! Yes, siree!
Kelso, man, I cannot make this place out.
- Looks like the coast is clear!
- Okay,you cover me. I cover you.
Okay, go! Go! Go!
- What a pretty pink bow.
- Don't touch it!
- Is it ticking?
- I'll see.
No.
Hey, meat!
Meat? That's a threat.
Like a dead fish on the doorstep.
Mob, or worse.
- Vegetarians?
- Get inside.
Oh! Don't step on the meat. Oh!
I just saw some vixen deliver meat to a couple of guys.
Ex-Excuse me-- Excuse me.
We have a young girl in the room here.
No, Zeke I just saw some woman deliver actual meat toa couple of guys.
- Cat's on the move.
- I'll secure the door!
Melvin,you man the window observation point.
Nobody there.
Pete Pete man! Talk to me man!
What's goin 'on out there?
Talk to me!Be careful.
The suspect could be dangerous!
Are your pizzas extra yummy?
And how old are you?
Oh, 16. Are you a pizza face?
- Just sounds like some sweet old lady.
- Oh, don't be so testy. I'm just funnin'.
- Mr Pepperoni Cheeks.
- I'm gonna get a little closer!
Hello, hello?
I can hang up on you too.
Who does he think he is?
- Whoa!
- Help! Help!
Who's out there?
The cat got the drop on me.
It was sweet of Patti to give us those tickets, wasn't it?
What a nice little girl we have there.
- She is the best. Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.
Do you think she's happy, honey?
She's a teenager!
She's not supposed to be happy.
True.
- What are you doing?
- Huh?
- You don't smoke cigars.
- Well, I don't buy cigars.
If a guy in a cat suit gives me a free one, I'm gonna smoke it.
- Well, not in my car,you're not.
- Am I supposed to walk home?
Absolutely.
- I will leave the light on for you.
- See that you do.
- Really? Hmm.
- Mmm.
Kelso, this cat has been sitting here for an hour!
- Now what do you want me to do?
- DC? DC?
Hi. What're you doin' here?
DC, it's me. Honey!
- DC!
- Kelso, an unidentified man's abducting the cat!
Well, don't let him.
We need the cat!
DC!
Hold it.
Don't move.
All right, cat man.
Up against the car!
Aw, the cat's gettin' away.
Miller, detain the suspect.
Phil, Steve, stay with the cat.
- Where's he goin' now?
- I don't know where he's going. I'm not a compass.
Oh, there he is. There he is.
All right, go, go, go!
No, he's goin' in the trees.
I hate trees.
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know. I'm all turned around.
There he is.
There he is.
Kelso, the cat has entered a house.
- I can see the shadows of two unidentifiable people
- What are we gonna do?
Awaiting orders, Zeke
Are you scared?
N-Not scared, Patti.
Just cautious.
In life, it's important to be prudent.
And besides, if these guys get killed,
I'm in big trouble.
- You're goin' in!
- One.
- Two.
- Three!
Don't-Don't-Don't move!
Uh-oh.
You know, we have a doorbell.
Huh?
Now, all we want to know... is what you wanted with the cat.
I told you, he's my cat.
But if he means that much to you, you can have him.
You're in serious trouble, mister!
This is an official
FBI investigation.
I just wanna know your name!
Don't lie to me!
'Cause I can tell when a man's lying.
I can see right through him.
Randall.
I'm Peter Randall.
Peter Randall.
You wouldn't happen to be related to a Patti Randall, would you?
Hey, Mata Hari.
What's up with you?
- You on stake-out?
- How did you find out?
Well, when they arrested me for picking up my own cat, that was a red fag.
I'm really sorry.
I meant to tell you too.
It's just that no one would listen to me about the watch.
Yeah. Uh, let me get this straight.
You mean to tell me that a kid like you got a whole squad of FBI men... down here to Edgefeld to follow your cat around all night?
- I'm impressed.
- You think mom would feel that way?
- Not a chance.
- So you’re not gonna tell her?
Mmm, well, I guess it's all right if a father and daughter have one secret.
- Merci.
- Yeah, I'm the best.
Just don't spread it around.
I got a reputation to maintain.
Now you go to sleep.
And, Patti... try and make a human friend, for your mother!
Hey.
Uh--
- Where have you been?
- Uh--
Go back to sleep.
This is a dream.
Peter, it is 6.30!
Re-- I got 6.24, honey.
I have been out of my mind with worry.
What happened to you?
Well,you know--
Well... it was a very long cigar!
- And?
- And...
I had a wonderful time with you last night.
- Excuse me?
- I had the prettiest date.
- I always do.
- Oh, I don't believe this.
This is the most inconsiderate thing you’ve ever done.
I guess we can talk about this in the morning then, huh?
Ooh.
If anybody needs me, uh,
I'll be down here, okay?
Boy,you sure had a big night, didn’t you, Kelso?
- Look, Captain, I-I know it looks bad--
- Bad?
No, we passed "bad" an hour ago.
Right now we’re on major career bungle.
If it was up to me right now, I would take your gun. I would take your badge.
But you’d let me keep my parking permit.
That must mean you like me, right?
I guess I'm off the case, right?
You're off the case.
- Hey, Captain, let me just say one thing--
- You're almost out of the Bureau.
Would you like some coffee? Huh?
Oh, boy. I need to solve this crime to keep my job.
- Randall.
- Hey, Kelso.
- I'm just doing a little research on some people.
- And what'd you find?
Absolutely nothing.
What are you doing here?
The thing is, I think that, though slightly obnoxious, you actually are onto something.
Oh, really?
Because I think you... although painfully inept, are my only shot at finding this woman.
- Thanks.
- So, partners?
No. FBI agent and kid.
Where are you going?
I'm going out to the tool shed to get a screwdriver!
Oh, honey, please don't cry.
It's just a screwdriver!
Oh, it's not the screwdriver,
Peter, and you know it.
In 20 wonderful years of marriage... you have never kept anything from me.
You told me about that Aunt Jemima thing.
It was Halloween.
I was 13years old--
You told me how they called you Tubby in school.
Just until sixth grade.
I wish you hadn't brought that up.
Peter,you are keeping something from me.
You know, that Tubby stuff is still kinda painful after all these years.
Forget it.
This is supposed to be blood?
That's how it was labelled.
You'd better get Boetticher!
Why do these street lights keep on flickering?
Thanks for including me in the investigation.
Hey, this is not an investigation.
This is me and you walkin' around so you can show me your town, okay?
- I've gotta get him. He's gonna get hurt.
- Stay back. I'll handle this.
- Hurry up.
- Don’t worry.
Baby love
My baby love
Wow. You can really belt it out.
Thank you. Thursday night's my karaoke night.
- Party often?
- Yeah.
I'd like to charter a plane to Argentina.
No luggage, one way.
- And I'd like extra nuts.
- Who is that?
- That's old lady McCracken. But I thought she was a shut-in.
- I insist on it.
First class.
Spare no expense.
I'm loaded.
I'm too sexy for my shirt
- Uh, Patti, about the butcher--
- Yes?
Yes, I got the order!
Well, I was afraid it might go bad.
Well, it better be delivered by tomorrow, or else it's dead meat.
Tomorrow? Tomorrow's the day the ransom's due.
Oh, she's definitely in on it.
It must be some kind of, like, kidnappers' code.
- Kidnappers' code? Oh!
- Too sexy for your body
The way I'm disco dancin'
Oh, not again!
So Lu is a spy for McCracken who's, like, the brains behind the whole thing.
So Melvin and Marvin are, like, muscle guys?
- So why’s she hidin' in the alley?
- Hey! Lamb chops!
Whoever's stalking us is probably watching us... right now!
- Does my hair look okay?
- Hey, it looks like he's signalling somebody.
No!
What in the name of all that is good still left in the world are you doing?
I was thanking whoever left the meat.
- Than--
- Melvin!
You're a burger and a fries short of a Happy Meal.
W-W-Wait! Hey, hey! Oh!
- Act Natural. - A full Happy Meal.
- Don't look suspicious.
Lamb chops down the drain.
All right, so I've got it.
Lu, Melvin, Marvin and McCracken are all in on it.
And when Lu drops off the meat... they transport the maid to a hiding place that McCracken picks.
This'll stick in your tank, Dusty.
Okay, Dusty, you wanna play hardball?
All right. This'll teach you to rip me off.
Take that! And this!
- This!
- Uh-oh!
Stay back!
You okay?
Why do people always ask somebody who's just had their slammed into something hard if they're okay?
You might wanna check that out for evidence you know?
It's right by the donut shop there at Ballard
Can you bring me back a sprinkles?
Oh, I wonder how that happened.
Well, it's obviously a conspiracy. I mean, they're hiding in ski masks, making plans to skip off to Argentina.
I can't believe this whole town is full of criminals.
- Patti, would you stop jumpin' to conclusions?
- What? These people are nuts.
Car 13. Car 13. We have a report of two unidentified suspects--
one male, one female-- trespassing
Could be prowlers Over.
Okay.
Ugh, what a mess. He's all covered in stickers and twigs.
Stickers and twigs?
This is where DC got the bloody twig.
Lizzy was dragged through these leaves.
- Officers, no need for alarm.
- Freeze! - I'm a federal agent.
- Hold it!
- I'm-I'm gonna get my ID.
Forget about the ID.
If you're an FBI agent,
I'm Oprah Winfrey.
Oh, I love your show!
Get in the car!
- In the back, in the car!
- This is ridiculous. They can't do anything to us anyway.
All right, put your hands on top of the car! Spread your legs.
Well, now. What do we have here?
...and don't forget to call your wife
Hmm?
Cat got your tongue?
Good one. Hmm.
Did I take you off this case?
Was that me?
Um, sir, I think you might find this interesting.
Um, we found the source of-of the bloody twig.
- The bloody twig?
- Mm-hmm.
- The bloody twig?
- Oh.
The bloody twig is a stem from a maraschino cherry!
Oh. Never mind.
- Kelso...
- Mm-hmm?
Out of respect to your father!..
I've tried to keep an open mind, but I can't do it any more.
You're an incompetent agent and an embarrassment to the department.
- Oh, Patti!
- Oops, uh, my turn.
You see? I was not lying to you.
There's no deep, dark secrets here.
I was just trying to be a good father!
- Believe me, it's the last time.
- This is how you help her!..
By letting her run around until she ends up in prison?
I don't know how to answer that.
I'm Captain Boetticher!
Mrs Randall, Mr Randall... on behalf of the Bureau...
I just want to apologize for getting your girl involved in all of this.
Well, I do have to say,
I find it surprising... that you would listen to a 16-year-old in the first place.
Well, ma'am, the watch with "help" on it was a very convincing piece of evidence.
It didn't say "help." It said "hell."
- It said "help."
- No, it said "hell."
No, I believe it said "help."
No, it definitely said
"H-E-L-L."
Wow, Mom. You swore.
I'm sorry.
The Edgefeld investigation... is closed.
You can't go to the movies.
You can’t watch TV.
You can't eat dessert. You can't go out with your little friends.
She doesn't do those things anyway.
You have put me in a terrible position in this town, Patti.
You have been hurling accusations. You have gotten innocent people arrested.
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry is just not good enough, Patti.
Now, I don't know what kind of a person you are choosing to be... but it is not one that I am very proud of right now.
While we are at the cat show...
I would like you to think about all the people that you have hurt... by your jumping to conclusions, all right?
- Peter!
- You go--
It's all your fault.
I don't belong here anyway.
One ticket to New York, please.
- One-way or round-trip?
- One-way.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Hey! What are you doing here?
- Waitin' for a train.
- Oh.
So where you goin'?
I don't know.
Anywhere that's not here.
This is kind of sudden, isn't it?
I mean,you're not in any kind of trouble, are you?
No. What are you talking about?
Nothing.
What's in the bag?
Clothing, books, pictures, a veal roast-- pieces of my nothing life.
Lu, I sense depression.
Oh, I just gotta get outta here.
I'm tired of being in love with someone who doesn't love me.
You're in love?
With who?
- Melvin Yazbo.
- Melvin?
Yes. I've secretly been in love with him for years... watching him patrol, knowing he'd lay down his life for someone in need.
I left meat on his doorstep.
Lamb chops, veal chops, pork chops. He likes chops.
I was always told a way to a man's hear twas through his stomach... that a nice steak spelled "love."
That's why you left the meat?
- I thought he'd figure it out.
- Oh.
I've been getting things really wrong.
I mean, maybe he-he did figure it out and he’s just not interested.
No. No. I think you’re way off, Lu.
Melvin is totally getable.
- Not by me.
- Lu, he doesn't even know you.
You haven't even tried.
You can't go around staring at him and leaving anonymous pieces of meat.
But they're the best cuts.
No visible fat.
Lu,you have to make an effort.
There's a right way and a wrong way to get to know people.
- Maybe if I were more like you.
- Like me?
Yeah.
You know, sharp, funny, outgoing.
You dress so cool.
I bet you’re really popular!
I wouldn't bet a lot.
But you're so young.
How do you know all of this?
I guess I just figured it out, like, two seconds ago.
Express train to Boston and New York...
now arriving from Bellows Falls and Worcester.
- The train's coming.
- Yeah.
Well, what do you say we cash in our tickets and give this place another shot?
I'd say it sounds good.
I need a tune-up and an oil change.
I’ll just leave you my wallet.
It'll make it easier for you to rob me blind.
No problem. The car will be ready in 30 minutes.
- I'll do it in 28.
- You want a fat lip?
Well, remember!
- He's shy, so be bold.
- Thanks.
- See ya later, Patti.
- Bye.
Why can’t you ever just torture mice or something?
Huh? Hey.
What's this?
Huh? DC!
DC!
Melvin!
Lu?
Wow! Ow!
I think you bit my lip.
- Oh.
- I liked it.
I sent you the meat!
I should've known.
Best cuts.
No visible fat.
You noticed.
How could I not?
- I-I need my inhaler!
- Oh, my goodness!
Norman! W-W-Wait.
Come with me.
- Norman, I think I'm engaged!
- Yeah!
I'm gonna strangle you, DC!
What are you doing? DC!
Kidnapping is a-- is a double tragedy..
for Elaine and me first, because we love Lizzy..
- and uh, second because we're broke
- Oh! - Oh!
Snack room.
And I'm out of decaf.
So if you want some,you go down the block and get it yourself, okay?
Zeke, it's Patti.
I know where she is. DC found her!
- Say goodbye, Patti.
- No, no,you don't understand I'm rght outside
No, no,you don't understand.
You falsified evidence.
You manufactured a witness.
You made me look stupid.
I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry.
I'm cleanin' cups.
My coffee's done.
I gotta go.
- Ow. That must've hurt.
- Oh, good. Am I glad to see you!
- Who are you?
- Oh, I'm the one who found your watch.
Oh, thank God somebody found it.
They almost caught me.
I didn't get to finish the "P."
Oh, don’t worry.
I did it for you.
I'll have you outta here in a sec.
Oh, my God!
It’s you!
The celebrity judge should be here momentarily.
This is a disaster! He was supposed to be here over 30 minutes ago.
Well, honey,you know these
Hollywood types-- fashionably late.
Maybe he left a message on the machine at home.
This is a most important mark of this cat.
It has a thick, shaped head a long lovely tail..
expressive ears, big eyes.
Hello. You've reached the Randall residence
If you're looking for Patti...
I've left town to go and depress some other once-happy community
Don't worry,
I'm not coming back
If you're looking for my parents, leave a message at the beep.
Regular or decaf?
Hello,Agent Kelso?
This is Mrs Randall, Patti's mother.
Is Patti with you? We can't find her, and we're afraid that she may be missing.
Uh, no, Ms Randall, but wherever she is, I'm sure she's fine.
- She's wearing an overcoat.
- Oh, well... uh, thank you very much.
Goodbye.
Anything else?
What to do?
What to do? What to do?
Well, if I go, then it's an automatic suspension... possible termination, career as a coffee bean expert.
But, on the other hand, you know, the kid's in trouble, so--
You would go, wouldn't you?
Okay, okay, okay. Where to start?
Where to start? Where to start?
Butcher!
Love meat!
Butcher!
Butcher, butcher, butcher!
Okay. McCracken.
Security guard.
Okay. Patti said the butcher signals the security guards where the maid is.
All right, when she's doing that... what are the rest of them doing?
FBI.
Mrs McCracken! Please, put your teeth back in before you lose 'em again.
How could I lose 'em?
I never go anywhere.
Open your mouth.
Come on. Open it.
No, this is wrong.
She's the ringleader of a conspiracy like-- like a butcher is a-- a messenger.
There's nothing here.
What am I gonna do?
Okay, okay. I need a--
I need a new strategy. No more manuals.
I gotta-- I gotta think like a cat.
A cat knows.
Yeah, I am a cat.
I am a cat. I am a cat.
Thinkin' like a cat.
I'm slinkin' like a cat.
I'm slinking, thinking like a cat.
Slinking-- Slinking and thinking like a cat.
Moving like a cat.
Movement.
I am movement.
I am instinct. I am motion.
I-I am-- I am cracking up.
Slinking, slinking, slinking, slinking, slinking.
Okay. I like slinking.
It's more fun than walking.
Hey, fella,you need help?
Okay, okay. DC likes--
DC likes meat.
DC likes to use my head as a launching pad. Oh, great.
DC likes--
Garbage!
DC likes garbage!
Come on. Bring her back.
That's good.
Take it.
Excuse me! Excuse me!
Um, have you-- have you seen--
- Ha-Have you seen a grey-and-white cat?
- Recently or in my lifetime?
Recently.
No. Wanna hear about my lifetime?
Thank you very much for your help, sir!
Okay, let's go!
Take her away!
Cherry stems!
Oh!
Lookin' for clues.
Lookin' for clues. Lookin' for clues.
Cabbage! Hey! I'm on the trail.
I'm on the trail. I'm on the trail.
Sorry, Patti. You know what they say-- curiosity killed the cat.
- Hello?
- Have you got any rocky road?
- Yes.
- You better pave it.
FBI! Hit the floor and drop the guns!
Drop the gun!
You okay, Patti?
What? Nobody says
"please" any more?
- Zeke! You smell really bad.
- Happy to see you too, Patti.
What happened?
- Got in a fight with a Dumpster and lost.
- Oh.
I'm watchin' you.
I'm watchin' you.
Ah. Thanks.
And who are you?
Zeke Kelso, FBI-- at your service, baby.
Oh, wait!
What about DC?
- The cat.
- Oh, my! Let's not forget him.
Okay, okay, DC. L-Let's go, let's go.
Hey, come on, man.
Don't even start with me. Okay?
- Grab the gun, Ma, or we're goners.
- Okay.
Who's in charge now?
- Why did you do this?
- We partied away all our cash in Monte Carlo.
Yeah. And the Riviera.
- Plus, we were bored out of our skulls.
- Oh, I can relate, but still--
Hey, hey! Don't sass your elders.
Let's do it, Pa.
- You're coming with me.
- Oh, here we go again. - I got her!
Shut her up, Ma.
So long, suckers.
You know, two can travel faster than three. Okay!
- Where's the car?
- It's at Dusty's getting a lube job.
- Kick it in.
- I'd rather go through the window.
- What?
- Keep the getaway car nearby, Pa?
How should I know?
It's my first kidnapping.
Excuse me, kidnapper?
I need to use the bathroom.
- You should've thought of that before we went on the lam. - Hey!
Aha! Gotcha!
I knew it!
You've been messin' with my cars.
- No, I wasn't. I was--
- How do you like this?
Just like Monaco in '67.
Except I don't have my own teeth.
- I said-- I said, get in the car!
- I'm not getting in there! - Get in the--
- Let's take the truck!
- Great!
They have a TransAm.
We have a beaten-up truck.
Patti. It's not the size of the dog in the fight.
It's the size of the fight in the dog.
- Gun it, Pa!
- You got it, Ma!
- Ma and Pa's Geritol must've just kicked in.
- Yeah!
- Okay, we need to cut 'em off. Get in front of them.
- Then they'll be chasing us!
This will teach you to mess with me, buddy boy.
- Someone's messed with the car! She won’t turn right.
- Then turn it left.
Oh, my God, did you see that? That was, like, a 360 twice. In fact, a 720.
I hope you’re happy.
I don't need a bathroom any more.
Into the skid. Into the skid.
Into the skid. Into the skid.
It's the moment we’ve been waiting for
We're cheek to cheek on the ballroom floor
- Zeke, that smell is getting worse.
- Tell me something I don't know.
- Try this. All the kids are doing it.
- All the kids are wearing air fresheners now?
- Oh,yeah. It's real cool.
- Cool.
We're gaining on 'em.
You know, he had the right of way.
Who gave him a gun?
- They're gaining on us, Ma.
- Oh!
- It's a dead end.
- Watch the road.
- It's not him!
- Sorry, sorry, sorry!
- Eh,you swing like a girl.
- Oh,yeah? -Yeah.
Okay, that's it! I'm sick and tired of you pushin' me, mister!
- I've got something for you.
- Oh,yeah?
- Yeah.
- Well, I've got something for you.
- Oh,yeah?
- Yeah!
And don't drip on my sidewalk.
I'll drip where I want.
I noticed you didn't use your turn signal.
Oh, great. Smokey's out.
- Everybody better practise their Motown.
- Hang on, DC!
Don’t worry.
The FBI'll fix that. Huh?
Go faster!
Stop hitting things!
- Here.
- Aw,you're so sweet.
We'll always have Paris.
He's smashin' way more stuff than me.
- Stay down! Stay down!
- What a place to put a window.
- Marvin, we're under attack!
- What’s your longitude and latitude?
The butcher shop.
We're at the butcher shop.
What is it with these criminals and meat?
Look, there! It says "no left turn."
Can’t you read?
- Oh, shush.
- And your hands are supposed to be at 2.00 and 10.00.
At this point, I'd take a hundred bucks for her!
This is my favourite jumpsuit.
Hey, come on.
Not in the face.
- Eat paint!
- Eat fuchsia, baldy!
- I'll see you on the street.
- This town has gone totally insane.
Sorry I'm late, folks.
The kitties needed new head shots.
Look at the size of that cat.
- I hate to bring this up, but Pa's headed straight for--
- The gazebo!
Sorry, ladies!
I like rock and roll!
And so are we!
Man, has Pa gone post office or what?
She still won't turn right.
We gotta go around again.
- What are you doing?
- I brake for animals!
Zeke! Stop!
DC! That darn cat.
What's happenin' out there?
You and I finally found love, and it could all be over!
- What a kick in the butt.
- Oh.
- I've come to rescue you!
- I knew you would.
I had to. You're my brother!
Come here, little bro.
- Thanks, Marv! Oh,you know Lu?
- Hello, Marvin.
Yeah.
Lu and you?
You know, Marv!..
Sometimes happiness is right in your own backyard or butcher shop.
Oh, man.
I threw away all those chops.
Let's get the heck out of this town.
One, two, three, four, five.
Oh, no!
Somebody call the fire department!
- Holy mackerel!
- Oh, no!
Just a sleepy little town.
I don't see how you stand it.
Low bridge!
Oh!
- Gimme your air freshener!
- No! - Come on.
Now I know what a sardine feels like.
- Things are gettin' hot around here.
- I think there’s something wrong with the engine.
I was right.
What do you know?
Lu and Marvin finally got it together!
Watch the road, Pa!
Melvin, Melvin! They've knocked out the lights. Get my flashlight.
One more push, and this will sign them off!
Don't move!
Okay, okay.
It's gonna be all right.
Yeah!
Freeze!
If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again--
- I finally left my apartment.
- If you need help, hangup and then dial your operat--
- Guess everything turned out all right, didn't it?
- Yeah, it was real good.
Patti! Oh!
- Miss me?
- H-E-L-L,yes.
- Mmm, I want some ice cream.
- Is a maid worth all this?
- Mr Randall?
- Oh, Officer Kelso. Hi.
- You know--
- Mrs Randall.
- There she is.
- Lizzy!
- Lizzy! Oh, Lizzy!
- Hi.
I-I hope you’re not expecting to be paid for this week.
Oh, we missed you so much, so much. Have a Ho Ho.
- Where's my Ding Dongs? Where are my Ding Dongs?
- Two butcher shop windows... a gazebo, a security office and a flower stand. All totaled?
Not to mention, two blown-up gas stations?
So you just had to do things your own way, huh?
Always alert and thorough, sir!
Not exactly 24 hours, but the victim is safe and sound.
And I think your father would be proud of you.
- W-What's that on your shirt?
- It's lettuce. - Oh.
This is so cool, Patti.
- Pretty scary picture, huh?
- Oh, I think it's good.
- Really? - Mmm-hmm.
- DC looks good.
Hey, listen, Patti. I'm having a party at my house tonight.
- Do you wanna come? - Yeah, sure.
- Okay. - Sounds like fun.
Hey, FBI girl!
- Who's that?
- My friend from the Bureau.
- Whoa, a fed.
- Well, I'll see you later tonight.
- Bye. - Bye.
- She's hanging outwith the FBI?
- Man, I'm happy if I see a fire truck.
- No kidding.
Hey, G-man.
W-Wait a minute. Did I see you talkin' to the locals?
I-I mean,you're gonna lose your
"queen of the freaks" title.
Yeah, well, being queen is kind of overrated.
So, how-how's it feel to be popular?
- Well, I'm not complaining.
- Oh.
How's it feel to be your own man?
Well, at least none of my assignments include cream and sugar!
How come your name's first?
Well, we've been over this time and time again.
- You see, it's alphabetical.
- Oh, right, right.
So, uh, where's the fleabag?
He-He-He’s working on another case?
No, his crime-fighting days are over!
He's got other things on his mind now.
Aw!
- That darn cat
- Somedays life is just the way it's supposed to be
Sometimes everything goes to the dogs
People calling out his name like he's supposed to care
They call him that darn cat
- That darn cat
- Call him till you're blue
- Just don't expect him to respond
- That darn cat
- Even though it's you he's still a cat
- That darn cat
What would you have him do go chase a stick out on the lawn
If you want your shoes go get a Lab
Catch him if you can
Come on,you're just a man
That is that darn cat
- That darn cat
- If you are a mouse
- You'd better run back to your hole
- That darn cat
- If you are a dog you'd better hide
- That darn cat
He's got sharper claws and teeth and tons of self-control
Most of all that cat has got his pride
Never leave your side
He'll work for food
Well, that's now
That darn cat
That darn cat
You can yell out all you want
Say here, kitty
Just be sure you got some tuna fish
He lives the life He likes to let you think that you're the man
But you know he's that darn cat
- That darn cat
- And that is that darn cat
- That darn cat
- Farewell to that darn cat
- That darn cat
- Just call him That Darn Cat
- That darn cat
- So Long
Thanks: subtitle's author
The Empire of lzmer has long been a divided land.
Ruled by the Mages, an elite group of magic users.
The lowly Commoners, those without magic... are little more than slaves.
Izmer's young Empress Savina... wishes equality and prosperity for all.
But the evil Mage Profion has other intentions.
At last!
Come, Damodar.
Release him.
You are mine now.
Come to me!
Yes, I told you it could be done.
You have the power of the lmmortals.
You can control Dragons.
With a Dragon army at my command...
I can crush the Empress... and control what is rightfully mine!
You don't like that, do you?
Good!
I can use every ounce of your rage!
Come on.
Follow me.
Follow me!
I said follow me!
What now, my lord Profion?
We shall have to modify our plans.
Summon the High Council of Mages immediately.
They're about to learn something of our young Empress... that may give them pause for thought.
It will be done.
This must be some twisted magic experiment... gone seriously wrong.
Why is it every time something bad happens... you blame the Mages?
When was the last time you saw a river catch on fire?
You think they care if anyone got hurt?
I'd love to find a way to give those Mages some payback.
"Ridley the Savior."
That'll be the day.
Look, Ridley, things are the way they are.
There's nothing you can do to change it.
You got your haves and your have-nots.
We are your gotta-gets.
And right about now, we gotta get paid.
The Magic School.
The what?!
The Magic School?
Are you crazy?
We'll break into the Magic School.
Think of what we could get.
With the fire, it won't be heavily guarded.
Think of the challenge, Snails.
Think of what we could find in there.
If we pull this off... we'll be the envy of every Thief in Sumdall.
Trust me.
Why would the Empress want to disband this Council?
It's a concept
I find difficult to believe.
Azmath, your loyalty is commendable... but we have all watched the Empress' growing up... and we have all heard her views... on what she considers to be the injustices of the land.
But she is just a young woman.
Young people speak from the heart, not the mind.
In time, with our counsel... she will come to understand why things cannot be changed.
Maybe so.
But is that a risk you are willing to take?
Her revolutionary ideas... have already taken root among the people.
In time, her influence will grow.
As the months go by... she will learn to master the powers of her Scepter.
When she does,
I have no doubt... she will use it to enforce her changes upon us.
What do you propose, Profion?
I humbly ask that we vote to remove the Scepter... from the Empress' control... so that government in lzmer will remain secure.
Remove the Scepter which lolls above our heads... and destroy the threat of revolution forever!
And if she does not agree?
Then... her true intentions will become clear.
And then we will be forced to do whatever we must... to protect the strength and unity of lzmer.
What say you?
How could he get the Council to turn against me?
He plays on the fears of the others-- their fears of change.
I know, Vildan... but the changes I propose are for the good of the people.
All people deserve to be free and equal... whether Commoner or Mage.
I know this within the depths of my soul... and if necessary...
I would die to make that the way lzmer is run.
What can I do to stop Profion?
You must outsmart him.
Over the past years,
I have been searching... for an ancient artifact called the Rod of Savrille.
It holds the same powers as your Scepter... with one difference--
It controls Red Dragons.
If you could obtain it... you could relinquish your Scepter to the Council... and still have protection against Profion.
I must have that Rod of Savrille!
With one wave of it,
I will topple her... and bring down that useless
Council of idiots with her.
What is your wish, my lord?
Pay a visit to the Magic School and see our friend Vildan.
Persuade him to give you the scroll of which he speaks... and bring it here to me.
And, Damodar... make sure that he's no longer around... to give our young Empress any more good advice.
Come, my friend.
Ridley, why it got to be so high?
Snails, let go of me.
Can't we just rob the first floor next time?
Hurry up.
Why don't we just rob God while we're up here?
Come on, Snails.
I thought you said this was going to be easy.
No, I said it wasn't impossible.
That's the same thing you said... when we robbed that little Halfling's house.
Who'd he catch? Me.
Who'd he beat from the waist down? Me.
-Are you going to jump?
-You going to catch me?
-I'm going to catch you.
-Promise?
I promise. Now jump.
All right.
Sorry.
I thought I heard something.
You did.
Me hitting the ground.
That is a big Dragon.
Now we're talking.
All right. Let's get to work.
I've already told you, Marina.
The Empress can't use... her Scepter of Gold-Dragon control... or Profion will paint her as a tyrant to the Council.
Profion must be made to expose himself to them.
Damn it, I know it's here.
Where is it?
It should be right here.
Are you sure you put it away in its proper place?
I'm sure.
You're sure, are you?
Then why is it filed here with these volumes on alchemy?
It belongs in Dracology.
Where is it?
I know I've got it somewhere.
Ah, yes, this was it.
Really, Marina, you must stop dawdling.
The Empress only has three days until the Council... forces her to relinquish her Scepter to them.
-I'm sorry.
-That's all right.
You must understand the seriousness of our task.
I just feel like I should be doing something more... than shelving books.
I understand, Marina... but you must learn to be patient to maintain focus.
That's the best help you can provide just now.
I suppose you're right.
I never saw a scroll so hard to decode!
It's protected by very ancient magic.
Marina, fetch me some Manticore wing.
-What is that?
-A Dragon tooth.
-Put it back!
-Just a Dragon tooth.
-Put it back.
-A Gold Dragon tooth?
-It's too big. Put it back.
-Come on, Ridley.
Here.
What'd you give me the rodent for?
Pick it up! Come on.
You already got enough of these at your house.
Look at this.
We're going to be rich.
You know how much we could get for one of these?
Don't touch that!
One of the lab creatures must have got loose again.
Marina, check on it.
Right.
Snails, relax.
It's an illusion.
I knew that.
Don't touch anything else!
All right.
What are you doing?
We're the...
The cleaning crew.
Right.
This is dirty.
Cleanup crew's more like it.
You're Thieves trying to rob us.
She must've put a holding spell on us with that bracelet.
It must be the only way she can get guys to come home with her.
I'd have to put a feeble-mind spell on myself... to want to take you home.
That was funny.
You're going to the city dungeon.
That wasn't.
What a relief.
I'll be thanking you when they cut my head off.
You should.
It'd be an improvement.
There's that superior intelligence... you Mages are so famous for.
Yes, well, speaking of intelligence... what kind of genius would break into a Magic School?
He'd have to be really stupid or--
Or what?
Well...
Master!
If you don't tell me which scroll it is...
I'll have to kill you painfully.
Never!
Are you crazy?
You just zapped...
The Chief of the Crimson Brigade!
To the streets of Sumdall!
Follow them, you fools!
Where are we going?
Hey, nice trick!
No, the other way!
Watch out!
Lady, please, stop and listen.
Escapes are our bread and butter.
-What's that?
-I don't know!
Get this rope off so I can deal with it!
Can't nobody get a moment of peace around here?
I ought to...
Nice lid.
You shouldn't have done that.
Check that door.
It's locked! It's locked!
Follow me!
If you think I'm going in that filthy mess--
That's disgusting!
Post Brigades at every sewer entrance and exit.
I want them found... now.
Marina of Pretensa, student Mage... is sought for the brutal murder of Vildan Vildir.
A reward will be...
I can't believe this!
You better believe it.
They're framing us.
They're framing you.
You're nothing but a Thief.
They can't be framing me.
I'm an aristocrat. I'm a Mage.
A low-level Mage-- completely expendable.
Practically worthless.
This is ridiculous.
I'll go to the authorities.
I can't go to the authorities.
That's right.
They'll toss you in prison... and torture you till you confess.
You better tell us,
'cause like the man said... we're your accomplices.
All right.
Come on!
You allow... a slip of a girl to escape you... with the scroll... and now Norda, the Empress' finest tracker... is in pursuit... and you tell me not to concern myself?
It was a mistake.
It will not happen again.
There you are right.
And here's why...
Just a friend I'm sending along for the ride.
A gentle reminder not to make any more mistakes.
The moment you deliver me the Rod...
I'll ensure that he-- it... vacate the premises.
Now... may I suggest... that once you two have become fully acquainted... you follow the Empress' tracker Norda.
She happens to be good at her job.
She will lead you to our missing friends... and the scroll... and this time, Damodar... don't fail me.
It's about time!
If we find the Rod, the Empress heaps us with gold, huh?
Why don't you try and rise above being a Dwarf?
This isn't about gold.
It's about saving our Empire.
Empire?
Who cares about the Empire?
You Mages are the only ones who benefit from it.
Oh, really? That's an interesting sentiment... coming from a guy who steals things for a living.
Have you ever heard of honor amongst Thieves?
We might live outside the law, but we respect each other.
Unlike a bunch of back-stabbing Mages.
That is just the sort of half-baked, illiterate drivel... that proves Commoners really are common.
That's it. We're out of here.
Come on, Snails.
We'll go into hiding.
She can find the Rod herself.
Fine.
I thought you were leaving.
Mind if we eat first?
No. Be my guest.
Those red marks there look like the locks... my father used to put on plans in his carriages.
Please.
This is an ancient scroll, not a blueprint for a bucket.
You don't seem to know what you're doing... so you might as well let me have a look.
Give that back!
Let's see. He used to put his fingers like this... and then he'd say something like...
Alanor, salah--
What was that word?
Bidet.
Bidet? Bidara! Bidara.
Alanor, salah, bidara!
Can't blame me for trying.
At least l--
See that there?
I knew that boy had talent!
Alanor, salah, bidara!
Do not let them escape... or you will suffer a fate far worse... than that which hath been inflicted upon me.
So there I am, hogtied, lying on my back.
This Orc starts poking me with the spear.
Kind of a no-win situation.
So, I say to myself,
"What do I got to lose?"
So, I take that spear and bite it.
And I start chewing.
Idol of idols.
With an Elf.
You got to be kidding.
The problem with Elves is they got no meat on their bones.
You got to get yourself a nice 250-pound Dwarf.
With hair on her chin you can hang on to.
Excuse me, little man.
You looking for somebody in particular?
Or are you just looking for... somebody?
Actually...
I'm looking for someone just like you.
What a coincidence...
'cause I was looking for someone just like you.
We got to celebrate.
Bartender, give me a bottle of your best wine.
Make that your cheapest.
Wait.
I need the girl.
Bar fight!
Get them !
This ain't the time for romance!
-What are you doing?
-Come on! Come on!
Wait, I got to go back.
I think I'm in love!
With an Elf?
They think Humans are a joke!
All right, I lied.
I just want to hit it!
Let's get Ridley out of here.
Bidet, bidet, bidet.
That Wraith must have been defective.
-He seemed reliable to me.
-He did not.
It's Damodar, man.
He's onto us.
With what we've walked into, everyone's going to be onto us.
What do you mean, everybody's onto us?
Go ahead.
Tell him what you got us into.
Me? But you--
Go ahead.
Tell me what you got us into.
According to the Wraith inside the scroll... the Rod we're looking for caused the Great War.
Is that all?
Have you lost your damn mind?
What does this Rod do?
It's supposed to have the power to control Red Dragons.
I don't know about you... but this sound like a pretty bad idea to me.
It gets better.
This map leads to a Dragon temple.
To get in, we have to get the Eye of the Dragon... from the Guildmaster of the Thieves Guild... in Antius City.
Xilus?
No. Get--
No way!
I told her she's crazy... but she keeps going on about
Profion and the Empress.
Profion?
They can take care of themselves.
I suggest we lay low...
Iet the whole thing blow over, come back, rob everybody.
That's all. Let's go.
Snails, there's one more small problem.
Problem?
What's the problem, Ridley?
I kind of committed us to find it.
Ridley, how could you do something like that?
You--
I can't believe this.
I can't believe--
"This is our big chance, huh?
"Let's rob the magic school.
This is our big chance!"
That's what you said to me, right?
This is... dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.
Dumb!
I got a new name for dumb.
"Ridley."
This is the Ridley-est thing
I ever heard of.
I'll understand if you don't want to go.
What do you mean I can't go?
Look, all I'm saying is that... don't you think this is just a little bit out of our league?
Just a little bit?
Snails, listen to me, OK?
This Eye of the Dragon we're supposed to get?
It's a ruby the size of your fist.
I don't--
A ruby the size of a fist?
Yeah. We'll use her to help us get it, and we'll take off.
We'll make a fortune.
Trust me.
I hate when you say that!
Ridley, I know I'll regret this.
I knew you'd come through for me!
Don't touch me.
OK, just a little bit.
We're in.
How about you?
I don't see what choice I have.
Just tell me one thing--
If I help, who'll pay me?
We'll worry about that later.
That's a terrible way to do business.
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it!
Get out of here!
Ridley, check it out.
Let's go.
Listen, we're looking for esteemed Guildmaster Xilus.
We thought you'd know him.
The only thing I know is... you ought to take your business out of town... before you get the words
"outsiders not appreciated"... branded right where your nose used to be.
Get it?
Thanks for your time!
If I ain't drinking, you sure ain't shopping!
Come on!
There you are!
Where have you been?
Don't look at us, all right?
We're just shopping.
Is that three-eyed hyphen bastard watching us?
If we follow him... he'll probably lead us into the Guild.
There he goes.
Let's go.
Come on.
Elwood, we'll go in.
You keep a lookout.
Nice.
Isn't that Tollum?
The guy that kidnapped the Duke of--
Let's keep 'em walking.
Let's go find Xilus.
That won't be necessary.
Like I said,
"Outsiders not appreciated."
You was talking to us?
We was confused
'cause your third eye... was looking at somebody completely different.
Take 'em away!
Don't touch me!
Get off me! Get off of me!
Where do you think they took Snails?
Don't worry. He'll be fine.
Just let me do the talking.
So this is it?
Everything a Thief strives for?
You must be Xilus.
Ridley Freeborn. Practitioner of the larcenous crafts.
Member in good standing of the Sumdall Guild.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
A fellow Thief.
The pleasure's all mine.
See?
Sumdall, eh?
How is old Sumdall?
That's a pretty tough town, isn't it?
All those Mages.
We get by.
Yes, well, I think you must be very accomplished... to have such a precious morsel traveling with you.
What might I do for you?
The unity of our kingdom--
We understand you have something called the Eye of the Dragon.
We desperately need it.
Yes, well, I'm always happy to help a fellow Thief.
Have you ever heard of the Antius Guild Maze?
Of course.
Every Thief has heard of it.
Wonderful.
Then you'll know that the Eye of the Dragon... is the prize at the center of my Guild Maze, won't you?
You finish the maze, you win the prize.
Has anyone ever finished it before?
They all died trying.
But look on the bright side.
At least the prize is still there.
Good health.
And jolly good luck.
This is a good one, Ridley.
That's no fair!
-I give him forty seconds.
-Nah, a minute.
I can't believe they're betting on whether or not he lives.
Au contraire, precious morsel.
They're betting on how long before he dies.
Be careful, Ridley!
Oh, my.
This is not right!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Very clever.
But is clever enough?
Come on, the game ain't over yet.
Very light on his feet, isn't he?
What kind of vault is that?
I think she needs to visit her friend.
Nice.
Well, yes, yes, yes.
Very clever. Well done, you.
-You were absolutely amazing.
-Thank you.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Thank you.
I waited fifteen years for someone to pick that lock.
I knew the man that could survive that maze... would be able to get into that vault.
And now, here he is.
The man. You.
Why don't you give me what's rightfully mine?
What about honor amongst Thieves?
What a romantic notion.
Do you honestly believe
I could've amassed my wealth... if I worried about honor?
So, pretty boy... if you don't want Hugo here... to rearrange your features for you...
I suggest you just give it up.
Who the hell is he?
Who the hell are you?
I don't know who you are... but be prepared for a lesson in pain.
You must be joking.
I never joke when Mages trespass in my Guild!
This is the map you're after.
Clear a path, and I'll put it out.
Do it.
Let go of me!
You OK?
We got to save Marina.
Wait. What about the Dwarf?
You get the Dwarf,
I'll get the girl.
Wait. How come I always got to get the Dwarf?
Damn!
Ridley, we already have the Dragon's Eye.
Let's take it to Sumdall and sell it.
Snails, we're not leaving without Marina.
Listen to you, Ridley!
You're going to risk your life for a Mage?
Listen, Snails--
What?
I wouldn't do that... if I were you.
Hey, it's you.
You know her?
We're acquainted.
Is that the Elf you were drooling over?
I wouldn't put it that way.
But, yeah, that's her.
Pretty, huh?
They all look alike to me.
Silence!
Where is the girl?
None of your business.
Wrong, Human.
It is my business to arrest you and Marina of Pretensa... and to take you and the scroll you stole... back to the Empress of lzmer.
So you're the law, are you?
I should have known.
One of your fellow lawmen-- in fact, the Chief of the Crimson Brigade-- beat you to the punch.
He just took off with Marina!
-Damodar.
-That's him.
Only he's not working for the law anymore.
He's working for Profion.
He's the one you want, not us.
Your Majesty.
Yes, Norda.
Have you found me the scroll?
No, Your Highness.
I have unfortunate tidings to report.
It seems Profion also seeks the Rod.
But how could he know?
I do not know, milady.
Damodar has captured
Marina of Pretensa... and the scroll... but I have her companions in my custody.
What is your command?
Seek Damodar out.
We need that Rod.
The Council demands my response imminently.
Norda, please hurry.
Our time is running out.
As you wish.
Gather the horses.
We will track Damodar.
They will travel with us.
Should they try to escape... kill them.
Tell me...
Why were you at the Thieves Guild?
It isn't exactly a sightseeing spot, is it?
We needed money for supplies.
You'll have to do better than that.
I'm curious.
You're a Mage... and yet you're disgracing your family... by consorting with Thieves.
You're a disgrace to lzmer, conspiring against the Empress.
I have no dispute with her.
You know me.
I have served her family loyally for many a year.
It is Profion's desire to dethrone her... not mine.
Then why do you help him?
Look at me.
Look at me!
If I do not obtain the Rod...
I will die.
Please... help me.
I'm sorry, but l...
I cannot help you.
Foolish girl.
I can suck... the information I want... right out of you.
Your friends have procured... the Eye of the Dragon... from the Thieves Maze.
A key... of some sort.
Can't I just walk?
Don't you people know Dwarves are terrified of horses?
Get over it.
A lot of Dwarves are afraid to show their true feelings.
I'm not, OK?
They followed the valley.
I know these lands.
There's a shortcut up ahead.
Through the forest and over those hills.
It means leaving the trail... but if Damodar sets up camp and we ride all night... we stand a good chance of cutting him off.
All right, let's go.
I love the way you track.
You wouldn't happen to be single, are you?
What?
There's no harm in asking is there?
It just so happens that I'm single.
Can you believe it?
How old are you?
Twenty-three. I know
I'm a little young for you.
What if I get my hands on an aging potion?
I'll sacrifice a couple of years for you.
I'm 234.
Oh, damn.
I didn't mean that much of a change.
Hurry.
Ridley, look--Beholders.
Relax, Snails.
We'll just sneak around 'em.
Now what?
A little distraction.
All right, Snails, stay close.
All clear.
OK. I'll get Marina.
You get the map.
OK. Hey, wait, Ridley.
How you get the girl and I get a map?
We got to work out some new plans.
Go.
Be careful.
All right.
You, too.
Let's go in.
We were not meant to enter this place.
This task they must complete alone.
I'm Damodar.
A little black magic.
All right, Damodar.
Nice.
Piece of cake.
I knew this was too easy.
Need a hand?
It's OK.
Let's get you out of here.
Come on.
Just like you Thieves.
Always taking things that don't belong to you.
All right. Now...
I'm mad.
You want to play, do you?
Yeah. Let's play.
OK, you win. Game over.
There they are!
So much for getting out of here without a fight.
Thanks.
Anytime.
Hit him ! Hit him !
Let's go!
Come on.
You cannot be serious.
I've never been so serious.
Oh, please.
If you'll give me the Dragon's Eye...
I might decide... to let you die quickly.
Go to hell!
Not your usual punctual self.
Where's my Dragon's Eye?
I have it.
Really?
Show it to me.
Let him go first, and it's yours.
Snails, don't!
Make it easy on yourself.
Give me what is mine.
Never!
You're as stubborn as your friend.
Very well.
You've made your choice.
Come on, Ridley!
Transporting!
Come on, Ridley!
Come on!
The Council has voted.
You must oblige us.
You understand the consequences of your decision--
Do not patronize me, Azmath... for I understand all too well.
Yes, I violate the law in defying the Council... but if I were to give you this Scepter... my crime would be graver yet... for I would be defying my conscience... and our people.
Have you all forgotten?
This Council was created to protect the people of lzmer... but ask yourselves...
Is this what you are doing?
I say not.
Your concern is only for yourselves... not the people.
And Your Majesty is forcing the Empire... to the verge of civil war... in the best interests of the people?
The man who convinced you to take the Scepter from me... so that he would leave the state defenseless.
Be careful, my friends... for once he's done with me, this Council may be next.
War benefits no one, Profion... and I oppose it.
But if it is necessary to obtain the freedom of our people... then no cost could be too great to achieve that goal.
Do you hear her words?
She violates our highest law!
And then seeks to force us into submission... with a threat of war.
Each citizen of lzmer, whether a Commoner or a Mage... deserves an equal right for prosperity... and as Empress... this is how I decree lzmer shall be run... from this day forward.
Such pretty words.
My friends, I warned you... that this headstrong child... will defy you and destroy you.
Her youth denies her the wisdom... to understand why some things cannot change... but idealism is for children... and a child is not fit to govern an Empire.
I ask you one last time!
Will you submit to the ruling of this Council... and relinquish your Scepter?
I was praying... that you would find the wisdom... to see that the path
I propose for lzmer... is the right one.
I do not wish to fight you... but I will not leave the Empire... at the mercy of an unscrupulous charlatan!
So decide as you must, but know one thing--
I am not afraid.
A wonderful performance.
My friends, ask yourselves... are we prepared to see our Empire... destroyed by a child?
Then is now not the time we should act?
Then down with the tyrants... and let the war begin!
What is he doing?
Isn't he going to use any spells?
Wait.
How did you do that?
The Elven people do not require spells to work with magic.
You use magic.
We are part of it.
Part of magic?
As are all living creatures, including Dragons.
Sadly, Humans see only their destructive powers.
I had a dream. I saw--
You saw a Dragon being born.
It was amazing.
Life was exploding all around.
So it should.
You see, when Dragons are born, they bring new magic with them.
Magic is the life force of our world.
It keeps nature and everything around us... in balance.
And if many Dragons should die?
Life would wither as it must... and the balance would be destroyed.
The Rod.
You and your countrymen... are very close to irreparably destroying... the fabric of magic with this Rod you seek.
The Rod is man-made... unnatural.
It must not be disturbed.
You must rest.
I'm sorry about Snails.
I'm sure you are.
He died for a good cause.
A good cause?
What cause is that?
The Empress against Profion?
Politics.
I'm through with all that.
I'm not going to die over some power struggle... between a couple of greedy Mages.
No, you're wrong.
No, you're wrong! Mage!
You never had to live on the other side.
You know what?
Snails was right.
There is nothing we can do to change it... and if I had listened to him, he would still be alive.
Just because some Mages are evil does not mean they all are.
I'm not!
Let me let you in on a little secret.
The Empress that Snails died for stands to lose everything... because she is fighting to change things.
As if she has anything to worry about.
You are so naive.
She risks everything... because she does not believe the system is fair.
Profion seeks to dethrone her because she believes... that Mages and Commoners should be treated as equals.
She is fighting to change what you hate so much!
That, Ridley, is what Snails died for.
When Vildan told me what was happening with the Empress...
I wanted to do all I could to help her.
But even then,
I did not understand... why she would want Commoners to be equal with us.
But now... after being with you for only a few days... and seeing how you always manage to find your way...
I understand why the Empress is right.
Please, Ridley.
Help me show them we are not like they are.
You know, for a Mage... you're pretty smart.
It will protect you.
Thank you.
All right. This is it.
This is the entrance to the dungeon.
What happened?
What is it?
It's a wall force of some kind.
I've never seen this kind of magic.
Only you were meant to pass.
I guess I go alone, then.
Be careful.
Don't worry. I'll be fine.
Great.
Now what?
Sorry, Snails.
Finally, a Mage who got what he deserved.
Why do you disturb the Rod of Savrille?
To save the Empire of lzmer.
Who...
What are you?
I am Savrille, creator of the Rod... cursed with the crime of trying to control the Red Dragons... and sentenced to this purgatory... until someone worthy of its power takes it.
You are such a man?
I don't know if anybody's such a man.
But I'm going to find out.
Be warned. Anyone who wields the power of the Rod... shall suffer a horrible fate... for the evil it creates cannot be undone... unless its spell is broken.
How do I break the spell?
That, you must discover.
The Empress has called her Dragons upon us.
Don't just stand there admiring them !
Destroy them before they reach us.
Hurry! Hurry!
Prepare to fire!
Fire!
Come on.
Get up! Prepare to fire again!
Move that crossbow.
Aim for their wings, you fools!
Fire, you fools! Fire!
What have I done?
Come to me.
I found the Rod!
Thanks for saving me the trouble.
Feels good, doesn't it?
Remember... your stupidity and persistence got your Thief friend killed.
Don't let it be responsible... for finishing off the rest of your social circle.
Oh, look.
I've cut her. What a shame.
Don't hurt her.
Then give me the Rod!
And you'll release them?
Don't do it, Ridley.
You have my word.
Finally.
You said you'd let them go!
I lied.
Kill them... slowly.
Give that to me.
You said you'd set me free.
Now what about my head?
Here they come!
Come, Damodar.
To the roof of Sumdall.
Fire!
My destiny.
Come to me.
Look. I've cut you.
What a shame.
You can run, Your Ladyship... but you'll never run far enough!
Let their blood rain from the sky!
You'll pay for that, boy.
You really think that you can steal my destiny?
I'll invent a new destiny especially for you... full of pain.
A new kind of pain and new senses to feel it with.
Not if I kill you first.
This will be a real pleasure.
Not so talented, eh, Mr. Ridley?
I've enjoyed our little chat, but now it's your time to die.
My little tracker.
I could--
Hey, Mage!
Why don't you pick on somebody your own size?
Back for more?
You really think you can use that, you little burglar?
Well, that's impossible.
Bring them down on him, Ridley!
Destroy him !
I won't become you.
What have you done?
Your Majesty.
It's over, Profion.
The battle maybe, Your Majesty.
Maybe... but not the war.
Thank you.
People of lzmer... at long last, I do declare that you are now all equal.
Let the celebration begin.
You hear that, buddy?
That's for you.
Nothing's going to be the same without you.
But I guess I'll have to get used to that.
I just hope wherever you are... you know that you did make a difference.
You helped things change.
You finally got it.
Your big score.
I guess I'd better get going... or I'm going to miss my own knighting ceremony.
Ridley the Savior.
Can you believe it?
I'm going to miss you, pal.
Do not question your gift.
Your friend awaits you.
I want you so bad!
Oh, man!
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
Pretty awesome, huh?
Oh, my God!
- Wait! What's the matter?
- Oh, my God!
Is it my split ends?
I can corn-row it!
Corn-row it! Corn-row it!
Page.
Listen, these bitches specifically asked us to get them alcohol.
I mean, it's a no-brainer.
We bring booze to the party and we're getting laid by the hottest chicks in school.
They're D.T.F.- down to fuck!
Mmm! Andy, nice touch with that sour cream, man.
I didn't use sour cream.
Trust me, you will have your D.I.H.E.- dick in her ear-
T.I.H.A.- toe in her ass- and my B.O.Y.C.- balls on your chin.
That just sounds horrible, Jonah.
What? Are you saying you would just rather have my balls on your chin?
- What are you doing, man?
- Nothing. Hair in your eye.
Look, it doesn't matter.
What's important here is that we find someone who can get us alcohol...
Hey.
Chicka-chicka-yeah!
Look what I picked up last night! Huh?
- "McAnalovin"?
- Yeah.
- One frickin' name? For realsies?
- What the hell is that?
- It's a great ID
- It's fuckin' awesome, man!
- Could you get me one?
- Yeah, I can hook you up.
- Nice.
- 'Cause I am McAnalovin.
Yeshiva class of 2010!
Chicka-chicka-yeah!
Fake ID! Fake ID!
Keep it Down, bitches!
Look, normally I wouldn't give a shit... but my cousin said that there's some serious side effects with this herb.
I mean serious.
What's wrong with you?
You're such a pussy.
It'll be the best shit you've ever smoked.
They're just telling you it's got side effects so they can keep it all for themselves.
All right, then you smoke some.
Not interested.
I'm on a diet.
I'll tell you what.
You smoke this shit for one week straight, and I'll pay your rent for six months.
- Serious?
- Uh, yeah.
- You're on, bee-yatch!
- You know how I know you're gay?
- How?
- Uh, you just called me "bee-yatch."
- You know how I know you're gay?
- How?
- You have a dildo stuck in your ass.
- What?
Yeah. Check it put.
Oh, there you are, Fernando.
Hey, this smells like curry.
Check one. Check two.
Ohh! Oh, my God, this microphone smells like Jimmy's balls!
- Hey, Manuel.
- No, that's mean.
Excuse me. I so badly want to do stand-up comedy.
I'd do anything for somebody to teach me how.
You know, I'm actually probably not the person to ask...
'cause I'm not very seasoned.
But there are several comics here that you could ask.
Oh, no, you don't.
There are a number of people here who could actually help you.
Excuse me for a minute, young lady.
Then she got pregnant. Um-
- Biscuit, what the hell's the matter with you?
- What?
She wants your ass, and you're standing there with your dick in your hand!
Give me a break. She doesn't want me.
That's just stupid.
Come on, Biscuit.
Trust me!
Take it from a man who's been around.
I may have the Benjamin Button disease... but I've had experience with women since childbirth.
Three days ago- bam!
Okay, thank you very much for sharing, but believe me, she doesn't want me.
Okay?
You are a lost cause, my brother.
Well, Blaqguy,
I'm not like you. Okay?
I'm not some wizard at reading women.
I don't know how to do this.
At least you're normal.
I'm a 25-year-old in an 85-year-old body.
Do you know what that shit's like? Huh?
This time last year I was in love... with the best fart my gay uncle laid.
Oh, dude, last night
I was fuckin' this chick.
We were in the middle of fucking, and I-
And we're getting all sweaty... and then I realize it's not sweat- it's pee.
This bitch peed all over me!
I know that laugh.
That's a virgin's laugh.
What? What are you talking about?
It all makes sense now!
- Andy's a virgin!
- You're a fucking virgin?
No, I'm not!
My man is not a virgin!
It's impossible!
Oh, yeah? Well, then why is he wearing this shirt?
That's a joke!
It's just a joke, a stupid shirt.
That's all!
I'm not a-
They're just shirts!
I'm not a virgin!
Then what is this shit, my friend?
Oh, let's beat his fuckin' virgin ass!
We should have sex with your ass!
Guys, come on, calm down.
Give him a break, all right? It's Andy.
You gotta get a set of nuts, bro.
You gotta get out there and experience life.
Be aggressive.
Do what you want with them.
If they say, "No, stop, not in there, you're hurting me"... you do it anyway.
No means yes.
How does anyone stay a fucking virgin all these years?
I mean, there are shaved middle-schoolers having sex on the Internet right now.
What the fuck?
Uh, not- not that I know that from... experience.
I mean, that's what I heard... from people that... I met... on the Internet.
Uh-
I'm the Green Hornet.
Yeah.
I just don't get it, Biscuit.
How in the hell could you go 40 years and not have sex?
I don't know.
I just kinda stopped trying.
That's okay, man. That's what
Simonizing your disco stick is for.
- What?
- You know. Buttering your peppercorn.
Skinnin' your smoke wagon.
Fillin' the sock with something other than your foot.
Oh. Okay.
You mean masturbation.
I don't know what all that shit means, man.
I'm talkin' 'bout whackin' off.
- Yeah, well, I've never done that.
- You what?
You've never busted a nut?
So you got 40 years of creamer all built up in there?
- Yeah.
- Damn!
I know. And the worst part is,
I just feel so left out.
I feel like everybody's having sex but me.
Ah, no pressure, Biscuit.
Not everybody's sexin' it up.
Oh, yeah?
What do you call that?
I say sex is not sex without penetration.
Oh, my God.
What is that?
My hip!
Damn!
That's some nasty shit, Ma!
Sweet mother of Mary.
Me likey.
Me likey a lot!
Walk slower.
Damn! God!
She was so pretty.
Oh.
See, that's just my luck, Blaqguy.
Ho-ho-ho-ho! look, look, look, man!
She's okay!
That's all you, dog!
No! Damn it! Those gangs!
Maybe not.
Wait, wait, wait!
She's so resilient.
She's so full of... verve and vigor.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, no!
- Man!
- Those guys are such assholes!
Damn, Biscuit, You do have some bad sex karma.
We gon' have to change your whole vibe, startin' with that fur carpet.
All right, just ask yourself, what's your "why factor"?
- My "why factor"?
- Yeah, you valet attendant-looking motherfucker!
Why are you buying alcohol illegally?
Because you get some pussy in exchange for it.
- Is this really what this is all about?
- Of course!
- That is, unless-
- What are you doing, man?
Nothing. Just a little mustard on your face.
Look, guys, we get alcohol, we'll be sac-deep by midnight.
So, McAnalovin, get your fuckin' ass in there and get us our "why factor."
- Give me that fuckin' vest, you faggot!
- The vest?
Yeah, take it off, dickhead.
Looks like you're parking cars at Morton's.
Makes me look older, you fucking gay Garth Brooks!
I'm gonna fucking kill you! Give me that fucking vest and get the fuck in there!
Fuckin' hate him.
- It'll be fine.
- Better fucking work.
- It'll work. It's fine.
- Fucking asshole.
So many things-
Oh, my God.
Mmm. Okay.
Can you hear me now?
Good!
Okay, don't draw attention to yourself.
Oh!
Okay-
Oh, shit!
Under age! Go!
Go home to your mother! Go!
Next, next. ID, ID!
Come on!
Ah! Out of state.
No good here. Next!
Come on, come on, come on!
ID
That's very flattering, young man... but I was born in the year 1930.
Yes, I can see that you are old by your leathery hands...
- and your breasts that sag to your "WUPA."
- What's a "WUPA"?
Wrinkled Upper-Pussy Area.
No ID, no alcohol.
Next!
These crazy motherfuckers.
I'm going on break.
ID.
Let's go.
This isn't vacation.
McAnalovin.
What kind of bitch-ass name is this?
- H-How'd you read it?
- Show me your nipples!
- What?
- Nipples.
Bitch tits. Little pinks.
Lemme see 'em.
- My nipples?
- Yes. Please. Do I s-s-stutter?
Huh? Eh?
- All right. Supple and taut.
- Ow!
I'd say 15, maybe 16 at the most.
What?
No way! That's crazy!
Don't fuck with me.
Damn, Biscuit!
What are you wearing, a fur coat, dog?
Oh, no. My-
My father's from the Balkans.
They're hairy.
Don't waste your high on that weak shit, bro.
Your cousin's shit is the bomb.
Really?
You don't feel any side effects?
Not a one, my friend.
I told you that was pure bullshit.
You realize you have tits, right?
Yee! New experience.
- Hyah!
- Chinese bitch!
Indian girl. Jew. Black.
Okay, but you're one hairy motherfucker!
Even your hair is growing hair.
Yeah, I need to use the extra-sticky flak jacket. Okay?
You ready?
This seems like a lot of glue.
Is this gonna hurt?
She's a professional.
It's not gonna hurt, right?
Yes, of course it's going to hurt, you stupid idiot.
- Oh, God.
- You be a man, okay? Don't be a pussy.
Okay? You ready?
A-one, a-two!
- Get set!
- No, no, please!
It doesn't... hurt that much.
Dude, if those are your nipples,
I'm gonna pass out.
Of course they his nipple! What you think?
Look. They all on the wall.
I got a collection over there. You see?
Shit.
Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy!
- How does it make me a pussy if I'm not gay?
- Domo arigato, bitches!
I really appreciate you guys giving me a lift and everything... but I think I can walk from here.
Man, it's the least we could do, considering what Helen Keller did to your ass back there.
Yeah, that was totally uncalled for, I know.
"McAnalovin"?
What the fuck type of name is that?
Irish... gay... porn?
How y'all expect to get anywhere looking like that? We need to take you shopping.
Get you some thangs, some clothes, some style.
- Alcohol, maybe?
- Absolutely. And how do you get that?
- My ID?
- No, motherfucker. Money!
- All right? Now, how you get money?
- Uh, work?
- That's crazy talk, son.
- That shit is crazy, dog.
That's what's wrong with the young people, Yo Ass.
- They all wanna do homework and be responsible.
- Hey!
- Oh, my-
- They all wanna grow up-
Whatever happened to droppin' out of high school... get a bitch pregnant, start a music career?
Preach, nigga, preach!
Hey.
Well, McAnalovin... this is America and we 'bout to bring things back to the good old days.
Beat and Yo Ass about to get you some money the old-fashioned way, homeboy.
- What?
- We gon' steal it.
Hold on, white boy.
Ah, yeah!
Is that a life meter?
Yep, and it's green.
When it turns red, your ass is dead.
Put this shit on.
We fixin' to go G.T.A. up in this bitch.
- Whoo!
- Oh, shit!
- Oh.
- Let's go shoppin'.
Fascists!
Hey, what-
What? Huh?
Asshole!
Hey, my man!
Oranges!
Naranjas.
Dos d鰈ares.
- What'd you just do?
- Oh, no, he didn't!
What? I got the cash money, dude!
- Did you just rob a Mexican?
Are you kidding me?
- What?
Do you know what happens when you rob a Mexican in this game?
Dog, when you rob a white guy, you get the money.
When you rob a black guy, he'll chase after your ass the whole dang game.
But if you rob a Mexican, dog, you get the entire Latin community after your dumb ass!
Every ese, muchacho, nino,
Menudo, Santana and Rob Thomas... the motherfuckers from the catering truck, they gon' all try to kill us!
Bring your ass over here!
Go, go, go, go, go!
We gon' find your ass a woman today.
Ow! Careful. I'm sore.
How do they look?
You look like Hannibal Nipples.
- Right this way.
- Got 'im.
You should like swimming and apple picking and-
I like a really large man, but he's gotta shoot blanks. You know what I'm sayin'?
- Bla-
- Mommy, I'm thirsty!
Hey! Mommy's trying to get some penis right now. Suck it up.
I love my kids.
We'll keep it simple.
He'll toss your salad while I give you the reach-around.
Okay?
No, I'm-
So, yeah, I like sitting in saunas... being in bathhouses, playing racquetball.
I like, uh... camping, pitching tents-
- She's not the one.
- What?
She's a knockout.
What are you talking about?
Tall, big head, masculine jaw.
- Something's not right.
- What's not right?
- Motherfucker, look at her hands.
- What's wrong with her hands?
I'm pretty picky.
You know?
- That ruins everything.
- Mmm.
You ain't tasted Mexican until you taste this shit, white boy.
Shit's the bomb, dog.
- Ahh. There we go.
- Yeah!
- Why is there an "F" in the window?
-"F"?
- Man, that's a "B."
- Stupid motherfucker.
You think I would take you somewhere if it was an "F"?
We got three ass-piss burritos, one crap splatter enchilada-
- That's mine. That's mine.
- We got it all!
Gracias, hombre!
Oh, shit.
- I told you this was gonna happen! Look!
- Oh, shit!
- Here come the gangbangers!
- There they are! Hey!
Has anybody been to the zoo lately?
I went to the zoo and, uh, I w-w- walked up to the penguin cage... and, um, I was, like, I wonder if the other animals are looking at them going...
"God, I'm glad I'm me."
Because they, uh, you know-
It's like, I wonder what I did in my past life to be reborn a legless, flightless bird... in the middle of the North Pole-
South Pole.
Sorry. Um-
Close!
- Uh-
- Nobody cares, buddy.
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
I will attempt to make comedy applesauce.
I'm sorry if I hit you.
Thank you very much.
You've been a great audience.
You suck!
Hey, give it up for Andy, huh?
He was great!
- Hey there.
- Hi.
Oh! Hi! You're from the other night, crossing the street!
- Yeah, that would be me.
- How are you? How's your neck?
- It's fine.
- Yeah? Bludgeoned head?
- Better.
- Stab wounds?
- Healing.
- And that mangled leg?
Actually, it's better than before.
I can do this now.
Oh! Oh, I'm- I'm sorry.
I know it's not a good color match.
They only had white or black.
I chose white.
Does that make me racist?
- No, absolutely-
- Thanks!
- You were really funny up there.
- Oh, please.
- You were hilarious.
I was laughing on the inside.
- Thank you very much.
Okay, well, I just-
Good job!
- Do you wanna go out sometime?
- I'd love to. Tonight?
Tonight? Yeah.
- Sure. Absolutely.
- Great. Maybe we'll have some sex after.
Excuse me?
What?
I mean- What- What-
You said- What did you-
- I didn't say anything.
- Okay.
So send me your e-mail address. I can tell you where I live and you can pick me up.
Maybe you should text me, then I'll call you and you can text me your address.
Is there an app for that? If not, why don't I just Twitter you my Facebook page... and then you can wall-to-wall me your number,
I'll call and leave my address on your voice mail.
It might be better if I IM you my MySpace page, then you can leave me your address there...
I'll blog my cell phone on it, you can call me when I give you my T-Mobile rollover minutes... put you on my fave five- that way you can give it to me live over the phone.
- You'd put me in your fave five?
- Oh, yeah. Sure.
Oh, excuse me one second.
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.
Hello?
Oh, hi.
Yes. Yes, I am. Of course.
That's great news. Yeah, I will.
Thank you!
Okay, bye.
I applied for this job in Hawaii six months ago, and I just found out I got it!
- Oh, my God! That's great!
- I'm so excited!
- But I have to leave tonight.
- Tonight?
- Yeah.
- Oh. Okay.
- I'm sorry about dinner and sex.
- Listen, work is work.
Thank you for understanding.
Yeah, sure.
No problem.
- Oh! Okay.
- Congratulations. That's great.
- Okay, bye! Give me a hug.
- Okay.
Um, oh, my God.
You forgot your, um, leg.
How do you not have an address?
This is your freakin' contact.
Stop riding me. That dipshit fucked me up with the whole getting arrested thing.
We'll find it. No worries.
Wait!
What the hell is that?
Sounds like " La Cucaracha."
- Holy fucking shit!
- Let's get the fuck outta here!
Oh, shit!
Rob Thomas?
- Get in the car.
- What?
Get in the car!
Okay.
This shit happens all the time, man!
Girls just be doin' that shit, and it's fucked up!
Oh, yeah, dude.
That shit doesn't even matter. All right?
'Cause tonight you're gonna fuckin' lay down the hammer, fucker.
I don't know what that means and it's not helpful.
I just wanna meet somebody for once who's down to earth and a normal person.
What they have is special.
Can I call you Noah?
What is wrong with you?
You're turning into a real, certified bitch!
Now you cryin' over the notebook?
Got these things right here.
- Ow.
- These... tits.
Damn, those feel kinda- those feel kinda good.
Okay, you know what?
You guys are disgusting.
I'm going to get a Shirley Temple.
- Hi!
- You're cute.
- What's your name?
- I'm Andy. Hi.
Well, Andy, every Thursday night my sister and I pick someone from the bar to have sex with.
And tonight we choose you!
Congratulations!
- You like a m閚age a trois, Andy?
- Five or six times a night?
How about double Dutch expressways?
You enjoy those?
- Jelly doughnut?
- Ukrainian popcorn?
Mouth fucking?
Would you excuse me a second, or a moment, if you don't mind?
Think about it!
Um, excuse me.
Excuse me?
Excuse me.
Why can't I be the center of attention?
He once had sex with a 345-pound woman... just to help her get some exercise.
His craps smell like a 40-day aged bone-in rib eye.
He's so secure with his masculinity... that he doesn't mind urinal peekers.
He is the most interesting man in the world.
I don't always fuck fat bitches... but when I do I prefer to be plastered on-
Stay thirsty, my friends.
Can I help You?
Hey.
- Can I help you?
- Huh?
- To drink. What do you want to drink?
- Sorry.
May I have a Shirley Temple, please?
That's my favorite drink.
Mine too.
This is fate.
I think so.
I'm Sarah.
Oh! Sorry.
I'm Andy.
Sorry.
- That was-
- Cute?
Yeah. Loud.
So, MTZ, the paparazzi show?
Yeah, I've been working there for two years and just got my promotion today.
- That's so cool. Congratulations.
- Oh, thank you!
- I'm so excited!
- That's really neat.
Hey-hey-hey!
Compliments of the boys!
You know, actually,
I don't drink.
I sipped some wine once, but that was it.
- Oh, that's fine.
- No.
Come on, girl.
One shot ain't gonna hurt you.
I will if you do.
- Okay!
- Okay. Cheers.
Oh! That was horrible.
Oh! My bad, girl. That was my genetic sample. Here, try this one.
I'm not sure if I liked that one.
Can I try another one?
Um, you kn- you know what?
That's a lot of booze... to have... quickly.
Whoo!
Sarah! Sarah! Sarah! Sarah!
Yeah!
Um, do you think that you should be driving?
Oh, I can't help it.
- My vagina has a mind of its own.
- Oh.
Oh, my god.
Okay, yep. That's weird.
I like you, Andy.
- I like you too.
- I like you a lot.
Okay, we should maybe-
Let's-
Okay, no, that's, um-
We have to get you some-
Oh, that could have done the trick.
- I'm gonna go down on you now. Okay?
- What? I don't think that's-
Oh, God, no! Please!
Oh, my God, that's so warm.
Oh, my God,
I am, like, so sorry-
No! No! No, please!
Andy! Andy!
Aah! Aah!
I'm right here!
- I'm here!
- Oh, God. Thank goodness.
I thought that I lost you.
Can you stop throwing up, please?
I'm not a very strong swimmer.
I think that I'm done.
Oh, I just peed.
It's so warm.
Oh, my God.
Do you want to come in?
- Oh, I'd like that.
- Okay.
Everyone, meet Michael.
We're glad you're here,
Michael.
We need an umpire.
What am I gonna be an umpire for?
- Edward, you didn't tell him?
- I was getting to that.
Let's just say it's something we can only play during thunderstorms.
Okay.
What is it?
We're all lactose intolerant.
Sorry.
- Hey there.
- Holy shit! You scared me.
My apologies.
Are you okay?
I'm sorry. I was being chased by a bunch of Mexicans for no reason.
All I'm trying to do is get some alcohol so I can have sex with the hottest chick in school.
I think I can help you out.
- Really?
- Yeah. You see that house over there?
They're practically giving away free booze!
- Just ask for Lisa.
- Seriously?
If I'm lyin', I'm dyin'.
Here, take this bag.
Never want to go to a party empty-handed.
Cookies?
And condoms?
You can never have enough of either, right?
- Agreed.
- Now go get your alcohol.
Thanks, man.
You're an awesome dude.
Yes, I am.
Yes, I am.
Hello?
Is anyone home?
Come on in. I made you a drink.
Just help yourself.
Cool! Thanks!
- Sweet!
- Hey there.
Oh. Hey, bro.
Dude, aren't you that guy from the show that catches the molesters?
- That would be me.
- That show's so fuckin' awesome!
You're great on that!
Remember that one with the priest and he was trying to weasel his way out of it... but you ended up nailing him with the e-mails from the underage girls.
Once he hightailed it and hit the front yard, he got hit by Shawne Merriman-looking cops.
- I do.
- That was so fuckin' awesome!
What are you doing here?
Is this your house?
Uh, no. I'm actually taping the show.
Really? Here?
That's awesome. Can I watch?
- It looks like you already are.
- What?
What's in the bag?
What? Just the stuff you gave me.
Just... cookies and condoms.
- I didn't give you anything.
- Huh?
What did you think was gonna happen by coming over here tonight?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I'm not a molester.
The only reason I'm here is because you told me there'd be alcohol here.
- You said to ask for Lisa!
- Really?
So you had no intention of having sex with an underage minor.
Wha- No! I-I-I don't know what you're talking about!
So you don't remember saying this?
What? Cor- No! I'm allergic to chocolate chips, for Christ's sakes!
And I don't even like real maple syrup.
I don't know what's going on.
- You could make things easier if you'd just tell us the truth.
- I am telling the truth.
I don't know who this girl is.
I'm just trying to get alcohol so I can have sex with the hottest girl in school.
- Really?
- That's all!
Oh, fuck.
Hold on. Wait.
I wanna talk to you. Sir?
What am I gonna do?
I'm not a molester, you fucking dickhead!
Here we go.
- Mm-hmm.
- Get a little of this debris... off your face.
Why are you being so nice to me? Hmm?
I don't know.
I guess 'cause you're letting me.
Okay. No, no, no.
No, no, no, no.
- You gotta drink some of that.
- Oh, I want you.
Not working.
Ahh!
Ahh. Ohh.
Aaah!
Yeah, that's it.
Let that sit on your tongue for a second.
That's just an antibacterial.
Okay.
I'm gonna slip into something more comfortable.
- Okay? I'll meet you in the bedroom.
- Okay.
Okay.
Ohh! No!
No! Oh, my God.
You wanna lay down some pipe, bitch?
Um, can you just-
Could you give me a minute? I'll be-
Pussy!
Oh, yeah! Oww! Oh! Oh, yeah!
Okay. Oh, Jesus-
- Okay. Hey.
- Hey. Hey.
- Sorry.
- I was just screwing this warm pie right here.
- I heard it feels like the real thing.
- That's cool.
- You know, 16's a real horny age, man.
- Yes-
- So, uh, what- what you doin'?
- Whoa.
Nothing. I-
I'm sorry to interrupt you.
Sarah's in the other room. She's tied to the bed.
She wants to have sex with me.
- Oh, shit!
- I don't know what to do.
- Are you serious?
- Yes.
My man!
This is the big moment!
- It's about to go down!
- You inconsiderate pricks.
Will you please keep it down?
I have such a massive headache.
Sorry, brother.
It's just, you know, so exciting.
Our boy's about to get laid!
- Yeah.
- Brother, you bleedin'?
What-
Oh! There are side effects to this weed!
Damn!
Anyone have an extra tampon?
- Preferably super-wide?
- No.
You need to get your ass back in there before she passes out.
- I know. But what if I do it wrong?
- Do it wrong?
All you doin' is stickin' your dick in her coochie!
There's no wrong way of doing that!
Well, there was this one time
I stuck my thing in Naomi Turner's cat.
It was dark in there, we was huddled up in a twin bed... and the cat just snuck up in between the sheets.
It just felt like-
Hey! You know? Uhh!
- We all's the Lord's creatures, right?
- Yes.
Man, just get your white ass in there and get to fuckin'!
- Get to fuckin'!
- Let's do some fucking.
- Just do some fuckin'!
- It can't be that hard. Everybody does it.
- Okay, I'm gonna do some fucking!
- Fuck-Fuckin'!
I can't.
I can't, I can't.
I can't do it.
I can't do some fuckin'.
I'm- I don't know what's wrong with me.
I'm 40, and I'm-
I'm- I'm never gonna be with a woman.
I'm just not.
Not with that sniveling attitude, you won't!
- Seth, what are you doing?
- Shut up!
I'm going out.
Out to get a milk shake.
A milk shake?
Yes, boy!
You see, I... have a milk shake... and you have a milk shake.
But I have a straw.
You see? Huh?
There it is. Watching!
My straw reaches... across the room... and into your milk shake.
I don't understand what you're doing.
Okay, if you're doing a metaphor,
I don't really-
My milk shake... brings all the boys... to the yard.
Damn right it's better than yours!
Damn right.
I drink your milk shake!
I drink it up!
I don't even know what that means.
That's so weird.
No one wants a virgin boy, Andy.
Hey! Don't- What are you- What are you-
Don't do that! Calm down!
I will not calm down!
- I will not calm down!
- Stop it! Seth, stop it!
Stop it!
Just stop it.
Dude, I'm so sorry, man.
I'm so fuckin' high right now.
Uh, look, look.
You got an ocean of cum under there, all right?
The only person that's gonna be able to get to it is you... and you gotta use your cock to do that.
- Okay, I get it. Please don't, you know-
- Okay?
- You can do it.
- I know. I feel like I can do it-
- No, you can do it!
- I feel like I can do it. I just need to do it.
- Then go do it already!
- My mind is changing, and I can do this, can't I?
- Yes, you can do this!
- I know I can! You know what?
I am sick-
I'm naked!
Wow, he is beautiful.
- Oh, Andy, you're so good!
- Bang that shit up!
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Oh, Andy, You're so good!
- Get off of her!
- Andy! Oh!
- Get off of her.
- Don't stop! Oh!
Oh, yeah!
- Get off!
- More! More!
Where'd you go?
- Son of a bitch!
- Get off!
What are you doing, baby?
Yeah.
Oh, I like that sound.
Oh! I can't breathe!
Ah! You son of a-
Oh, shit.
Oh, that burrito definitely was the meat.
I'm crowning. Oh, my God. Guys, we gotta pull over here. I don't feel too good.
Guys?
You fucking assholes!
Pull this shit over before I shit all over your fucking Corinthian leather!
Oh, shit! Look out!
Oh, shit. Oh, my God.
Uh- This won't take long.
Ah! My God!
What the fuck!
What the f-
Is someone in there?
Hello! Oh, God!
I'm gonna shit my fucking pants.
I'm gonna shit my fucking pants.
Oh, my God. What?
Can you hear me now?
Good.
Oh, my God.
Oh, fuck.
What the fuck?
Where's the fucking toilet?
Oh, my God.
That's disgusting.
Oh, God! I gotta go!
Oh, fuck.
Oh, God. Yeah. Fuck.
Huh?
- Yo, where are you, white boy?
- I'm almost done.
Listen, it's because of you these Mexicans are trying to kill us!
- Huh?
- Come on!
What? What the fuck?
What? What the fuck?
Oh, my god.
Oh, God.
I don't want to do it! I can't do it!
Fuck it! Oh, God.
- Okay! I'm here. Let's go.
- Well, it's about goddamn time, white boy.
What the fuck is that smell?
I don't fuckin' know, dude.
- Let's go, dude!
- Come on, let's go, Beat.
Sarah. Hi!
Hi.
That's it? You don't- You don't notice anything?
Oh, um-
Did you- You got new flip-flops?
- Uh, not the flip-flops.
- Ankles swollen?
- Higher.
- Oh, you carry a little weight in your knees.
Higher.
Oh, my God. Aha! Of course.
You have an outie.
I never even realized you had an outie.
Not even when you were bangin' me last night?
Nope? Okay. So, no, I wasn't-
I didn't bang you last night.
Of course you didn't bang me.
You just had your dick pounding my liver like Floyd Mayweather's punching bag... and now I'm pregnant!
- Oh, shit. You're pregnant?
- Oh, bingo!
- Give the man a fuckin' prize!
- Be careful with that.
I don't, um- That's-
Yeah, you are. You're very pregnant.
- I'm just wondering how that happened in a day.
- I'm half Mexican.
Really?
Andy, do you know how hard it is... to find a guy who can make you feel like you're getting nailed by five guys?
Mmm. No, I don't-
I don't know how hard that would be... but that's not my baby.
Oh, God. Of course.
Typical response from an irresponsible, middle-aged guy... who lives with a bunch of sex-crazed teenagers!
Okay. Come on.
My friends are not sex-crazed teenagers.
Okay, yeah. He's cupping and maybe juggling your breasts a little bit.
Look- Do you mind?
Oh, awkward.
Thank you.
I thought you were wearing a condom.
No, I wasn't wearing a condom because I didn't have sex with you.
If you don't accept this child...
I am gonna go so Flint, Michigan on you... that you are gonna go into a deep economic depression... caused by the demise of the auto industry.
Then some fat guy's gonna do a documentary on you!
I don't understand what that means.
If that doesn't work- then this baby is gonna suffer!
- It's just a baby, so- Don't smoke that.
- May cause severe birth defects.
That's very 1970s.
Don't do that, please.
- Still not your baby?
- No, that's-
- Wanna go for underdeveloped lung capacity?
- I don't want to go for that.
It's illegal also, so please don't-
Okay. I know you're upset, so please don't drink that... because that's how you make a baby homeless and- Oh!
Mommy, Mommy! No, Mommy!
We're done, Andy.
It's over, jerk-off.
Sarah. Sarah! Come on!
I thought we had something!
I mean, I let you throw up in my mouth!
Oh!
Hey, come on, Biscuit!
You're talkin' 'bout a hood rat.
Hey, she's just for practice, you know?
You can't get all emotionally involved all up in that shit.
I don't know, Blaqguy.
I just feel like I need to get out of here... recharge my batteries, go on vacation.
But I don't-
I don't know where to go!
Sarah Marshall was found canoodling with British
Rock sensation Aldous Bright... in Maui, Hawaii.
The couple seemed very much in love as they frolicked about without a care in the world.
What's warm this time of year?
Maui, which is a favorite hot spot for many celebrities... seems to be the place of choice for Aldous... as we've seen him with multiple love interests just in the past few months.
- Maybe Australia?
- Maui-
- No, that's too far.
- is one of the warmest and closest of the tropic getaways.
- How 'bout Mexico?
- Fuck face, are you deaf?
Your whore is here in Maui with another guy.
I have frequent flyer miles, but I- I don't know.
Hey, asshole! no wonder You're a virgin.
You're a fucking retard.
- Turn the TV up.
- Hey, you know what? How 'bout Maui?
Oh, ha, ha!
Hey, Maui. Good call.
You'd be so far removed from anything
Sarah, you'll get over her ass in no time.
Yeah. Yeah.
Don't move, you sick fuck.
Where am I supposed to go, you fucking dickheads?
Hey, Mandy, quit takin' up all the drugs.
Yeah.
What the fuck?
Holy shit!
McAnalovin!
McAnalovin!
McAnalovin!
McAnalovin!
- Let me in!
- Holy shit!
McAnalovin!
Let me in the fuckin' car!
Dude! Jonah!
- Let him in the car, dude.
- Any friend of yours is one of ours.
- Get on in, fat white boy!
- Hi, baby!
Holy fuckin' shit!
You got fuckin' beer!
- You got the fuckin' beer!
- Of course I did. I'm McAnalovin!
- Fuckin' incredible!
- Chicka-chicka-yeah!
And you got fuckin' tits in your car!
Holy fucking shit!
- Yeah!
- Whoo!
- Hi.
- Aloha.
Oh.
Hi. I'm Andy Spitzer.
I'm checking in.
Oh, Mr. Spitzer. Hello!
We have you in one of our econo rooms.
Great. Yeah.
That's $50 a night?
Fifty dollars.
Of course.
Then there's a eight percent state tax, a seven percent city tax... a 12% airport tax, a 32% stimulus tax and, of course, the valet fee.
Oh, valet.
No, I didn't drive, so-
- Everyone pays the valet fee.
It's standard.
- Standard?
The grand total on your room will come to $485 per night.
Food is extra except the mint on your pillow at turndown.
$485? That's... ridiculous.
- It's a very good mint.
- I know. I-I-
I'd like to speak to a manager, please.
Manager to the front desk.
Manager to the front desk.
We have a cheap bitch in line one.
Cheap bitch in line one.
If he's not a cheap bitch, he's a broke-ass motherfucker.
Cheap bitch broke-ass motherfucker in line one!
- Okay. Can you-
- Uh-uh. Piehole, I'm goin' on break.
- Andy?
- Kim.
- What are you doing here?
- I needed a vacation. This is so- Wow.
This is crazy. Well, I work here.
I'm gonna hook you up.
I'm gonna give you the presidential suite.
Oh, okay. Thank you.
That's so nice of you.
- Under one condition.
- Okay.
You take me on that date we were supposed to go on last week.
Deal. I'd love to.
Okay. T-Tonight?
- At 8:00 p.m.?
- 8:00 p.m.'s great.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Okay.
So, thank you so much.
Bye! I have my leg on.
I didn't forget it this time.
If you don't open this door, asshole,
I am gonna get the manager... and have him throw your drunk, lowlife ass out on the street, you prick!
Sarah?
Oh! My baby daddy.
This is weird.
Um, I came here on vacation... and my friend gave me this room.
- This is weird.
- It's not weird at all.
You came here to find me.
That's so romantic.
No, I didn't come- no, this is a coincidence, really.
This is really just a coincidence.
So you're still not gonna claim your love child?
Baby, what is all the noise?
You're not still mad at me, are you?
Right. I thought you said no sex till after the baby.
That must be some other lady you're dating,
'cause we are gonna do it right now.
Bye, Andy.
Son of a bitch.
He must have a girl over there.
Oh. Take it. Take it!
Take it like a dirty whore!
Oh, yeah!
Give me your man stick!
Oh, take it like a Brit who hates everything American!
No, I can't, 'cause I can see the baby moving.
- Yes.
- Don't look.
Oh, yes! Give me your big limey lizard!
Oh, yeah! You're giving new meaning to "bangers and mash"!
Oh, God! You are so huge!
- Say you love me right now.
- I love you right now.
- Fuckin' louder, bitch.
- I love you right now!
I love you too, Aldous! Of course we can name the baby after you!
- No. I don't want to name the baby-
- Shut up! Yes, you do!
Get inside me now.
Oh, yes!
Oh, yes!
Yes, yes! Oh, yes!
Oh, yeah! Yes!
- Something's got a hold of me willy.
- What?
Something's got a hold of me willy!
It feels like... baby hands.
Oh, good God, Lord!
The baby's got a hold of me wanker!
Shut up! Oh, yeah!
Oh, yes! Like that!
- Yes, yes!
- What did you fuck, the devil?
Daddy! Daddy! Play!
Oh, good Lord!
Help me, Jesus Christ!
- This woman's got a demon in her sex!
- Oh, yeah!
Oh, God!
Oh, yes!
- This place is really nice.
- Yeah, I love it here.
It reminds me of a restaurant my uncle used to take me to when I was a little girl.
He'd always have a scotch.
I hated the taste of it after he kissed me.
- Is that- Uh, is that you?
- Huh?
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh.
You know what?
My ex-boyfriend owns this restaurant.
He took those of me one night when I was really toasted.
You have- Ex-boy-
You've been here three days.
You already have an ex-boyfriend. Wow.
Once you start mixing alcohol and Red Bull... it's like you're behind the wheel of a car going 100 miles an hour, but nobody's driving.
- Yeah.
- Yeah. That's- wow. You're really flexible.
Oh, yeah. It's genetic. I come from a long line of leg spreaders.
Yeah. Because you seem to really like being naked.
A- Are you judging me, Andy?
Is that what's going on here?
- No. No!
- 'Cause if you are,
I will walk out of here right now.
No, no, no. Kim, I'm not judging you.
Please, I'm not judging you.
You know, I've gotten drunk and done some pretty wild things myself.
Just drop it, Andy, okay?
Put the photos behind us?
- Yeah. Okay. I'm all for that, yeah.
- Great. Thank you.
- Shall we order?
- Yeah. I'm starving.
Is that a-
Is that a gorilla?
Yeah, Andy.
It's a gorilla.
- What does it look like, a giraffe? Come on.
- No. Yeah.
- I like you, Andy. I like you a lot.
- I like you too.
The funny thing is that usually I like to get really physical with the guys I date.
But with you, it's different.
- It's like I need something more.
- Yeah.
I feel like I'm connecting with You on such a deeper level.
You're like a brother to me.
You've got this asexual vibe that's so hot.
It's like I could see us married for five years and not even kissing.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
I really think we should just go a while without having sex.
Like a long, long while, you know?
- Just take things really slow.
- Okay.
You know what I'm saying, Andy?
'Cause I don't think we should get each other hot and bothered.
I really think we should just let sex be the furthest thing from our minds.
- Okay.
- I won't tongue your ear... or rub my natural... perky breasts up against your chest... or lick your inner thigh all the way up to your c- up to your- to your c-
- My c-
- Yeah.
I really want to say it, but I feel shy saying the word "cock."
I think I know what you mean. Yeah.
Is that your cock?
Oh, my God!
You're making a weird face right now.
- I am? Really?
- Yeah.
It's funny. You look like a- like a crazy person.
Oh. Oh!
I had such a good time with you.
Oh, I just- I feel like we're connected or something.
I feel like you might be my soul mate.
Ooh!
Take me from behind. Yeah.
Oh. Okay.
Uh, what the hell is that?
What? Oh. Oh, it's my tattoo.
My uncle inked it on me when I was, like, 12.
It's like a family crest. It's kind of cool, right?
I never got a full look at it.
- Are you Native American?
- What? No.
I want you inside me right now.
- Please, Andy.
- Okay, okay.
Don't do it, Andy! Do not throw away everything that we have built together!
- Who the hell is this?
- Sarah, what are you doing?
Look, I made a mistake, okay?
I never should have let you go.
You're the one that I want to be with.
I know it, and our baby knows it.
That is not my baby, okay?
That is not my baby.
I know that this is a lot for you to process, and that's okay.
Oprah says that all men go through this first phase of denial with pregnancy... and we can go through it together.
Hold on a second.
Am I hearing that this is your baby?
- That is not my baby!
- Of course it is. He's my baby's daddy.
I'm not your baby's daddy!
Blaqguy's the baby's daddy.
Leave it up to the man to put the blame on the coloreds.
I'm not blaming anybody! Blaqguy had sex with you when you were blindfolded!
Okay, Andy.
I'll humor you, all right?
There's only one way to find this out for sure. A little help, please!
Ladies and gentlemen, Andy claims... that his roommate diddled Sarah while she wasn't lookin'.
Ooh!
Sarah claims that this baby is gonna come out all white and hairy... just like his daddy Andy.
Aw!
So, to end all of this right now... we have an amazing new DNA test... that can determine the father of a child before the baby is born.
Ooh!
Come here, you grisly little bastard.
I am so sick and tired- of you deadbeat motherfuckers... makin' us white guys look bad!
Oh, shit!
If it turns blue, ladies, we've got your baby's daddy.
I'm sorry, son. I may have been a little too hard on you right there.
You can take a hound to water... but you can't water a hound.
Sarah, you're a bitch.
Good night, folks.
I'm Dr. Bill.
He told you, bitch.
Now you look stupid.
Stupid?
Who you callin' stupid, bitch?
- You, trick.
- Trick? You the ho.
I'm the ho?
You the ho with that ho mouth.
Should be eatin' out this peach with that ho mouth.
Oh, I will eat that peach.
I will eat that peach until it turns into a prune, bitch.
You think I'm scared of you turning my peach into a prune?
- Oh, you're not scared of me?
- Nah, I ain't scared of you.
You're not scared of me suckin' it?
- I'm gonna suck you off like I did my man Andy.
- What you say, bitch?
- You heard me.
- What you say about my man Andy?
- Your man?
- It's on, bitch.
All right. Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Let's get it on!
Let me see what you can do.
Fucker!
Oh, I think I just farted.
I'm sorry, you guys.
Come on, smelly snatch.
Come on! Come on! Fuckin' do it!
Oh, you did not just fuck with my best asset.
Oh, did it just get cold in here?
- Let's go, bitch.
- You want to go again? You want to go again?
Oh!
- Oh.
- This is what I like to call the "Heather Mills," bitch.
Please! Don't.
You know what, Andy?
This is exactly the kind of drama I wanted to get away from by moving out here.
So who's it gonna be- me or her?
You're both, like, incredibly special people, and I-
You know what?
It's been real, but it's over.
- Kim, please-
- Give me my leg!
Give it to me!
Hey. You ready for some of this?
- Aw, shit.
- Pussy!
Young white one, follow me to the path of your destiny.
What?
Motherfucker, get yo' ass out of that lounge chair and follow me, bitch.
Damn!
Hi. Who are you?
The force is strong with this one.
- Virgin you are.
- Are you-
A virgin? Yes.
140 years for me.
Okay. You're 140 years old? I doubt that.
Nobody's 140 years old.
By not soiling your seed upon the sand, many years do you live. splooge is the key to life force, it is.
He's saying if you don't jerk it, you live longer.
- Really?
- Mmm.
I'm 81 myself.
So, wait. I've been doing the right thing this whole time?
Yes have you.
Um, I'm sorry.
Is that your ball sac?
Observant you are.
Scrotum very stretchy.
Yes, yes. Very stretchy.
- Yeah.
- At age 41, your balls will fill up.
The bigger they get, the more force you'll have.
I don't care about the force.
I don't want big balls.
Behold, the power of the virgin force.
Oh!
No! This is not what I-
I don't want to be a virgin anymore!
I fear we have lost another one to the dark side.
Scratch the back of my balls, will you?
Reach them I cannot.
Jesus Christ.
That's so hot. Oh, my god.
Smile on this one.
No, no. Don't use your teeth.
Ah, that's-
Hey, hey, hey, fuck snort!
What are You doing with my photos?
She's my girlfriend, and these are mine!
And don't call me a snort fuck or whatever it is you called me.
What a fuckin' hunyak!
You, back at me right now. There we go.
It just isn't right that a woman as wonderful as you... has her shaved... chunch plastered all over a four-star restaurant.
I know we're not together, but if we were I wouldn't want to share your growler with anyone.
Except for maybe the gorilla.
That kind of turned me on.
It wasn't a gorilla, Andy.
It was a guy in a fuzzy suit.
Oh. I didn't know that.
Look, I made a mistake back there by not telling you how I really feel.
I choose you, Kim.
I choose you.
Now I know
My one mistake was not telling you
Memories
Wicked scenes
I can't escape or erase from the end
I'm doomed!
I'm gonna be this old man with this giant nut sac... and nobody to carry it around for me!
Oh, damn! Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Holy fuck! Oh!
Andy!
- Andy! Oh, my God! Andy, are you okay?
- Yeah.
I'm so sorry I said all those things to you.
I feel horrible about it.
I'm sorry.
- It's okay. Listen, Kim.
- Yeah?
There's something
I wanna tell you, okay?
You, too, have hepatitis "B" and an incurable case of burning Chlamydia?
- No. What?
- What?
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- Nothing. No. No.
- There's something else, okay?
- Oh.
Look.
I'm a virgin.
Really?
Oh, Andy, that is so refreshing.
I haven't been with a virgin since I was, like, eight.
- Wait. What?
- Since I was, like, eight.
Oh. Okay.
You know what?
I love you. You got hit by a car, and you're still standing up.
You're just undefeatable.
All right, Sarah! Just keep pushing! got some crowning action going on over here.
I can see the head, but the head can't see me. Here we go!
- I'm gonna take a look.
- No, don't look! Don't look!
Holy Christ!
I shouldn't have looked.
Oh, shit! Get it out!
Get it out!
Here it comes.
Oh! Oh!
Can you hear me now?
No.
What about now?
Good.
- Oh!
- I see the head.
- Shit! Ah, cocksucker, motherfucker!
- Push.
Oh!
Congratulations on your beautiful baby boy!
You got a playmate now.
Do I even know you?
- We got another one.
- What? Oh, God!
- Here we are. It's coming.
- Fuck!
Oh!
Uh, I'm gonna assume this one is yours?
Oh, he's beautiful!
- Hey!
- Here's another one.
Come on. Here it is.
Oh!
It's for you.
Congratulations.
Oh, wow.
How many people did You have sex with?
It's coming! Here it is.
Is it- Is it-
My little rice ball.
Oh. Thank you, Nurse.
Love
Love
- Hey, Andy. Congratulations.
- Congratulations.
Tonight you get to do both of us.
But we were just wondering one thing.
- Have you ever had a Turkish log jammer?
- Double clam slam?
- Bolivian skyscraper?
- Sweaty catfish sampler?
Pink glass shower?
Mouth fucking?
Okay. Get the fuck out of here!
Are you ready for this?
Yeah. I think so.
I'm gonna make it really easy on you.
I'm gonna do all the work.
Oh. Okay.
- Oh. Oh!
- Wow.
Oh, that feels- That's good.
You're officially not a virgin anymore.
Oh. Yeah.
Oh, that's really-
That feels good.
That feels, like, really good.
Why are you making that face?
- Aw, sorry. I'm sorry.
- That's okay. It's all right.
Just try to look into my eyes.
Okay. Yeah. That's- Ah, there.
There, that hurts.
This hurts. Little bit hurts.
Good though. In a good way.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- Okay. Oh.
Do it harder.
You shouldn't move. Something's going on now. Something's going on.
What's happening?
Ah! Get out of me!
Get out!
Apparently, the wildfire has been completely extinguished.
But in related news...
Louisiana is now completely flooded.
A torrential downpour of an unknown salty liquid... has filled the area... breaking the levees once again in the process.
Ha! Aha!
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes, yes!
Yes, yes, you stupid, lame brained, relentless... snot-nosed, dickface, cocksucker, cock knocker... motherfucker, yes!
Yes! Now, don't you ever give up?
Don't you have a conscience?
Have you no fucking soul?
You unflinching bastard!
You stupid, relentless, lame brained... fucking cocksucker!
Fuck burger, fucking, fucking fuck burger!
Can you hear me now?
Yes.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes. Yes.
{876}{}KAZAAM
{6469}{}Loser!
{8926}{}No, ?????
{126051}{}What's happend?
{3214}{3272}. . .because of the defiance of|one person.
{3277}{3312}You must forget about him.
{3317}{3399}He was a wild spirit and this was|always to be his fate.
{3404}{3470}You talk as if he's already dead
{3628}{3708}Even if he does survive this time,|he's a greener. . .
{3713}{3773}. . .so set your sights elsewhere|for a husband.
{3778}{3838}I'll never set my sights elsewhere.
{4662}{4732}-This is all the medicine I could find.|-I'm sorry.
{4742}{4806}The gods took your father|in the night.
{5402}{5496}As long as we stay here, there'll|never be enough to eat. Never.
{5513}{5601}There may be other places|we could live where food is plentiful.
{5606}{5688}All it takes is one demon to follow|you back from the forbidden land.
{5693}{5732}Then we'd all be struck down.
{5738}{5773}Have you ever seen one?
{5778}{5809}Have you?
{5814}{5861}Has anyone here ever seen one?
{5872}{5896}A demon?
{5906}{5934}A monster!
{5939}{5968}A beast!
{6056}{6090}The stories are true.
{6120}{6157}The gods used to live here.
{6179}{6265}They watched over and protected man,|but man grew selfish. . .
{6270}{6321}. . .and cruel. So the gods left. . .
{6326}{6386}. . .allowing the demons|to descend from the sky.
{6516}{6604}As survivors, we must dedicate|our lives to pleasing the gods. . .
{6610}{6700}. . .so that one day they will come back|and drive away the demons.
{6718}{6793}That is our fate.
{6844}{6892}Only if you believe in fate.
{7454}{7492}I'm sorry. I can't take you.
{7497}{7545}I can't handle myself|as well as a man?
{7550}{7596}-No.|-You arrogant greener.
{7601}{7670}You can handle yourself|better than most men. . .
{7675}{7737}. . .which is why you need|to help the village.
{7866}{7948}Your mother gave this to me|before she died.
{7954}{8008}She hoped it'd be passed|to your children.
{8108}{8137}It's for good luck.
{8354}{8411}Don't let anything happen|to you out there.
{9455}{9475}Easy!
{9623}{9644}Easy!
{10288}{10339}So you're the beast|we're all afraid of.
{10972}{11011}Not a lot of meat on a dragon.
{11196}{11243}You have been fortunate in the hunt.
{11248}{11299}I hope you thanked the gods.
{11331}{11399}-A nonbeliever.|-I believe what I can see.
{11452}{11526}A nonbeliever, huh?|You from the caves?
{11531}{11592}Probably never seen a god.|Would you like to?
{11597}{11679}-What do you know about gods?|-We've seen gods. Rock and l.
{11685}{11722}You lying thieves.
{11823}{11849}Wait a minute.
{11875}{11915}Wait a minute, we're hunting.
{11920}{11970}No time to show you gods with no food.
{11975}{12060}We need food. We must hunt.|Nonbeliever.
{12147}{12172}Wait.
{12388}{12433}First you show me the god.
{12454}{12489}Then we eat.
{12678}{12703}Look.
{12719}{12760}Frozen ones.
{12765}{12851}The way to the great god village|is marked by these frozen ones.
{12869}{12954}When the gods left this world,|they ordered man not to look at them.
{12962}{13054}Those that disobeyed were|frozen in place for all of eternity.
{13060}{13133}When the gods lived here|they could fly through the air.
{13153}{13246}They'd drive chariots in front|of special caves with golden arches.
{13259}{13283}Golden.
{13288}{13350}And the food would magically appear.
{13355}{13381}Magic.
{13387}{13415}Here!
{13440}{13542}The gods weren't allowed to fall|in love with mortal women.
{13552}{13590}This one did. . .
{13595}{13667}. . .and was left behind,|frozen as punishment.
{13770}{13803}Are you sure this was a god?
{13809}{13868}I thought you said you believe|what you can see.
{14143}{14170}If you need proof. . .
{14175}{14267}. . .when the sun goes down, you can see|the rest of the gods in the sky.
{14276}{14317}They're the bright lights.
{14371}{14443}The evil beasts hunt in the dark.|We need to find shelter.
{14448}{14495}There's a cave over here.
{14627}{14721}Look at those poor bastards.|They really angered the gods.
{14728}{14754}Carlo.
{14771}{14802}Let's eat.
{15161}{15199}Go. Go.
{15576}{15603}What's a "greener"?
{15609}{15660}The grass is greener|on the other side.
{15678}{15764}Always looking for something better,|something out there.
{15769}{15799}Maybe she was right.
{15923}{15955}God stone.
{15991}{16018}Sharp.
{16052}{16100}No, you keep it. You keep it.
{16116}{16199}Where we're from, a good woman|is a hard thing to find.
{16204}{16285}So if you were stupid enough|to leave a good woman behind. . .
{16290}{16379}. . .why don't you tell me where she is|so I can go get her for myself?
{16384}{16408}No!
{17421}{17479}Forget about me.|Get out of here. I can't move!
{17808}{17831}No!
{17936}{17972}Oh, heavenly gods!
{21840}{21885}Don't breathe the air!
{21898}{21922}It's poison!
{22048}{22090}My chest is on fire!
{22316}{22368}It helps you breathe. Take it!
{22373}{22404}I can't!
{22506}{22548}Get off my brother.
{24196}{24239}-What's he saying?|-Don't know.
{26297}{26336}Who's responsible for allowing|him to run around?
{26342}{26362}He shot the wrangler.
{26468}{26561}I'm a little pressed for time.|Save the going-away jokes for later.
{26566}{26613}No joke, sir. I swear.
{26618}{26678}The man-animal|got ahold of this gun.
{26695}{26720}Really?
{26751}{26780}Show me.
{26804}{26824}Sir?
{26932}{26959}Reach for the gun.
{26964}{27005}But, sir, I might get shot.
{27011}{27091}Sure, you might. And I might|suddenly grow a third arm!
{27096}{27128}But it shot the wrangler.
{27134}{27206}Any report filed today|still has my name on it. . .
{27212}{27301}. . .and you are out of your skull-bone|if you think I'm going to write. . .
{27306}{27389}. . . "shot by a man-animal" as the|cause of death unless I see it!
{27394}{27452}If I obey your command,|I may get killed.
{27457}{27522}If you don't, it's a certainty|you will be killed.
{27547}{27574}Reach for the gun.
{27853}{27913}Well, I'll be damned.
{29892}{29961}Teleportation sequence activated.
{30016}{30063}Teleportation sequence activated.
{30622}{30677}It is a pleasure to see you,|Your Excellency.
{30682}{30762}I would be honored to expedite|your clearance through security.
{30767}{30849}Please, call me Zete.|Does all of Earth look like this?
{30854}{30904}I'm afraid so, sir.
{30919}{31024}Pathetic. All the green|and the blue sky.
{31031}{31120}They told me this planet was ugly,|but this is one of the ugliest. . .
{31125}{31194}-. . .in the entire universe.|-I couldn't agree more.
{31199}{31305}I hate these puny, undersized planets.|The gravity is so different.
{31313}{31353}One does get used to it.
{31359}{31431}And the human-animals,|grossly undersized.
{31437}{31495}They don't make good eating,|Your Excellency.
{31501}{31557}-My executive assistant, Ker.|-Thank you.
{31563}{31655}He has been fully trained|to replace me as chief of security.
{31661}{31750}-As soon as my transfer goes through.|-Well, Ker. . .
{31755}{31836}. . .once we finish mining out|this miserable little planet. . .
{31841}{31887}. . .Iet's do the universe a favor.
{31892}{31950}Let's exterminate the lot of them.
{32019}{32079}-Oh, you're too much.|-So they tell me.
{32085}{32130}Please, come this way.
{32235}{32279}Spy satellites recorded those.
{32285}{32363}-What is this species?|-According to the Clinko historians. . .
{32368}{32407}. . .the species is called "dog. "
{32413}{32454}-Dog.|-Yes.
{32464}{32543}Obviously the superior race,|having the man-animal chauffeur.
{32565}{32664}Well, dogs did prove to be|more cooperative than the man-animals.
{32669}{32746}They weren't as useful|when it came to manual labor.
{32803}{32889}I am honored by your visit,|Your Excellency.
{32894}{32922}Thank you, Planetship.
{32927}{33003}You'll be pleased. I approved|additional labor resources.
{33008}{33065}They'll be here|by the end of quarter cycle.
{33070}{33111}Thank you, Your Excellency.
{33121}{33165}Now, let's see.
{33239}{33296}Your long overdue transfer.
{33309}{33406}You must be looking forward to getting|off this disgusting excuse of a planet.
{33412}{33510}I just want to do whatever serves|the corporation best, sir.
{33515}{33581}Very admirable.|And I must say, you've done. . .
{33587}{33657}. . .a first-rate job here|as interim security chief.
{33662}{33717}Hear, hear! Hear, hear!
{33722}{33759}I do what I can.
{33764}{33837}So we've decided to keep you|for another tour of service.
{33948}{33998}There must be some mistake.
{34003}{34070}Home Office does not make mistakes.
{34075}{34131}Of course not.|But have you looked at my file?
{34146}{34228}It explicitly says that this|is a temporary assignment.
{34375}{34455}Are you not aware that I graduated|top of my class?
{34460}{34492}Quite an accomplishment.
{34503}{34573}I don't mean to second-guess|the Home Office. . .
{34578}{34639}. . .but surely I could be|of better service--
{34644}{34759}Home Office is well aware of your|academic achievements and talents.
{34764}{34871}That's why we've decided not to keep|you here for another five cycles.
{35000}{35036}It's a joke.
{35096}{35120}Thank you, sir.
{35125}{35211}I don't know if I|could've kept my sanity. . .
{35216}{35263}. . .to be here another five cycles.
{35268}{35360}We've decided to keep you here|for another 50 cycles!
{35395}{35454}With endless options for renewal!
{36051}{36111}Those options, of course. . .
{36116}{36174}. . .being at Home Office's discretion.
{36179}{36209}Not yours.
{36256}{36289}The senator. . .
{36327}{36380}. . .has a lot of friends.
{36530}{36581}Would you please tell the senator. . .
{36587}{36656}. . .if I'd had even an inkling that|that was his daughter--
{36662}{36697}Watch your tongue.
{36751}{36838}The senator's exact words to me were,|and I'm quoting:
{36843}{36911}"If that blasted Terl tries|to talk his way out of it. . .
{36916}{36972}. . .have him vaporized on the spot. "
{37020}{37112}But cheer up.|There's one bright side to this.
{37117}{37209}One day you're going to die,|and when you end up in hell. . .
{37222}{37292}. . .at least it'll be a step up|from this place.
{38651}{38699}You haven't left for Psychlo.
{38713}{38803}Your powers of observation|are simply startling.
{38815}{38853}Give me three pans to go.
{38917}{38975}I don't know what|you're so down about.
{38987}{39039}You still get to be head of security.
{39044}{39163}Which, from what I can tell,|is a pretty cushy job.
{39171}{39235}Well, I can assure you. . .
{39240}{39359}. . .that I was not groomed since birth|to have some cushy job. . .
{39364}{39434}. . .that even a moron like you|could perform.
{39454}{39538}While you were still learning|how to spell your name. . .
{39543}{39634}. . .I was being trained|to conquer galaxies!
{39684}{39716}To do anything less. . .
{39721}{39796}. . .is a disgrace|to my entire family line.
{39830}{39869}That'll be six credits.
{39877}{39909}Put it on my tab.
{39914}{39940}You don't have a tab.
{39950}{39984}I do now.
{40958}{41020}You're new here,|so I'll explain how it works.
{41047}{41077}I eat first.
{41083}{41117}Then my men eat.
{41123}{41196}If there's anything left,|you can share it with them.
{41205}{41252}That's how it used to work.
{41268}{41328}Greener, let's just stay alive.
{41334}{41358}You're right.
{41365}{41397}-So I'll fight you.|-No.
{41425}{41489}Without food,|we don't have strength to escape.
{41494}{41555}-So now we're escaping?|-I am.
{41560}{41584}Come if you want.
{41676}{41735}We fight, it's to the death.
{42277}{42319}Say your prayers to the gods!
{43011}{43104}We have enough problems without|killing each other over food.
{43164}{43256}From now on, we eat at the same time.
{44114}{44141}Sir.
{44256}{44305}I was wondering when|you'd look at that.
{44319}{44428}It came in last week,|and I put it right in your box.
{44499}{44570}I've wasted my time, haven't l?
{44617}{44712}If you're going to lie to me, have|the decency to do a credible job. . .
{44717}{44781}. . .so I don't look like an idiot|for training you.
{44787}{44886}But I'm not lying. I put the photo|in your box as soon as it came in.
{44891}{44971}You are pathetic. You wouldn't last|one day at the academy.
{44976}{45053}-And I saw you.|-What?
{45142}{45175}You said:
{45185}{45265}"We use picto-cameras|to spy on other offices.
{45270}{45368}But under no circumstance|do we spy on our own office. "
{45373}{45427}That's right. We don't. I do.
{45447}{45485}Start talking.
{45527}{45576}The photo's from|last week's recon drone.
{45581}{45660}It shows a rockslide in the mountains.|It exposed a gold vein.
{45665}{45714}You were waiting for me to transfer. . .
{45719}{45771}. . .so you could turn it in|and get credit.
{45776}{45808}I didn't think you'd mind.
{45813}{45885}I don't mind. Turn it in. But before|you do, pretend you're not. . .
{45937}{45955}. . .a complete imbecile. . .
{45960}{45999}. . .and check the compo gradients.
{46097}{46149}It's full of uranium. No Psychlo. . .
{46201}{46272}. . .can get there without his breath gas|exploding. No way to mine the gold.
{46361}{46461}But what I do mind is that you|betrayed me over a lousy recon photo!
{46493}{46535}It's worthless! You said so!
{46540}{46599}But you didn't know it was worthless!
{46739}{46799}I would never hurt you, sir.
{46863}{46980}I'm unarmed. You can't shoot me.|It's against regulations, sir.
{47001}{47085}I can make this up to you, sir.|I promise. I swear.
{47090}{47117}Please, sir.
{47195}{47247}You do not have to shoot me, sir.
{47473}{47567}Shoot you? My most trusted colleague?
{47572}{47631}Of course not.|We have work to do. Come.
{47677}{47771}Tomorrow morning, we must warn|the Planetship of the mutiny.
{47776}{47800}What mutiny?
{47805}{47873}The one you're going to pretend|is in the works. . .
{47878}{47980}. . .Iike your life depended on it.|Because it does.
{48012}{48095}If the worker revolt takes place,|my informants tell me. . .
{48100}{48180}. . .that the first order of business is|to separate you from your head.
{48220}{48297}Which is why there will be no revolt.
{48302}{48396}I am authorizing you to use whatever|means necessary to prevent it.
{48408}{48513}The best way is to increase profits|and stop cutting the workers' pay.
{48518}{48570}Production equals profits.
{48581}{48665}And I've already ordered|as many new workers as possible. . .
{48670}{48707}. . .to boost production.
{48712}{48776}But we have to pay the new workers.
{48781}{48899}Maybe you were absent the day they|taught economics at the academy, Ker.
{48909}{48965}But nobody works for free.
{48978}{49017}Man-animals do.
{49068}{49127}What if we were to train them|how to mine?
{49248}{49322}Man-animals operating machinery?
{49344}{49401}Have you blown a head gasket?
{49412}{49526}I will be the laughingstock|of the universe.
{49531}{49585}So you should have me|take man-animals. . .
{49590}{49644}. . .with equipment,|out to a remote area. . .
{49649}{49724}. . .better that you don't know where,|and try and train them.
{49736}{49799}Have them do some test mining.
{49804}{49867}If it doesn't work out,|no one will know.
{49872}{49922}-Right.|-And if it does work. . .
{49927}{49979}. . .I will be vaporized.
{49985}{50026}It is against the law.
{50031}{50060}Regulations say. . .
{50065}{50166}. . .a Planetship faced with|a profit-threatening situation. . .
{50171}{50250}. . .is relieved|of all other ordinances. . .
{50255}{50360}. . .to pursue, to protect|and to acquire said profits.
{50365}{50392}There you have it.
{50568}{50637}We stick to the original plan.
{50655}{50693}Bring in new workers. . .
{50712}{50790}. . .and they go on half-pay|as soon as they arrive.
{50795}{50864}And that is final!
{52379}{52447}Run! Run!
{53758}{53819}Okay, now! Pull his breath mask off.
{53928}{54000}Last time we didn't even stop timing|until its lungs burst.
{54006}{54030}That's the wager.
{54188}{54279}No way this man-animal|lasts more than four minutes.
{54834}{54864}Help me!
{54881}{54910}I need your air!
{55293}{55346}The wager's off.|The damn thing cheated.
{55547}{55600}The Planetship is hiding something.
{55605}{55662}All we have to do|is find out what it is. . .
{55668}{55713}. . .then we'll have leverage.
{55719}{55773}And then we can get the gold.
{55779}{55830}What do you mean, we? It's my plan.
{55840}{55939}I'm sending the gold to Psychlo, then|I'm getting off this stinking planet.
{55945}{55974}Come on, sir.
{55989}{56030}You gotta let me in on it.
{56036}{56097}I barely make any lousy credits|in this job.
{56103}{56179}And I've got five wives|to support, sir.
{56237}{56317}I don't know if I want|to partner up with an idiot.
{56336}{56393}How do I even know|you understand the plan?
{56513}{56616}We train man-animals|who don't need breath gas. . .
{56622}{56673}. . .to mine the gold for us.
{56679}{56759}But Home Planet owns this planet.|The gold belongs to them.
{56765}{56798}That's the beauty of it.
{56804}{56858}Home Planet doesn't know|the gold exists.
{56864}{56932}Those corporate crapheads|won't know we stole it.
{56941}{56986}It's the perfect crime, sir.
{56992}{57091}Putting aside the serious violations|of teaching mining to inferiors. . .
{57097}{57190}. . .and insulting corporate superiors,|each one punishable by death.
{57196}{57241}So it is my duty to report you. . .
{57246}{57338}. . .though you'll be vaporized, and|I'll have to train a new assistant.
{57365}{57416}But it's your stinking plan, sir.
{57421}{57474}So I'm glad I have|a recording of you. . .
{57479}{57530}. . .Iaying out the plan|and my reprimanding you.
{57535}{57584}Think of it as part of your education.
{57626}{57655}Education, huh?
{57725}{57824}Never engage in a criminal activity|unless you have a patsy to pin it on. . .
{57830}{57879}. . .in case you ever get found out.
{57894}{57949}Thank you. That's great.
{57955}{58002}But why do I have to be the patsy?
{58008}{58068}So you don't get any bright ideas|to get rid of Terl. . .
{58074}{58123}. . .and keep the gold for yourself.
{58128}{58169}But I'd never double-cross you.
{58175}{58264}I've arranged that if any unfortunate|accident were to befall me. . .
{58281}{58349}. . .this would go|straight to the Home Office.
{60228}{60302}Double or nothing|I can blow off one of its limbs.
{60468}{60550}That one does seem to be unusually|intelligent and resourceful.
{60560}{60609}But it's also defiant.
{60618}{60659}We'll need leverage over it.
{60664}{60717}Leverage? Over a man-animal?
{60722}{60769}Man is a primitive species. . .
{60774}{60887}. . .so we'll need something primitive|for leverage. Like food.
{60897}{60963}What do you think a man-animal|would like to eat?
{60968}{61015}What would he consider a treat?
{61021}{61066}How the crap should I know?
{61086}{61123}There's no way of knowing that.
{61162}{61213}But before we educate it|on the machine. . .
{61218}{61298}. . .we'll take it to the mountains|with a couple of the others.
{61304}{61351}Let them think they've escaped. . .
{61364}{61444}. . .and then we'll sit back|and watch it choose its favorite food.
{61465}{61493}Yes.
{61969}{61995}Look!
{62199}{62285}Three days, and they still haven't|eaten anything yet.
{62291}{62351}Precisely. Now that|the man-animals feel. . .
{62358}{62407}. . .that they have|enough distance from us. . .
{62413}{62487}. . .soon they'll find|their favorite food and celebrate.
{62790}{62812}What is it?
{62819}{62852}Food. Food!
{63029}{63111}No spark, no flints, nothing.|You, Floyd?
{63117}{63174}Plenty to burn.|Nothing to start a fire with.
{63317}{63371}-That's their favorite.|-Of course it is.
{63377}{63451}-They could've selected anything.|-It's not cooked.
{63479}{63576}If man-animal prefers rat uncooked,|then our job is that much easier.
{63583}{63663}If they like their rat so much,|how come those two aren't eating?
{63668}{63775}Don't you know anything? The leader|of the pack always eats first. See?
{63949}{64015}We're really going to have|leverage over them now.
{64366}{64399}What are you doing?
{64653}{64690}They know about the camera.
{64695}{64738}Don't be a knot-head.|It's a man-animal.
{64749}{64798}It couldn't possibly know about it.
{64965}{65016}You sure called that one, sir.
{65021}{65064}No way they know about the cameras.
{65069}{65135}Move your fat ass|and let's go round them up!
{65164}{65193}Crap, lousy ceiling!
{65824}{65874}Great. This is great.
{66138}{66163}What do we do now?
{66169}{66239}What are you thinking, Jonnie?|Don't even think about it.
{66244}{66333}You wouldn't live the jump, Jonnie.|You wouldn't live the jump!
{66340}{66398}You can surrender and rot|in those cages.
{66404}{66453}That's your choice.|I'm not going back!
{66460}{66526}The monsters catch us,|they'll take us to the mines.
{66787}{66814}Run!
{67653}{67688}How do we know what he wants?
{67693}{67770}They made me do this before.|Follow me and you'll be fine.
{68031}{68075}Don't touch anything.
{68081}{68137}Get them mad,|think what they'll do to us.
{68787}{68867}Excuse me, but I am your instructor. . .
{68873}{68904}. . .if you'll forgive such arrogance. . .
{68957}{68990}. . .for I do not have the honor|to be a Psychlo.
{68997}{69030}I'm a lowly Clinko language slave.
{69096}{69208}As you are listening to me,|I most likely do not exist. . .
{69214}{69311}. . .as we may have been exterminated|like many other races. . .
{69317}{69387}. . .by the gas drones|of our conquerors.
{69395}{69446}Please forgive my pretension. . .
{69452}{69529}. . .as I try to educate you|in Psychlo. . .
{69535}{69614}. . .the noble language|of our superiors.
{70620}{70648}You understand?
{70683}{70743}You understand me?
{70778}{70844}Are you hungry, little fella? Yes?
{70935}{70990}Obviously, this is going|to take a while.
{71499}{71544}Jonnie! Jonnie!
{71611}{71665}Carlo! Carlo!
{71679}{71764}I know who they are and where they're|from. I can speak their language.
{71770}{71815}-Monsters?|-They're called Psychlos.
{71821}{71852}What did they do to him?
{71859}{71921}They made him look into a light,|a god machine.
{71927}{71980}It teaches.|It's a knowledge machine.
{71987}{72079}It sends pictures through your head|so fast, it's spinning.
{72086}{72126}Let's go, Jonnie. Come on.
{72133}{72236}No, I can't. I have to stay.|I have to learn more about them.
{72263}{72332}This may be our only way out of here.
{72711}{72797}So this is the monster's language?
{72802}{72848}No, no. This is mathematics.
{72900}{72966}This is the unifying language|of the entire universe.
{73105}{73132}Look.
{73142}{73203}This symbol is called a triangle.
{73212}{73272}If all these sides are equal. . .
{73277}{73338}. . .then these three angles|must also be equal.
{73367}{73392}Equal to what?
{73407}{73435}To each other.
{73441}{73516}It's the basic foundation|of Euclidean geometry.
{73540}{73584}Seems pretty hard to understand.
{73597}{73676}No, only at first. And then it|becomes clear in your mind.
{73682}{73730}I learned molecular biology.
{73736}{73837}This is the symbol for water|and engineering.
{73851}{73961}See, a wing, see? And line|and form and artistic composition.
{73978}{74034}You see, this is a square,|like a cage.
{74039}{74143}I thought we were supposed to be|working on stuff to help us escape.
{74199}{74232}This will.
{74253}{74288}All this will.
{74650}{74716}Jonnie. Jonnie. Human.
{74795}{74875}"The security chief should secure|the field vault. . .
{74880}{74953}. . .with an eight-digit|combination code. . .
{74974}{75059}. . .and do not use a personal|or employee. . .
{75064}{75097}. . .identification number. "
{75102}{75151}What's an identification number?
{75161}{75185}There.
{75190}{75236}-How many numbers is that?|-Eight.
{75244}{75268}Eight?
{75286}{75318}Eight.
{75515}{75559}It's more clever than that.
{75564}{75604}The question is, how clever?
{75615}{75660}Try the numbers backwards.
{76014}{76044}Look at this.
{76049}{76092}It's a recording machine.
{76268}{76315}This is how he watches us.
{77018}{77063}Stop! Chrissy, stop!
{77084}{77111}What if he's not dead?
{77116}{77183}Hope is an admirable quality,|but foolish isn't.
{77188}{77257}I can't give you permission|to go and get killed.
{77270}{77303}I don't need your permission.
{77370}{77414}I'm no longer a child.
{77795}{77836}Do you want lunch?
{78071}{78136}It's obviously too much|to ask a man-animal. . .
{78141}{78197}. . .to learn a language|as sophisticated as Psychlo.
{78202}{78280}What if it can understand|and it's pretending it can't?
{78285}{78336}-What the hell for?|-I don't know.
{78341}{78425}Maybe it's secretly listening,|trying to get leverage over on us.
{78437}{78522}Man-animal getting leverage over|a Psychlo. That'll be the day.
{78564}{78632}What if this one is|particularly stupid?
{78637}{78679}Maybe we should train another one.
{78691}{78739}No time. When they detect the gold. . .
{78744}{78805}. . .the Planetship will know|what we're doing.
{78899}{78967}We'll have to terminate the operation|and cover our tracks.
{79220}{79246}It speaks Psychlo.
{79251}{79291}Go on, say something else.
{79300}{79347}You'll stay here as my prisoner. . .
{79352}{79419}. . .while you, you go|and get a transporter.
{79439}{79507}Because you've learned Psychlo|doesn't mean you are one.
{79512}{79564}Follow my orders|or I'll have you killed.
{79647}{79693}How exactly do you plan to do that?
{79946}{79995}-Mickey, no!|-Mickey, no!
{80026}{80134}If any of you rat-brains|knew anything about firearms. . .
{80149}{80236}. . .you would know that you never|store loaded weapons.
{80241}{80274}You drop him now!
{80283}{80343}Drop him or I won't mine|an ounce of your gold.
{80363}{80446}I'll have you vaporized|and find someone else to mine it.
{80451}{80477}You don't have time.
{80487}{80543}You can't hide this|from Home Office forever.
{80591}{80687}A man getting leverage over a Psychlo.|That'll be the day.
{80836}{80949}I think it's time that we show|our little friend a thing or two.
{81592}{81647}As long as you cling to|the feeble hope. . .
{81652}{81698}. . .that you'll ever get|the better of me. . .
{81703}{81773}. . .you'll be distracted|from more important things.
{81778}{81824}Which is exactly why. . .
{81829}{81884}. . .I share the following with you:
{81920}{81964}When we attacked your planet. . .
{81985}{82080}. . .all your soldiers and all|their advanced technology. . .
{82089}{82141}. . .could only put up|a nine-minute fight. . .
{82146}{82194}. . .before they were exterminated.
{82217}{82307}Which is why man|is an endangered species.
{82348}{82412}Everything you humans knew is here.
{82417}{82467}You can look at anything you want. . .
{82487}{82556}. . .because there is nothing|that will help you.
{83359}{83390}Satisfied?
{83403}{83430}Yes.
{83449}{83523}I have one more demonstration|for you and your friends.
{83800}{83863}You will be relocated|to a new mining site.
{83868}{83939}If any of you get any bright ideas|about escaping. . .
{83944}{84045}. . .keep in mind that although you|know nothing about firearms, I do.
{84056}{84172}I graduated top marksman in my class.|I can kill any of you at 1 000 paces.
{84177}{84212}Tell them what I said.
{84217}{84260}We try to run, he'll kill us.
{84272}{84330}-That's it?|-Yes.
{84352}{84389}Allow me to demonstrate.
{84809}{84842}No! Wait!
{85256}{85313}Let's give this demon|what it deserves.
{85318}{85373}Kill it, I say! Destroy it!
{85378}{85427}Shoot! Shoot!
{85432}{85457}Why wait? Kill it!
{85463}{85498}Kill it. Then we'll run.
{85503}{85534}Then what?
{85542}{85629}What kind of life is it to run?|Living in fear of being hunted?
{85645}{85699}What about those we're leaving behind?
{85704}{85747}There's nothing we can do.
{85752}{85790}Only the gods can free them.
{85795}{85879}You think the lights in the sky|are gods waiting to save us?
{85885}{85993}Do you? Those are planets,|planets like this one.
{85998}{86046}The great villages were built by us.
{86062}{86110}By men and women just like us.
{86117}{86181}Willing to fight to the death|for one thing:
{86197}{86223}Their freedom!
{86228}{86288}Do you think no one has tried?
{86309}{86359}You can't defeat them.
{86480}{86538}That is our fate.
{86580}{86638}Yes, we can. Yes, we can!
{86652}{86689}But we have to go back.
{86694}{86749}We go back and learn|about their weapons.
{86770}{86838}Our race is slowly dying|and will be gone forever.
{86845}{86934}Let it be said that we took|this one chance and fought!
{86941}{87002}Are you with me? Are you with me?!
{87025}{87055}We fight!
{87091}{87166}If you're fighting the beast,|me and my men are with you.
{87171}{87244}Thank you.|It's good to have friends out here.
{87249}{87296}May the gods be with you.
{87437}{87509}One as wise as you has ways|to stop me from shooting.
{87518}{87587}I know if I'd tried,|you would've killed me first.
{87749}{87846}Damn right, rat-brain! That's the|first intelligent thing you've said.
{87878}{87926}Rest break is over.
{87940}{88028}There's something I need you to see|so you're properly motivated.
{88530}{88573}You don't know her?
{88610}{88668}No, I don't know her.
{88688}{88768}She's one of the foulest|looking females I've ever seen.
{88785}{88818}While I tend to agree. . .
{88837}{88942}. . .it's obvious that you show a lack|of aptitude for strategic deception.
{88947}{89056}On the other hand, what you show|marginal proficiency at is. . .
{89084}{89112}. . .drawing.
{89164}{89215}This was found when she was collected.
{89252}{89343}The collar has enough explosives|to remove her head from her body.
{89348}{89389}And this remote. . .
{89400}{89465}. . .will activate it|from anywhere on the planet.
{89470}{89547}So if you disobey me, let me|show you what will happen.
{89552}{89592}Please don't harm her.
{89616}{89645}I believe you.
{89650}{89707}Don't worry, rat-brain.
{89715}{89780}Every collar has its own frequency.
{89787}{89853}I'm not going to blow up|your little female friend.
{89905}{89937}Just. . .
{89987}{90014}. . .this one.
{90056}{90089}You made your point.
{90094}{90143}I said I would mine your gold.
{90159}{90202}Please don't kill him. Please.
{90300}{90328}Fine.
{90344}{90448}Due to our new working relationship,|I will grant you this one request.
{90486}{90521}I won't kill him.
{90537}{90600}But you may never ask of me|anything again.
{90613}{90641}I promise.
{90732}{90802}As I've said, I won't kill him.
{90807}{90832}Yes, sir.
{91263}{91303}Stupid humans.
{91966}{92009}No, no, no.
{92014}{92060}What you did was right.
{92072}{92110}It was right for all of us.
{92124}{92182}Greener, you're a thinker. . .
{92197}{92242}. . .and the gods respect thinkers.
{92255}{92299}You didn't kill Sammy.
{92320}{92385}Jonnie, this is not living.
{92403}{92455}This is. . .
{92474}{92494}. . .cages!
{92503}{92527}Cages!
{92532}{92616}Even if we escaped and went back|to where we all came from. . .
{92621}{92651}. . .it'd be like you said.
{92656}{92722}We'd be waiting for the Psychlos|to hunt us down.
{92734}{92809}I think that is not living either.
{92917}{92963}We all chose to fight.
{93582}{93646}-Count us in too!|-What's going on?
{93651}{93726}Someone knows how to speak|the Psychlo's language.
{93731}{93770}He's gonna help us fight.
{95111}{95153}Yes.
{95178}{95247}Ker, I'd like you to meet Chirk.
{95271}{95327}She's. . . .
{95332}{95384}His soon-to-be|newly acquired secretary.
{95389}{95444}-Yes.|-Really?
{95453}{95545}She's stupid enough not to be a menace,|pretty enough to be decorative.
{95550}{95652}She gets drunk with economical speed|and has other advantages.
{95724}{95760}I can see that.
{95766}{95829}-Don't you have some work to do?|-No.
{95834}{95854}Ker?
{95860}{95893}All right, sir.
{95956}{95995}Now, listen, missy. . .
{96000}{96075}. . .I'm still waiting for|the Planetship's accounts.
{96144}{96222}I had to go way beyond|the call of duty to get these.
{96227}{96303}I see. Well, that's why|I especially chose you.
{96315}{96369}So you'll keep your side|of the bargain?
{96389}{96432}Which was?
{96440}{96529}You said we'd have a huge house|when we go back to Psychlo next year.
{96535}{96592}-We're going to be rich, right?|-Right.
{96602}{96690}I am going to make you|as happy as a baby Psychlo. . .
{96695}{96762}. . .on a straight diet of Kerbango.
{97086}{97131}Well, isn't it interesting. . .
{97136}{97201}. . .that you have been keeping|two sets of books. . .
{97206}{97256}. . .and telling all the workers. . .
{97262}{97320}. . .that the planet has been|operating at a loss?
{97361}{97453}I only claimed that it was|running at a loss. . .
{97459}{97561}. . .to try and motivate them all|to work harder.
{97566}{97604}Oh, yes, of course.
{97614}{97667}And it had nothing to do|with the fact. . .
{97672}{97730}. . .that it allowed you|to cut the workers' pay. . .
{97736}{97811}. . .and keep all the extra credit|for yourself. Did it?
{97840}{97910}That. Well, I can explain that.
{97915}{98020}Well, unfortunately, the company|requires me to vaporize you.
{98061}{98086}On the other hand. . .
{98101}{98175}. . .I could understand someone|in your situation. . .
{98180}{98232}. . .being old and having no future. . .
{98238}{98309}. . .coming up with ways|to solve your financial problems.
{98338}{98401}-You can?|-Oh, yes.
{98409}{98469}It's really of no interest|to anybody. . .
{98474}{98531}. . .to have you not be Planetship.
{98537}{98634}But it would be prudent of you|to start to share your authority.
{98880}{98978}But these forms are|all blank, undated.
{98993}{99053}You could put anything|you wanted on them.
{99059}{99145}You would run the entire planet!
{99187}{99293}I would be nothing but a puppet.
{99309}{99372}Well, if you don't want|to do it that way. . .
{99377}{99428}. . .we could always do it by. . .
{99457}{99492}. . .the book.
{99645}{99744}What the hell does the Planetship|need with all this mining equipment?
{99749}{99792}That's not even the crazy part.
{99797}{99882}He's ordered me to take a group|of man-animals to a remote area. . .
{99887}{99966}. . .with the equipment to see|if they can be trained to mine.
{99971}{100048}Man-animals being able to mine?
{100053}{100082}Yes.
{100254}{100305}Old Psychlo's gone completely insane.
{100319}{100348}Indeed.
{100353}{100393}But what can I do?
{100398}{100444}An order is an order.
{100562}{100612}You have a busy day, rat-brain.
{100617}{100655}First, learning how to fly. . .
{100661}{100734}. . .then on to the learning machine|for mining techniques.
{101448}{101475}Crash one more time. . .
{101480}{101559}. . .and your little friend|will no longer be among the living.
{101569}{101591}Again.
{101596}{101632}Again!
{102635}{102718}Never underestimate what a little|leverage can do, rat-brain.
{103366}{103398}That's good, man-animal.
{103413}{103490}This is the lever where|we mine the gold!
{103495}{103546}Lever! Up, down!
{103578}{103662}Warning: External sensors indicate|dangerous radiation levels ahead.
{103667}{103710}This is as far as I can go!
{103715}{103749}Land it!
{104102}{104140}Meet me back here in 1 4 days.
{104145}{104197}I want the ship's cage|half-filled with gold.
{104319}{104385}And even though I won't be|at the mining site. . .
{104440}{104470}. . .I'll be watching you.
{104721}{104793}-How's your side?|-It's good. Good.
{105096}{105138}Next time, you fly.
{105415}{105485}No, no, no.|Even if we do mine enough gold. . .
{105490}{105562}. . .we'll be lucky to fill|half of that cage in time.
{105567}{105597}That's why we're not mining.
{105602}{105687}What about the big uglies watching|us with that eye in the sky?
{105692}{105747}Carlo, look. Here's the men, right?
{105752}{105811}We split them in half.|One group goes. . .
{105816}{105848}. . .and one group stays. . .
{105853}{105913}. . .and it looks as if|we're still working.
{105959}{106054}But if we don't deliver it in 1 4 days|to Terl, he's just gonna kill us.
{106060}{106113}There's a place called Fort Knox|where the gold's already been mined.
{106118}{106191}Listen, there will be no mining,|but we'll deliver it.
{106196}{106286}Okay, so we have to pretend|that we're mining the gold.
{106322}{106399}We have to figure out where|we're gonna get the gold. . .
{106404}{106465}. . .then we have to get the supplies|to help our revolt.
{106484}{106505}Yeah.
{106510}{106570}We barely have men to|do one of those things. . .
{106575}{106621}. . .Iet alone all three.
{106669}{106738}It's good to have friends|on the outside!
{107172}{107192}Come on!
{107197}{107265}If you two kept your eyes open,|that'd be a great help.
{107270}{107343}Look for an ocean. If you see any,|we've gone too far.
{107398}{107438}I think this is it.
{107443}{107486}I think we're in Washington.
{107491}{107555}-We're still in Colorado.|-That's impossible.
{107561}{107601}I've been watching,|we haven't crossed this line.
{107606}{107652}You're not paying attention.
{107658}{107747}Let him navigate and watch me.|You're gonna fly on the way back.
{107766}{107826}We couldn't have crossed|all these lines.
{107831}{107917}Well, we did. The lines must|have faded over time.
{108283}{108360}This great village was the capital|for all our tribes.
{108365}{108425}This is where our people's|history was buried.
{108675}{108746}Here. When the Psychlos|attacked Earth. . .
{108753}{108802}. . .they sent out flying gas drones.
{108808}{108895}Our ancestors must've made it out|into these remote radiated areas. . .
{108900}{108990}. . .and the only reason they survived|was because radiation is. . .
{108995}{109034}. . .Iethal to the Psychlos.
{109039}{109110}-And that was not good for them.|-That's good for us.
{109115}{109185}Even if we fail, the people|will be safe if they stay--
{109190}{109233}Safe from being hunted. . .
{109240}{109305}. . .but radiation is|also poisonous for humans.
{109328}{109370}So, you see, either way. . .
{109395}{109447}. . .if we don't take back our planet. . .
{109488}{109544}. . .the last of humanity|becomes extinct.
{110218}{110283}Based on what I've read about|Psychlo security. . .
{110288}{110317}. . .if we revolted. . .
{110322}{110401}. . .only using weapons they don't|perceive as any real threat. . .
{110406}{110466}. . .if we just use rocks and sticks. . .
{110471}{110546}. . .they'll just throw us|back in the cages.
{110551}{110580}But. . .
{110595}{110681}. . .we're gonna stage this revolt|inside the dome.
{110686}{110799}So the Psychlos are gonna have to|come inside the city to round us up.
{110814}{110887}And that is when we blow the dome.
{110915}{110955}Carlo's gonna blow the dome.
{110961}{111012}-They won't have masks.|-They can't breathe.
{111017}{111045}-They die.|-Carlo?
{111050}{111121}-I'm gonna blow the dome?|-You're gonna blow the dome.
{111159}{111234}Piece of cake.|Piece of cake, piece of cake.
{111323}{111386}But remember, as soon as|we blow the dome. . .
{111391}{111438}. . .boom, stage 2 alarm.
{111443}{111463}What is that?
{111468}{111545}Thousands of gas drones and troops|will be teleported here.
{111550}{111634}-We can't fight against that.|-Then what's the point?
{111639}{111719}If they send more monsters to Earth,|we get wiped out.
{111733}{111800}Well, the point is,|we don't let it get to stage 2.
{111805}{111867}We'll destroy their Home Planet|before it happens.
{111872}{111939}-Their Home Planet?|-Their Home Planet.
{111979}{112047}We need some extra supplies|before we can do that.
{112052}{112110}Our first stop is a radiation bomb|storage bunker.
{112115}{112172}Is everyone clear?
{112220}{112245}Count us in.
{112997}{113041}-Look.|-Flying machines.
{113046}{113124}These are flying machines.|They're weapons of some kind.
{113188}{113222}Flying spears.
{113230}{113284}I think there's a little more|to it than that.
{113705}{113747}It's a learning machine.
{113763}{113798}Teach us to fly.
{114251}{114277}You're right.
{114283}{114317}It's like breaking a horse.
{114335}{114387}Can you teach your men to fly this?
{114392}{114462}-Piece of cake, piece of cake.|-Piece of cake.
{114467}{114509}-Try and keep it level.|-Jonnie!
{114514}{114544}-What is it?|-I think I found one.
{114549}{114619}Come on! Nuclear firebomb!
{114624}{114656}Piece of cake.
{114681}{114743}According to the book, there's|a firing mechanism. . .
{114748}{114831}. . .that has to be in place before|it's operational.
{115324}{115367}Don't touch the auto-sensor.
{115372}{115409}What happens if we do?
{115414}{115480}The bomb will explode. Big fire.
{115518}{115566}Look. Greeners from this cave.
{115571}{115611}Off. Off.
{115992}{116013}War--
{116018}{116040}--ning.
{116045}{116087}Warning. Warning.
{116092}{116121}Warning.
{116143}{116189}Warning.
{116194}{116221}Get it?
{116348}{116410}What does the auto-sensor look like?
{116417}{116470}There's an illustration in Appendix A.
{116605}{116641}What? What?
{116730}{116765}We don't have Appendix A.
{116971}{116997}More books, Jonnie.
{117206}{117239}It's okay.
{117256}{117321}I thought you said nuclear fires|were powerful?
{117326}{117363}It's not nuclear. Mickey!
{117368}{117398}Sorry.
{117403}{117440}You're sorry. Mickey!
{117445}{117519}Stop touching things|and turn off the damn light.
{117524}{117548}Leave it on.
{117592}{117622}Look.
{117770}{117806}Good work, Mickey.
{117812}{117859}You just found Appendix A.
{118243}{118299}Will this be enough to blow up|their whole planet?
{118304}{118361}Radiation reacts with their|planet's atmosphere.
{118366}{118438}-There's enough to destroy it forever.|-Let me do it.
{118491}{118546}Let me go there|and detonate the weapon.
{118553}{118632}It's brave of you, Mickey,|but it's my plan, so I go.
{118637}{118711}You're the only one who speaks|the monsters' language.
{118716}{118764}You know things about them!
{118783}{118822}Listen. . .
{118827}{118892}. . .without you leading this revolt. . .
{118927}{118961}. . .we might not succeed.
{120203}{120289}I hope their eye in the sky didn't|see the gold through the lead walls.
{120741}{120794}Start filling the cage.
{120799}{120891}We'll hide half and deliver|the other half to Terl tonight.
{121368}{121405}Why is it in bars?
{121453}{121490}I assumed, sir. . .
{121495}{121591}. . .that a Psychlo of your refinement|wouldn't want raw ore.
{121689}{121721}Really?
{121998}{122049}Since you have had extra time. . .
{122054}{122104}. . .to smelt it into bricks. . .
{122109}{122173}. . .I'll expect the rest of the gold|in seven days.
{122885}{122945}He has no intention of sharing|that gold with you.
{122997}{123060}What the hell are you talking about?
{123090}{123158}Why are you here?|You should be mining the gold!
{123163}{123234}You really think the only reason|he made that recording. . .
{123239}{123313}. . .was to have you as his patsy?|Do you, Ker?
{123328}{123401}No. He has leverage over you. . .
{123406}{123469}. . .and it'll guarantee you|never see an ounce.
{123499}{123560}How do you know|about those recordings?
{123571}{123610}It really is amazing. . .
{123615}{123684}. . .the collection of discs|you find in Terl's personal vault.
{124060}{124083}First, we trade.
{124088}{124127}-The disc--|-I don't think so!
{124133}{124190}Because if you don't give me|the disc now. . .
{124195}{124236}. . .I will blow your head off.
{124733}{124771}You want to trade?
{124803}{124831}Let's trade.
{124862}{124892}Hooray!
{124947}{125004}Won't the Psychlo see|I'm not wearing the collar?
{125010}{125084}After tonight, won't matter|much either way.
{125116}{125181}Jonnie, I know you|don't believe in fate. . .
{125188}{125242}. . .but I've always known|this was your destiny.
{125251}{125323}This is our destiny.|It's freedom for all of us.
{125336}{125372}For our children.
{125406}{125437}Children?
{126017}{126047}Beautiful.
{126365}{126388}Quickly!
{126805}{126870}What if this one is|particularly stupid?
{126875}{126935}There's no time.|When they detect the gold...
{126940}{127002}... the Planetship will know|what we're doing.
{127111}{127190}We'll have to terminate the operation|and cover our tracks.
{127234}{127329}When they detect the gold, the|Planetship will know what we're doing.
{127389}{127446}We'll have to terminate the operation|and cover our tracks.
{127451}{127472}I've been thinking.
{127485}{127577}80/20 is a pretty fair|distribution of the gold.
{127594}{127636}But I should get the 80% .
{127655}{127737}And with my share, I'm gonna|fire all my wives. . .
{127743}{127778}. . .and buy new ones.
{127803}{127856}Maybe pretty ones this time.
{127885}{127912}Ker-bango!
{127967}{127995}Congratulations.
{128002}{128076}You've learned how to get|leverage over someone, haven't you?
{128095}{128168}Which means I haven't wasted my time|training you, have l?
{128187}{128233}-You're not upset?|-Don't be crazy.
{128242}{128290}You know how long I've waited|for this day?
{128296}{128347}I know the perfect way to celebrate.
{128396}{128451}What are you doing?
{128484}{128512}You can't shoot me.
{128517}{128591}I made a copy and gave it|to someone for safekeeping.
{128596}{128671}You are just too good of a teacher.
{128690}{128791}How about giving your old teacher|a clue as to who this might be?
{128796}{128846}You insult yourself, sir.
{128851}{128884}You taught me better.
{128889}{128942}How am I supposed to know who it is?
{128947}{128984}I don't know.
{128989}{129052}It could be anybody|on this damn planet.
{129058}{129106}-It could be a mechanic.|-No.
{129112}{129163}-It could be a concubine.|-No, no.
{129168}{129226}It could be anybody|in communications.
{129231}{129252}Wrong!
{129258}{129351}I hate these things. It's like|it's a test I'm not prepared for.
{129386}{129499}Well, hell, it could even be|our friendly bartender!
{129635}{129688}Please. I made a mistake.
{129805}{129860}Now, give me the original disc. . .
{129865}{129946}. . .then meet me at the teleportation|platform in two hours.
{129975}{130009}Sir.
{130260}{130298}The control bunker's to the right.
{130308}{130331}Three guards left.
{130339}{130408}Two from the guardhouse,|one coming from the north.
{130427}{130465}I'll take the guardhouse.
{132004}{132071}Jonnie, the shooting's|triggered the alarm.
{132089}{132172}Five guards from the south,|heavily armed and moving fast.
{132179}{132213}Between you and the bunker.
{132225}{132254}Jonnie!
{133834}{133916}The man-animals have escaped.|They're running into the city.
{133923}{133996}Send some guards out|and round them up. I'm busy.
{134001}{134059}Don't bother me|with every little detail.
{134064}{134099}Gotta round them up.
{134378}{134404}Psychlos!
{134438}{134469}Psychlos!
{134602}{134685}Greener? Carlo. Explosives are set.|Can I blow the dome?
{134735}{134760}Greener?
{134773}{134821}What's going on? Talk to me!
{134826}{134888}It's Carlo. What's going on?|Talk to me.
{134893}{134923}Hold on!
{134955}{135012}If I don't get Mickey to Psychlo,|they'll send drones.
{135017}{135097}Well, hurry up. Just hurry up,|because I've got company.
{139079}{139099}Here they are.
{139781}{139831}Panther!
{140351}{140410}Hang on. I'm right on his tail.
{141621}{141664}You know what you gotta do.
{142345}{142374}Greener, come on.
{142379}{142417}I've gotta blow this dome now!
{142422}{142478}I'm teleporting Mickey and the bomb.|Hang on.
{142485}{142516}I'm seconds away.
{142828}{142853}Jonnie, come on.
{142859}{142902}They're destroying the bombs.
{142909}{142944}-It's now or never.|-Now!
{142949}{143013}Now, go ahead! Blow the dome!|Go! Go! Go!
{143173}{143240}Teleportation sequence terminated.
{143267}{143303}Interrupting something?
{143317}{143352}Jonnie? Jonnie?
{144147}{144200}Why isn't it coming down?
{144229}{144280}The dome is holding!
{144310}{144362}-It's not working.|-It's only cracked!
{144478}{144545}The dome isn 't broken.|We can 't hold out long.
{144616}{144694}Attention! This is Terl,|your chief of security.
{144712}{144789}Exterminate all man-animals at will.
{144794}{144830}And happy hunting!
{145165}{145212}Run! Run!
{145919}{145950}What's with the dome?
{145979}{146039}Hold on, I'm taking it out now.
{147041}{147075}Help us!
{147084}{147111}They're killing us!
{147302}{147383}We're not gonna make it!|I think we should pull out!
{147875}{147964}I'm blowing the dome. In five.
{147979}{148006}Four.
{148160}{148188}Three.
{148209}{148235}Two.
{148249}{148270}One.
{148322}{148359}Piece of cake.
{149043}{149098}Everyone on the ground now! Go!
{151144}{151208}Teleportation sequence activated.
{151255}{151321}Teleportation sequence activated.
{151336}{151406}Psychlo War Center,|this is a stage 3 alert!
{151412}{151462}I repeat, a stage 3 alert.
{151467}{151537}Initiate the gas drone|extermination sequence.
{151887}{151945}You have been|quite a challenge, rat-brain.
{151950}{152003}You'll make a hell|of a conversation piece. . .
{152009}{152087}. . .when you're stuffed|and hanging on the academy wall.
{153225}{153266}Where's the rest of my gold?
{153276}{153331}I'll exchange it for my woman's life.
{153347}{153425}My life is over, but hers is|of no consequence to you.
{153451}{153531}Thanks for reminding me, rat-brain.|Now, where is it?
{153536}{153591}Trust me, you don't want to do that.
{153597}{153654}Trust me, there's nothing I want more.
{156099}{156142}Carlo came through.
{157581}{157643}Why don't you vaporize me?
{157833}{157856}Leverage.
{157950}{158017}If there are other Psychlo|colonies out there. . .
{158022}{158091}. . .they'll send out gas drones|and exterminate us.
{158109}{158181}But if they learn|that it was your greed. . .
{158200}{158251}. . .that destroyed their Home Planet. . .
{158309}{158368}. . .then all the credits|in the universe. . .
{158386}{158446}. . .won't equal the bounty|on your head.
{158764}{158856}But there is one thing you rat-brains|weren't smart enough to realize.
{158864}{158896}Kill them.
{159233}{159280}I fixed the problem with it.
{159311}{159350}-It works now.|-You imbecile!
{159360}{159410}What kind of game are you playing?
{159421}{159529}Since I'm teaching them our technology,|they made me the head Psychlo.
{159647}{159678}Look at the bright side.
{159706}{159811}You may not be wallowing|in luxury on Psychlo. . .
{159864}{159929}. . .but at least you finally|got your gold.

WAS GOING VERY SMOOTHLY.
WHAT IS THIS?
UH, IT'S, UH...
[CLEARS THROAT]
LIST OF DATES WHEN
I'LL BE DOWNTOWN
SO WE CAN, YOU KNOW,
AVOID RUNNING
INTO EACH OTHER.
IT'S JUST
A SUGGESTED
SCHEDULE.
ARE YOU EVER GOING TO STOP
MAPPING OUT YOUR LIFE?
OH, AND YOU NEVER
PLAN ANYTHING?
I PLAN. YOU MAP.
Boy:
DR. RIEGERT TOLD ME
TO COME IN HERE.
SHOULD I WAIT OUTSIDE?
NO. COME ON IN,
JIMMY. COME ON.
THAT'S FINE.
[SIGHS]
LOOK, IF IT DOESN'T
BOTHER YOU
THAT WE'RE GOING
TO BE RUNNING INTO
EACH OTHER, THEN FINE.
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO MAKE THINGS EASIER,
THAT'S ALL.
ON WHO?
YOU NEVER REALLY
CONSIDERED IT,
DID YOU?
YES. 6 MONTHS AGO, I SAID
I'D THINK ABOUT IT, AND YOU
GO AND RESERVE THE GRANGE HALL
LIKE IT WAS AUTOMATIC
I'D SAY YES IN THE END.
WERE YOU JUST GOING TO
SEND OUT THE INVITATIONS,
OR WERE YOU GOING TO
TELL ME FIRST?
Jimmy: OW!
OH, SHOOT.
I'M SORRY.
ARE YOU OK?
JUST A SECOND, OK?
Man: I JUST THOUGHT--
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT CHANGE
YOUR MIND.
IS THAT SO CRAZY?
NO. CRAZY IS GETTING
A PLOT IN THE
ALTAMONT CEMETERY
WHEN YOU'RE 25.
WELL, YOU HAVEN'T
SEEN THE PLOT, OK?
I MEAN,
IT'S A GREAT PLOT.
THERE'S THIS
BEAUTIFUL MAPLE TREE
ON THE HILL--
EDDIE, I CAN'T HAVE
ONE OF YOUR SCHEDULES
HAUNTING ME. I CAN'T.
NOW, I GOT TO GET
THIS KID SET UP,
OR DR. RIEGERT'S
GOING TO FREAK OUT.
FINE. I'M DUE
AT THE LAB ANYWAY.
Eddie: PERKA, WISCONSIN,
MY HOMETOWN.
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
SOMETIMES I GOT TO FEEL LIKE
THERE WASN'T MUCH TO DO.
BEFORE ANNE DROPPED ME,
I NEVER EVEN CONSIDERED
THE JOB IN NEW YORK.

OF ANOTHER 300 ON THE FURNITURE,
A DEPOSIT OF $200 ON THE PHONE
AND UTILITIES, PLUS THE FINDER'S
FEE FOR RESPONDING TO MY AD,
PLUS I'LL PUT BARS
ON THE WINDOWS,
AND BELIEVE ME,
THEY COST.
YOU CAN BRING IN
ANYTHING YOU WANT.
UH, I DON'T REALLY HAVE
ANY FURNITURE.
I'M NOT VERY DOMESTIC.
CAN YOU COOK?
OF COURSE,
NO SMOKING PERMITTED...
UNLESS IT'S POT.
[CHUCKLES]
BECAUSE I DO SMOKE POT
NOW AND THEN...
AND HASH, TOO,
SOMETIMES...
WELL, MORE OFTEN
SINCE I LOST MY JOB.
I PUT A FICHET LOCK
ON THE ENTRANCE,
SO IT'S ULTRASAFE HERE.
THERE'S A LITTLE LAUNDRY ROOM
IN THE BASEMENT WITH A COUPLE
OF NICE TOP-LOADERS.
WHAT YOU THINK
ABOUT THE BEACH BLANKET FLICKS?
[RATTLES DOOR]
[KEY CLICKS IN LOCK]
WHAT?
OH, UH, THE BUZZER'S OUT,
SO THE GUY TOLD ME TO YELL UP,
BUT I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW,
SINCE YOU'RE HERE, I'LL JUST--
WHAT GUY?
OH, UM...
RAY.
NOBODY NAMED RAY
LIVES HERE.
HEY. WHAT
DO I LOOK LIKE?
LIKE A GUY WHO SOLD ME
A REAL LOUSY DISABILITY
POLICY LAST YEAR.
RAY!
HEY, RAY!
YOU EDDIE BRODSKY?
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE YOU GO.
[CAT MEOWS]
OH, JEEZ.
Ray: YOU THOUGHT
HE'D KNOW MY NAME?
WELL, YEAH.
WELL, I KNOW PEOPLE
ON MY FLOOR, BUT...
BUT NO NAMES.
NO.
THAT WOULD BE
AN INTRUSION...
UNLESS IT WAS SOME GIRL
I WAS HITTING ON.
RIGHT.
BUT I...
I WOULDN'T DO THAT,
NOT ANYMORE.
SO, UM, LISTEN.
YOU MENTIONED
350 FOR--
YEAH, I MEAN, I WORKED
WITH THIS MAGAZINE
ONE TIME, AND, UH...
A LOT OF WOMEN
WORKED THERE, RIGHT?
IT WAS PARADISE.
THEN ONE DAY, BY SOME
BIZARRE COINCIDENCE,
I GOT ON THE ELEVATOR
WITH THESE 4 WOMEN,
AND AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER,
I HAD SLEPT WITH ALL 4,
AND THEY ALL KNEW IT.
LONGEST FUCKING
ELEVATOR RIDE
OF MY LIFE, MAN.
4 WOMEN
IN ONE ELEVATOR?
MM-HMM.
I HAVEN'T BEEN
WITH 4 WOMEN
IN THE SAME TIME ZONE.
HA HA HA HA!
WHAT DO YOU DO?
GENETIC RESEARCH AT
THE WORLD RICE INSTITUTE
UP NEAR COLUMBIA.
THROUGH CROSSBREEDING
AND BASIC GENETIC WORK,
WE TRY TO DEVELOP
BETTER STRAINS OF RICE
FOR PROBLEM CONDITIONS.
SAY THERE'S A DROUGHT
IN THAILAND.
UM, THE RICE
THAT WE DEVELOPED
WILL LAST
SUBSTANTIALLY LONGER
THAN THE NATIVE RICE,
AND, UM, PEOPLE,
UH, WON'T...STARVE.
GOOD PAY?
NO. [CHUCKLES]
NO. IT'S
INTERESTING, THOUGH.
AND THAT'S WHY
YOU MOVED HERE.
WELL, YEAH.
I NEEDED A CHANGE.
SO, WHEN DO YOU WANT
TO MOVE IN?
MOVE IN NOW?
YOU DON'T WANT
ANY REFERENCES?
I BROUGHT
SOME REFERENCES.
IF YOU KNEW YOUR NEIGHBORS
BACK IN WYOMING...
WISCONSIN.
YEAH. RIGHT.
THEN I'M NOT WORRIED.
OH. I'M MEETING SOMEONE.
OH. OH, OK.
Eddie: WHAT ABOUT HIM?
HE'LL BE OK.
BE GOOD FOR THE MICE.
YOU HAVE MICE?
JUST A FEW.
SMALL. YOU ALMOST
CAN'T SEE THEM.

I MOVED IN 3 DAYS LATER.

DR. BANARJEE.
EDWARD, IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU.
ARE YOU
SETTLED HERE YET?
NO, BUT I'M
WORKING ON IT.
VERY GOOD. I'M ANXIOUS
TO GET YOU STARTED
RIGHT.
ON THE INDONESIAN
STRAIN.
I LIKE VERY MUCH
THE SEQUENCING
STRATEGY
YOU DEVELOPED
WITH DR. EAGLE.
I WANT YOU TO APPLY
THE SAME APPROACH
TO THIS
INDONESIAN STRAIN.
WE MUST FIND
ITS RESISTANCE
TO ROOT ROT
FOR TRANSFER
TO THE BRAZILIAN
VARIETY.
I LOOK FORWARD
TO THIS WORK
VERY MUCH, DOCTOR.
I'VE...
I'VE HEARD SUCH--
PLEASE, PLEASE.
NO COMPLIMENTS.
SOON ENOUGH,
THE WORK WILL GROW
TO THE CEILING,
AND YOU WILL CURSE
MY NAME EACH TIME
YOU SEE ME.
ALL THE GENETIC SAMPLES
YOU'LL NEED ARE HERE.
THE CENTRIFUGE
AND INCUBATORS ARE
LOCATED IN THAT ROOM.
DOCTOR,
I HAVE TO TELL YOU,
THE STRATEGY
I DEVELOPED
UNDER DR. EAGLE,
IT WASN'T ONE
I CAME UP WITH.
IT WAS ACTUALLY
A COMPLETE ACCIDENT.
[CHUCKLES]
EDDIE.
YEAH?
A COLLEAGUE OF MINE
ONCE PUT HUMAN NEURON TISSUE
INTO THE WRONG SOLUTION
AND FOUND
THAT THEY MULTIPLIED,
WHICH EVERYBODY BELIEVED
WAS IMPOSSIBLE.
IT WAS
AN IMPORTANT FINDING.
I JUST DIDN'T
WANT TO TAKE CREDIT
THAT WASN'T DUE ME.
WELL, SKILL OR LUCK,
IT WAS YOUR WORK,
ACHIEVED ONLY THROUGH
YOUR METHOD OF WORKING.
WE TAKE BLAME
FOR OUR BAD MISTAKES.
WE MIGHT AS WELL
GET CREDIT FOR
OUR GOOD ONES.
THERE YOU ARE.
THAT'S MINE?
YES.
DO I--DO I LOOK OK?
NOPE.
[MUSIC PLAYING,
LAUGHTER, AND TALKING]
Eddie: WHOSE PARTY
IS THIS?
NO IDEA. A GUY AT WORK
GAVE ME THE ADDRESS.
YOU MEAN,
YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW ANYONE HERE?
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.
YOU'RE WITH ME.
[SQUIRT SQUIRT]
Woman: I'M NEVER GOING TO DO
ANOTHER OPEN CALL AGAIN.
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
THE BITCH THAT GOT THE PART.
PANTS SO TIGHT
YOU COULD READ HER LIPS.
Second woman: I MEAN,
THAT JUST FIGURES.
THAT IS SO TYPICAL.
Man: HAPPINESS?
YEAH, I HAD A BRUSH
WITH HAPPINESS ONCE.
Man: YEAH, WELL,
I'M IN THE BUSINESS,
SO FROM
A PURELY AESTHETIC
POINT OF VIEW,
WE'RE KIND OF
OFF-BASE.
Woman: SO WHAT
DO YOU DO IN FILM?
Man: UH, WE'RE ON
WITH ABC NEWS.
I SHOOT ALL
THEIR WEATHER VIDEO.
THERE'S MORE WOMEN HERE
THAN IN MY ENTIRE HOMETOWN.
YOU GOT A GIRL
BACK THERE?
NO. WE BROKE UP.
WHAT'S YOUR TYPE?
OH, LET ME GUESS.
YOU'RE ONE OF
THESE PICKY BASTARDS
LOOKING FOR MISS
FLAWLESS GORGEOUS.
NO.UH-HUH.
YOU STUDY RICE?
ON A GENETIC LEVEL,
YEAH.
PRETTY WEIRD JOB.
[THUD]
Man: SORRY.
Eddie: WHAT
DO YOU DO?
PERFORMANCE ACT.
IT IS ABOUT
THE CONTINUED HUNGER
FOR RITUAL
IN THE MODERN
INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY.
I JUST DID A PIECE
AT LA MAMBA.
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT?
OH, WHAT I DO
ISN'T "ABOUT."
IT IS SOMETHING
IN ITSELF.
IT'S NOT HUNG UP
WITH THE WHOLE STAR THING.
INSTEAD OF ASKING,
"WHAT IS IT ABOUT?"
YOU COULD ASK,
"WHAT HAPPENS?"
BECAUSE WITH MY STUFF,
IT'S MORE "HOW"
THAN "WHAT."
IN FACT, THE "HOW"
IS THE "WHAT."
WHAT?
AMERICANS ARE OBSESSED
WITH NUMBERS.
IF IT CAN'T BE MEASURED,
IT ISN'T REAL.
WE NEED TO SEE PERCENTAGES
AND POLLS AND CALORIE COUNTS.
IF YOU TELL SOMEONE IT'S
WARM OUT, THEY NEED TO KNOW
THE EXACT DEGREE FAHRENHEIT.
THEY CAN'T JUST GO OUT
AND FEEL IT ON THEIR SKIN
AND SAY, "OH, YEAH. IT'S WARM."
THE NUMBER THAT WE ASSIGN
TO THE TEMPERATURE
BECOMES MORE IMPORTANT,
MORE REAL THAN
THE TEMPERATURE ITSELF.
YEAH, I--I GUESS
PEOPLE DO OVERDO IT
SOMETIMES.
SO, HOW LONG
HAVE YOU LIVED HERE?
SEE THAT?
IT'S THE NUMBER OF YEARS
YOU WANT TO KNOW.
THE NUMBER.
SEE?
OH. UH, EXCUSE ME.
I THINK I SEE
MY DENTIST.
[TOILET FLUSHES]
OH! THE RAINMAN.
[GROANS] 驴QUE TAL, HOMBRE?
UH...JORDAN, RIGHT?
YEAH. YOU USED
TO COME INTO--
ARRIBA.
GREAT PLACE, MAN.
YOU GUYS MAKE THE BEST
MARGARITAS AROUND.
WELL, NOT ANYMORE.
I'M WORKING
AT NEW YORK MAGAZINE
IN LAYOUT.
EXCELENTE.
[WOMAN GROANS]
[VOMITING]
SO...
OH, UH, THIS IS
MY ROOMMATE EDDIE
FROM WISCONSIN.
WISCONSIN, HUH?
THEY MAKE CHEESE
THERE, RIGHT?
YEAH, THEY DO.
Man: JORDANHEIMER!
BRYCEMAN.
[GRUNTING]
[TOGETHER]
AND EVER THE MOOSE SHALL GO.
Jordan: HEY, BRYCE,
I WANT YOU TO MEET RAY,
MY FAVORITE
FORMER MIXOLOGIST,
AND ED,
JUST IN FROM WYOMING.
Jordan: BRYCE IS
A BOND TRADER, TOO.
WYOMING, HUH?
UH, WISCONSIN,
ACTUALLY.
OH, BECAUSE I WAS
GOING TO SAY I'VE NEVER
ACTUALLY BEEN THERE,
BUT I'VE SEEN SOME
VERY BEAUTIFUL PICTURES
OF WYOMING.
BUT WISCONSIN...
I DON'T THINK I'VE
EVEN SEEN PICTURES
OF WISCONSIN.
I MEAN,
WHAT'S THERE?
UH, HOUSE,
GRASS...
CHEESE...
SPACE.
I'M...I'M GOING
TO GET MY COAT.
IS, UH...HE A POET
OR SOMETHING?
Ed: OH, UM...
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO INTERRUPT YOU.
I LEFT MY COAT
[MOANING]IN HERE.
[WOMAN
LAUGHING]IT'S PROBABLY...
I'LL JUST...
[MOANING]NO, DON'T STOP.
I'LL JUST
FIND IT HERE.
OK, THIS...
ALL RIGHT, OK.
JUST...
IF YOU COULD
MOVE YOUR LEG.
OK, GREAT.
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
Ed: I THINK
I DRANK TOO MUCH.
HI.
[BELCH]
[ALARM SOUNDING]
SHH!
[ALARM STOPS]
[HONK HONK]
YOU EVER CONSIDER
JUST HIRING
A SECURITY GUARD?
HEY, YOU LAUGH,
BUT...
HEY, RAY,
YOU OK TO DRIVE?
I'M FINE.
I HAD ALL THE POISE
OF A CACTUS IN THERE.
BAD NIGHT...
THEY HAPPEN.
YOU GOT TO ALLOW
FOR THAT.
I'M OUT OF PRACTICE,
I GUESS.
WHAT HAPPENED TO
YOUR OLD GIRLFRIEND?
SHE BROKE IT OFF,
SAID I WASN'T FLEXIBLE,
SAID SHE FELT
CLAUSTROPHOBIC.
SHE ACTUALLY
GAVE ME A LIST
OF EVERYTHING WRONG
IN OUR RELATIONSHIP.
A LIST?
A LIST.
I DID ASK FOR ONE,
BUT I WAS JOKING.
CLAUSTROPHOBIC.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,
ANYWAY?
[LAUGHING]
YOU KNOW?
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S LIKE SOMETIMES
WE NEED A...
A TRANSLATOR.
[BIRD CAWS]
[COW MOOS]
Anne: I JUST FEEL
CLAUSTROPHOBIC.
Woman: YOU NEED ME
MORE THAN I NEED YOU.
Ed: I NEED YOU
AS MUCH AS ANYONE NEEDS
ANYONE THEY CARE ABOUT.
I'M CONFUSED BECAUSE I
HAVEN'T TAKEN THIS PERSPECTIVE
ON MY NEEDS BEFORE.
I'M LIKE A BALLOON,
AND YOU'RE LIKE A...ROCK.
I'M OPEN TO CHANGE.
YOU'RE AN IMMOVABLE OBJECT
WHO CAN'T SEE THE BENEFIT
OF A LITTLE RISK.
I THINK
YOU'RE WRONG.
I'M RIGHT, AS USUAL.
I JUST THINK WE NEED
TO TAKE SOME TIME
TO RETHINK WHAT
WE'RE DOING TOGETHER,
MAYBE MAKE THINGS
A LITTLE LESS EXCLUSIVE.
THERE'S A GUY AT WORK
WHO MAKES THE ZIPPER
ON MY JEANS MELT.
NO.
YES.
Ed: I DON'T THINK
IT'S HEALTHY FOR US
TO SEE OTHER PEOPLE.
IF I SEE YOU
WITH THAT GUY,
I'LL KILL HIM
AND/OR SEPARATE HIM FROM
HIS MOST PRECIOUS ORGAN
WITH A DULL BUTTER KNIFE.
Anne: LOOK, I JUST
NEED TO TAKE SOME TIME
TO FIGURE THINGS OUT.
I JUST NEED SOME TIME.
IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK?
WAKE UP. IT'S OVER.
Man: MY HEAD HURTS.
MY HEAD HURTS.
CALL ME LATER.
I'LL BE HOME.
IF YOU THINK I'M GOING
TO CHANGE MY MIND,
YOU'RE DREAMING.
YEAH. FINE.
ALL RIGHT. OK.
Man: I CANNOT PUT
INTO WORDS
THE FEELINGS RAGING
WITHIN ME AT THIS MOMENT.
SUFFICE IT TO SAY,
I AM NOW ENVISIONING
PUTTING A GUN TO MY HEAD
THE MOMENT YOU WALK
AWAY FROM ME.
[THUNDER]
BOB, LATTE?
I KNOW A PLACE
AROUND THE CORNER.
[JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING]
OH. OH, THAT'S OK.
I'LL JUST HAVE
A HAMBURGER
AND SOME FRIES.
[SLAVIC ACCENT]
NO, NO, NO, NO.
HAVE SOME PIROGHI,
MUSHROOM BARLEY SOUP,
OR BLINTZES.
BLINTZES?
YOU HAVE SOME.
YOU WILL LIKE THEM.
UM...NO,
THANK YOU, BUT--
YOU ARE NOT
FROM HERE.
YOU HAVE A ACCENT.
I HAVE AN ACCENT?
YEAH. NOT NEW YORK.
NO. UM...WISCONSIN.
IT'S IN CALIFORNIA?
RIGHT.
I'LL HAVE THE BLINTZES
AND THE MUSHROOM
BARLEY SOUP, PLEASE.
GOOD.
YOU'LL ENJOY.
IF YOU DON'T,
TALK TO HIM.
Man: WHAT'S THIS?
"MEYER SAID TODAY
"THAT HE WOULD SOON
GET DOWN TO THE NITTY-GRITTY
OF THIS YEAR'S
CITY BUDGET."
WHAT'S THIS...
THIS NITTY-GRITTY?
UH...NITTY-GRITTY
MEANS, UM...
LIKE, ROLLING UP
YOUR SLEEVES
AND REALLY GETTING
YOUR HANDS DIRTY
IN THE PROCESS.
Man: NO, IT DON'T.
NITTY-GRITTY MEANS
GETTING TO THE FACTS
BEHIND SOMETHING,
THE REAL TRUTH
OF THE MATTER.
Woman: YOU GUYS
GOT IT ALL WRONG.
NITTY-GRITTY
IS THE DETAILS,
THE BASICS,
Woman: GO AHEAD.
READ IT.
THE NUTS AND BOLTS.
NITTY-GRITTY, NOUN ONE:
THE ESSENTIAL SUBSTANCE
OR DETAILS OF A MATTER.
2: BASICS, CRUX.
I GUESS YOU WERE
THE CLOSEST.
YEAH.
IT'S GOOD.
Eddie: DIDN'T I SEE--
WEREN'T YOU AT THAT PARTY
UH, ON MORTON STREET
ABOUT 2 WEEKS AGO?
OH, AT FLAME'S.
FLAME?
THE WOMAN WHO HAD
THE PARTY. FLAME.
HER NAME IS FLAME?
YOU DON'T KNOW HER?
NO. I--
UH, NO. ACTUALLY,
NO, I DON'T. NO.
BUT, I MEAN...
I WAS THERE.
THAT'S, UM...THAT'S
A REALLY WONDERFUL BOOK.
UH, YEAH.
YOU'D THINK THE ARCTIC TUNDRA
WAS PRETTY BARREN, YOU KNOW,
BUT...[CLEARS THROAT]
IT ACTUALLY SUPPORTS
A REMARKABLE VARIETY
OF MOSSES AND LICHEN.
IN FACT, THERE'S
APPROXIMATELY 2,600
PHYLA OF MOSSES
AND ALMOST, UH...
3,900 STRAINS OF--
[COIN RATTLES ON COUNTER]
REALLY?
BYE.
[DOOR SQUEAKS]
NOTHING LIKE TALK
OF A LITTLE ARCTIC FLORA
TO WARM THINGS UP.
DON'T TAKE IT PERSONAL.
I SEE HER.
SHE'S NICE...
BUT YOU NEVER KNOW
WHO IS A NICE GUY.
THANKS...
ELENKA.
IS PLEASURE.
Man: MEN, HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE YOU TRIED TO MEET
A WOMAN IN PUBLIC
ONLY TO HAVE
YOUR GENIAL ADVANCES
BRUTALLY REJECTED?
AND I BET YOU THOUGHT,
"WAIT. I'M JUST A NICE GUY."
BUT LET'S BE HONEST, GUYS.
MOST OF YOU ARE SKUNKS.
WELL, NOW THERE'S ONE SURE WAY
YOU CAN SHOW THE GALS
YOU'RE THE REAL McCOY.
IT'S THE OFFICIAL

YOU'RE ONE
OF THOSE NICE GUYS.
THERE'S A GLUT OF SLOBS
OUT THERE.
DISTINGUISH YOURSELF
AND DO IT TODAY
AT NICE GUYS "R" US.
[ALARM BEEPING]
[ALARM STOPS]
[SHOWER RUNNING]
WE GOT TO TALK
TO THE SUPER
ABOUT THE BOILER.
IT WAS
FREEZING IN HERE
THIS MORNING.
[SOFT SQUEAKS AND SCRATCHING]
Ed: TELL HIM WE HAVE
MICE, TOO, HUH?
HE'LL TELL ME TO BE GLAD
THEY'RE NOT RATS.
LOOK, I'LL PICK UP
SOME GLUE TRAPS
AND PUT THEM DOWN,
AND WHEN THE LITTLE
DIRTBAGS GET STUCK,
YOU JUST...WHAM!
WHACK THEM IN THE HEAD.
IT'S QUICK, PAINLESS.
I COULD MAKE A TRAP.
ED, WE'VE GOT
ENOUGH OF YOUR GADGETS
AROUND HERE ALREADY.
I FEEL LIKE I'M LIVING
WITH THE NUTTY PROFESSOR.
IT'S HOW I RELAX.
MM-HMM.
WHY DON'T THIS ONE RELAX
BY KILLING SOME MICE
IS WHAT I WANT TO KNOW.
YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN.
CAN'T YOU TELL
WHAT SHE'S THINKING?
IF I COULD READ MINDS,
GIRLS WOULDN'T GIVE ME
SO MUCH TROUBLE.
TROUBLE?
WE SHOULD PUT
A TURNSTILE ON
YOUR BEDROOM DOOR.
WE'D MAKE RENT
IN A WEEK.
OH, OH. YOU THINK
THAT'S HEALTHY?
IT'S BETTER
THAN CELIBACY.
NO--YEAH,
BUT THAT'S...
IT'S UNHEALTHY.
I MEAN, I'D LOVE
TO HAVE ONE GIRL.
I REALLY WOULD.
ONE GIRL THAT I COULD
TALK TO EVERY DAY,
YOU KNOW,
MEET HER FAMILY
AND GET HER GIFTS.
MAKE HER DINNER
AT NIGHT, YOU KNOW?
I DON'T KNOW.
I...
I CAN'T DO THAT.
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST CAN'T DO IT.
RAY...
HOW ABOUT
YOU INTRODUCE ME
TO ONE OF
YOUR LADY FRIENDS?
NO. I'M NOT
THE FIXING-UP TYPE,
YOU KNOW?
DID THAT FOR
MY COUSIN FRANK
LAST YEAR,
AND HE STILL
WON'T TALK TO ME.
COME ON.
WHY DON'T YOU DO
WHAT MY SISTER'S
ALWAYS TELLING ME?
GO TO MUSEUMS.
VERY NICE,
THE WOMEN AT MUSEUMS.
THE CLOISTER.
CHECK IT OUT.
YEAH?
MM-HMM.
NAH.
[MONKS CHANTING
AND PIGEONS COOING]
Woman: MARGE,
IF THOSE AREN'T
THE MOST GORGEOUS
CARVINGS!
NICE STONEWORK.
JUST LIKE
MY GARDEN PATIO,
EXCEPT REAL.
I WOULDN'T MIND
GETTING BURIED
LIKE THAT.
THOSE
OLD RELIGIOUS GUYS
HAD IT GOOD.
VERY IMPRESSIVE.
[BELL TOLLING]
OW!
Man:
THAT'S A QUESTION
THAT COMES UP A LOT.
CERTAINLY THERE'S
AN AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL
ELEMENT...
HI.
AT LEAST,
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE
GENERALLY SAY.
ALL MY WORK
IS AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL,
EXCEPT
THE HORSE STUFF.
Second man:
YOUR MATERIALS,
WHERE DO YOU GET THEM?
Woman:
I WAS WONDERING
ABOUT THAT.
First man:
MY WRAP IS FABRICATED
TO MY SPECIFICATIONS
BY ARTISANS IN AUSTRIA.
Second woman:
I SAW YOUR SHOW LAST YEAR,
AND IT WAS REALLY AMAZING.
THIS ONE IS
EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE.
THIS I KNOW.
[CLEARS THROAT]
HI.
HE'S SORT OF GOT
THIS FISHER-PRICE THING
GOING ON, YOU KNOW?
I...IT'S PLAYFUL.
IT'S NOT STUFFY.
I LIKE THAT.
OH, YEAH?
YEAH.
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
I FEEL EXACTLY
THE SAME WAY.
REALLY?
YEAH.
WHAT'S THIS...
THIS STUFF HE'S USING?
OH, IT'S BUBBLEWRAP.
IT'S THE SAME
AS ALWAYS.
THIS IS NOT
BUBBLEWRAP.
I REALLY WOULDN'T
TOUCH THAT
IF I WERE YOU.
[POP]
Man: OH, MY GOD.
Man:
DID YOU SEE THAT?
YOU POPPED MY SCULPTURE.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO.
IT JUST POPPED.
SIR, YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO GO.
I BARELY TOUCHED IT.
I'M SORRY.
YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO GO.
IT'S GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT.
HE POPPED MY SCULPTURE.
IT'S OK,
SWEETIE.
IT'S RUINED.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
WELL, I GET MORE
PRACTICE THAN YOU DO.
WHEN I'M BOGGLED
AT WORK, I COME HERE.
YEAH, BUT YOU'VE GOT,
LIKE, 10 YEARS ON ME.
I MEAN...
THAT'S NOT OLD OLD.
I THINK
LESS THAN YOU.
WHAT?
THINK LESS.
FOR SCIENCE,
THAT'S FINE,
BUT HERE, YOU'RE LOST
IF YOU DON'T STAY LOOSE.
RIGHT.
LOOSE. I'LL HAVE TO
REMEMBER THAT.
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S IT FOR ME.
IT'S HOME.
[CRUNCH]
OH, SHIT.
DO YOU HAVE A PEN?
YEAH.
GOOD, BECAUSE I DON'T,
AND I WANT TO PUT
A NOTE ON THAT CAR
WITH THE JERK'S
PLATE NUMBER.
WOULD YOU HOLD THAT?
THANKS.
WHAT AN IDIOT.
YEAH.
IT WAS, UH...
L24-A...
672, RIGHT.
WHAT A DICK.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
PUTTING MY PHONE NUMBER
DOWN AS A WITNESS.
OH, WELL, THEN I'LL
PUT MINE DOWN, TOO.
OH.
THAT'S THAT.
YEAH.
YOU LOOK FAMILIAR.
YEAH. THE YALTA.
REMEMBER,
THE COFFEE SHOP.
YOU WERE READING
YOUR BOOK.
I WAS THE...
RIGHT, RIGHT.
RIGHT.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
GOOD. GOOD.
HOW YOU DOING?
GOOD.
ANYWAY,
I GOT TO GO.
OH. OK.
BYE...
NATALIE.
BYE...
EDDIE.
EDDIE.
BYE.
YOU BETTER CALL,
OR I'M GOING
TO SMACK YOU.
Ray: ALL RIGHT,
DON'T MAKE ME COME IN THERE.
HI. NATALIE?
Natalie:
WHO IS THIS?
UM, THIS IS, UH...
THIS IS EDDIE BRODSKY.
UM, WE MET, UM,
YESTERDAY
WHEN THAT CAR
BUMPED INTO THE...
OH, RIGHT. HI.
NATALIE'S MY FULL NAME,
BUT NO ONE
CALLS ME THAT.
THEY CALL ME LEE.
OH.
SO DID THAT GUY
CALL YOU
ABOUT HIS CAR,
BECAUSE I DIDN'T
HEAR FROM HIM,
AND I WAS WONDERING
WHAT HAPPENED.
NO, NO. HE DIDN'T.
UM, NO. HE DIDN'T.
I WAS, UM...
I WAS JUST WONDERING...
I, UH...I, WELL,
I THOUGHT YOU WERE...
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
REALLY, UH...
PLEASANT, AND, UH...
I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF YOU'D LIKE TO, UH,
I DON'T KNOW,
HAVE DINNER
OR SEE A MOVIE
OR SOMETHING
SOMETIME.
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO EXPLAIN.
I MEAN, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE NICE.
I MEAN, I HAVE NO IDEA.
YOU MIGHT BE
A COMPLETE JERK,
BUT THE THING IS,
UM...
THAT'S FINE.
REALLY, IT'S FINE.
UM, IT WAS...
IT WAS JUST A SHOT
IN THE DARK.
LOOK, SO,
UH, TAKE CARE.
THANKS. BYE-BYE.
REALLY PLEASANT?
Eddie: I KNOW.
I KNOW.
SMOOTH.
YEAH. THAT'S...
THAT'S GREAT.
I.D.?
SOMEDAY I'LL BE HAPPY
I LOOK SO YOUNG.
MORE THAN YOU KNOW.
WISCONSIN.
MAKE CHEESE THERE,
DON'T THEY?
YEP, THEY DO.
WHAT KIND? AMERICAN?
YEAH, AMERICAN.
YELLOW AMERICAN
OR WHITE AMERICAN?
ALL AMERICAN.
YELLOW AND WHITE?
UH-HUH.
WHAT DO THEY PUT
IN THAT YELLOW TO
MAKE IT THAT COLOR?
YOU KNOW, I...
I REALLY...I REALLY
COULDN'T TELL YOU.
YOU REALLY
FROM WISCONSIN?
* WHEN I'M ALL ALONE
AT NIGHT *
* I TURN ON THE RADIO *
* I LISTEN TO SOME MUSIC *
* OR I TRY TO FIND
A TALK SHOW *
* JUST BETWEEN
ME AND YOU *
* EVERY WORD THEY SAY
IS TRUE *
* SOMEONE SPEAKS TO ME *
* SOMEONE TRIES
TO TELL ME SOMETHING *
* I BELIEVE THEM *
* I BELIEVE IN THE POWER
OF THE SPOKEN WORD *
* EVERYTHING
THAT I HAVE EVER HEARD *
* MAKES SENSE TO ME *
* AND IF YOU GOT
A BETTER WAY THEN *
* SET ME DOWN
AND TELL ME WHAT TO DO *
* AND I'LL *
* BELIEVE YOU, TOO *
* I'LL *

[APPLAUSE]
I THINK I WAS
A LITTLE OFF,
BUT IT WAS VERY NICE.
HI.
DID YOU HEAR US?
YEAH. IT WAS GOOD.
WELL, WE COULD
ALWAYS USE
SOME WORK.
LISTEN, UM, CAN I
BUY YOU A DRINK?
OH. UH...
SHALL WE MEET
OUT FRONT
IN ABOUT 10 MINUTES?
YEAH. THAT'S FINE.
YOU ARE PERSISTENT,
AREN'T YOU?
I CAN TAKE NO
FOR AN ANSWER.
YOU WANT TO SEE
A MOVIE?
YEAH--UH, NO!
LOOK, I AM
IDIOTICALLY BUSY
RIGHT NOW
WITH, UM, REHEARSALS
AND STUFF.
I'M REALLY
NOT A FUN PERSON
TO BE AROUND
RIGHT NOW.
OH. OH...OK.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT YOU.
WELL, UM, I'M 25.
I JUST MOVED HERE
FROM WISCONSIN.
UM, I EARN A LIVING
STUDYING THE GENETICS
OF RICE PLANTS,
EXCITING AND INTENSELY
DANGEROUS LINE OF WORK.
THANKS, BUT I CAN'T.
OK.
SURE.
THANKS FOR THE MUSIC.
HEY.
I'M GLAD
THAT YOU LIKED US.
I DO.
Elenka: TOO MANY CARS
EVERYWHERE.
CITY'S GOING TO CRUMBLE
UNLESS EVERYBODY
GETS LIKE CHINA,
DRIVES BICYCLES.
WHAT ABOUT THE MAYOR?
HE COULD HAVE
HIS BIG BICYCLE,
OR ELSE WHOLE CITY'S
GOING TO CRUMBLE.
REMEMBER WHAT I SAY.
I GOT IT.
WHY DON'T YOU COME
TO THE BAKE SALE?
MEET A NICE
UKRAINIAN GIRL
THERE.
HAVEN'T BEEN TO CHURCH
IN YEARS, ELENKA.
I THINK I FORGOT
HOW TO PRAY.
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO PRAY
AT THE BAKE SALE.
YOU HAVE ONLY
TO LIKE CAKE.
I DON'T THINK SO,
BUT THANKS, ELENKA.
[THUNDER]
WELL, IT'S FIXED.
CONNECTOR WAS LOOSE.
FREE BREAKFAST
ALL WEEK FOR YOU.
WHAT IS THIS
IN THE PAPER?
IT SAYS ABOUT
THE TOLLBOOTH ROBBERY.
"THE TOLLBOOTH
ATTENDANT SAID
"THAT AFTER HE GAVE
THE THIEVES THE MONEY,
THEY WERE OUT OF THERE
LICKETY-SPLIT."
WHAT IS
THIS LICKETY-SPLIT?
Lee: FAST. QUICK.
HE DIDN'T WASTE
ANY TIME.
UH, WHAT DO YOU SAY
TO DINNER ON FRIDAY?
UH, I SAY, UM...
I'LL COOK.
OK.
SO...
DO YOU HAVE
AN ADDRESS?
UM...YEAH.
I DO.
I...I...
OK. UH,
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.
OK.
[SMOKE ALARM SOUNDING]
[ALARM CONTINUING]
[ALARM STOPS]
Ray:
WHOA, TAKE IT EASY.
THOUGHT YOU WERE
LEAVING.
WELL, CAN'T I GET
A LOOK AT HER?
YOU GOT TO LEAVE
AS SOON AS
SHE COMES, OK?
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
OH, GREAT. LOOK.
SHE'S LATE ALREADY.
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT, 5 MINUTES?
HA HA HA!
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I KNOW.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'VE GOT TO
RELAX.
IT'S JUST...
IT'S LIKE...
SHE'S, LIKE,
THE FIRST GIRL
THAT I'VE MET
WHERE I FEEL
LIKE SOMETHING
COULD ACTUALLY
HAPPEN WITH,
YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN?
MM-HMM. ED, SHE'S
THE ONLY GIRL
YOU'VE MET.
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THERE'S--
THERE'S THAT.
SHOULD I STAY
AT ERICA'S TONIGHT?
IT'S OUR FIRST
DATE, RAY.
YOU GOT TO ALLOW
FOR THAT.
I WOULD.
YOU WOULD ALLOW
FOR THINGS
THAT I CAN'T
EVEN PRONOUNCE.
OH! DIDN'T
YOU EVER DO A GIRL
ON THE FIRST DATE?
DO?
RAY, I DO LAUNDRY.
I DO DISHES.
I DON'T DO WOMEN.
I MEAN,
SEX IS NOT...
A TRANSITIVE ACT,
YOU KNOW.
I MEAN, IT'S...IT'S
AN INTRANSITIVE ACT.
YOU TALK TO HER
LIKE THAT,
SEX WILL BE
A NONEXISTENT ACT.
[DOORBELL BUZZES]
THAT'S HER. OK.
UM...
GET YOUR COAT.
ACT LIKE
YOU'RE LEAVING.
RIGHT.
HEY, HOW ARE YOU?
YOU LOOK GREAT.
HI. COME IN.
WOW, YOU LOOK GREAT.
THAT'S FUNNY.
THAT'S VERY FUNNY.
HERE WE GO.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
[DOOR OPENS]
HI. LEE, RIGHT?
Lee: THAT'S ME.
I'M EDDIE'S ROOMMATE RAY
WHO'S JUST LEAVING.
OH, VIOLIN.
HEY.
HI.
WILL YOU BE
ENTERTAINING?
UH, I JUST HAD
REHEARSAL.
IN A BAND?
YEAH.
BYE, RAY.
RIGHT.
WELL, GOOD-BYE.
BYE.
HERE, UM...
LET ME GET YOUR COAT.
SO HOW DID YOU
AND RAY HOOK UP?
RAY PUT AN AD OUT
IN THE NEWSPAPER,
AND I ANSWERED IT.
AND YOU GET ALONG?
YEAH, WE REALLY DO.
WE GET ALONG.
WE SORT OF BALANCE
EACH OTHER OUT,
I GUESS.
YEAH?
MM-HMM. HE'S, UM...
HE KIND OF JUST GOES
FOR WHAT HE WANTS,
YOU KNOW,
AND I KIND OF...
HOLD BACK MORE,
I GUESS, SOMETIMES.
YOU SURE TRIED
TO GET TO KNOW ME.
WHAT DOES
THAT TELL YOU?
THAT YOU'RE LYING.
WELL, THANK YOU.
[CAT MEOWS]
OOH.
KEYS,
COME HERE.
NO, IT'S OK.
UM, THIS WILL SOUND
PRETTY STUPID
PROBABLY,
BUT, UM...
I DON'T KNOW,
YOU JUST SEEMED LIKE
YOU KNEW
WHO YOU WERE,
YOU KNOW,
AND YOU DIDN'T
MAKE ANY BONES
ABOUT THAT,
AND I FIND THAT
REALLY...
UM...
COMPELLING.
[CAT REGURGITATING]
OH, GOD. HERE.
LET ME HAVE HER.
YOU KNOW WHAT,
IT'S OK.
IT'S...UH,
IT'S JUST
A FURBALL. UM...
LET ME GET
YOUR NAPKIN.
DAMN.
UM...
UM...
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU BRUSH HER
EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS,
IT KEEPS HER
FROM EATING HER OWN HAIR
WHEN SHE CLEANS HERSELF.
OH, I...
I HAVEN'T HAD
A CAT BEFORE,
SO I...
[CAT CRIES]
KEYS.
NO, IT'S OK.
SHE'S NOT GOING
TO DO IT AGAIN.
IT'S OK.
LOOK, I'M FINE.
YOUR CARPET'S
GOT A STAIN...
AND WITH THIS ONE,
THAT MIGHT BE
AN IMPROVEMENT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE TOTALLY
RIGHT.
SO WHEN
DID YOU GUYS
START UP THE BAND?
WE MET IN COLLEGE.
WE HAD A SIMILAR
WAY OF THINKING,
SLIGHTLY...
BENT?
YEAH.
I'D LIKE TO THINK
THAT IF RAYMOND CARVER
AND HOAGY CARMICHAEL
GOT TOGETHER,
THEY WOULD HAVE
SOUNDED LIKE US.
[EDDIE
CLEARS THROAT]
SO, UH...
WHEN DID YOU GET
INTO THE VIOLIN?
OH, MY PARENTS SENT ME
TO MUSIC CAMP.
MUSIC CAMP?
YEAH. YOU KNOW,
SENDING THE KIDS
UP TO THE MOUNTAINS
SO THAT THEY
CAN SPEND ALL DAY
PRACTICING THEIR SCALES
IN A TENT THAT SMELLS
LIKE RACCOON PEE.
NO SWIMMING
OR HIKING
OR ANYTHING?
OH, NO.
THAT WOULD BE FUN.
NO, IF YOU ACTUALLY
WANTED TO HAVE FUN,
THEY ACTED LIKE
YOU WEREN'T SERIOUS
ABOUT MUSIC.
I HATED IT.
DO YOU MIND IF I...
NO. I MEAN...
SURE, YOU CAN. SURE.
SO WHY DID YOU
STICK WITH IT, THEN?
WELL...IN HIGH SCHOOL,
THEY HAD A TALENT SHOW,
AND I DECIDED
TO WRITE SOMETHING,
AND, UH, IT WAS ONE OF
THOSE JONI MITCHELL THINGS
WHERE SHE TRIED TO CRAM
AN ENTIRE RELATIONSHIP
INTO A 3-MINUTE SONG.
IT WAS BAD.
IT WAS REALLY BAD.
BUT I JUST KEPT WRITING.
YOU KNOW,
LITTLE SONGS ABOUT GUYS
AND GAMES OF BACKYARD...
LAWN DART...
BESIDES THE FRENCH HORN,
THE VIOLIN HAS
THE MOST COMPLEX OVERTONES
OF ANY WESTERN INSTRUMENT.
LIKE THE FLUTE.
IF YOU SAW THE FLUTE
ON A SPECTROGRAPH,
IT WOULD BE, LIKE,
THIS ONE SPIKE,
WHEREAS THE VIOLIN
HAS ALL THESE...
OTHER, UH, OVERTONES.
YOU SMELL
LIKE COOKIES.
IT'S A PERFUME
THAT I MADE MYSELF...
WITH VANILLA AND MUSK
AND...AND AMBER.
[CAT MEOWS]
[MEOW]
[MEOW]
[MEOW]
[MEOW]
[MEOW]
[MEOW]
[MEOW]
[MEOW]
[MEOW]
OH, GREAT.
CAN YOU
TAKE HER, PLEASE?
OH! A GLUE TRAP.
THAT'S AWFUL!
WHY...
WHY IS THAT AWFUL?
LOOK AT THEM.
THEY'RE TERRIFIED.
YOU WANT
TO TAKE THEM HOME?
NO.
WELL, I SHOULD
PROBABLY PUT THEM
OUT OF THEIR MISERY.
HOW ARE YOU
GOING TO DO THAT?
I'LL JUST FIND SOMETHING.
I'LL JUST WHACK THEM
OVER THE HEAD.
WHAT ABOUT
LETTING THEM GO?
NO. THIS STUFF'S
LIKE DENT-U-CREME.
THEY'RE STUCK.
BUT DO YOU HAVE TO
KILL THEM?
WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST,
REHAB?
I MEAN...
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
I DON'T KNOW.
I WOULDN'T
HAVE PUT DOWN
ONE OF
THOSE GLUE TRAPS
IN THE FIRST PLACE.
WELL, UM,
RAY PUT THESE DOWN.
I DIDN'T PUT THESE DOWN.
UM...
I KNOW.
IT'LL BE PAINLESS.
I'LL JUST...I'LL JUST
TURN OFF THE PILOT LIGHT
IN THE OVEN,
AND I'LL JUST...
YOU'RE GOING TO
GAS THEM.
NO.
LOOK, COULD YOU JUST...
COULD YOU JUST
TAKE HER
IN THE OTHER ROOM, OK?
[MEOW]
[CLANG]
[CAT GROWLS]
[CLANG]
[GROWL]
SO...
UH...
YOU WANT
SOME COFFEE?
OR I HAVE
SOME BEN & JERRY'S.
NO. I THINK I SHOULD
PROBABLY GO, I THINK.
YOU'RE LEAVING?
YEAH. I JUST FEEL
A LITTLE FUNNY.
OH.
OK.
UM...
IS IT ABOUT
THE MICE, BECAUSE--
NO. IT WAS A NORMAL
THING TO DO...
I GUESS.
BYE.
BAD DATE, HUH?
I SAW YOU KNOCKED OUT
ON THE COUCH
WHEN I CAME IN.
NO. IT WAS
A GOOD DATE...
THEN I COMMITTED
2 MURDERS.
MICE.
OH. WE GOT 'EM?
YEAH, WE GOT 'EM.
PUT A DAMPER
ON THINGS, HUH?
LET'S JUST SAY
FIRST DATES GO BETTER
WHEN NOTHING DIES.
Woman: MORNING.
HEY.
HOW YOU DOING?
HEY.
Woman: HELLO?
MOM?
EDDIE.
HOW ARE YOU, HONEY?
AAH! AAH.
UH, I'M FINE.
HOW ARE YOU DOING, MOM?
WHEN ARE YOU
COMING BACK, EDDIE?
THIS IS
WHERE I WORK, MOM.
IT'S NOT A VACATION
I COME BACK FROM.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU CAN'T GET WORK
AROUND HERE.
MOM, LET'S NOT
GO INTO THIS, OK?
I'M DRINKING TEA
WITH LEMON AND HONEY.
THAT'S GOOD.
THAT WILL HELP, RIGHT?
COULDN'T HURT.
JUST MAKE SURE
YOU GET SOME REST.
NO GALLIVANTING
AROUND TOWN, OK?
NO, I WOULDN'T
GALLIVANT, MOM.
I AVOID ACTIVITIES
I CAN'T SPELL.
VERY FUNNY.
[INTERCOM BUZZES]
UH, MOM, LOOK,
THAT'S THE DOOR.
I'VE GOT TO GO, OK?
I'LL TALK TO YOU SOON.
OK. REMEMBER,
NO GALLIVANTING.
RIGHT. OK. I'LL TALK
TO YOU, MOM. BYE.
[COUGHING]
YES? HELLO?
Man: THIS IS
THE SANITATION
DEPARTMENT,
OFFICER SANCHEZ.
I'M LOOKING FOR
EDWARD BRODSKY.
UH, IS THERE
A PROBLEM...OFFICER?
THERE'S A PROBLEM
WITH YOUR GARBAGE.
IF YOU COULD
COME DOWN, SIR.
UH, YEAH. OK.
I'M COMING.
[COUGHING]
HI. WHAT'S UP?
THIS YOUR GARBAGE, SIR?
I DON'T KNOW.
WHY?
THIS WAS INSIDE.
OK. IT'S MINE.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
I FOUND THIS
IN THE TRASHCAN
ON THE STREET.
IT'S ILLEGAL TO PUT
YOUR HOUSEHOLD TRASH
INTO A CITY GARBAGECAN.
UH, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT A MINUTE.
I PUT IT OUT HERE.
I PUT IT IN THIS ONE.
IT WAS RIGHT HERE.
JUST LIKE THAT.
THAT'S NOT
WHERE I FOUND IT.
YEAH, WELL, HOMELESS GUYS
GO THROUGH THIS STUFF
ALL THE TIME
FOR BOTTLES AND CANS...
IT WAS TWIST TIED.
50 BUCKS!
THIS IS NUTS!
HEY. EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME, SIR.
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
I'M NOT GOING TO PAY THIS
SO YOU CAN FILL
SOME TICKET QUOTA.
LOOK, I DON'T CARE
IF YOU PAY IT,
EAT IT,
OR ROLL IT
INTO TOILET PAPER.
HEY, WATCH IT!
Man: GO AHEAD!
TRY SOMETHING!
OH, CHRIST.
YEAH, YEAH.
GO AHEAD, MISTER.
I'VE GOT YOU COVERED.
YOUR EVERY
MOVE IS BEING
CAPTURED...
COME ON.
Ed: WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?
CAN I TALK TO YOU?
Man: YOU GOING TO BEAT UP
THE GIRL, TOO?
[CRUNCH]
JESUS.
COME ON.
LET'S GET INSIDE.
Man: IT'LL BE LIVE
AT 5:00. YOU BETTER
BELIEVE IT, MAN.
OH! VERY NICE!
WHAT A NICE CIVICS
LESSON, OFFICER.
THANK YOU.
GET OUT OF HERE.
YOU WANT TO BE A STAR
ON TONIGHT'S NEWS?
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
YOU'RE NOT TOUCHING
MY GARBAGE.
YOU PUT THAT BOOK AWAY!
LEE: WELL, THAT
WASN'T TOO SMART,
WAS IT?
Ed: WHAT?
MESSING
WITH THAT COP.
HE WAS BEING A JERK.
HE'S A COP.
I THOUGHT I
WAS CYNICAL.
YOU, CYNICAL?
ME, CYNICAL.
WHAT DID YOU THINK
THIS PLACE WOULD BE
LIKE...
WISCONSIN WITH MORE PEOPLE
AND A SUBWAY?
IS IT UNREASONABLE
TO WANT TO PUT OUT
MY GARBAGE WITHOUT
FEAR OF ARREST?
YOU GOT TO DEAL
WITH NEW YORK
ON ITS OWN TERMS,
OR YOU CAN
FORGET ABOUT IT.
DOES THE SAME
GO FOR YOU?
LOOK, I, UH, I'M
INVOLVED WITH SOMEONE,
AND THAT'S WHY I...
OH, GOD.
OOH.
[COUGHS]
YOU KNOW, IT USED
TO ALWAYS DEPRESS ME
THAT EVERY
EXPERIENCE IN LIFE,
YOU KNOW,
ONCE IT HAPPENED,
WAS GONE FOREVER,
NEVER TO BE REPEATED
OR RELIVED.
SINCE I GOT HERE,
THAT'S STARTING TO
FEEL LIKE A BONUS.
YOU'RE SERIOUS,
THOUGH, AREN'T YOU?
ABOUT NEW YORK OR--
NO. ABOUT THE PAST.
YEAH.
I'D LIKE, FOR ONE MINUTE,
TO REMEMBER WHAT THE WORLD
FELT LIKE WHEN I WAS 6.
SEEING THE WORLD LIKE IT
ENDED AT THE TOWN LINE.
OR WHAT IT FELT LIKE
BEING IN LOVE WHEN I WAS 15.
IT CAN'T COME CLOSE.
WAS IT LOVE, THOUGH?
NICE FEELING....
WHATEVER IT WAS.
WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST TELL ME THAT
YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND?
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S NOT EXACTLY
A PERFECT RELATIONSHIP.
HE'S REALLY TALENTED.
WE MET UP AT THIS WORKSHOP
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE
LAST SUMMER,
AND HE TAUGHT ME A LOT.
HE HELPED ME
WITH MY WRITING, AND...
LOOK...
ARE YOU
ALWAYS LIKE THIS?
OW, OW!
JUST KIDDING.
OH, MY GOD.
I'M GOING TO
GET YOUR COLD.
TELL ME YOU'VE NEVER
KISSED A GUY WITH
A COLD BEFORE.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I CAN'T DO THIS.
I CAME HERE TO TELL YOU
THAT I HAD A BOYFRIEND,
AND NOW I'M
ON THE KITCHEN FLOOR
WITH YOU, AND, UH...
LOOK, I REALLY LIKE YOU.
I HAVE TO GO.
[DOOR CLOSES]
YES. HERE.
THIS BASE PAIR
CORRESPONDS TO
THIS SEQUENCE.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
[KNOCKING]
OH, NO.
WHAT IS IT?
THE CHILDREN.
THEY COME HERE
ONCE A YEAR
FOR A TOUR.
Dr. Banarjee:
SO THIS IS D.N.A.
IT IS FORMALLY KNOWN
AS DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID.
IT IS MADE UP OF
A SERIES OF BUILDING BLOCKS.
THERE'S ADENINE AND THYMINE
AND GUANINE AND CYTOSINE,
WHICH WE REPRESENT
WITH THE LETTERS--
Boy: IS THAT THIAMINE,
LIKE THAT STUFF
THEY PUT IN CEREAL,
IT'S FORTIFIED WITH?
Dr. Banarjee:
NO. NO. THAT'S THIAMINE.
THAT'S A VITAMIN.
THIS IS THYMINE,
A NUCLEIC ACID.
UH...THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT.
IT'S, UH, IT'S...
DOCTOR?
UH, YES, EDDIE.
MAYBE I COULD
TAKE A CRACK.
OH, BE MY GUEST.
HI. I'M EDDIE.
WHAT WE DO HERE
IS WE STUDY D.N.A...
UM, WHICH IS
A LIST OF INSTRUCTIONS,
LIKE THE ONES YOU MIGHT FIND
IN A BOX OF BROWNIES.
NOW, D.N.A. IS A RECIPE
FOR MAKING ALL LIVING THINGS,
LIKE A BANANA OR A WHALE
OR ALL OF YOU GUYS.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TEACH SOMEDAY.
NO. NO.
I LIKE RESEARCH.
ANYWAY,
IT'S THE ONE THING
THAT'S GOING RIGHT
FOR ME NOW.
OH? WHY IS THAT?
OH, I'VE--I'VE STOPPED
TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT.
IT'S LIKE,
WITH SOME THINGS,
THE MORE I ANALYZE THEM,
THE LESS CLEAR
THEY BECOME.
I USED TO THINK THAT
IF I STUDIED ANYTHING
ENOUGH,
I COULD UNDERSTAND IT,
BUT LATELY I'VE JUST
FELT LIKE SOME MYSTERIES
ARE PERMANENT.
TO HER, I BET YOU'RE
AS MUCH OF A PUZZLE.
Man: 1, 2, 3; 2, 2, 3.

* I LEFT MY MAP
ON THE ROOF OF MY CAR *
* I NEED SOMEBODY
TO MAKE IT SEEM WORTH IT *
* TO SEARCH FOR A LIGHT SWITCH
OR REACH FOR A STAR *
Man: * WOULD YOU
BE MY CLOCK *
* IF I PROMISED NOT TO HANG YOU
TOO CLOSE TO THE WINDOW *
* OR THE PICTURE
OF THE POPE? *
* I WON'T SET YOU BACK,
AND I WON'T PUSH YOU FORWARD *
* I JUST WANT TO LOOK
IN YOUR FACE AND SEE HOPE *
* THERE'S SO MUCH TO DO
AND SO MUCH TIME TO DO IT *
* I TRY HARD TO CONCENTRATE,
TRY HARD TO THINK *
* I'VE GOT A NEW OVEN
THAT COOKS FOOD IN 12 SECONDS *
* NOW I'M EATING SO QUICK
I'VE GOT HOURS TO DRINK *
All: * TIME'S UNPREDICTABLE *
* JUST WHEN YOU THINK THAT
YOU'VE LEARNED HOW TO SAVE IT *
* YOU SPEND ALL DAY
ON HOLD *
* I NEED SOMEONE
WHO CAN SHOW ME THE DIFFERENCE *
* BETWEEN USING IT WISELY
AND JUST GROWING OLD *
I'M SORRY.
IT'S O.K.
SEE YOU TOMORROW, LEE.
BYE, AL.
SEE YOU TOMORROW.
GOOD LUCK.
HEY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
OK. I CAN'T DO THIS
ANYMORE.
ED, SHE'S ONLY ONE GIRL.
SHE'S NOT SOME MAGIC BULLET
THAT'S GOING TO MAKE
YOUR LIFE RIGHT.
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
I NEVER SAID THAT.
WELL, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO.
LOOK, YOU'RE HEALTHY.
YOU LIKE YOUR JOB.
YOU HAVE AN EXCEPTIONAL
ROOMMATE.
YOU KNOW, I'D LIKE
TO SEE YOU WITHOUT
A FUCKING GIRL,
SEE WHAT IT WOULD
FUCKING DO TO YOU.
I'M STARTING TO TALK
LIKE YOU.
FIRST OF ALL, RAY OBERGON
BEING WITH A WOMAN
IS LIKE A FACT OF NATURE,
LIKE GRAVITY,
LIKE THE SUPERIORITY OF
BASKETBALL OVER FOOTBALL
AS A TEAM SPORT.
WOW, ARE YOU DELUDED.
CAN I BE BUSYBODY
AND SAY SOMETHING?
Ed: LIKE YOU NEED
PERMISSION NOW?
I READ ONCE,
YEARS AGO, WHEN GREAT
PIANO PLAYER DIES,
ARTHUR RUBINSTEIN,
ON HIS LAST BIRTHDAY,
SOMEBODY ASK HIM
HOW COME THAT
HE LIVE SO LONG,
AND HE TELL THEM
WHEN HE WAS ABOUT 20
AND THE GIRL WHO HE LOVED
THE MOST IN LIFE LEFT HIM,
HE IS SO DEPRESSED,
HE GOES TO HIS BEDROOM
AND TRIES TO HANG HIMSELF,
BUT IT DOESN'T WORK.
ROPE, IT BREAKS
OR SOMETHING,
SO HE WALKS
TO THE STREET HE LIVES ON,
AND SUDDENLY EVERYTHING
LOOKS DIFFERENT.
FROM THAT DAY ON,
HE DECIDE, NEVER EXPECT
ANYTHING FROM LIFE,
ONLY TO TAKE A BIG BITE
WHATEVER COMES HIS WAY,
SO HE WAS
NEVER DISAPPOINTED.
Man:
ARE YOU TELLING
THAT STORY AGAIN?
IT'S NOT A STORY.
IT'S THE TRUTH.
IT'S WHAT HE SAID.
SO MANY TIMES.
SO MANY TIMES.
[ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS]
EDDIE, IT'S LEE.
WE'RE PLAYING AT A PLACE
CALLED BROWNIE'S
ON AVENUE 8 TONIGHT.
CAN YOU COME?
I'D LIKE TO TALK.
HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOU OK?
ERICA SAID...
ERICA SAID
SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO SEE ME AGAIN.
OH.
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
THIS UPSET ABOUT A--
WELL, I AM.
I MEAN, I ACTUALLY
LET MYSELF...
FORGET IT.
IT'S OVER.
LOOK, I'M GOING TO GO HEAR
LEE PLAY AT THIS BAR.
WHY DON'T YOU COME ALONG?
BE GOOD
FOR YOU TO GET OUT
OF THE APARTMENT.
TAKE YOUR MIND OFF...
OK.
GET THAT SHIT
AWAY FROM ME.
I DON'T WANT TO SEE
ONE FUCKING BIT OF IT.
I EVEN LET HER PUT HER
POTPOURRI IN MY GODDAMN
UNDERWEAR DRAWER.
* YOU TWISTED YOUR ANKLE,
I CARRIED YOU *
* YOU GOT A DIVORCE,
SO I MARRIED YOU *
* YOU FELL OFF A CLIFF,
SO I BURIED YOU *
* I WISH THERE WERE MORE
BAD TIMES TO SEE YOU THROUGH *
Lee: * YOU NEVER HAD RABIES,
YOU NEVER GAINED WEIGHT *
* YOU NEVER CAME HOME
WITH A SCAR *
* YOU NEVER DRANK POISON,
YOU WATCHED WHAT YOU ATE *
* YOU NEVER SO MUCH
AS PUT A SCRATCH ON MY CAR *
Al: * SO MANY THINGS
DID GO WRONG *
* BUT THE LIST
IS NOT LONG ENOUGH *
* NOT ENOUGH BAD THINGS
TO FILL UP A SONG *
Both: * YOU TWISTED YOUR ANKLE,
I CARRIED YOU *
* YOU GOT A DIVORCE,
SO I MARRIED YOU *
* YOU FELL OFF A CLIFF,
SO I BURIED YOU *
* I WISH THERE WERE MORE
BAD TIMES TO SEE YOU THROUGH *
WHAT WAS THAT?
[MUSIC ENDS]
THANKS. THANKS VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
MAN, YOU THINK
I SHOULD CALL HER?
YEAH, YOU SHOULD
DEFINITELY CALL HER.
YOU GOT
ANY CHANGE?
YEAH.
HEY.
Ed: HEY. YOU GUYS
SOUNDED GREAT.
THANKS.
UM, REMEMBER RAY?
YEAH. HEY, RAY.
HI. IT'S VERY
UNIQUE STUFF.
HUH. LOOK, I GOT
TO WRAP UP AND GET PAID,
AND DO YOU WANT TO
MEET ME OUTSIDE IN,
LIKE, 10 MINUTES?
YEAH. YEAH. OK.
OK.
WHAT THE HELL'S
THE MATTER WITH YOU?
WHAT?
UNIQUE?
ALL RIGHT. ORIGINAL.
I KNOW YOU GOT TO TALK,
SO I'M GOING TO HEAD OUT.
I WANT A FULL REPORT.
YEAH. OK. SURE.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
YOU GOING TO BE OK?
I GUESS.
LEE.
I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU.
YEAH.
WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO YOU, OK?
NOT HERE. NOT NOW.
YOU CAN CALL ME.
Man: YOU CAN'T TALK
TO ME FOR 5 MINUTES?
WHAT DO YOU GOT TO DO
THAT'S SO IMPORTANT?
I TOLD YOU
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO YOU.
IS THIS WHO YOU'RE
RUSHING TO SEE?
WHAT, ARE YOU
FUCKING THIS GUY?
WHAT?
AND WHAT
IF I WAS?
ARE YOU OK, LEE?
Man: HEY.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?
I LOVE YOU.
YOU JUST FUCKED UP.
[KARATE YELL]
Ed: GET HIM, RAY!
LISTEN TO ME!
OH. ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT?
Ed: COULDN'T YOU HAVE JUST SAID,
"NO, I'M NOT SLEEPING WITH HIM.
I'VE NEVER SLEPT WITH HIM.
I WOULDN'T DREAM
OF SLEEPING WITH HIM"?
I'M SORRY.
I THINK HE
REDESIGNED MY JAW.
BOYFRIEND?
YEAH--NO!
HE USED TO BE.
WELL, HE'S A SWEET GUY.
ARE YOU OK?
YEAH.
WHO'S THE VIKING?
Lee: HE USED TO BE
A GOLDEN GLOVES.
I'M HEADING HOME.
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?
IT'S JUST A PLACE I LIKE
TO GO TO...SOMETIMES.
Lee: HE'S REALLY NOT
A BAD GUY.
OH, NO. HE'S A DOLL.
WHAT'S THE STORY
WITH YOU TWO?
WHY DID YOU ASK
TO SEE ME TONIGHT?
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?
OK. OK.
YOU SMOKE?
YEAH, WELL,
I GOT HYPNOTIZED
LAST YEAR,
AND I WAS FINE
UNTIL NOW.
IN THE LAST YEAR,
RAPHAEL AND I MUST
HAVE SPLIT UP, LIKE,
A DOZEN TIMES,
BUT LAST WEEK,
THAT WAS IT.
HATING SOMEONE
ALL THE TIME
WHO YOU USED TO LOVE
PART OF THE TIME...
IT JUST TOOK ME
A WHILE TO SEE IT.
SO...WHY DID YOU
WANT TO SEE ME?
I WANTED TO SEE YOU.
WHY IS THAT
SO HARD TO SAY?
I'VE NEVER BEEN
WITH A GUY LIKE YOU.
WH-WHAT'S A GUY
LIKE ME LIKE?
LET ME ASK YOU--
HAVE YOU EVER EVEN
CONSIDERED SEEING
A THERAPIST?
BEFORE I MET YOU?
OOH, THANKS,
BUT THERE, YOU SEE?
SEE WHAT?
IT'S JUST
THAT YOU ARE SO...
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU'RE SO...NORMAL.
NORMAL.
THAT--THAT REALLY SUCKS.
I'M WORRIED
WHAT IT WILL BE LIKE
TO BE WITH SOMEONE
AS EASY AS YOU.
WELL, I'M ACTUALLY
AN INCREDIBLE PAIN
IN THE ASS.
MY OLD GIRLFRIEND
GAVE ME THIS LIST
OF ALL MY FAULTS.
IT'S COMPREHENSIVE.
I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU.
MIGHT HELP YOU
FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.
THERE'S--
THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT YOU THAT I
CAN'T LET GO OF.
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT
MAKES ANY SENSE,
BUT THAT'S AS TRUE
AS I CAN EXPLAIN IT
TO YOU.
THE STRANGE THING
IS THAT...
TO ME, THAT DOES
MAKE SENSE.
Lee: I'LL BE RIGHT OUT.
[WATER RUNNING]
[BIRD CHIRPS]
THAT'S NICE WORK.
THAT'S BOB BARKER.
HAD HIM 7 YEARS.
HE KNOWS EVERYTHING
ABOUT ME.
Ed: DOES HE TALK?
I COULDN'T FIND ANY.
OH, THAT'S OK.
ON FIRST AND FIFTH
THERE'S A 24-HOUR STORE.
WE DON'T HAVE
TO DO THIS NOW.
I MEAN, IT
MIGHT BE MORE FUN
NOT TO BE ABLE TO.
WHAT?
DOES THAT
SOUND WEIRD?
NO. NO. I JUST NEVER
THOUGHT I'D MEET A GUY
WHO'D FEEL THAT WAY.
I DON'T. I'M JUST
TRYING TO MAKE
A GOOD IMPRESSION.
[LAUGHING]
OH.

{695}{748}Everybody fucks everybody.
{759}{798}It's the nature of the beast.
{925}{959}Jesus Christ!
{1116}{1136}Fuck!
{1367}{1443}I can provide a woman with|pretty much anything she wants.
{1472}{1513}Sausage included.
{1873}{1912}How you doing, baby?
{1923}{1945}Fine.
{1967}{1995}Here's my card.
{2076}{2131}One of the most important keys|to being a scammer
{2136}{2185}is to try and get their number,
{2190}{2249}and go to their place, if possible.
{2256}{2307}Homeless guys got it fucking made.|Forget about it.
{2449}{2467}Hi.
{2639}{2657}Shit.
{2789}{2823}I’ve slept with nine women.
{2827}{2901}I know, nine women by the time|you're twenty-six,
{2905}{2952}it's almost like being a virgin.
{2957}{3004}But I like to think|I’m just picky.
{3098}{3118}Thanks.
{3123}{3178}Where the fuck's my tip?
{3182}{3231}In your pants, dickhead.|You should've took a left.
{3236}{3256}Asshole.
{3276}{3300}Nice.
{3311}{3339}Real nice.
{3343}{3417}-Fuck off, jerk.|-You'd like that, wouldn't you?
{3422}{3450}Give me your number,|I’ll call you later.
{3455}{3525}The three of us can make|a Brad sandwich.
{3557}{3587}Don't touch me.
{3643}{3665}Brad!
{3730}{3769}Hey, what's going on?
{3773}{3795}All right, man. How you doing?
{3809}{3841}What's up, Zeke?
{3862}{3878}After you.
{3896}{3968}SyncFix by divx.NeKryXe.com
{5564}{5582}So you see...
{5588}{5645}I got this chick|back at my apartment.
{5649}{5684}She thinks I’m|her best friend's brother.
{5688}{5725}Why the fuck does she think that?
{5734}{5762}'Cause I told her I was.
{5774}{5815}Only way she'd come home with me.
{5820}{5856}Do you even know her best friend?
{5879}{5917}I never know their best friends.
{5921}{6001}But if they believe I know|their best friends, then I’m safe.
{6014}{6059}-That's genius.|-What do you mean, "safe"?
{6064}{6100}Safe, you know.
{6104}{6165}She wants something in common|before she lets you in.
{6169}{6235}It's like the college connection.
{6239}{6280}She's comfortable about|letting you nail her.
{6284}{6378}She thinks you have a bond because|you went to the same school.
{6386}{6412}All of a sudden,
{6424}{6442}you're safe.
{6458}{6505}Fuck this safe bullshit.|Did you bone?
{6510}{6530}Ah, well.
{6543}{6567}Listen, okay?
{6571}{6624}I was at this club|with some guys from work.
{6659}{6698}Check out those sweet honeys!
{6715}{6750}That ho' is fly!
{6766}{6811}Look at those fucking losers.
{6816}{6840}They are totally checking us out.
{6847}{6898}Pigs. So desperate.
{6903}{6952}Bet they're lawyer|or Wall Street assholes.
{6957}{6992}They want lawyer rap.
{6996}{7078}Chicks don't dig lawyer rap,|they want Wall Street.
{7161}{7185}Yeah, pigs.
{7193}{7211}I don't know...
{7216}{7281}I think that blond one's|kind of a hottie.
{7295}{7319}Yeah, right.
{7323}{7357}What are you talking about?
{7386}{7447}I’m not even sure|if they can handle me.
{7452}{7490}Go get them, tiger.
{7497}{7535}You can have him.
{7539}{7590}Those chicks are all over me, man.
{7635}{7661}I’m going in.
{7680}{7762}Brad! Brad! Brad!
{7780}{7796}Hi.
{7821}{7876}Have we met before?
{7894}{7918}Excuse me?
{7936}{8010}-I’m sure I’ve met you before.|-I don't think so.
{8023}{8062}Through a friend or something.
{8066}{8107}She's not interested, okay?|Just go.
{8112}{8153}What's your name?|Maybe it'll come back to me.
{8187}{8248}I’m really not interested, so...
{8266}{8307}I’m sorry, you just look like
{8312}{8357}one of my sister's friends
{8361}{8422}and I wanted to come over|and say hi. Sorry.
{8429}{8476}Wait a minute. Who's your sister?
{8608}{8624}Jen.
{8654}{8699}You're Jen's brother?
{8704}{8759}I knew I recognized you|from those pictures.
{8764}{8825}I haven't seen Jenny|since college.
{8835}{8869}How did you know to say Jen?
{8878}{8939}Every chick's got a friend|named Jen. It’s common.
{8944}{8997}It’s like Peter.
{9009}{9054}She didn't ask you your last name?
{9059}{9149}She wanted me so bad,|all she needed was the link.
{9163}{9199}So then what?
{9203}{9256}I fed her some more bullshit|about Jenny
{9260}{9340}and after twenty minutes|she was begging to join me
{9345}{9384}in the stabbin' cabin.
{9520}{9540}Oh...
{9550}{9589}a very stylin' place you have.
{9593}{9667}-Not half as stylin' as you.|-Really?
{9671}{9685}Yes.
{9690}{9739}She's all over me.
{9758}{9842}She's so fired up|and raring to go.
{9847}{9898}She's like a fucking|gorilla on Ecstasy.
{10233}{10266}I’m in Brad heaven,
{10270}{10307}just about to get smoked...
{10311}{10397}when all of a sudden,|she started cleaning my tailpipe.
{10450}{10487}Man, that's awesome.
{10507}{10552}It’s not awesome,|it's fucking disgusting.
{10557}{10608}She tossed your salad.|That's right out of a porno film.
{10612}{10659}Do you realize how much|people pay for that?
{10663}{10714}That's got to be the best|blowjob story yet.
{10718}{10765}No, moron, you're missing the point.
{10770}{10848}She passed over my dick|and went straight for the ass.
{10853}{10919}Why complain? Some people wait|their whole lives for a rimmer.
{10924}{10944}Yeah, well...
{10974}{11033}you guys know how bad|my stomach is, right?
{11037}{11096}I’m constantly taking|sloppy dumps and shit.
{11125}{11166}That's her problem, not yours.
{11184}{11229}It became my problem.
{11570}{11637}Dude, that's disgusting.
{11643}{11663}Yeah, no shit.
{11667}{11728}You're grossing me out.|You tasted your own asshole?
{11732}{11781}Not by choice, all right?
{11786}{11823}Change of subject. Zeke, you're up.
{11827}{11880}That's sick. I don't know|if I can top that.
{11885}{11946}Try, 'cause shit lips|is bugging me out.
{11950}{11968}Fuck you.
{11972}{11992}All right, chill.
{12013}{12058}I was at Bell Café, writing,
{12206}{12234}when all of a sudden,...
{12244}{12278}I see these two fine honeys
{12282}{12341}all over my wood.
{12372}{12396}All over it.
{12417}{12499}I’m trying to work and I realize|they're totally focused in on me.
{12503}{12540}Now way I’m getting anything done.
{12548}{12578}So I’m thinking,
{12583}{12613}"opportunity's knocking".
{12619}{12680}I don't get it. lf I walked into|some beatnik coffee shop
{12685}{12773}and saw an unemployed dirty freak|like you writing in a diary,
{12778}{12856}I’d stay as far away as possible|from that loser.
{12872}{12898}But that's you, Brad.
{12903}{12987}An ass-kissing, no pun intended,|suit from the upper East Side.
{12996}{13055}Women look at you and know|what they're getting.
{13062}{13128}I, on the other hand,|am an East Village enigma.
{13132}{13167}I secrete mystery.
{13175}{13213}Women dig mystery.
{13217}{13276}-That combined with the pheromones.|-The what?
{13281}{13318}The pheromones.
{13322}{13396}The electricity I give off to|send the chicks climbing the walls.
{13400}{13430}They see me,
{13435}{13459}they smell me,
{13470}{13492}they fuck me.
{13535}{13553}Yeah.
{13557}{13577}Okay, guy.
{13606}{13678}-So, which one did you choose?|-Fuck that, I took them both.
{13777}{13857}-You got both chicks to your crib?|-Damn straight.
{13868}{13927}These girls were fucking pros.
{13934}{14005}They did shit I didn't|even know existed.
{14057}{14081}Like what?
{14086}{14162}You ever hear of an inverted,
{14166}{14230}double teabag slide?
{14234}{14277}No way.
{14282}{14353}The sex was amazing.|It was like a gift from God.
{14357}{14392}Are you writing this shit down?
{14398}{14457}This should be your next screenplay.
{14461}{14489}How many times did you bone?
{14494}{14516}A box worth.
{14523}{14559}Three times?
{14564}{14623}You know I only buy twelve-packs.
{14642}{14705}-These chicks sound perfect.|-Not exactly perfect.
{14762}{14796}The next morning,
{14806}{14838}they stole my TV.
{14842}{14881}-They what?|-They fucking stole my set.
{14886}{14941}Do you think that was|their intention from the start?
{14945}{14996}-Definitely.|-I’m sure of it.
{15001}{15073}I bet they double team|so they can carry out more shit.
{15078}{15142}It’s an ingenious operation,|if you think about it.
{15146}{15203}Don't you feel like they fucked you,|they got the better of you?
{15207}{15276}They fucked me all right,|in a way I’ll never forget.
{15282}{15364}It was worth a TV. They come back,|I’ll throw them the toaster.
{15395}{15421}This is some fucked up shit.
{15437}{15525}Both you guys are crazy.|That never happens to me.
{15530}{15573}That's 'cause nothing|ever happens to you.
{15578}{15619}Yeah, what, did you score?
{15624}{15671}Or did you spend another|weekend tugging root?
{15675}{15765}Fuck you, man. I had multiple|ladies on my tip.
{15778}{15806}Multiple, my ass.
{15811}{15843}Better your ass than Brad's.
{15847}{15873}Funny.
{15892}{15943}I was at Strokes
{15948}{16019}with my five knucklehead friends.
{16034}{16106}There were seven fine honeys|at my disposal.
{16112}{16171}Place was so ripe, I had my pick.
{16184}{16218}Always talking a big game.
{16222}{16275}No, seriously, they were all|sitting there waiting.
{16279}{16332}All I had to do was|go in for the kill.
{16336}{16352}So?
{16372}{16390}So I did.
{16440}{16466}Her name...
{16483}{16509}was Keri.
{16557}{16598}The flyest girl at the bar.
{16603}{16658}Dude, you got to stop|whacking it so much.
{16663}{16679}What?
{16685}{16746}Making up chick's names|while you're feeding the geese.
{16750}{16768}Fuck you.
{16772}{16831}She's as real as the|scrambled eggs on that plate.
{16836}{16873}Last week her name was Nivea,
{16877}{16914}the week before it was Neutrogena.
{16918}{16979}Nivea was a nice French girl|I met in the park.
{16983}{17034}Fuck that. If you didn't score,|just say it.
{17039}{17076}You don't believe me,|I don't give a shit.
{17080}{17096}Say it.
{17100}{17161}All I want to know is,|have we found a prospect yet?
{17166}{17205}-A prospect?|-For what?
{17210}{17243}You know, the plan.
{17253}{17288}The triple team some chick plan.
{17292}{17368}-You still caught up in that shit?|-It'll be fucking great.
{17372}{17413}The three of us and some hottie,
{17418}{17494}doing high-fives over her back.|The ultimate sexual plateau.
{17603}{17642}Fuck the plan.
{17647}{17706}I'm just trying to find|some chick I can relate to.
{17710}{17726}What?
{17734}{17820}-Some girl I actually respect.|-Why can't we find girls like us?
{17826}{17873}Dude, all girls masturbate.
{17877}{17916}Fuck you. That's not what I meant.
{17920}{17953}Why are you always...?
{17957}{17996}I’m kidding. I understand|what you're saying.
{18000}{18053}It'd be cool to find a hot chick
{18058}{18101}that also cared about|the same shit we do.
{18105}{18172}Some little snappy you don't|want to kick out of bed
{18176}{18211}-right after you throw your web.|-I hear you.
{18215}{18276}-Is that too much to ask?|-Good fucking luck.
{18316}{18332}What?
{18374}{18392}Oh, no.
{18396}{18494}-Who the hell invited him?|-I did. He used to be one of us.
{18498}{18549}Exactly, he used to be.|Then the asshole got married.
{18553}{18610}When you pass the ring,|you lose the sting.
{18614}{18661}You might as well chop|your dick off at the altar.
{18811}{18862}-Hi.|-Hey, Eric. Have a seat.
{18866}{18919}Zeke, Brad. What's up?
{18938}{18966}Same old.
{19007}{19035}What the fuck's that?
{19055}{19106}My wife says I have|chronic halitosis.
{19111}{19212}She makes me spray this shit|into my mouth every hour.
{19217}{19264}Lend it to Brad.
{19269}{19297}Fuck you.
{19332}{19354}Why?
{19358}{19392}Don't worry about it.
{19436}{19464}So,...
{19469}{19520}where you guys been?|I haven't seen you in forever.
{19524}{19571}Dude, you're married.
{19576}{19617}We no longer have anything in common.
{19627}{19645}Jesus!
{19659}{19675}Well,
{19698}{19751}-I’m still the same guy.|-No you're not.
{19755}{19783}You're married. Face it.
{19802}{19832}You think I don't got stories?
{19836}{19885}About your wife?|Come on, that's nasty.
{19889}{19930}You saying we don't do kinky shit?
{19935}{19988}I’m sure you do, but it's|like your wife, man.
{19998}{20057}That's got to be a bit sacred.
{20061}{20077}Yeah.
{20081}{20136}lf it was a girl we don't know,
{20140}{20222}then that'd be okay.|But your wife? That's sick.
{20226}{20256}That's where you're wrong.
{20261}{20343}It’s way better because|it's totally uninhibited.
{20349}{20408}Like last night, we were|having sex in the kitchen,
{20412}{20482}and I started using|all the utensils.
{20486}{20572}We got this new juicer|and it's shaped like a carrot.
{20577}{20641}-I am bent over...|-Save it!
{20645}{20727}We had an entire line|of extra virgin olive oil.
{20732}{20789}Cut the visuals. We're eating.
{21095}{21164}Eric, did you say you had to|go somewhere this afternoon?
{21169}{21187}Yeah.
{21212}{21251}Dude, you should probably go.
{21259}{21295}I had to meet my wife
{21299}{21340}for brunch twenty minutes ago.
{21345}{21377}Brunch? You just fucking ate.
{21381}{21451}Once you're married, you got to|do a lot of things twice.
{21472}{21575}Appease the little woman,|make her feel you care.
{21581}{21611}Man, that sucks.
{21674}{21692}Well,...
{21697}{21723}bye.
{21740}{21760}See you, Eric.
{21782}{21833}Jonathan, I want you to go|back over to that tree.
{21840}{21864}Wait about a minute.
{21868}{21907}Brad, you come up at the end.
{21914}{21951}You close the deal. You got it?
{21955}{22008}It’s standard. Just don't|save the ugly one for me.
{22013}{22052}Dude, look at them.
{22056}{22136}They're all sitting down.|They could have fat asses.
{22140}{22177}Come on. They're going to leave.
{22186}{22222}Chill. Are you ready?
{22226}{22240}Yeah.
{22244}{22262}Break.
{22279}{22318}Women, men, nobody.
{22333}{22376}Above the knee, they get nasty.
{22381}{22430}Yeah, like they go down to the...
{22484}{22508}Hey, girls.
{22530}{22564}How you doing?
{22574}{22592}Good.
{22630}{22662}Is your name Kelly?
{22678}{22708}No, Stacey.
{22712}{22748}Stacey, hi. I’m Zeke.
{22753}{22786}-Hi.|-Hi.
{22790}{22826}And your lovely friends?
{22830}{22864}This is Marie and Bristol.
{22881}{22907}Marie...
{22921}{22964}-...and Crystal.|-Bristol.
{23017}{23041}So...
{23047}{23121}So, those are interesting pants|you got there.
{23126}{23152}You like?
{23159}{23177}Stroke it.
{23181}{23220}Like is not exactly the word.
{23226}{23279}That's real crocodile leather.
{23284}{23356}I’m most like Mickey Rourke|in "9 1l2 Weeks".
{23361}{23433}Let's face it, the man understands|the term "dominant male"
{23438}{23471}to the nth degree.
{23475}{23551}Not that I see myself as|the controlling freak he was.
{23555}{23616}You never know. Am I in control?|Am I not?
{23622}{23677}Not that I’m a control freak.|I mean...
{23702}{23768}Control is very,|very important.
{23773}{23810}You always must keep the upper hand.
{23814}{23869}No it's not. Crocodile has scales.
{23874}{23921}-Oh my God! Zeke!|-Jonathan!
{23926}{23992}-I thought that was you.|-What are you doing here?
{23996}{24032}Just walking around.
{24036}{24079}Jonathan, meet Marie...
{24085}{24101}Hi.
{24115}{24170}-Kelly and Crystal.|-Hi.
{24175}{24226}-Stacey.|-Stacey, I’m sorry.
{24230}{24250}Bristol.
{24254}{24301}How do you guys know Zeke?
{24307}{24340}We don't.
{24346}{24415}Maybe Andrew McCarthy in|"St. Elmo's Fire".
{24419}{24472}He was totally misunderstood|in that film.
{24477}{24497}Just because...
{24502}{24571}he had creative,|more intellectual interests,
{24586}{24625}everybody thought he was gay.
{24633}{24663}I’m not.
{24667}{24689}I’m not like that.
{24695}{24771}It’s because I’m single|and creative,
{24785}{24865}and I understand my feminine side|better than the next guy.
{24870}{24958}He just came over here|and made us feel his leg.
{24968}{25044}Hey, guys. What are you|doing in the park on Sunday.
{25048}{25066}Brad!
{25092}{25137}Who are these beautiful mommies?
{25142}{25189}Brad, this is Marie...
{25195}{25217}-Marie.|-Stacey...
{25222}{25238}Pleasure.
{25243}{25300}-And Crystal.|-Bristol.
{25311}{25327}Bristol.
{25331}{25347}Bristol.
{25356}{25440}I would have to say|Tom Cruise, "Risky Business".
{25449}{25492}He was stuffing Rebecca DeMornay,
{25504}{25565}drove a Porsche,|and he ran a clam house.
{25569}{25591}For Christ's sake!
{25598}{25659}Brad, get off the babysitter.
{25708}{25763}Scamming's not|the most important thing.
{25768}{25836}It’s just something I’m good at.
{25854}{25923}A good catch?|Yeah, I think I’m a good catch.
{25938}{25979}I make a shitload of money...
{26038}{26062}Look at me!
{26709}{26746}Why is everyone so quiet?
{26767}{26814}Didn't anyone scam this weekend?
{26820}{26840}Zeke?
{26875}{26928}Of course. I just don't|want to talk about it.
{26948}{26993}What do you mean?
{26998}{27051}Isn't that the point of|coming here every Sunday?
{27056}{27132}Maybe I met someone I don't|feel like telling you dicks about.
{27137}{27208}Just because you talk|about how you porked your wife
{27212}{27232}with a waffle iron,
{27237}{27280}doesn't mean I gotta tell you shit.
{27287}{27319}Excuse me for asking.
{27326}{27356}And it was a juicer.
{27397}{27413}So,...
{27429}{27457}was she hot?
{27493}{27569}I don't care about looks anymore.|I’m over that superficial crap.
{27574}{27654}As long as she's got a great rack|and buns like a champ, I’m happy.
{27660}{27682}Yeah, she was hot.
{27688}{27726}-You railed her?|-What?
{27745}{27769}You didn't rail her?
{27779}{27844}That's probably why you like her|and you're not talking about her.
{27850}{27934}-I didn't say if I railed her.|-Usually means you didn't rail her.
{27939}{27980}-Didn't rail her.|-Definitely didn't rail her.
{27985}{28028}Listen up, assholes.
{28054}{28109}It was Thursday night.|I was back at the Bell Café,
{28114}{28142}looking for the wonder twins,
{28147}{28245}when I suddenly I notice this|beautiful woman at another table.
{28249}{28325}Notice she's a woman|and not a hi-dee-hi-dee-ho.
{28452}{28480}What are you reading?
{28487}{28526}Now this girl was fly.
{28535}{28563}-She was that fucking hot?|-Yeah.
{28601}{28675}The capper is, she was reading|Syd Field's screenplay book.
{28684}{28702}So?
{28710}{28726}So?
{28730}{28764}That's like the Bible|for screenwriters.
{28768}{28825}She's not only hot but got|the same interests as me.
{28846}{28918}Wait, did you say|you fucked her in a field?
{28932}{28948}Yeah!
{28953}{29025}No, I said she was reading|Syd Field's screenplay book.
{29030}{29071}Who cares?|Did you fuck her?
{29099}{29127}No, look.
{29137}{29203}Have some fucking respect.|I think I actually like this one.
{29236}{29285}-I knew it.|-Definitely didn't fuck her.
{29294}{29335}Did you get her back to your crib?
{29342}{29376}Of course.
{29387}{29444}-What are your legs?|-Steel springs.
{29449}{29521}-How fast can you run?|-Fast as a leopard. Gallipoli.
{29644}{29701}George, George, George, George.
{29706}{29741}It’s Michael Dorsey.
{29750}{29786}Your favorite client.
{29798}{29824}"George of the Jungle"?
{29845}{29861}No.
{29878}{29900}"Tootsie".
{29924}{29954}You go.
{29959}{29998}What, I amuse you?
{30021}{30066}That's so easy.|"Good fellas".
{30145}{30165}Hey, wait.
{30183}{30224}Can't we just take it slow?
{30263}{30332}We can definitely|take it slow, baby.
{30368}{30409}She wanted me pretty badly,
{30413}{30456}but I thought it would be|best to take it slow.
{30479}{30507}I knew it.
{30526}{30614}lf he'd nailed her,|then she'd be nothing special.
{30618}{30690}But since he didn't fuck her,|he cares.
{30695}{30744}But I never get laid, and I never|care about most of my scams.
{30751}{30804}You haven't fucked and lost yet.
{30808}{30867}Once a chick plays you for|nothing more than a dick,
{30872}{30933}you'll toughen up and be able to|fuck and forget.
{30938}{30952}Yeah,
{30957}{31008}a chick's got to tease a dick|in order to be teased.
{31012}{31080}After a dick-tease, you'll be|working with an unteasable dick.
{31084}{31120}Nothing's penetrating that thing.
{31124}{31204}You got to fall off the bike|in order to get back on.
{31222}{31271}So I got to be fucked and spit on,
{31275}{31326}before I can have feelings for|a girl by not fucking her.
{31378}{31394}Yeah.
{31399}{31415}Yeah.
{31425}{31458}I get it now. Thanks.
{31463}{31493}Dude, you're up.
{31505}{31540}What are you thinking about?
{31555}{31575}What's on your mind?
{31580}{31600}Nothing.
{31609}{31635}It’s just...
{31666}{31746}I may have met somebody I like|this weekend too.
{31752}{31772}No!
{31783}{31799}Dude!
{32168}{32211}Oh, my God!
{32228}{32269}Unbelievable!
{32280}{32317}I think I’m getting a wood.
{32330}{32424}What is it about two chicks|grinding that turns me on?
{32429}{32493}This lesbian fad is awesome.
{32573}{32628}Holy balls!|Will you look at that?
{32727}{32747}Shit!
{32881}{32905}Hi.
{32917}{32937}Hi.
{32959}{33012}This chick was so hot.
{33017}{33043}She had the whole package.
{33047}{33071}She had a cock?
{33115}{33149}Yeah, she had a dick, dude.
{33182}{33220}Come on.
{33224}{33275}This is the kind of girl|I’ve been looking for.
{33280}{33319}And she was digging your shit?
{33341}{33375}Of course she was.
{33379}{33407}Did you stuff her?
{33411}{33437}No, man.
{33451}{33475}I’m kind of like you, Zeke.
{33481}{33509}I think I really like this girl.
{33534}{33618}She was more interested in|stocks and bonds and stuff.
{33622}{33667}Sounds like she was|interested in your wallet.
{33671}{33757}It wasn't like that at all.|I think she cared about me.
{33763}{33791}That's so great.
{33801}{33825}All right, so...
{33833}{33861}these are the revenues.
{33908}{33940}And these are earnings.
{33951}{33973}Exactly.
{33988}{34012}That makes sense.
{34017}{34093}Most chicks I date couldn't|give two shits about what I do.
{34097}{34177}All they want is a nice dinner|in some trendy restaurant
{34181}{34226}and a nice hard cock|at the end of the night.
{34231}{34276}They don't care what's|important to me.
{34337}{34378}Did she want the hard cock too?
{34404}{34440}No, man. This one was different.
{34444}{34489}We totally bonded.
{34494}{34570}I didn't want to sleep with her.|I could've talked all night.
{34575}{34612}That sounds like a lot of fun.
{34616}{34632}So...
{34637}{34680}you just talked all night?
{34685}{34703}No.
{34707}{34727}She smoked me.
{34776}{34823}But I could've talked all night.
{34829}{34859}Was she good?
{34880}{34918}I just told you I didn't fuck her.
{34922}{34990}No, was she good at smoking pole?
{34995}{35031}Fucking horny bastard.
{35043}{35115}She was all right.|She won't win any medals.
{35120}{35179}So she ain't no Hanna.
{35184}{35225}Shit!
{35241}{35286}Wait a second. Who's Hanna?
{35290}{35331}My God! I almost forgot about her.
{35336}{35391}You remember Hanna.|Hoover Hanna.
{35396}{35461}She gave Brad|the five hour blowjob.
{35465}{35502}Bullshit. No fucking way.
{35509}{35568}That chick could suck|a taxi driver through immigration.
{35595}{35666}After three hours, I got so hungry|I called Mr. Pizza.
{35685}{35767}The dude came into the room|as Hoover was gumming my knob.
{35771}{35806}She never knew he was there.
{35817}{35866}How did you last for five hours?
{35877}{35944}I was so boozed and tabbed up,
{35948}{36020}maybe 27 bongos on top of that,|now way I was gonna nut.
{36024}{36102}I was fortunate my wood|didn't go south.
{36114}{36161}Plus, she reminded me of my sister.
{36166}{36186}I couldn't get into it.
{36212}{36240}But enough about me.
{36245}{36304}It’s time for you to bore us|with another spank fest.
{36308}{36351}What was her name this week,|Vaselina?
{36383}{36432}No, this week was different.
{36454}{36487}I was at the newsstand,
{36492}{36561}picking up some reading material|for the bathroom,
{36568}{36598}when out of nowhere...
{36656}{36680}I’m sorry.
{36765}{36781}I’ll get it.
{36792}{36825}No.
{37041}{37061}Are you okay?
{37082}{37098}Yeah.
{37183}{37240}You want me to put these|back in your bag for you?
{37262}{37284}Okay.
{37572}{37642}We spent the rest of the day|talking over coffee.
{37647}{37700}That's the most embarrassing shit|I’ve ever heard.
{37704}{37732}Man, that sucks.
{37740}{37777}But that's the best part.
{37786}{37851}She knows I beat off constantly|and she doesn't give a shit.
{37855}{37871}What?
{37900}{37945}What's more personal than that?
{37969}{37989}I mean...
{38005}{38037}after knowing that,
{38052}{38088}we could talk about anything.
{38098}{38143}It’s like there's nothing to hide.
{38147}{38173}Once a day, that's it?
{38215}{38231}Yeah.
{38235}{38265}Isn’t that enough?
{38368}{38431}Once a day is a foundation,|and then...
{38474}{38538}definitely at night|before I go to sleep.
{38542}{38585}-It helps me go to sleep.|-Me too.
{38589}{38605}Really?
{38609}{38644}-Yes.|-That's so cool.
{38648}{38707}Except sometimes|I’m too tired to finish.
{38714}{38738}You know...
{38750}{38778}I just bore myself.
{38912}{38986}My ex boyfriend was into...
{39005}{39058}videotaping me while I...
{39093}{39115}Really?
{39136}{39212}And while he was videotaping,|he would also be...
{39229}{39255}to himself.
{39273}{39295}Really?
{39305}{39352}And you would watch?
{39357}{39375}Yeah.
{39422}{39446}While he...?
{39475}{39520}Did you like it?
{39542}{39560}Yeah.
{39834}{39883}You are one lucky bastard.
{39906}{39949}Congratulations, little stroker.
{39954}{40005}For the first time,|you finally scored big.
{40014}{40067}He's earning his stripes.
{40075}{40116}Thanks. It means a lot|coming from you guys.
{40120}{40152}So did you...?
{40163}{40187}I didn't fuck her.
{40192}{40210}But...
{40225}{40276}I have a date with her this week.
{40282}{40312}And...
{40338}{40385}she asked me to bring|the video camera.
{40390}{40416}Nice!
{40430}{40466}You know what you got to do?
{40470}{40558}Show up at her house with|some wine and flowers and shit.
{40563}{40597}With a video camera.
{40601}{40652}Of course with a video camera.
{40658}{40729}-Why are you feeding him bullshit?|-What made you a fucking pro?
{40733}{40761}I know what I’m talking about.
{40766}{40832}You get some cheap wine,|like Dunwood.
{40836}{40916}It’s got a nice label,|so it looks expensive.
{40921}{40987}You can get it on sale|for like $9.99.
{40997}{41017}Dunwood...
{41022}{41055}and some cheap roses,
{41059}{41129}and you'll be doing|the bone dance in no time.
{41133}{41197}He should take advice from you.|What do you know about women?
{41201}{41227}You're married, for chrissakes!
{41232}{41273}Think I don't know what women want?
{41297}{41391}Now I’m married, I’m more|sensitive to a woman's needs.
{41399}{41431}Wait, wait. Dunwood?
{41435}{41482}The shit works every time.
{41487}{41550}I’m waiting a week or two|before I call my chick.
{41554}{41572}You know,...
{41589}{41658}get her all moist so she's|begging for my love.
{41665}{41739}lf you like this woman, call her|right away, make her feel special.
{41744}{41795}Pipe it, toughie.|I don't need your bullshit advice.
{41799}{41819}Yeah, shut the fuck up.
{41824}{41875}He's right.|You should call her tonight.
{41879}{41932}Maybe we could all do something|together this week.
{41937}{41980}Don't get faggy on me.
{41984}{42066}I don't want your lame ass|ruining my chances on some clam.
{42071}{42087}I’m waiting a week.
{42092}{42168}I’d get the nice guy date|out of the way as soon as possible.
{42173}{42207}-What?|-The nice guy date?
{42212}{42279}The filler, to show her|what a nice guy you are.
{42283}{42322}So she lets you hit it on the next.
{42327}{42370}How many dates does it take|for you to bone?
{42375}{42465}lf I don't hit on the first,|which is rare, on the second.
{42470}{42554}But by rule, if I don't get it|on the third, I never call her.
{42559}{42625}Definitely not worth the time|after the third.
{42642}{42687}It always takes me a few months.
{42811}{42860}Come on, art boy.|Let's see what you got.
{42865}{42916}Did you bring your notepad?
{42920}{42961}Going to write down "Brad Dreams"?
{42967}{43041}"Brad Got Game"?|Trying to get a piece of me?
{43054}{43080}Pass the ball!
{43084}{43131}I’m ready. Bring it in!
{43172}{43256}-Why aren't you paying attention?|-I am paying attention.
{43977}{44032}Last night, I couldn't|get to sleep...
{44037}{44117}'cause Loraine was in the bed,|so I snuck down to the den
{44122}{44181}and ordered some|pay-per-view porn.
{44186}{44237}Why? It’s terrible.|It’s useless.
{44242}{44272}They don't show penetration.
{44277}{44338}I couldn't believe the size|of the breasts on these women.
{44343}{44384}They were like huge.
{44388}{44422}They were fake.
{44432}{44477}Those foam bags aren't real.|Come on.
{44502}{44592}A lot of pillows, propped up|straight, pointing north.
{44596}{44637}Never south, always north.
{45047}{45113}When I come home from the gym|after a few butterflies,
{45117}{45168}I look in the mirror and go:
{45173}{45232}"I’ve got a nice rack.
{45237}{45273}I’d fuck me."
{45307}{45372}Like that psycho in|"Silence of the Lambs".
{45376}{45417}Except I didn't do the dick tuck.
{45493}{45526}I did the dick tuck for Loraine,
{45530}{45616}to spice up the sex life,|keep the bedroom hot.
{45621}{45678}You did the tuck for Loraine?
{45683}{45732}She talked about|bringing home a woman
{45738}{45774}and threesomes and shit.
{45778}{45825}Dude, that's awesome.
{46043}{46086}Oh, master, oh, master.
{46167}{46214}She wouldn't let this go
{46218}{46306}and I realized she had this|pseudo lesbian craving.
{46310}{46365}Are you kidding me? Loraine?
{46369}{46410}No, she wouldn't let it go.
{46414}{46465}So instead of bringing back|another chick,
{46470}{46538}sometimes I do the tuck,
{46542}{46612}talk in a high voice like this,|and ask her to touch me.
{46616}{46638}Touch me.
{46642}{46706}Touch me. Touch me.
{46710}{46753}Touch me.
{46899}{46923}Oh, Brad.
{46971}{47006}Oh, Brad.
{47033}{47092}I’ve tried doing the tuck|a couple of times,
{47096}{47163}but it really kind of...
{47167}{47193}hurts my penis.
{47197}{47229}Then you're not doing it right.
{47233}{47267}Is this shit still going on?
{47271}{47318}You still unstrapping one|for Loraine?
{47323}{47362}That was just a phase.
{47367}{47408}Now she's in a book group.
{47415}{47474}-I got to go.|-Where you got to go?
{47480}{47539}I got to make a phone call.|Brad, you still have your cell?
{47544}{47597}-Are you calling your hump?|-Of course not.
{47602}{47655}I just got to make a call.
{47724}{47767}You fucking cunt.
{48462}{48528}There are certain words|I don't like to use.
{48569}{48593}I don't like...
{48607}{48635}masturbation...
{48695}{48721}or jerking off...
{48736}{48762}or spanking.
{48793}{48858}I think those words,|they sound vulgar.
{48862}{48888}"Sturbing"
{48899}{48940}is the word I use.
{48948}{48968}"Sturbing".
{48997}{49036}I’m comfortable with "sturbing".
{49078}{49147}Hey, hey, hey, hey, Mia,
{49201}{49343}You're my cup of Tee-ah.
{49378}{49423}Sometimes I sit on my hand.
{49427}{49443}You know.
{49447}{49467}And...
{49477}{49575}I sit on it for a long time|until it falls asleep.
{49588}{49604}And then,
{49616}{49642}once it's asleep,
{49656}{49693}I sturb with it like this,
{49710}{49767}so it feels like...
{49775}{49820}somebody else is|doing it to me.
{49840}{49879}I call it "the stranger".
{49884}{49906}Mia,
{49946}{50001}we can take a trip...
{50029}{50066}across the sea.
{50072}{50088}Yeah.
{50115}{50131}Yeah.
{50398}{50445}You look beautiful.
{50449}{50473}That's no good.
{50490}{50506}You look...
{50530}{50554}wonderful.
{50612}{50649}You look amazing.
{50729}{50753}What the hell?
{50761}{50777}Hello?
{50967}{51018}Amazingly beautiful.
{51035}{51069}Shit, that's so bad.
{51164}{51186}You look...
{51231}{51263}you look stunning.
{51311}{51329}Mia?
{51356}{51374}Mia?
{51414}{51432}Holy shit!
{51498}{51534}In here!
{51668}{51688}Stop that!
{51710}{51732}Get off!
{51737}{51759}Get off!
{51769}{51795}Fucking cocksucker!
{51822}{51858}What the hell's going on here?
{51958}{51974}Wait!
{51991}{52055}I’ll kick your ass if you don't|tell me why the fuck you're here!
{52059}{52116}-What is going on?|-I have a date with Mia?
{52192}{52229}Fuck you! I’m dating Mia!
{52235}{52271}Would you get the hell off me?
{52275}{52316}You guys all know each other?
{52335}{52386}You guys have known each other|since college.
{52422}{52455}And you're best friends.
{52462}{52480}Yeah.
{52490}{52514}For real?
{52543}{52584}How is that possible?
{52589}{52630}It’s New York City.
{52634}{52669}What are the odds of that?
{52683}{52736}Apparently pretty high.
{52755}{52773}Sorry.
{52800}{52824}I’m sorry too.
{52885}{52942}I really like you guys,|all of you.
{53007}{53039}What's with the Dunwood?
{53113}{53131}Anyway,...
{53137}{53192}in an ideal world, I guess...
{53215}{53254}I’d want to see all of you,
{53261}{53320}but I understand it's not possible.
{53325}{53343}So,...
{53390}{53433}if you guys want to take off,
{53440}{53462}I understand.
{53509}{53527}Okay.
{53574}{53617}It was fun while it lasted.
{53845}{53869}-Bye.|-Bye, Jonathan.
{53921}{53954}Come on, Zeke, let's go.
{53959}{53989}I’m not going anywhere.
{54039}{54061}What?
{54070}{54088}I’m staying.
{54112}{54136}Come on, Zeke.
{54161}{54206}Fuck that. If you want to go, go.
{54248}{54281}Come on, man. Don't be a dick.
{54287}{54317}You don't understand.
{54338}{54368}I actually like her.
{54387}{54425}Mia and I have a connection.
{54584}{54602}Wait.
{54615}{54666}We have a connection too, right?
{54785}{54817}I’m staying.
{54861}{54877}What?
{54883}{54905}I’m staying.
{54920}{54973}My God, you got to be kidding me.
{55101}{55119}Okay.
{55142}{55160}Okay.
{55170}{55200}You're connected,
{55221}{55255}and if you're connected,
{55300}{55334}I’m connected too.
{55404}{55445}You sure you're okay with this?
{55487}{55503}Oh, yeah.
{55507}{55531}It’s not a problem.
{55538}{55579}Back off, she's mine!
{55595}{55644}Both of you have totally|fucking dicked me over!
{55652}{55690}Fuck that. You dicked me.
{55695}{55711}You know...
{55720}{55773}I’m the only one that's|supposed to be here.
{55778}{55839}It’s funny both of you|decided to surprise her
{55844}{55885}on the one day that|I had a date with her.
{55890}{55935}And we were going to|use the video camera.
{55980}{56019}I’m not backing off.
{56031}{56101}lf Mia wants to see all of us,|you'll have to deal with it.
{56105}{56150}Fuck you.
{56160}{56203}Who gives a shit what you think?
{56207}{56227}You know what?
{56238}{56287}I’m really tired of the way|you talk to me.
{56331}{56364}Fuck you, you fucking...
{56378}{56402}Fuck you.
{56407}{56437}Easy, easy. Chill.
{56442}{56483}-I’m going to kick his ass.|-What?
{56487}{56523}Going to kung fu chop me to death?
{56527}{56545}Hey, chill.
{56578}{56619}Crane position,|Daniel san.
{56654}{56701}First of all, it's jujitsu, faggot.
{56705}{56781}Second, I don't need to know shit|to kick your lame ass.
{56786}{56812}I’m so scared.
{56816}{56861}lf you don't shut up,|I’m going to move.
{56918}{56940}You know what?
{56948}{57003}Fuck this shit.|You're both assholes!
{57009}{57029}I’m out of here.
{57126}{57150}Assholes.
{57181}{57222}Why do you always have to be|such a dick?
{57238}{57258}Asshole.
{57277}{57299}Dick.
{58125}{58180}It’s Mia. Please leave a message.
{58229}{58257}Hello, Mia.
{58263}{58298}How you doing, sweetie?|It’s Brad.
{58302}{58363}I have two tickets to|the Knicks game tonight
{58367}{58400}if you wanted to go.
{58516}{58536}What?
{58733}{58804}Hi, it's Jonathan. How are you?
{58809}{58870}Just calling to say hey,|and see if you maybe...
{58874}{58944}want to do something later?.
{59322}{59389}It’s Zeke. Where are you, baby?|I want to hangout with you.
{59393}{59434}We could do something and get close.
{59438}{59456}Call me.
{59628}{59702}I like to walk into a place,|check out the vibes, the signals
{59706}{59782}I’m getting on the wood meter,|lookaways, that kind of shit.
{59786}{59804}A lookaway?
{59815}{59854}That's when a girl looks at you,
{59858}{59899}and she instantly looks away.
{59903}{59962}That is a solid green light.
{59988}{60006}Lookaway.
{60013}{60033}Lookaway.
{60039}{60104}Like you hit a home run and|you haven't had to pick up a bat.
{60117}{60176}Like most scammers|that I’m aware of,
{60181}{60245}I’m not that comfortable|with other men.
{60251}{60323}I have a very strong affinity|for the society of women.
{60344}{60428}It’s a matter of time before you|get over the Brad/Jonathan thing.
{60432}{60481}What do you see in those dicks?
{60486}{60533}I thought they were your friends.
{60549}{60606}Your friends don't try and|get on your girlfriend.
{60684}{60710}Excuse me.
{60928}{60948}Mia,
{60977}{61032}I know we haven't been|together for that long,
{61075}{61118}but I just wanted to tell you...
{61139}{61217}I haven't had many special|relationships with girls.
{61236}{61260}I mean, women.
{61322}{61340}And...
{61356}{61405}it might not seem a big deal to you,
{61417}{61433}but...
{61471}{61553}but I feel I can talk to you|about just about anything.
{61594}{61631}It means a lot to me.
{61642}{61699}I never thought|I’d be able to say that.
{61745}{61798}That's what I love about you, Zeke.
{61804}{61911}You have this whole cool,
{61915}{61937}ladies man exterior,
{61944}{61999}but inside you’re just a big dork.
{62032}{62056}In a good way.
{62231}{62274}How do you know me so well?
{62305}{62337}I just...
{62356}{62376}...do.
{62887}{62919}That was awesome.
{62924}{62948}Thanks.
{62955}{63006}Practice makes perfect.
{63072}{63090}Look,
{63109}{63158}I know I joke around a lot,
{63166}{63190}Mia, but...
{63210}{63236}I want you to know...
{63247}{63286}I am totally serious
{63328}{63366}when I say that you are...
{63374}{63411}the coolest thing
{63418}{63442}in my life.
{63527}{63582}I’ve never met anyone|like you before.
{63626}{63654}So what's next?
{63716}{63780}No, no, I meant with us.
{63822}{63844}Oh.
{63852}{63882}I don't know.
{63887}{63977}I’ve never been in|a relationship like this before.
{63993}{64026}You'll be my little...
{64039}{64057}student.
{64089}{64150}And you can spank me|when I’m bad.
{64592}{64618}That was amazing.
{64723}{64764}I want to show you something.
{64770}{64786}Okay.
{65143}{65171}They're great.
{65382}{65410}These are really...
{65442}{65472}These are great.
{65489}{65561}The guys think I look like|a fag in that picture.
{65567}{65614}What do they know?|They're just jealous.
{65726}{65783}You're really different|from them, you know, Jonathan.
{65800}{65841}Really, you're more genuine.
{65878}{65931}And these past few weeks with you
{65940}{65978}have been really special.
{66049}{66086}The past few weeks
{66098}{66151}with me and Zeke and Brad?
{66183}{66201}No,
{66234}{66254}dummy.
{66267}{66318}The past few weeks with you.
{66478}{66523}I was really confused before,
{66555}{66596}but I’m not anymore.
{68539}{68559}Jonathan?
{68593}{68619}Come on, we're late.
{68641}{68677}I’ll be right out.
{68682}{68700}Okay.
{68908}{68943}Wow. Five speeds.
{69862}{69903}Honey, come on. We got to go.
{70002}{70024}Shit.
{70099}{70117}Shit.
{70122}{70138}What?
{70165}{70181}Nothing.
{70232}{70266}Are you sure you're okay?
{70274}{70315}I’m fine. Just a second.
{70837}{70861}Sweetheart,
{70866}{70950}if you need Pepto, it's in|the cabinet above the sink.
{71094}{71126}Come on, it's not coming out!
{71134}{71200}Are you sure you're okay?|You sound pretty bad.
{71206}{71220}No.
{71254}{71272}I’m fine.
{71276}{71331}-Honey, I’m coming in.|-Wait, no!
{71424}{71471}What are you doing?
{71476}{71500}I was washing my hair,|or my hands.
{71504}{71559}I was just feeling dirty.|We have to go.
{71563}{71602}-Wait, what is that?|-What?
{71655}{71687}I hear humming.
{71691}{71750}-I don't hear anything.|-Why are you so wet?
{71754}{71788}You smell like a toilet.
{72039}{72092}Great to have the boys|back together again.
{72113}{72168}I was starting to miss you guys.
{72172}{72196}Fuck you.
{72202}{72253}To think that I actually cared!
{72277}{72353}Look, guys, can we put everything|behind us and move on?
{72358}{72413}Just forget about|all the bullshit?
{72444}{72470}Okay with me.
{72499}{72517}Fine.
{72530}{72560}Good, let's order.
{72674}{72692}So...
{72735}{72809}Did anyone read the blow-job|article in Cosmo this month?
{72847}{72863}What?
{72868}{72913}Why the fuck are you reading Cosmo?
{72917}{72974}My wife keeps it|near the bathtub.
{72982}{73033}Thank God I am not married.
{73037}{73125}You don't understand.|This magazine is for women.
{73129}{73147}So...
{73151}{73241}it has all these tips|on how to please your man.
{73265}{73304}I get it now.
{73320}{73384}You read this shit so you can|learn how to please your man.
{73388}{73435}That is funny, but no.
{73439}{73531}What I’m saying is that|it's written by women.
{73541}{73625}It says things like|"one out of every three men
{73630}{73689}has latent homo-erotic fantasies".
{73833}{73853}What?
{73864}{73913}Anyway, this article says
{73917}{73993}that chicks should make|their boyfriends
{73997}{74062}drink apple juice|before they give head.
{74066}{74109}It makes the taste better.
{74114}{74138}Therefore,
{74142}{74249}they would want to give|more head in the future.
{74273}{74318}-Really?|-That's just bullshit.
{74336}{74377}Why are you wasting our time|with this crap?
{74392}{74451}It’s better than talking about|that whacked ho' Mia.
{74519}{74549}Oh, man,
{74553}{74604}she's got you all whipped.
{74722}{74752}Excuse me!
{74775}{74801}Yeah, who's whipped?
{74806}{74892}She's got you muff-spelled,|riding your asses into the ground.
{74897}{74933}What the fuck are you talking about?
{74937}{74970}What is wrong with this asshole?
{74974}{75052}Mia's not riding me.|She realized who Mr. Right was.
{75058}{75080}Yeah, me.
{75092}{75124}That's a good one, Zeke.
{75128}{75200}Actually, she only wants to|see me now, exclusively.
{75208}{75242}lf you haven't already heard.
{75249}{75319}I don't know about that.|You see, Mia and I are in love.
{75323}{75360}Dream on, pussy.
{75368}{75427}Are you both so whacked in|the head you don't realize
{75432}{75462}she thinks you're total losers?
{75467}{75489}She wants me,
{75494}{75516}the "Z".
{75541}{75563}Oh my God,
{75568}{75642}You talk so much shit, Zeke,|you're starting to believe it.
{75646}{75674}She’s just a girl.
{75678}{75748}I thought you both knew she|didn't want to see you anymore.
{75752}{75820}-Like she wants to see you.|-The only reason I came today,
{75824}{75908}is I figured you two ignorant|dickheads finally backed off.
{75914}{75961}-Whatever, Zeke.|-Don’t whatever me!
{75976}{76060}There's other people here.|Take it outside.
{76064}{76138}I’ll fucking take it outside,|away from you two dicks.
{76146}{76222}-A bunch of fucking pricks!|-She wants me, asshole.
{76254}{76295}You remember that too, fuck-o.
{76301}{76377}Should I remind her of that|before or after I pull out?
{76422}{76442}Fuck you!
{76453}{76479}You little pup!
{76516}{76536}Dick!
{76580}{76643}Why don't you go home and|snap one off, you toss-off?
{76647}{76679}Fuck you, too.
{76700}{76730}Oh, my gosh!
{76741}{76761}Sorry.
{76781}{76809}Don't worry.
{76815}{76841}And besides,
{76847}{76890}it's not apple juice.
{76896}{76920}It’s pineapple.
{76972}{76990}That's it.
{76996}{77016}Forget it.
{77457}{77477}Hello.
{77488}{77549}Hi, my name's Eric...
{77569}{77641}and I’m a friend of Zeke,|Brad and Jonathan's.
{77693}{77711}Yeah?
{77746}{77826}Yeah, I just came to talk about...
{77872}{77921}what you're doing to my friends.
{77984}{78056}Most of it is|none of my business,
{78082}{78178}but you're completely|messing with their heads.
{78219}{78258}And I just want to know
{78265}{78357}how it is that you can|respect yourself,
{78369}{78389}doing,...
{78430}{78494}what it is that you do?
{78498}{78537}And what exactly is it that I do?
{78572}{78662}You're seeing all of my friends|at the same time.
{78675}{78726}You're fucking all three of them.
{78810}{78838}Is this Dunwood?
{78851}{78939}First, I don't see how this is|any of your business. And second,
{78944}{78995}you act like I’m doing this|on purpose.
{79004}{79103}You think I enjoy putting myself|and your friends through this?
{79108}{79188}Then why don't you just|choose one of them?
{79256}{79299}Look, I really...
{79320}{79381}I really like your friends.
{79405}{79466}Haven't you met a woman who's...
{79471}{79512}so special you didn't|want to lose her?
{79535}{79574}Well, no. I’m married.
{79595}{79640}So then you have.
{79685}{79736}Oh, yeah. Right, right.
{79753}{79775}Yeah.
{79786}{79824}Well, so have I.
{79840}{79906}Except instead of one person,|I met three.
{79910}{80008}I’m just asking you|to stop seeing them.
{80060}{80097}Why do you care so much?
{80121}{80145}Because.
{80213}{80235}Because why?
{80247}{80273}Because.
{80345}{80383}You got to understand.
{80428}{80485}I’ve been married for two years.
{80505}{80552}Two long fucking years.
{80556}{80607}I don't know if you know|what that's like,
{80612}{80683}having to spend every day|with the same woman.
{80698}{80753}The only thing I look forward to
{80758}{80809}is Sunday lunch with the guys.
{80823}{80880}And now that you've come along...
{80984}{81027}You're ruining me.
{81048}{81128}You've taken away the one thing|I have to look forward to.
{81148}{81195}And now I’m fucked.
{81241}{81311}I got no outlets.
{81410}{81444}Well, Eric...
{81474}{81494}Is it Eric?
{81554}{81580}I understand.
{81607}{81631}And...
{81638}{81677}I will take care of it.
{81700}{81722}Okay?
{82262}{82309}Just call me anytime, okay?
{83161}{83235}Look at that woman's tits.|Nice and high.
{83267}{83310}There's one for you over there.
{83314}{83361}You know a girl like that|does squats.
{83925}{83989}I find it amazing that men
{83993}{84065}go on forever without|actually buying toilet paper.
{84069}{84099}What do you mean?
{84103}{84169}For us, it's like an essential,|you know?
{84173}{84224}But men, they'll use anything.
{84229}{84268}Tissue, paper towels,
{84299}{84325}newspaper.
{84345}{84365}Sheets.
{84408}{84463}Sheets? That's a good one.
{84469}{84491}Hey, honey.
{84556}{84590}Man, this place sucks.
{84594}{84629}They don't have my Rough Riders?
{84639}{84655}All right.
{84674}{84704}I think this will do.
{84771}{84826}Honey, I don't think those are
{84830}{84873}the right ones.
{84897}{84921}Honey,
{84930}{84950}let go.
{84988}{85025}Don't you think that
{85030}{85067}these would be more comfortable?
{85072}{85090}What?
{85114}{85173}For me. I meant,|more comfortable for me.
{85177}{85216}-See? "For her pleasure".|-What are you talking about?
{85221}{85245}Excuse me.
{85432}{85462}What are you looking at?
{85530}{85585}Come on, baby.|It’s an emotional reaction.
{85658}{85717}I didn't expect to see you|around for a while.
{85724}{85777}To what do I owe the pleasure?
{85823}{85841}Well,
{85847}{85927}seeing as how you're|married, I was wondering...
{85973}{86028}What's it like to|settle down with a woman?
{86044}{86062}I mean,
{86080}{86121}does your life stop or what?
{86140}{86158}No, no...
{86163}{86243}don't get me wrong, I’m not|saying I want to do this now.
{86247}{86325}I’m interested in your thoughts|about living with chicks.
{86359}{86389}Wait a second.
{86394}{86455}You're not thinking of|shacking up with that ho'?
{86459}{86512}Don't be a dick.|Of course not.
{86519}{86549}I’m just...
{86569}{86608}you know, curious.
{86629}{86651}Well...
{86683}{86781}When you decide to live with|a chick, everything changes.
{86839}{86871}The key to survival...
{86881}{86913}is remember one thing.
{86933}{87013}That's that your life now|belong to someone else.
{87042}{87126}You'll notice things about your|daily routine that start to change.
{87158}{87244}For instance, the toilet seat shit.|It is a big one.
{87249}{87331}You've got to remember to|put that down or you're fucked.
{87337}{87400}Loraine almost left me|because I forgot that shit.
{87439}{87517}And remember to flush.|If you leave a floater in there,
{87521}{87551}you're a dead man.
{87607}{87637}And you got to
{87643}{87684}go easy on the gas.
{87693}{87777}I used to give Loraine|the Dutch oven every night.
{87804}{87870}Then she started slipping|laxatives into my dinner at night,
{87874}{87912}you know, for revenge.
{87919}{87989}I almost shit out my colon.
{88028}{88054}But I...
{88061}{88126}changed my diet after that.
{88130}{88156}For Loraine.
{88167}{88231}And I actually feel better|because of it.
{88255}{88323}All in all, living with Loraine...
{88327}{88372}sharing everything...
{88404}{88478}has got its advantages|and disadvantages.
{88502}{88549}Is that what you wanted to hear?
{88578}{88608}Yeah, man.
{88621}{88639}Yeah.
{88661}{88685}Thanks a lot.
{88802}{88839}We used to have this credo.
{88843}{88879}Bros before ho's...
{88910}{88951}pals before gals.
{88966}{89027}Don't get me wrong.|I definitely believe in
{89046}{89091}the institution of marriage
{89096}{89120}and family.
{89146}{89181}It’s just that
{89217}{89254}until I find the one,
{89263}{89339}nothing's wrong with chalking up|as many points as possible.
{89358}{89397}When I’m not closing deals,
{89422}{89452}I’m closing deals.
{89680}{89731}What the fuck's going on here?
{89758}{89801}Why are you assholes here?
{89834}{89856}Fuck you.
{89868}{89892}I was invited.
{89900}{89926}Where's Mia?
{89948}{90001}-What the hell you doing here?|-She asked me to come,
{90005}{90025}dick-suck.
{90031}{90061}Mia's in the shower.
{90066}{90109}What the fuck's going on?
{90116}{90181}I don't know, but I think|maybe Mia made her choice.
{90208}{90243}Then you guys can leave now.
{90254}{90286}This is good a time as any
{90290}{90362}for you guys to learn how|special our relationship is.
{90367}{90410}Man, you really are whacked.
{90418}{90446}Wait a minute.
{90462}{90501}I’m not sure, but...
{90507}{90542}it's definitely possible.
{90588}{90604}Yes.
{90608}{90706}It is a definite possibility.|I know why she called us here.
{90726}{90798}There's a good chance|she called us all here because...
{90817}{90833}because...
{90838}{90897}because she wants us all|to do her.
{90903}{90925}Together.
{90941}{90973}You know, triple team her.
{90982}{91021}She wants the fucking plan!
{91025}{91103}-You got to let that shit go.|-That is fucking ridiculous.
{91108}{91161}It could have been her fantasy|right from the start.
{91165}{91220}She's been seeing all three of us|for a few weeks now.
{91225}{91286}If she wanted to choose,|she'd have done so long ago.
{91291}{91321}She wants the plan.
{91338}{91401}She's in the fucking shower|right now soaping herself up.
{91445}{91525}She's cleaning herself up 'cause|she wants us all to bone her.
{91529}{91568}Would you have some respect?
{91572}{91608}My Mia doesn’t want the plan.
{91617}{91658}I know she wants to fuck me,
{91663}{91702}-but not you guys.|-Your Mia?
{91707}{91729}Come on!
{91739}{91755}Yeah.
{91760}{91780}My...
{91789}{91805}Mia.
{91813}{91858}Well, guys, believe what you want,
{91863}{91893}but I’m boning.
{91929}{91963}What the fuck is that?
{91975}{91995}That...
{92003}{92056}is what keeps the chicks|coming back to my man.
{92061}{92116}You got some fucked up shit|going on.
{92120}{92161}At least I got some shit going on.
{92206}{92261}What the fuck are you fag boys|looking at my dick for anyway?
{92293}{92342}Just put your pants|back on, okay?
{92355}{92389}I have to talk to you guys.
{92441}{92465}I’m serious.
{92475}{92522}What now?
{92649}{92717}I made a decision about something.
{92748}{92818}It’s the toughest decision|I’ve ever had to make.
{92822}{92883}I knew you'd come out eventually.|It’s okay.
{92887}{92932}Being gay is kind of hip now.
{92936}{92975}This is serious. It’s not a joke.
{92991}{93013}Just listen.
{93054}{93078}I love Mia.
{93159}{93191}And Mia loves me.
{93256}{93307}And I think I’m going to|ask her to marry me.
{93311}{93341}Are you kidding me?
{93359}{93425}I know this will have some|effect on our friendship,
{93434}{93518}but if you guys don't understand|my feelings for Mia,
{93572}{93610}then you're not my real friends.
{93644}{93660}Fine.
{93667}{93687}Fuck you then.
{93703}{93721}My God.
{93725}{93760}Mia does not love you.
{93765}{93824}Jesus, Jonathan,|you're so naive sometimes.
{93843}{93869}Yeah, you know what?
{93878}{93908}I could use a good laugh.
{93912}{93978}Why don't you go in there now|and ask her to marry you?
{93982}{94020}You fucking loser!
{94061}{94081}I’m going to kill you.
{94286}{94337}What the hell is going on here?
{94368}{94407}What the hell are you doing?
{94447}{94496}Put your pants on!
{94500}{94545}Are you guys out of your minds?
{94710}{94759}I’d say that the one thing...
{94763}{94816}that you can never be|prepared for,
{94828}{94864}with married life,
{94885}{94919}is the shopping.
{94941}{95005}It all seems to have something|to do with shopping.
{95009}{95062}There's always shopping to be done,
{95068}{95086}somewhere.
{95116}{95136}Shopping.
{95153}{95202}I’ve gotten into antiqueing,
{95207}{95264}but that's 'cause the chicks|are usually better looking.
{95276}{95309}My specialty...
{95339}{95429}when I was hanging out|with the guys and scamming,
{95440}{95501}was something called|"jumping on the grenade".
{95516}{95569}That's when you're out with|a group of guys and...
{95573}{95616}you meet up with a group of women,
{95627}{95670}or find a group of women,
{95674}{95760}and usually one of them is|a little less attractive.
{95771}{95801}This is the grenade.
{95808}{95824}And...
{95834}{95918}it would be my job|to jump on the grenade,
{95923}{95939}To sort of...
{95945}{95996}keep everything flowing|for the evening.
{96006}{96036}That was my thing.
{96087}{96134}And then I married the grenade.
{96190}{96225}I pulled her pin.
{96362}{96417}She just threw you guys out?
{96423}{96503}All because Tarzan over here|thought she wanted the plan.
{96508}{96532}He got naked.
{96553}{96617}How was I supposed to know?|All the signs were there.
{96640}{96693}And you never even found out|what her choice was.
{96698}{96714}No.
{96723}{96797}Then fag boy freaked out on us|and left the place.
{96801}{96850}Did you know he's thinking|about asking Mia to marry him?
{96867}{96883}No!
{96887}{96903}Yeah.
{96907}{96937}She'll never marry him.
{96954}{96974}Right?
{96984}{97010}Of course not.
{97017}{97037}Of course not.
{97047}{97071}Yeah, no way.
{97107}{97158}Here comes the princess now.
{97209}{97233}Hey, Jonathan.
{97238}{97252}Hey, dude.
{97298}{97349}I just want you guys to know...
{97364}{97446}that I officially do not|like you anymore.
{97485}{97559}From this moment on,|we are no longer friends.
{97565}{97606}-Jonathan.|-Just stay out of it.
{97611}{97627}Okay?
{97631}{97674}This is between me and them.
{97695}{97742}So I brought some things.
{97774}{97825}Here are your karate videos|that you lent me.
{97837}{97925}Sorry it took me so long|to return them, but I was...
{97930}{97946}busy.
{97989}{98023}You can have it back.
{98033}{98109}Every time I use it,|I think of you and get upset.
{98118}{98161}Dude, could I have that?
{98195}{98238}It’s a Boner Toner.
{98242}{98316}-Why don't you sit down and relax?|-Yeah, come and sit down.
{98321}{98374}I ordered you some waffles.
{98379}{98417}-And sausage.|-Come on, man.
{98428}{98448}Have a seat.
{98486}{98539}I’m not staying.|I have things to do.
{98571}{98630}Are you really willing to|give up everything we've got?
{98646}{98666}For Mia?
{98677}{98693}Yeah.
{98716}{98759}That's how much she means to me.
{99102}{99135}My God!
{99183}{99255}-What the fuck...?|-What the fuck is this?
{99537}{99569}Hey, you guys.
{99634}{99675}I know we have a lot to talk about.
{99686}{99739}But I’m kind of busy right now.
{99744}{99774}Who the fuck are they?
{99781}{99855}Guys I met in Italy last summer.|They're visiting me for awhile.
{99860}{99911}-Visiting?|-Yeah.
{99919}{99968}But I’ll call you guys later.
{99972}{99994}Later in the week.
{99999}{100019}Okay?
{100035}{100063}But Mia...
{100073}{100110}What's going on here?
{100125}{100151}I’m sorry.
{100166}{100192}I got to go.
{100267}{100331}I’m going to kick me some|salami motherfucker ass!
{100335}{100373}-Calm down.|-Fuck you!
{100377}{100444}Let it go.|They could be her cousins.
{100448}{100519}Cousins? Give me a break!|She's whacking that meatball!
{100523}{100572}Maybe they're very close cousins.
{100576}{100608}What? Mia?
{100631}{100667}She's letting them grab her ass.
{100671}{100716}-Where?|-Don’t worry about it, man.
{100720}{100792}All three of them are|grabbing her ass. What the fuck?
{100797}{100813}Mia...
{100817}{100876}That was the last time any of us|saw or heard from Mia.
{100893}{100936}She just kind of vanished.
{100948}{100983}I guess I should be angry.
{100991}{101034}She could've had the best...
{101041}{101057}me.
{101275}{101310}As for the group,
{101315}{101333}well...
{101366}{101413}we tried to get back in the groove.
{101426}{101498}I have to take a shit so bad,|and there's no bathroom anywhere.
{101504}{101534}I can barely hold it in.
{101538}{101597}Zeke was back to|getting robbed once a week.
{101630}{101671}The bastard was watching them.
{101726}{101796}Eric was still trying to find|creative ways to pork his wife.
{101829}{101923}Honey, ready or not,|here I come.
{101965}{102020}He'd do anything to stay|a part of the group.
{102024}{102046}And Jonathan...
{102054}{102072}well...
{102101}{102142}Let's see.
{102177}{102234}Who will it be tonight?
{102249}{102281}As for me...
{102290}{102314}Damn!
{102326}{102396}My sister never told me|how beautiful you were.
{102400}{102457}She's going to get it when|she gets in from Colorado.
{102462}{102494}Colorado?
{102501}{102546}I thought Jen lived in Boston.
{102574}{102600}Whatever.
{102666}{102719}Soon we faced the inevitable.
{102735}{102790}Our little tradition|began to disband.
{102812}{102844}Till finally,
{102860}{102896}it was no more.
{102976}{103014}We had never
{103018}{103075}let anybody get between us before.
{103080}{103150}I guess it took somebody|as special as Mia
{103168}{103217}to open our eyes
{103222}{103275}and make us realize
{103281}{103334}that women are|a lot more like us,
{103346}{103366}well..
{103384}{103437}a lot more like Zeke and Brad,
{103455}{103492}than we ever imagined.
{103510}{103542}I’m worried about her.
{103546}{103624}I know in my heart that|she's really hurting inside.
{103634}{103716}Brad was never, and I mean never,|fully hard.
{103727}{103770}Never? Why didn't you bail?
{103775}{103824}I really hope
{103831}{103861}she's okay.
{103866}{103890}It’s a package deal.
{103895}{103919}Evidently not.
{103966}{104017}So, did he ever get it in?
{104043}{104067}Sort of.
{104081}{104107}I’d say...
{104111}{104141}I kind of felt sorry for the guy.
{104159}{104175}I mean,
{104181}{104253}it was sad watching him struggle.|He'd just kind of,
{104263}{104279}I don't know,
{104324}{104396}bang it up against me,|like fucking "Rain Man".
{104423}{104499}I know, it's like fitting|a marshmallow in a keyhole.
{104516}{104565}-Like playing pool with a string.|-Okay?
{104571}{104653}How do you get|a condom on like that?
{104657}{104737}A condom? Guy needs a splint,|prop that shit up.
{104751}{104786}You know what’s even worse?
{104790}{104823}The guy had ass rot.
{104885}{104909}We're eating here.
{104915}{104945}I’m sorry, but he did.
{104954}{105005}Do you know why?|They don't know how to wipe.
{105009}{105027}It’s true.
{105031}{105084}And then there was Zeke.
{105090}{105143}Zeke was like downtown art boy.
{105147}{105171}You know what I mean?
{105176}{105233}The guy was so fucking|conceited in bed.
{105237}{105271}Right? And the irony is...
{105275}{105334}he had the smallest cock
{105339}{105376}I have ever seen.
{105380}{105449}It was all tip and no shaft.
{105453}{105483}I’m serious.
{105488}{105558}It was like an acorn|resting on his balls there.
{105594}{105678}Then to top it off,|the guy's a freak in bed.
{105689}{105715}He'd be like:
{105731}{105774}"Who's your daddy?
{105779}{105848}Who's your daddy?"
{105889}{105957}I think that was the most he|ever asked me about myself.
{105968}{106007}And then there was Jonathan.
{106033}{106088}He was harmless, Jonathan.
{106092}{106108}Yeah.
{106114}{106159}I could've hung out|with him a little longer.
{106178}{106229}Mia, you getting "emo" on us?
{106242}{106289}-Please.|-What's "emo"?
{106293}{106350}Emotions. Occupational hazard.
{106354}{106415}No, I just felt kind of|bad for him, that's all.
{106429}{106492}-Then again, he had it coming.|-Of course he had it coming.
{106497}{106515}Exactly.
{106519}{106572}Fuck this shit. I want details.|Did he have a big dick?
{106584}{106617}Come on, give it to us.
{106623}{106662}Package size.
{106683}{106705}Oh my...!
{106751}{106773}Come on.
{106812}{106875}Holy shit!
{106909}{106968}-Oh, baby!|-You go, girl!
{106983}{107038}Does he have cousins or brothers?
{107045}{107086}So is that all of them?
{107095}{107111}No.
{107116}{107159}Then there was also Eric.
{107164}{107209}The pathetic married friend.
{107213}{107272}Married, not married, married...
{107277}{107343}He comes over to my house,|giving me this sob story
{107347}{107433}about how it's my fault|his friends are abandoning him
{107437}{107488}-on their Sunday brunches.|-Which it was.
{107492}{107541}Of course, but I didn't|let him know that.
{107545}{107583}So what did you do?
{107619}{107641}I blew him.
{107645}{107708}Yeah! Who's your daddy now?
{107788}{107820}He actually tasted good.
{107824}{107875}-His wife probably reads Cosmo.|-Yeah.
{107880}{107929}Mia, you're a fucking pro.
{107939}{107992}Where do you find these guys?
{107998}{108067}When I saw them work on those|three girls in the park that day,
{108071}{108110}I knew they were the ones.
{108115}{108185}They had the bloated egos,
{108189}{108271}the look, the lines,|the whole nine yards.
{108280}{108316}Why are men such|fucking idiots?
{108320}{108383}I figured these guys out|in a matter of minutes.
{108387}{108422}They were perfect.
{108426}{108498}It was awesome watching them|scramble in their own game,
{108503}{108550}thinking they're|God's gift to women.
{108554}{108582}They didn't know what hit them.
{108586}{108637}The point is that it's fun.
{108642}{108670}I mean...
{108683}{108703}Yeah, it's fun.
{108708}{108763}Guys do it all the time.
{108767}{108831}You got to be willing to face|the consequences if you scam.
{108849}{108869}You know...
{108876}{108937}everybody fucks everybody|in the end.
{108943}{108976}You got to be prepared.
{108984}{109029}It’s the nature of the beast.
{109039}{109069}Next, please.
{109336}{109385}I don't know what you got|down here, lady.
{109391}{109430}It’s been clogged all week.
{109459}{109506}I think I got something here.
{109593}{109629}That's where it is.
{109638}{109658}Give me that!
{110015}{110056}Here comes Papa!
{111242}{111274}What the hell...?
{111288}{111368}I haven't been able to come|all week and that's why.
{111566}{111596}What's that smell?
{111601}{111621}What?
{111716}{111740}Never mind.
{111782}{111866}Just put your pants back on.|I got to talk to you guys.
{111884}{111914}I’m serious.
{111920}{111948}What now?
{112183}{112234}I don't care what the guys say.
{112270}{112286}Anymore.
{112291}{112329}They're always...
{112342}{112399}giving me shit about Loraine
{112403}{112452}and trying to cock block me.
{112457}{112516}Cock block is where, let's say,
{112520}{112583}you're in a bar and you're|trying to hit on a woman
{112587}{112656}and she's buying your shit.
{112662}{112688}And then...
{112709}{112787}one of your asshole friends|comes up and they're like:
{112793}{112867}"Hey, man. How's the wife?"
{112889}{112930}That's an instant cock block.
{112935}{112994}You cannot talk your way|out of that shit.
{112998}{113076}Why are you trying to pickup|women in bars if you’re married?
{113089}{113111}What?
{113118}{113190}I said, why are you trying to|pickup women if you’re married?
{113237}{113282}I mean, come on...
{113332}{113358}I’m a guy.

I've something to sing about now
and I want the world to know just why the moon's aglow
...why stars are winking up above.
I'm in love.
I've something to sing about now.
My heart is so full of song, just couldn't hold it long
I want to brag a little love.
 I'm in love.
I never knew why the robin spent hours
singing sweet little ditties to the flowers.
 I thought he sang just because it was spring la di da...
but now I know it was love for I have felt the same thing.
I've something to sing about love.
And someday I'm gonna try singing a lullaby
Who said that heaven's up above?
I'm in love.
And that was Tina Wyatt, featured vocalist with Terry Rooney and his orchestra.
And now it's time to say goodbye to our old friend Terry.
In a few hours Terry will be on his way to Hollywood to make a picture.
Good luck, Terry, and success to you as a movie star.
Goodbye, Terry.
Goodbye, Charlie.
Goodbye, Terry. Gee, I'm sorry to see you go.
What's the use of my sticking around here when he won't give you a night off?
I'm glad to see you go.
But I'll be back.
Bye, Terry and all kinds of good luck to you.
Goodbye, Joe.
Are we off the air, Mac?
Yep, it's all yours, Terry.
Thanks, friends, for a wonderful send-off.
As you probably know, Hollywood calls.
And I'm about to trade close-ups with Montgomery and Taylor... and uh... that other big good-looking fellow, you know, er... I mean... uh, Gable. and, uh, may the best profile win.
And now, by way of saying goodbye...
Hit it, you cats!
All I know is Terry told us to wait for him.
Any of you guys see the cover to this doodad?
You'd think that I might have been playing a fiddle.
What are you squawking about, Happy?
Suppose you had to carry a dog house around all your life?
Here we are, boys, here we go!
Gather around, gentlemen, and why!
Here we are.
Champagne, champagne and more champagne.
Let's get some chairs, and the trays and some glasses down there.
Come on, wrap yourselves around some of this champagne.
Champagne
Wow, what is all this?
One last drink before I go, boys.
Ah, success, success, success.
Let's get all our goodbyes done here.
Boy, this is goodbye in anybody's language.
We'll call it auf wiedersehen.
Now, look.
I don't want anybody to come to the train with me.
Oh, now, wait a minute, Terry.
No, no, no. I get embarrassed.
Standing around saying goodbye, goodbye, goodbye for a half hour.
Makes me self-conscious.
Anyway, I'll be back in a couple of weeks.
I don't know, if they get you out there in Hollywood and make one of those movie heroes out of you.
You mean I'm a cinch, can't miss?
I ain't kidding.
You wouldn't toy with me?
Hm-hmm.
Don't worry, I'll be back.
And meanwhile you're all set.
I've seen to that.
Anyway, I'm leaving Rita with you.
Where is Rita?
Rita! Rita!
I'll call her.
Call her, will you?
Hey, Rita.
Rita, Terry wants to see you.
Come on, canary, get your nose wet.
And, uh... You don't think I'm gonna leave my baby for long, do you?
Yeah, sweet, all for you.
For now, auf wieder all.
Good night all.
Here we go.
Hal, I've got a job for you.
Yeah?
Yeah, dig out the Wedding March in Lohengrin.
The Wedding March?
Still a good tune.
We'll give it a shot in New York.
You make a nice arrangement, something sweet and hot.
What do you wanna do with that old tomato?
Come on, geek.
What do you need, a blueprint?
Oh, I know what you mean.
You mean something like this.
That must be Rooney.
Come on, kids.
Terry Rooney?
Yeah.
I'm Hank Meyers, Publicity Department,
Galor Studio.
Glad to meet you.
How are you, Terry? Come on, kids, okay.
This is Jan, Joan, Eleanor and Dora.
How do you do?
Out of your clothes, kids.
Come on, we got work to do here.
Straight up, that's better.
We shoot from right down there, Eddie.
There you go, girls. Light it up.
Give me that smile now.
Hold it!
That's good.
Next.
Hold that.
That's good. Next.
That's the one. Hold that now.
Good!
There we are, That's enough, kids.
Into the coats.
I'm sorry.
All right. The cars are outside.
Okay, Terry.
A car for you, too. Come on.
Hi, Toots.
How do you do?
Good morning, honey.
The name's Rooney.
Mr. Regan?
Oh, Mr. Regan...
Yes?
Mr. Regan, Mr. Hank and Mr. Rooney are here.
Yes, sir.
Go right in.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
How do you do, Mr. Regan, I'm happy to see you.
No, that's not Regan. That's his secretary, Eddie Burns.
Well, hello, anyway.
Hi, Mr. Burns. How are you?
Mr. Regan is expecting you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Hi, B.O. Here's your new leading man for any old for "Any Old Love".
Name's Terry Rooney.
Hi, Mr. Regan. I'm very happy to be here.
Oh, so you're happy to be here, are you?
You're happy to be here.
Of course you are.
Hollywood is the natural goal of any actor's ambition.
You're wrong, B.O., he's not an actor.
He's a hoofer.
Hollywood is the natural goal of any hoofer.
And Bennett O. Regan will try to make you an actor.
Thanks, Mr. Regan, thanks very much.
Come over here.
Yes, Mr. Regan... Oh, I'm sorry.
Come over here at once.
Come to my office immediately.
In Hollywood, Mr. er...
Rooney, Rooney.
Yes, thank you...
In Hollywood, Mr. Rooney, we create.
We create not only pictures but actors and actresses as well.
We create and mold them.
We even try to mold hoofers.
Soon you'll find that out, Rooney.
Please, please don't turn away.
I'm speaking.
I'm so sorry.
The hair.
Do you always comb it that way?
I er...
Yes, yes I do, but er...
I can change it if it's important.
Important? Imp...
Important...
Here they are. Grief, trouble and worry.
Gentlemen.
Good evening, Mr. Regan.
This is Mr. Terry Rooney, who's to play the male lead in "Any Old Love!
Mr. Eastman, from the makeup department.
The hairline!
Gracious!
It belongs on an entirely different face, Mr. Regan.
Well, fix it!
So easily said.
Mr. Daviani, our wardrobe expert.
The clothes. Gentlemen don't wear clothes like that.
Of course, of course.
That's why I brought you in here.
Mr. Farney, our dialogue director.
Speak to me.
Why, it's er...
It's rather hard to think of anything to say.
Would you mind to repeat this once more?
I said it was rather hard to think of anything to say.
Once more, please.
I just said it was rather hard to think of anything to say.
Thank you.
Impossible. The diction. Those "rs".
It will take months.
And the voice is not in the mask.
I place him in your hands.
Gentlemen!
Yes, Mr. Regan.
You have work to do.
I want to shoot him in two weeks.
Yes, Mr. Regan.
You see what I mean?
In breathing you must remember the diaphragm.
Very important. Like this.
Why, I thought I knew how to breathe.
I've been doing it a long time, you know?
Please. Now once more for the diction.
See?
The duke blew on the hunting horn and he laughed, ha-ha, when the hounds came running.
Like that?
Yes, exactly.
Here we go.
The duke blew on the hunting horn and laughed, ha-ha, when the hounds came running.
Please, don't do as I say.
Say as I do.
A bit lower, lower.
Yes.
The duke blew on his hunting horn and laughed when the hounds came running.
Please, not, "dook", "duke".
I said "duke".
Not "laft", "laughed".
I said "laughed".
"Laughed"!
I want to hear those pear-shaped vowels.
Pear-shaped.
Which end of the pear?
The duke blew on his hunting horn and laughed when the hounds came running.
The duke blew on his hunting horn... Lower.
The duke blew his hunting horn... A little higher, please.
The duke on blew the hunting horn and laughed when the hounds came running.
The duke blew on the hunting horn and laughed ahhh!
Mr. Rooney, please!
Now, look. I'm a quiet, peaceful kind of a fellow and I'm willing to stand here all day and let you stick pins in me.
But one more tickle and I'm gonna break off a leg and wrap it around your neck for a scarf.
I'm sorry, but the coat must be perfect.
Hm-hmm.
The duke blew on his hunting horn and laughed when the...
Would you mind pulling your coat down just a trifle?
You pull it down.
Thank you.
The duke blew on his hunting horn... and laughed when the hounds came running.
Mr. Rooney, if you don't mind.
You distract me.
The duke blew on his hunting horn...
Was that pear-shaped enough?
You're just aggravating me.
Oh, who said?
I'm just whipping up a batch of pear-shaped vowels.
When I look at that hairline I could almost cry.
Wait a minute.
Just a minute. I want you to see this.
Now, it will help, you can take my word for it.
It'll help.
Now there.
The Robert Taylor...
Now look.
I've heard all I want to hear about Robert Taylor.
This pan of mine may not be anything to boast about but I'm not going to wear a widow's peak.
But I...
I've worn this face of mine a long time.
I've washed it, I've shaved it...
I've sung with it, and more than once
I've fallen on it.
And if Regan doesn't like it, I'm gonna take it right back where it came from.
But I will not wear a widow's peak.
Savvy?
Oh, Academy Award, eh?
Yes, the Academy Award.
Ah, how nice.
For which picture did you win it?
Well, we haven't won it for a picture yet but I thought it'd be nice to have it around to get used to it.
One gets used to so much in Hollywood.
Yes.
Never mind.
Steffie, did you see the rushes of Terry Rooney today?
Oh, yes, I saw the rushes of him.
He's all right, I suppose.
But, um...
All right!
But I am not interested in your baby stars.
No?
No, no, no, no.
For my leading man I must have an actor.
Well, of course, Steffie, I know that you have the privilege of choosing your leading men for your pictures, but in this case
I think you're making a mistake.
But I am not running a school for acting.
No, Steffie, you certainly are not.
I demand a supporting cast at least worthy of my talents.
Well, Steffie, we'll think about it.
Goodbye, dear.
Au revoir.
Hm? Oh...
The egotistical little mink coat!
What does she think she's doing.
Who does she think she is?
Take a letter.
Yes, sir.
Miss Stephanie Hajos, Galor Studios.
Dear Madam.
Where's Blaine?
On the set rehearsing Terry Rooney.
I gotta see him.
That sound ready?
Ready.
All right.
How about you, Terry?
Have you got the lines or do you want to run through them again?
I think I know them now.
We can make a shot if you like.
All right. Let's make a take.
Come on, come on, boys.
Hurry up.
Oh, that's all right...
Remember, pear-shaped.
Pear-shaped.
Come on, come on, let's go.
Very important.
Okay.
Oh, now, go away and let me alone.
Come on, let's go.
Will you get this thing out of the way, please?
Come on, now.
Quiet, please! Roll 'em.
Speed!
Action.
Oh, Holly. Miss Emily was supposed to be here at 8 o'clock, wasn't she?
Blaine. Mr. Blaine...
Cut!
All right, relax, everybody.
I saw the rushes this morning and the boy is great.
He's got it, Blaine.
He certainly surprised me.
But I don't want him to know it.
You've all spoiled Stephanie Hajos by telling her how good she was.
Now tell him he's no good.
How can you expect me to get a performance out of him if I continually tell him he's no good?
Well, tell him it'll take him five years to make an actor out of him.
But don't let him see the rushes.
And I'll fire anybody who tells him he's any good.
If I'm bad as they say in this picture as I am
I'm gonna do the sensational nose dive of the century.
It makes honorable master very happy to joke with humble servant.
It's no joke, Ito.
At least the director doesn't think so.
Yes, please.
Honorable master would like humble servant bring dinner?
No, thanks.
I'm sick and tired of eating in this joint.
Yes, please.
You know, Ito.... you're the only one around this studio who'll even deign to talk to me.
And all you can say is "Yes, please".
Would you rather that I spoke ordinary English, sir?
Was that you?
Yes, sir.
My former employers felt that the accent lent a certain dignity.
Now look here.
You're not gonna stand there in all this heat and tell me this Japanese lingo is an act.
Oh, very much so.
Pull up a chair.
Sit down.
I want to hear about this.
Tell me about yourself.
I came here aspiring to be an actor.
And they couldn't mold you, huh?
They didn't even try.
Tell me, how do you like being a gentleman's gentleman?
Oh, very much.
As an actor, it was a long time between meals.
What are you doing for dinner?
I know a place on Hollywood Boulevard where they serve wonderful wiener schnitzel.
Swell. May I come along?
It's rather embarrassing, but... there was a young lady that I had to...
Oh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't even have mentioned it.
Forgive me, will you?
Well, uh... You're probably late for your date now.
You better go on.
Oh, thank you, please.
Come on, Ito. Stop kidding me, will you?
Thank you. Thank you, please.
Will you go on. Go home.
The topper and the payoff.
A Japanese who speaks English better than I do... with a weakness for wiener schnitzel.
It's too much for me in my weakened condition.
Hello? I want to put in a person-to-person call to New York City.
Yes, please.
The phone's ringing! Hold it!
Rita! Hollywood's calling!
Hey, shut up, will you?
Let her talk on the phone.
Oh, hello, darling.
How are you, canary?
Darling! How are you?
Oh, lower than a whale's foot.
Silly. A whale doesn't have feet.
Did you ever see a whale's foot?
You'd be amazed.
Hm?
Oh, it was funny when I first got in.
I thought I could handle it but...
Kinda getting under my skin now.
Let's not talk about that...
I wanna forget it.
How are things with you?
We've written a new song.
You have?
Come on, sweetheart, sing it to me.
I don't care if it costs a million.
Go on. Shoot.
Wait a minute.
Wait till I get comfortable.
Okay, darling. Go on, render your song down.
Tear me apart. Go on.
It's costing him money. Hurry.
Ready?
Stop to ask the why or wherefore.
Wouldn't help me any if I would.
Only know that you're the one I care for.
Trying to reason wouldn't do no good.
 Right or wrong.
This I know.
Love is just like a strong undertow
that takes me wherever you go.
Marvelous, marvelous.
Right or wrong.
Right or wrong.
Your commands
are all that my heart understands.
I'm only a slave in your hands.
Right or wrong
When you're near
All my fears,
every doubt that I have disappears.
But sweetheart
when we part
the thoughts of my longing you start
Right or wrong.
Who can tell?
When each beat of my heart knows so well.
For life may be heaven or hell
I'll string along
Right or wrong.
Hang up, will you?
Listen, you're breaking my heart.
Any more of this and I'll cut my throat.
I'm that homesick now.
Will you please hang up?
No, don't make me hang up.
You do it.
All right. Boys!
Boys on this camera, listen to me just a minute.
I want you to take this boom up as far as it'll go and give me a shot of the complete set.
Got that?
All right, take your boom up whenever you're ready.
Hold the lights. Are we all set?
All set, Mr. Blaine.
Now listen, boys.
Everybody, please.
Hey, Rooney, don't play with the props, will you?
Andy, Andy!
Yes, Mr. Blaine.
Let's get to work. This is the last shot in the picture and let's get it right.
I don't want much of a fight here, but I do want it to be good.
You understand?
All right. Everybody on your toes now.
By the way, Terry, come here.
You've never staged a fight before, have you?
No, never have.
No fight, eh?
No.
Well, don't let it worry you.
It's perfectly simple.
Hm-hmm.
It's all a matter of camera angles.
You see, we'll get in an angle so that when he makes a pass at you it'll be like this...
Take it, let your head go back with it.
Do it again, huh?
All right.
Ready? Here we go.
That's it!
Simple as that, huh?
Simple as that.
Well, uh...
Tell me, do those other boys know how to do it just as well as you do?
Oh, yes, don't worry about that.
They've been doing it for years.
By the way, you're not afraid, are you, Terry?
Oh, no, no.
I don't care how hard they sock him.
I didn't make a thing he has on.
I hope somebody at last will knock a pear-shaped vowel out of him.
I hope so.
I haven't socked a green horn actor in months.
Get a load of this.
I heard you remark, son.
You're not afraid of us, are you?
Hey, would you do that again?
Sure.
It's all right.
You try one.
You want me to try it?
Yeah.
Close?
That's right.
Yeah, you'll do it.
Good enough?
You're okay.
Thanks.
Thanks very much.
Oh, too bad, too bad, too bad.
All right, come on, everybody. On your toes.
Let's quite down now.
Make this scene right.
Come on, boys, I want to explain this scene once more to you before we start to shoot.
Now, Terry, on camera you're coming down the stairway, you understand?
Joe and Eddy are hiding back there.
Oh, no like this.
I just itch to take a poke at that chin.
You should land, well, I should say about here.
Right about there?
Right about here.
Fine.
Okay? Fine, let's make a take.
Cameras ready?
Sound ready?
All right. Quiet, please.
Johnny, got your number?
I land right about there.
That's it.
That's fine, thanks.
Take your places now.
On camera.
Turn them over.
Speed!
Camera.
Cut!
Fine! Great!
Cut my foot.
Keep that traveler running.
Close that up.
Keep it going.
Up on high there. Get all this.
OK! Kill 'em!
Sock 'em!
Good for honorable master.
Good for honorable master.
Get this in your camera!
Hey, what's going on here?
I'll see you later.
One, two... three, four... five, six.
That does it.
Yeah, please.
Hello?
Hello, darling.
Well, I'm through.
Terry! Are you all right?
Now look, sweets, pop yourself on the first plane from San Francisco.
I'll meet you at the airport.
Oh, I'd love it.
Where are we going?
I don't know where we're going but it'll be far away from where they make motion pictures.
All right.
I love you, darling.
I'll be waiting.
Bye-bye, darling.
Bye.
I've something to sing about now
And someday I'm gonna try singing a lullaby
Who said that heaven's up above?
 I'm in love!
I didn't know anyone can be as happy as I am.
Where are we going now?
To the City Hall for a license.
Oh, sweet, I've got a  confession to make.
Well, if it's about another girl,
I don't want to hear...
No, no, it isn't that.
I've got to tell you that my name is not Terry Rooney.
I'll break the real one to you very, very gently.
It's uh... It's McGillicuddy.
What?
McGillicuddy.
McGillicuddy?
Hm-hmm.
But that isn't the worst.
The first name is Thaddeus.
Mrs. Thaddeus McGillicuddy.
Can you stand it?
I've always wanted to be Mrs. Thaddeus McGillicuddy.
And where are the McGillicuddies going on their honeymoon?
South Seas, we sail this afternoon.
And what's more?
We're going on a very exclusive, a very exclusive... tramp steamer.
Tramp steamer?
We're the only passengers.
That's wonderful.
There it is. How do you like it?
It's the most beautiful boat I ever saw.
How are you, lad?
Mrs. McGillicuddy.
How do you do?
Come this way.
Now listen Blaine, I want that Terry Rooney picture ready for preview and I want it immediately
But Mr. Regan, we're doing all we can.
We're working 24 hours a day.
Well, work 25 hours a day if necessary.
Now when do I get the picture?
In about three weeks.
Well make it two.
Cutting room.
When will the Rooney picture be ready for preview?
It'll take us at least two weeks, Mr. Regan.
One?
Hey, Harry, where's that close-up with Rooney in the fight sequence?
Look in the tin can.
Any old love, any hugs today...
Any old kisses that you want your way, say
I'm just the fellow to see.
A bona fide collector of anything to do with love
and if you should find a moon up in the sky
and love on your mind
babies, don't you cry.
Just say this till I come your way.
Hm?
Any old love today?
Oh, mister...
how about tonight?
Good, marvelous... I predicted that boy would be a star the minute I saw him.
Do you still want me to go on telling him he's no good?
By the way, Rooney ought to be here right now to sign his contract.
Is Terry Rooney up there?
He's not here, Mr. Regan.
Well, find him.
I'm waiting for him.
Good, good...
I'm getting tired of saying "good".
Oh, Hank, a terrible thing has happened.
We can't find him.
Terry Rooney.
He's disappeared.
He's gone.
We can't find him.
He's vanished.
Oh, I see.
And you're all afraid to tell Regan.
Now don't quarrel, boys.
Let me tell him.
Disappeared?
I hope the poor boy didn't commit suicide.
That's ridiculous!
Yeah? He got some pretty rough treatment around here.
I make a star out of him and you call it rough treatment.
Get on the telephone. Call his orchestra.
Call New York.
Hank, we've got to find that boy.
First, I'll have the harbor dragged.
Hank...
Hank, please, stop!
Hank, dear old boy, dear old pal...
I'm depending on you now more than I've ever depended on you before.
Hire detectives. Do anything.
But find Rooney and bring him here... before he knows he's a success.
Now hurry, hurry!
Maybe we best start with the morgue.
Good, good, excellent.
Good, good...
Hello! Hello!
Any news?
Oh.
Not a thing.
Hours of working, waiting, wondering.
And for what?
Nothing.
We're no nearer to finding Terry Rooney now than we were when we started.
Why do I have to be crucified like this?
Any news?
Plenty of news.
But it's all bad.
Nothing but mystery.
But I can't get the idea of suicide out of my mind.
Torture me with that word once more and you're through with Galor Pictures.
Oh, I'm just as anxious to find him as you are.
He borrowed 5 bucks from me the other day in the lunch room.
Five bucks.
Yeah.
Five dollars and I'm talking in millions.
Five dollars means a lot to me on my salary.
Hank, find him and I'll double your salary.
Agreed. He's found.
I mean, I'll find him.
Just a minute.
Is this some foul scheme of yours?
Are you holding out on me?
Oh, B.O. ...
I wouldn't do that.
Terry Rooney, where are you?
My Terry!
...change of bites, he bites left... brown boy against the ropes... right white boy...
Come on, white boy, that's it.
Oh, right...
Right, left, right and left...
Brown boy's down!
Eight, nine, ten, he's out!
Ladies and gentlemen, you've missed the most terrific fight in years.
Pandemonium, we're facing an uproar!
Man overboard!
Goodbye, McGillicuddy.
When you get to Chicago look us up, will you?
You bet!
Take good care of our little sweetheart.
I will.
See you in the next trip, Mac.
Isn't this a terribly expensive suite?
Yep.
Can we afford it?
No.
Do you care?
No.
Wait a minute, leave that on.
We're going out take a nice long walk so we can get our land legs.
Good?
Oh, you have such lovely ideas, Thaddeus.
Oh, Mrs. McGillicuddy. I strive to please.
In fact, I strive to please Mrs. McGillicuddy.
How do you feel now?
Oh, I feel much better.
Got your land legs yet?
Yes.
That's Terry Rooney.
Both of them?
Yes.
Hey, is there something strange about me?
People seem to be staring at me.
What is it?
Oh, it's because you're so beautiful, darling.
You think that's it?
Yes.
Well, it has been said.
Look what we have here.
One of those movie palaces.
Do you know that in places like these people actually earn a living making faces?
Really?
Absolutely. I know a man who did it.
For example, they do things like this, uh... the double take,
And then there would be the triple take which was, uh...
And the triple take with a slow burn... with a one-eye fade away, which was this.
And uh..
Do another one.
Another one? Well, there was the Charlie Murray, who always did this.
Now you see what a motion picture career can do for you?
That woman thinks I'm crazy.
Come on, make some more faces.
Not on your life. I'm through for the evening.
Is it my imagination or... or am I hearing my voice?
There's nothing strange at that.
You're talking.
That isn't what I mean.
I'm singing someplace.
Now, Terry.
No...
It's "Any Old Love" from the picture.
Ahhh, Mr. Terry Rooney.
Please, take this flower
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
It's coming from over there.
Why, look. They have pictures of you plastered all over the place.
Yes, darling. Things have been happening while we've been away.
But you didn't tell me they made any records of you.
They didn't. They probably took them from the soundtrack.
Hello, Mr. Rooney.
Your performance was lovely.
Thank you.
Very fine performance, Mr. Rooney.
Thank you.
Very glad you're back again.
Please, Mr. Rooney, may I have your autograph?
Yes.
May I have your autograph, Mr. Rooney, please?
Rita! Rita, where are you?
What's going on out there?
A fire, a riot or what?
Terry Rooney's out there.
Terry Rooney?
Yeah. Come on, let's get him and bring him in.
Mr. Rooney said that he'd meet you at the hotel.
Thank you.
Guess you know what that means.
Terry Rooney!
Get them out of the lobby.
Get me the Galor Studios in Hollywood right away.
Say, what is this all about?
It's about you.
Can you tell me where on earth you've been?
Yes, certainly, the South Seas. Why?
Why, he asks me why.
Give me that phone quick.
Hello?
Hello, this is the manager of the Belvedere Theater in San Francisco.
I've got Terry Rooney here in my office.
What... who...Hold the phone!
Rooney! Found him.
San Francisco.
Telephone.
What?
Yes.
Mr. Regan! Mr. Regan!
They found Terry Rooney. San Francisco.
Telephone.
Hello! Hello!
Give me that call for Mr. Regan.
Call the airport and have the fastest plane standing by for San Francisco.
Give me the phone, boss.
Nr Regan wants to talk to you.
Regan?
Yeah.
Hello, B.O.
Huh? What are you saying...
Oh, hello, Hank.
Where are you staying?
Have you talked to any reporters?
No, I haven't talked to anybody.
Nobody.
Well, nobody but a crazy manager, if that means anything.
Swell, don't talk to him. Don't talk to anyone.
Don't even talk to yourself.
All right, but... you ought to see what they did to my hat.
B.O. and I are leaving right away by plane.
Yeah, right away.
Just as soon as we can get to the airport.
Now for the love of Mike don't talk to anybody, will you?
Hide in the closet till we get there.
Here we come. Goodbye, kid.
Come on, B.O., let's get out of here.
The contract!
Thanks a lot!
Thanks for what?
For all the publicity I'll get out of this.
Gosh, Mr. Rooney, you don't realize...
I guess they must have liked the picture, huh?
Liked it? Liked it?
Hey, canary!
Yes?
Can you see it from there?
Yes, I can see it from here.
You can see from both of these.
Oh, darling. I'm so proud of you
I don't know what to do.
To think I married a celebrity and didn't even know it.
Oh, 'twas nothing at all.
Anybody in my place would have done the same.
You're not having a slight attack of swell head, are you?
Yes, darling, I'm afraid so.
I've got that good old feeling coming over me now.
You now owe me 129 million dollars.
Hm-hmm. Give me a bag-o-tail.
I'll settle for a box of candies.
You'll take chewing gum and like it.
Probably Hank and the National Guard.
I have to fix my hair. It's a mess.
You go get yourself fixed up...
I won't say anything about you.
You stage a surprise entrance.
Fix the door so I can hear a bit.
All right. Don't miss a word.
Who's there?
Mr. Regan to see you.
Regan?
Step right this way, sir.
Terry, my boy!
Hey, kid.
Hi, Terry.
Hank, I'm glad to see you.
Baby, when I say I'm glad to see
I'm just beginning to talk.
Say, Hank, I want you to forgive me for putting the slug on you the last time I saw you, but you know...
Forget that. I had it coming to me.
Where have you been?
I've been running myself bald looking for you.
Terry, here's the contract all ready for you to sign.
Now look, B.O., let's get our hellos over with have a little drink or something and then we talk about the contract later, huh?
While you're talking you just take a look at that money.
Better take a peek, Terry.
Did you read this?
Every word of it.
See those figures?
And you're worth every penny.
Do you know what that picture's doing across the street?
It's doing very well.
Very well? It's terrific!
Wait a minute, wait a minute...
I can't sign this.
What's wrong?
I just can't sign it.
Why?
Pardon me, I...
Oh, this is Mrs. McGillicuddy.
This is Hank.
Nobody knows his last name anymore.
And this is Mr. Regan,
How do you do?
But why can't you sign the contract?
The reason herself.
What has Mrs. McGillicuddy got to do with the contract?
Of course we don't know what arrangements you have with her, Terry but this is a...
Now, look, pulp head, you don't understand.
Rita is my wife.
My real name is McGillicuddy.
And it says in the contract that I must remain single.
Your wife? But you can't.
You can't have a wife.
But I have and I'm going to keep her.
Look at that thing, darling, that top clause there... it's silly!
Well, darling, if this is for just one picture we could go on keeping it a secret.
One picture, it's for seven years.
And look at the dough.
But I have an idea.
This is for so much money, why couldn't we take less and still be married?
Hang on to yourself, sweetheart.
Now listen, tell me.
What is this all about anyway?
Don't they have married people in Hollywood?
Why a silly clause like that?
Don't you understand? You're the potential heart interest of every woman in America.
It's your stock-in-trade.
Yes.
Isn't that charming.
You think I can handle it?
Oh, Terry.
Look.
If you think I'm gonna give up this gal for any movie contract, you are crazy.
You two are very nice and I thank you.
But we are going back where we belong with the band.
That's very sweet of you, darling.
But this is too important to decide that bet.
Why couldn't I go to Hollywood as just a visitor?
As Mrs. Thaddeus McGillicuddy.
What a moniker. Thaddeus McGillicuddy.
We like it.
Are you kidding, Terry?
No, absolutely on the level.
I'm sorry, Hank, but it was given to me while I was asleep.
Well, I'm glad you woke up in time to change it.
Well, couldn't I?
Couldn't you what?
Wait a minute.
I think I got it. Come here, B.O. Listen to this.
Come here, Terry.
Would you be willing to go down to Hollywood and go to work?
I mean, take a job, a cover-up job?
Why, certainly.
That's swell.
Now we have nothing to worry about.
Here's what you do.
You come down to Hollywood as Terry's confidential secretary.
Take care of all his personal affairs, fan mail and all that stuff, huh?
Hank...
Would you do that?
Of course, darling.
I think it's marvelous.
You're a genius sometimes.
Sometimes I think I deserve more dough.
All right, come on. Give me the contract.
Here you are, Terry.
Amateur! That nobody!
Hi, Daisy.
How do you do, Mr. Hank?
Glad to see you.
Well, good morning.
How's everything, Snooks?
Don't Snooks me.
What, I ask you, what is that?
What? Why, it's a bungalow.
Yes, I know. But whose?
Whose, why, I don't know. Let me see.
Don't stall with me. You know.
Do I?
It's Terry Rooney's.
Is it?
You know darned well it is.
Five rooms and three baths.
What, I ask you, is he going to do with three baths?
He's not running a laundry.
Although he should be.
Who lives here?
Mrs. McGillicuddy.
And this is her hideaway.
You remember Mrs. McGillicuddy?
Yes, I have a vague recollection.
And you come to see her.
Oh, do I?
Every night?
No, not every night.
The neighbors might talk.
Who?
The neighbors.
The neighbors.
Hm-hmm.
Who cares for the neighbors?
Shhh!
That'll take care of them.
Why don't you get some lights on in here?
Well, why don't you take off your glasses?
Oh, never thought of that.
You look silly in them anyway.
I suppose I gotta go on wearing these.
Well, Hank thinks it's a good idea.
I see.
Oh, and here's the stairway.
It leads to two of the cutest bedrooms you ever saw.
How many?
Two.
We can rule out the other one.
So you think I should carry him along, eh?
Help build him up?
Now listen, darling.
You come in with me on this... and I'll team you with Rooney for more publicity than you've seen in a year.
Get this. Hollywood's newest  love interest!
Do you like it?
Hm-hmm.
Why, they'll eat it up.
I adore it.
Good!
For Galor.
Good again. I'll get started with the story.
Leave it to me, honey.
Lots of publicity and a good story.
Just leave the whole thing to me.
All for me!
Cut! Cut! Cut!
Steffie, darling, what is the matter?
You're not giving me anything.
Can I make a love scene with a icicle?
He doesn't give me anything. Nothing!
Terry...
Oh, I know, I know it's bad.
Listen, I can give you the scene if you just get these people off the set.
Imagine that guy getting to have a medal.
Doesn't take long for their heads to start swelling.
That's not so.
Oh, you too, eh?
Listen, don't you go going gaga over that guy.
You're not in his class.
He only goes for stars.
Like Stephanie.
Oh, is that so?
Yes, that's so.
That was no tempering, Blaine.
Something upset me on the set.
I think I can give you the scene now.
All right, Terry, but look.
Warm up to Steffi a little bit.
She needs it.
All right, sure.
Uh, Steffie.
Yes?
Please forgive me for blowing up.
You see, you're such a very great actress and I'm actually no actor at all.
I never even expected to be on the same set with you.
I guess I'm a little bit scared.
It's so sweet of you to say those things to me.
Will you go through it once again with me?
I will.
All right. Let's do it once again now.
Come on.
Action!
But I can't give you up like this, darling.
But it is so difficult with things as they are now.
I can't give up hope. It's all I have.
Maybe someday in some faraway place.
No, no. No faraway place, darling.
No faraway place.
Here and now.
Here and now!
Is that what you mean?
Perfect!
The boy has talent.
Sorry, canary, I had to do that to you.
But I had to.
But the only reason I came on the set is because I haven't seen you for two or three days.
Yeah, I know.
I couldn't play that love scene when I knew you were there standing watching me.
I had an impulse to drop her and rush over to you.
Now I want to play a love scene with you.
Now, Terry...
You're not gonna try and run away from me, are you?
No, but I...
It won't do any good, all the doors are locked.
Someone may look in the window.
The windows can take care of themselves.
But Ito...
Ito's too smart.
Hi, Terry.
Don't you ever knock, chump.
I see you're rehearsing the little scene you told me about. Looks good too.
A critic, huh?
Well, I'm glad you like it.
Thanks, it certainly does look good.
I'd like to have you know Miss Robbins.
How do you do, Mr. Rooney?
Oh, how do you do, Miss Robbins?
How do you do, I'm very happy to meet you.
We were just going over the fan mail situation.
Oh, I thought it was a rehearsing.
Well, yes and no, you see.
Sometimes they rehearse while they're running through the fan mail.
Oh, I see.
Yes, I'm glad you do.
Mrs. McGillicuddy, will you run and see if the mail is ready to sign, please.
Right away. Pardon me.
Thanks.
She's my confidential secretary.
Very confidential, I expect.
You'd be surprised.
And very pretty too.
Yeah, we think so, don't we, Terry?
Well, for a secretary.
But then again the... average run of girls around here have very high standards of looks, you know.
If you'll excuse me, I'll run inside and get out of this collar... before it cuts my throat.
Go right ahead. Take your time, Terry.
Wait a minute. What are you up to now?
Just a little blind item for my column.
What rising young star was caught making love to his pretty secretary?
Now listen. If you print that story, you're going to ruin two lives.
What lives?
Yours and mine.
Oh...
First of all, if you print it,
I'm gonna sock you on the nose.
Oh...
And if I sock you on the nose,
I'm gonna lose my job so figure it out.
But it's a story.
Yeah? Well there's a bigger story than that around here... if somebody was bright enough to spot it.
What?
Listen... do you think Terry Rooney would be fooling around with a funny little secretary with a glamorous dame like Stephanie Hajos here in the studio?
Oh, Hank!
Yeah, you better sharpen your pencil.
That's very interesting.
Now. There's one thing I'm sure all our readers will want to know.
What is your ideal of feminine beauty?
Well, I er...
That's a funny thing you should ask him a question like that.
You know, Terry was saying to me only this morning that his idea of feminine beauty is Stephanie Hajos.
A little less statuesque then Venus de Milo, perhaps.
More delicate, possibly. More flaming.
Am I right, Terrence?
Exactly my words.
In fact, practically verbatim.
How lovely!
Now, Mr. Rooney... won't you tell me what was your first, your childhood love?
Well, you see, what Terry...
Oh, Hank, may I handle this one, please?
Well, my first, my childhood love...
That goes way back, way back...
In fact, she was the dog catcher's daughter in my home town.
And every time my pooch was snatched...
Your what?
Every time they snatched my pooch...
Oh...
She'd get it back to me by hook or by crook.
In fact it happened so often that her old man began to think my dog was quintuplets.
One of the characteristic things about Terry is his love for animals.
Particularly dogs.
Please, honorable master, excuse humble servant.
Oh, they want me on the set?
Thank you, please.
Well, I'm awfully sorry to break up this luncheon this way
It's was awfully pleasant.
It's been delightful.
You will come again, will you?
Oh, yes, thank you so much.
I've enjoyed it. And anything you want just call Ito, he's here.
Hank, thanks so much.
What a quaint servant. What's his name?
Uh, Ito.
Ito.
Oh, he adores Terry.
Why, when Terry disappeared we had trouble restraining Ito from committing Charlie Cary.
Or a Harry Carryl.
Nice interview, huh?
Did you get everything you wanted?
Plenty.
Having Hog's tea?
Hi, Terry boy, how are you feeling?
Oh, fine.
Good. Here's your tickets.
Tickets for what?
Tickets for the opening of part you're playing tonight.
You're taking Stephanie.
Oh, yes?
I'm not going to any opening tonight.
What do you mean you're not going to any opening?
I am not going to any opening tonight.
I've been working for a week on this.
The reporters, the photographers, they're all gonna be there. It's important to me!
Now look, you can save yourself all that.
I am not going to any opening.
Oh, stay and let me talk to you, why do you want to act like this for?
Wait a minute, what about Stephanie?
You can take her and put her back in the woodwork.
Don't be so unreasonable.
When I say a thing is important it's important.
I can't just stand...
Now look!
I've got a wife and I like her.
And I'm gonna see her once in a while.
Cut out that wife stuff, will you?
I am not going to any opening!
Come here and listen to me, will you?
What do you want to be such a bull head?
Billy, call Mr. Regan on the phone and tell him to go right over to Rooney's bungalow.
Yes, sir.
That boy's going nuts again.
Get me Mr. Regan's office.
Quick! Certainly it's important.
Now, Terry, why don't you do this for me?
You know what I do for you.
Why, I've worked my head to the bone to put you on top.
And I'd cut my arm off to... off to here to keep you there.
Having me run around every night with
Stephanie Hajos is keeping me on top, huh?
Say, what am I, an actor or a stooge?
I'm supposed to be an actor.
Well, at least that's the rumor.
Well, if I'm not good enough,
I can always go back with the band.
And something tells me
I'd be a whole lot happier if I did.
But Terry, you've got a duty to the...
I've got a duty to myself and my wife.
And that fine elaborate scheme you worked up in San Francisco isn't gonna work either.
It's got me and Rita absolutely insane.
While I'm out to previews, and openings and cocktail parties and testimonial dinners, all for the glory of your dear old Galor, she sits up in the hill swirling her thumbs.
She isn't yelling, is she?
No, she's too good a sport for that,
But I know how she feels and I don't blame her.
He's right, B.O.
Of course he is.
We've been entirely unfair to Rita.
I can see now the whole situation has been a terrific strain on her.
Terry, will you let me do something?
With your permission, may I?
Hank, get a drawing room to New York.
Wire the office there and get a reservation to the best hotel and get tickets for every theater in town.
Right.
For Rita.
Now what kind of a solution is that?
Wait a minute.
That's only half the plan.
Terry, when you finish this picture
I'm going to a four weeks' vacation.
To go to New York and be with Rita.
That's great, B.O.
There you are, Terry.
That solves the problem.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Let me understand this.
You promise me four weeks off after I finish this picture?
Yes.
Four weeks?
Successively?
Successively and positively.
If you go to the opening tonight.
All right.
That's great.
Fine, Terry.
That's swell of you, B.O.
See what a grand time those two kids are gonna have on those four weeks.
What four weeks?
Every time I put this vest on I think of Regan.
All front and no back.
What time do you think you'll be home?
Oh, I don't know, darling.
You know how these things are.
I may have to stay in town if I expect to be on the set at nine in the morning.
Do you have to go?
Well, you know, practically a command performance.
Darling, listen to me.
This isn't going to work out trying to live this way.
I know that.
It's a dog's life for you and...
I don't mind telling you that it's getting the best of me.
It's driving me crazy.
Look, darling. We've got an idea.
How would you like to go East and visit your mother and see the boys while I finish the picture?
I could join you in, say, three or four weeks and then we could go someplace together where nobody ever heard of pictures.
All right, if you want me to.
No, wait...
I didn't say I wanted you to.
I just thought it might be a good idea.
That's what I mean.
What are you doing?
I'm not going.
Oh, yes, you've got to go.
I am not going!
But you made a promise... and you mustn't break it.
Here, get into this.
Sure you understand?
Perfectly.
I've hurt you, haven't I?
No.
Well, you don't like the idea of going East.
I really haven't given it much thought.
You said you wanted me to go...
I did not say I wanted you to go.
Oh, I must have misunderstood.
All I meant to say was that Regan promised if I went to the opening tonight, you could go East and I could possibly join you later. That's all!
Well, then, by all means go!
What is the matter with us?
Here we are standing here arguing like a couple of children over nothing at all.
No, nothing. You've arranged for me to go East, that's all.
And I'm going.
I did not arrange for you to go East!
Oh, put on your coat and go to your opening.
I have a lot of packing to do anyway, and you'd only be in the way if you stayed.
I probably would.
Hi, canary.
Well, Rita, hello, how have you been?
Where have you been?
Oh, just a little trip to California.
I see the boys are still here.
Yes, they're still here.
Why I don't know. Look at this business.
Do you mind if I go up and say hello to them?
No, no, go right ahead.
Rita, stop in my office and see me before you go, will you?
Thank you.
Who's doing that?
Somebody's singing.
Sounds like Rita's voice.
I want to croon
Then I found you
it was love from the start
and I traded my heart
for an angel
from out of the blue.
Rita, when did you get back?
So glad to see you!
Mr. Richards, can we have five minutes, please?
Can you have five minutes?
You're taking it, aren't you?
Go on back and get your hellos over.
Baby, when I heard that voice
I knew who it was right away.
Boy, am I happy.
Is she coming back to sing with the band?
We ought to ask her to.
Yes, I saw Terry in Hollywood.
Everything is coming along beautifully for him and he's coming East in about four weeks.
Is there any truth to the stories the paper about him and that Hajos dame?
Just a lot of press agent drool.
You're sure?
Well, I know the press agent.
Boy, I'm sure glad to hear that. We were all beginning to get worried, weren't we?
Yeah, we thought... well, you know what he said when he left the band.
About you being on the West Coast and everything...
Stop kicking me, will you?
Well, I guess I'd better go in and get the piano warmed up...
Telling her isn't going to be easy, you know.
But you must.
I can't stand the idea of hurting her.
We have reached the point where you and I are the only things that matter.
That's the way I feel, you know that, don't you?
Hm?
Cut!
That's swell.
Print that!
Can that pair play a love scene?
Why not?
Terry, I'm proud of you.
Those pear-shaped vowels were perfect.
Bless your hearts, children,
I could kiss you both.
Don't you kiss me.
I'll let Steffi do it for me.
Why, gladly.
I think we are wonderful.
No doubt about it.
Come on, let's go in and say hello to Terry.
Hello, Mr. Rooney.
Hello.
Amy, darling!
Hello, Steffi.
That last scene was a knockout.
You liked it?
Terry, you know Miss Robbins, of course.
Yes, sure.
We'll book for an interview Sunday.
Sunday?
Oh, yes, that's right. Sunday it is.
We'll have a good long gab this time.
Very happy to see you.
If you'll excuse me, I gotta go change my tie.
Bye-bye.
Miss Robbins, wouldn't you like to sit down?
How's the play coming?
Excuse me, Mr. Blaine,
I'm going to steal Amy from you.
Oh, yes, of course.
Amy, will you come with me while I fix my makeup?
You have an interview with me today.
I have something most exciting to tell you.
Why, Steffi!
Something about Terry and me.
Where does it go from here?
Fine bunch of musicians.
Have a girl run your band.
Oh, I guess we missed her.
We miss Terry too, of course, but...
Terry? You can kiss him goodbye.
He's cooked.
What do you mean?
Haven't you seen the paper?
No.
What's the matter? Is he hurt?
Stephanie Hajos reveals engagement to Rooney.
Sensational dancing star and exotic actress plan to make their real romance real... when their current picture ends.
I thought something terrible had happened.
This is just more silly stuff.
Doesn't look like silly stuff there.
Don't be ridiculous. Besides, it's impossible for him to be engaged to Steffi.
Why is it impossible?
Because we...
Well, we hadn't intended telling you until he came East but... we're married.
Married? Why didn't you tell us?
We thought you were working out there.
Hey, wait a minute. How can they print about him being engaged to her... when all the time he's married to you?
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
Give me that!
All right, take your places, girls, please.
Come on.
Oh, come on, girls, please.
Blaine.
Just a minute, Hank, please.
I wanna talk to you, Blaine.
All right, what is it?
Relax, girls.
You've seen this, haven't you?
What?
Well, she certainly laid it on thick.
Yeah, but you can read that later.
Now, listen.
Nobody has got to Terry with this yet and nobody's gonna get to him.
I've got both doors guarded.
That boy'll kill me if he sees this story.
Why should he kill you?
As a publicity gag it's all right.
Yeah, but there's a lot more than you can see, you can take my word for that.
Murder is the least he'll do to me.
Where's Stephanie?
I don't know. she's not working today.
I know that.
Did she happen to say where she's gone?
No.
Well, she's not home and I've paged every beauty shop in Hollywood.
The girls already in waiting?
Oh, yes, please.
Well, well.
Very cute.
Very cute.
Oh, do you like it?
Oh, Mr. Blaine.
Hm?
Is this the one I'm supposed to marry?
Oh, no!
My luck.
Hi, kid, how goes it?
Well, what dirty press agent trick are you up to now?
No, you're wrong.
I'm working on a high spiritual plane.
I'm praying, my boy.
Praying, huh?
You'll never know how hard I'm praying.
How nice for you.
Well, what's doing?
Who's murdering who today?
Oh, nobody murdered anybody. Gimme that.
I'm doing a crossword puzzle.
I'll get you another one.
You ain't mad, are you?
No.
All right.
I'm ready whenever you are.
All right, Terry.
My dear Terry, I want to be the first to congratulate you.
On what?
On what?!
Get out of here!
What is this?
It's B.O.'s orders that you're not to be disturbed while you're working.
He oughta know better than that.
Congratulations, Terry, my boy!
Say, what is the matter with you?
There's nothing the matter with me.
It's an old superstition... that an actor can't be congratulated until his picture is finished.
He oughta know that.
Mr. Rooney...
He's out?
Yeah, he's out cold.
Take him outside and give him a little air.
That's all he needs.
I brought it for your scrap book...
Wait a...
So this is what you've been doing.
You're trying to keep this from me.
I'm not trying to keep anything from you, Terry.
My word of honor.
I've nothing to do with this.
Your idea of publicity.
My idea of nothing.
Take my word for it, Terry.
I have nothing to do with it.
Nothing to do with it.
And I thought you were my friend.
I am your friend.
Let me explain a thing to you.
I haven't anything to do with that, you gotta believe me.
Let me explain it to you!
Will you go away?
Where's Ito?
Ito!
Ito...
Follow Mr. Rooney to his bungalow and beg him to stay there till I come, will you?
Yes, sir.
What a day and what a life!
Mr. Hank, Mr. Hank!
Miss Hajos just drove up to her bungalow.
Miss Hajos?
That lets me out.
Hold everything!
See you later, Daisy, you're excused.
I don't know whether to kill you for that story or... kiss you for showing up.
How dare you!
Oh, don't give me that how dare you stuff today, Steffie.
You got me in a jam.
I only did what you told me to do.
I got Galor Studio a million dollars' worth of publicity.
I certainly didn't tell you to say you were engaged.
Do you mean to tell me that he objects to being engaged to me for a few weeks?
Objects? He does nothing but object!
I, Stephanie Hajos, the great star, condescends to link my name with this hoofer?
And he objects? He objects?
I won't speak to him again.
I won't even finish the picture.
Tell him in public I am through.
Oh, you're through all right.
Unless you go with me to Terry Rooney's house and tell him you're responsible for this.
You'll go if I have to drag you by the hair of the head.
You can't talk to me like this.
I never wanted to smack a woman, but...
I'm awful close to it right now.
Go ahead and strike me, you woman striker.
Oh, Steffie, I didn't want to have to tell you this, but I suppose I'll have to.
The boy is married.
But why don't you tell me things like this?
Because we were trying to keep it a secret.
Trying? It seems to me you have succeeded.
Now, you don't want to hurt
Terry and his wife, do you?
I don't want to hurt anyone.
I've been hurt so many many times.
I know what it is to be hurt.
I will go with you.
But please...
Please don't scold me anymore.
Oh, darling, you're a haywire dame.
But I love you.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Come on, Steffie.
We want Mr. Rooney.
Terry!
Terry Rooney!
Where is he?
Honorable master, he no home.
Cut off the honorable master stuff.
He's no home, huh?
Any idea where he went?
No, sir, please.
Did you phone the studio?
No, sir, please.
What good are you around here?
No, sir, please.
No, sir...
Hello, give me the gate.
Why didn't you follow him when he left the stage?
No, sir, please.
No, sir...
Has Terry Rooney come back to the lot?
What don't you do something?
No, sir, please.
Why don't you beat it?
I resent your tone.
I came out to Hollywood to be an actor, not a servant.
I shall go. In your own vulgarism,
I shall beat it and I shall not come back.
I bid you good day.
Did you....
I bid you good day.
Oh, grand pappy's cracking up under the strain.
I fear poor old grand pappy's going nuts.
Get on the wire, Rita, will you?
Rita, will you please call him?
All right. If it'll make you fellas any happier.
You'd think he was your husband instead of mine.
Am I worried?
No, I'm not worried, but you're...
Hello, I want to put in a person-to-person call to Terry Rooney at the Galor Studios in Hollywood.
Yes.
You're going to see how ridiculous all this is.
Imagine doubting Terry.
I thought he was gonna get us in his second picture.
Oh, but Candy, it wasn't that kind of a picture.
There wasn't a band in it.
Every picture's got a band in it.
A least a fiddle.
No?
Well then, try Hollywood 12521.
Yes.
That's our hideaway.
It's the cutest little house.
Hello?
Hello? Is Mr. Terry Rooney there?
Who is this speaking?
This is a friend of his.
Hello?
What's the matter, Rita?
You win.
That was Stephanie Hajos at the house.
Gee, I'm sorry, chicken.
Don't be.
I can't stand people being sorry for me.
At our hideaway.
He took her to our house.
Our house.
It's like the old saying.
As you sow...
So what?
I'll get it.
Hello, Mr. Richards.
Well, how are you boys?
Would you really like to know?
Yes, and how's the little lady?
Oh, swell, she's fine.
Well, hello there. I'm glad to see you.
We finally got the break at last.
It's on the front page of every newspaper in town that Mrs. Terry Rooney is singing at the Palomino Roof.
How did you know I was Mrs. Terry Rooney?
Well, I overheard you telling the boys on the stage and uh... while I was standing in the bar a newspaper man, a friend of mine, overheard me mention it.
Well, Mrs. Terry Rooney is not singing at the Palomino Roof.
Oh, now listen, girlie...
And don't call me girlie.
If you think you can use us just because you overheard what I was telling the boys, you're wrong.
Now listen.
For one night only. Just for tonight.
I'll give you a thousand dollars.
Every table has been reserved by telephone.
We sold out before we opened.
There'll be a riot if Mrs. Terry Rooney doesn't appear.
Get out.
Oh, now, listen...
She said out.
And, brother, she don't mean in.
Oh, so that's the way it is, huh?
Well, now let me tell you fellows something.
You get down there and get those instruments before they hit the ash can.
Boys, you'd better go with him.
Will you be all right?
Just sit tight, chicken. Everything's gonna be all right.
I'm gonna get my flute...
Mr. Rooney, may I congratulate you?
I hope you'll have a lot of happiness.
Is something the matter?
Is there anything I can do for you?
No, thank you.
I can't think of anything that would help.
Oh.
Well, do you still want us?
Do I still...
It'll cost you 2 thousand bucks for the night and we knock off at 12:30.
Oh, listen to reason.
Give us a quick yes or no.
Yes.
And in advance.
Boys, you can trust me.
And in advance too.
Okay, Maurice!
Maurice, hurry up.
Get those waiters ready.
Get some more tables and the flowers.
Let's see. You want eight uppers, eight lowers and a compartment, right?
No compartment. I'll take a lower.
All right. Go on, boys. Get ready.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please?
I take great pleasure in personally introducing to you
Mrs. Terry Rooney.
Right or wrong
this I know.
love is just like a strong undertow
that takes me wherever you go.
right or wrong.
I've never seen the moon
out shining in the sky.
But why do I want to cry?
I guess it's just 'cause I
can't convince...
All these are going to car 43 down at the station.
The trunks are down there already.
All right. I'll get a couple of men to help me.
that's what loving you is for me.
I love you, I do.
My whole life is yours.
The reason for my smile,
for loving all the while.
All right.
Hello, Holly. Who's doing all the travelling?
We all are. We're getting out of here.
Where's Rita?
She's on, doing her number.
She's going along with us.
Wait a minute, Terry, I wouldn't interfere.
She's made up her mind.
Made her mind on what?
About getting out of here.
Now look, you go in there and tell the boys to start my music.
I can't do that, Terry. She told me...
Get in there and tell the boys to star my music!
Come on!
I've learned it from your own lips.
Though life may be heaven or hell
I'll string along
right or wrong.
Hit it, you cats.
Come on, canary, get into your cage.

Ooh.
Wow. That's really nice.
It's, um... like, fruity yet...
Diabolical.
Wow, the Elysian sunflower's a nice touch.
Mm. Are you going to be back this afternoon?
Well, if this stuff works,
I won't even be gone the whole hour.
Oh, like Danny needs perfume for motivation.
No, this is a real test.
I'm going to be invading some very sacred space.

- Hey.
Right on time.
Always.
He's, uh... up on 28.
Okay.
Here you go.
- What a gentleman.
- Yeah, that's me.
Thanks.
All right.
You guys going to be long?
As long as it takes.
Yeah. Long.

What is that?
It smells better right here.

- Yes.
Well...
Body temperature releases the scent.

For research purposes,
I'm going to...
Wow.
Wow, I just love your dedication to science.
Step on over here in my private office.
What is it with women and elevators, anyway?
Beats the hell out of me.
Boy, would I love to find out.
Yeah.

Okay. It's okay.
So, how'd the Giants do?
Won. They won five in a row.
We should go when they get back from these away games.
Yeah?
Oh, don't forget about tonight.
No excuses.
We both agreed that date night cannot be canceled, and I have planned something very special.
The architect's coming by today.
I may have to... um...
...leave the meeting early so that I can make it home in time for our special once-a-month date night.
Listen, I've got to go.
Okay. Ooh, you're quite messy, hon.
Bye.
Oh, can you go by the cleaners, drop off that stuff?
Just say "Him-ho-tie-yan-ting- yah-law."
That means, um, "Not too stiff.
Tomorrow, I pick up."
Him-ho-tine... tine-yah-ting-yah-law?
Hon, it's him-ho-tie-yan- ting-yah-law.
T-ting-yah-law.
Him-ho-tie-yan-ting-yah-law.

- Law!
- Law! Thank you.
Make sure you got 'em...
So, uh, you do it anyplace interesting lately?
Your house with Julie.
Oh-ho, no wonder she's been in such a good mood.
I mean, what is it with you and Jennifer and this spontaneity thing?
She's been trying to come up with a... aphrodisiac she can sell at the shop, so she, uh... she surprises me in the weirdest places.
Well, that's too much pressure for me.
I mean,
I need a little... warning before the wife requires my services.
Yeah, like a week, ten days?
Yeah, that'll do it.
You know, some of the guys think.
Jennifer's trying to get pregnant.
You guys are talking about my sex life.
No, we talk about Jennifer's sex life.
I mean, we'd leave you out of it if we could.
Admit it... I got a great love life with my wife, and it drives you guys crazy.
It does seem a little unnatural.
Feels very natural to me.
Ow!
Who the hell is that?
That is Lindsay Hamilton.
That's the architect who designed this building?
Yeah.
I thought Lindsay was a man.
Well, if it is, that's some damn fine makeup.
Hi, boys.
Uh, where can I find your boss?
Well, mine's at home with the kids, but, uh... you know, if there's something special you want to do,
I could always call and ask permission.
Cute, but I'm in a bit of a hurry, so if you could just point me to Mr. Robertson...
I'm Danny Robertson. Hi.
Sorry.
Plans are up on 28.
I'll just wait down here.
That elevator really only accommodates two comfortably.
By the way, my name is Steve.
Good old Steve.
I agreed to date night, not to humiliate myself in a karaoke bar.
Excuse me, sorry.
Right here, right here.
That's it.
T... This is a booth?
Oh, sure.
It's a Japanese booth.
Oh...
Oh, a Japanese booth.
Okay, one free song with each order of sushi.
Mark selection on the card, then you give it to me, okay?
Uh-uh... arigatou,
I'm pretty sure not everybody in here's as bad as we are, Jen.
I know, hon.
De... Well, have some sake.
Look, drink menu.
Hon, do you have a pen?
Oh, you're not going to sing, are you?
Honey, we are going to sing.
Sakes are coming, hon.
You know, they're... they're very good.
Yeah.
Yeah, the crowd is really loving these songs.
Did you pick something good?
Yeah. Motown, hon.
Here.
Oh.
Next up is Danny and Jennifer.
Come on, hon, we got to sing Motown.
Here we go.
Honey, this isn't Motown.
Love.
Love will keep us together.
Come on, hon.
Think of me, babe, whenever.
Some sweet-talking girl comes along.
Singin' a song.
Don't mess around, you just got to be strong.
- Just stop.
- Stop.
- 'Cause I really love you.
- 'Cause I love you.
Stop
I'll be thinking of you.
Look in my heart and let love...
- Keep...
- I love you.
I love you, too.
Oops.
Let's go, pal.
One moment, sir.
You reading a book?
Hi.
Hey.
Hey.
Your essential oil shipment came in.
Really? Where?
Oh, thank God.
Okay.
Right.
Clearing apprehension.
Ooh, I really needed that.
What do you have to be apprehensive about?
Well, I've got this new neighbor.
I've been trying to get his attention for weeks.
Finally, this morning, he asked me to bag my garbage tighter.
Hey, I know it's going to be a challenge,
But I don't know, there's something about this guy.
I really like him.
Do you know anything about him?
Yes, I do.
He's a mortician, and he looks great in black.
That would be a job requirement.
Hey, don't be a smart-ass.
Honestly, I want to try to get to know him more.
I want him to notice me.
Well, you could always get naked and put a tag on your toe.
Tried that.
What I need is if you wouldn't mind mixing up some of that perfume you made for you and Danny.
And use up the Bohemian hibiscus at $50 an ounce?
I'm going up against formaldehyde.
I need the good stuff.
Okay, okay,
I'll do it when I get back.
Where you going?
More love in the afternoon?
No. I'm four days late.
But my pregnancy test was negative.
I'm going to go see Dr. Felber.
He's always so comforting.
Is Danny... ejaculating?
What?
Is Danny ejaculating?
Of course.
Are you sure?
Do you actually see the result?
Are you thinking that my husband is faking orgasm?
It is possible, you know.
You do it to us, uh, so I've been told.
But that makes no sense.
Danny loves sex, and he's not opposed to having kids.
He just doesn't want the process to take over our lives.
Jennifer, many young couples get overwhelmed by the stress of trying to have a child.
A positive frame of mind is just as important as your physical health.
But I think positive.
I've always thought positive, long before it was popular.
That's the way.
Convince yourself.
Now is the time, this is the month.
You will conceive.
But are you sure there's nothing wrong with me physically?
Have you run every test possible?
Don't let your insurance company hear you ask me that.
Please, I have to be sure.
So that I can be positive.
Hey, Danny, what are you building over there?
Holly, I have no idea.
Danny, it's not such a big deal.
We said I'd get off the pill,
I got off the pill.
But building a nursery is not the next logical step.
It goes no pill, pregnancy, then nursery.
But I'm going to be pregnant.
See, that's the whole point.
It's positive thinking.
Yeah, but that's not the point.
The point is we said we weren't going to think about this at all.
We said we were going to... we're just going to let nature take its course, and if it happens, then great, it happens.
Then we build the nursery.
But sweetheart...
So, how are things going with the mortician?
Thank you.
He happens to be out of town.
He's at a cremation convention this weekend.
Oh. Sounds like a very hot time.
Will you stop with the mortician jokes?
You're killing me.
How's Operation Positive going?
Thank you.
Well, negative, so far.
Well, maybe you ought to think about adding another layer of positive action.
Thank you.
I saw this in the Chronicle,
Hi. How are you?
Great. Say, Danny,
I want you to know when your baby comes,
I'm available for baby-sitting.
I know I'm only ten, but I'm very responsible for my age.
I'm captain of my soccer team, and I almost made straight "A's" last report card.
And my rates are very competitive.
That's quite impressive, Holly, but I don't think we're going to be needing a baby-sitter soon.
Mr. Babyproofer says it's never too early to start thinking about the safety of your baby.
Holly, who's Mr. Babyproofer?
He just left, but he's coming back.
He says your deck is an accident waiting to happen.
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.
Jen, what's wrong?
I just got my test results from Dr. Felber.
Yeah?
I'm fine.
You're fine?
Oh, honey,
I'm a little confused.
Help me here so I know what to spray you with.
Well, if it's not me, it must be Danny.
Oh.
Well, now, you're just jumping to conclusions.
Just because there's nothing wrong with you doesn't mean there's something wrong with Danny.
Maybe your timing's just been off.
Nancy, for the last six months, our rhythm has been better than a percussion section.
Well... well, maybe it's just what Dr. Felber said.
You're just putting too much pressure on yourself.
Yeah, you just got to take some of that pressure off.
You got to just... breathe.
Just breathe, yeah.
You just got to breathe.
Is this like Lamaze?
It's time you became familiar with some nontraditional methods of improving your fertility.
Jennifer... whose are these?
Um, they're yours.
No. No, no, I... I can't be dangling loose in boxer shorts, honey.
I work around power tools.
Come on, honey, I bet half the guys at work wear boxers.
Yeah, and you can tell who they are.
They've always got their hands in their pockets, walking around adjusting themselves.
Where are my Jockeys?
I got rid of them.
You got...
Well, boxers are so much sexier.
Jennifer, I wear Jockeys.
I mean, that-that's what I do.
That's what I've always done.
I mean, it's-it's really who I am.
Well, just... set yourself free, hon.
I got to rinse.
Holly?
Hi.
Hi.
- Two dozen, right?
- Right.
Thanks, Jennifer.
My soccer team loves your peanut butter cookies.
Oh. Anytime.
We've got another game this Thursday.
Well, then I better be baking some cookies.
Thanks.
It's a good batch.
They're all crispy on the bottom.
The kids always love your cookies.
Wait up.
Damn.
Mind if I join you?
No. Not at all.
Have a seat.
Oh, um, actually, would you mind if I just borrowed
Danny for lunch?
I have a few things
I need to talk to him about.
Oh, sure, yeah.
I was just finishing up.
So... there you go.
Uh, I'll, uh, meet you up top in half an hour.
Aren't you going to eat your lunch?
Oh, it's empty.
I thought the prop might make things a little more comfortable.
I didn't know you were uncomfortable.
Yeah.
You make me a little nervous.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
You make me a lot nervous.
What did you want to talk about?
A job.
What kind of job?
In Seattle.
There's an old building that a group of investors plans to renovate, and it only has four elevators.
It needs to have at least six, and they need to move faster than the people walking the stairs.
A lot of elevator companies up there in Seattle.
I meant what I said the other day.
There's not a lot of honest subs out there.
I'll let you know.
Thank you for the offer.
You're welcome.
I'll be right back.
I'm going to go downstairs and get a drink.
Don't go to sleep.
I'm almost ready.
Ready.
Two pages, and I finish this chapter.
I'm finished.
Wow.
Hi.
Hi.
Oh, no.
I have something very special planned for you tonight.
Just lay back.
Hmm.
God, it's been a while since you did this.
Yeah.
It's like riding a bike, hon.
You don't forget.
Those boxers do slide off easy.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, God!
What the hell are you doing?
I-I just heard it was supposed to turn you on.
No more daytime television.
Okay.
Sorry. It's all gone.
Okay? Again?
Just wait.
Ready?
Okay.
Hey.
Yeah.
If you have any matches,
I want them now.
- Ow.
- Easy, easy.
We usually prefer to collect the semen sample ourselves.
Do you need this back?
Oh, no thank you.
Real butter's better for you.
I know this isn't the usual procedure, but it's so hard for Danny to get away from work.
He wanted me to bring in this sample and get the results.
Did you run all the tests?
Yes. I've... I ran the tests.
Jennifer, I'm not very comfortable going over these results without Danny present.
It's highly unusual.
It's not very ethical.
Well, Danny and I don't keep any secrets from each other.
Yeah.
I'm a little disturbed by some of these results.
I'd like to make an appointment for Danny and you with a friend of mine who's a fertility specialist.
Have an expert run some tests.
Of course.
I just have to check
Danny's schedule.
Hi.
How was your day?
Good.
You know, I was thinking today,
I'm-I'm fine with all this... baby stuff, you know?
If you, if you need those things to help you think positive about getting pregnant,
I mean, it's-it's fine by me.
Now, personally, yes, I think you might be overdoing it a bit, but
I'm willing to play along, if it works for you.
Dear Mr. Ricardo,
My husband and I are going to have a blessed event.
I just found out about it today, and I haven't told him yet.
I heard you sing a number called 'We're Having a Baby,
My Baby and Me.'
If you will sing it for us now, it will be my way of breaking the news to him.
Isn't that wonderful?
Of course I'll do it for you.
Sure.
Hey... Oh, wait a minute.
I got a wonderful idea.
Why don't we bring the couple up here, and I'll sing it right to them, huh?
Come on, let's bring them up on the floor.
Come on, folks.
Come on. We're just trying to wish you luck.
Who is it?
No?
No?
Hiya, honey.
Hi.
Oh...
Honey, oh, honey.
Honey, no.
Yes.
- Really?
- Yes.
Why didn't you tell me?
Well, you didn't give me a chance.
- Are you kidding me?
- No...
It's me.
I'm gonna be a father.
How about that?
I want you to meet my mother.
I mean, my wife, my wife.
Do your song.
What?
Do the baby song.
Do the baby song.
San Francisco Center for Fertility.
Hi.
We're the Robertsons.
We have an appointment.
We want to have a baby.
Isn't that nice?
Now, fill out everything in detail.
Including the questionnaire on your sexual history and past drug use.
When you're done, just stay seated.
I'll call you.
I-I'm sorry.
This is kind of, uh...
It's kind of personal stuff.
I'll be happy to let you read mine.
Don't say a word.
I wondered what happened to that woman from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,
Surviving sperm begin the journey up the uterus to the Fallopian tubes.
Meanwhile, inside one of the two ovaries, an egg is ripening.
The ripened egg bursts out of the ovary, an event called "ovulation."
Propelled by tiny finger-like projections on the ends of the Fallopian tubes, the egg sweeps into one of the tubes to await fertilization.
That comes when a surviving sperm begins to beat against the clear membrane that surrounds the egg.
As soon as one of the sperm breaks through, the membrane toughens, so that no other sperm can penetrate...
Okay.
How you doing?
First time?
It's our third clinic.
Ten years.
Three tubal pregnancies.
Scarred Fallopian tubes.
Gonorrhea in '89.
PID.
Pelvic inflammatory disease.
Very painful.
Welcome.
I'm glad you're here.
Starting this process is a big step for couples.
We're pleased that you've chosen us to help you.
Overcoming infertility can be time-consuming, expensive, not to mention, a little embarrassing at times.
Yeah, uh, time out here.
I'm-I'm sorry.
Uh, there's a mistake.
We're not infertile.
Jennifer just went off the pill a few months ago, and her... her doctor thought it'd be a good idea for us to come down here and get a... a couple of physicals before we really, really start trying to get pregnant, so you-you should check that chart there.
I see.
Mmm.
Oh.
Well, if that's the case,
I think it is better that we get started right away.
Yeah.
Anatomy.
Nature.
Soft porn.
Not-so-soft porn.
Deviant behavior.
Women with men.
Women with women.
Miscellaneous.
Clean linens here.
Soiled linens there.
Lotions and creams here.
Remote control here.
And the emergency call button here.
Come in.
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you, but there's a problem with Danny.
He's been in there more than 20 minutes.
Oh, well, that's not that long for him.
Aren't you the lucky one.
Yeah.
Hon, it's me.
Um...
Wow.
Pretty nice spread, huh?
I particularly like the section on deviant behavior.
Oh. I'm sorry.
I know it's hard for you.
No. That's... kind of the problem.
It's been a while since I've done this without you.
I know.
Hey, look at this.
Good morning.
You have no idea how good a morning it is.
Last night, I had the most incredible sex of my life.
With the mortician?
I have never met a man who knows so much about a woman's body.
Well, he has had his hands on a few.
We go out to dinner, right?
After dinner, he asked if I want to see his business.
Forensic foreplay.
And I'm, like,
"Do I want to see his business?"
And then I think, if I really like this guy, and I do,
I'm going to eventually have to see his business.
We've had a few glasses of wine,
I think, what the hell, so I say, sure.
Before I go in, I dab on a little of that perfume of yours.
Next thing I know, bottles are crashing to the floor, clothes are being ripped off, and there's cold steel pressing against my bare back.
The cold steel, mind you, of an embalming table.
Could you just die?
Nancy.
I mean, it was that perfume of yours.
You really got to go up in there and mix up a batch right away.
We're selling that stuff.
Yeah. Right away.
I'm telling you, I need it tonight, too.
I'm afraid the test result are not good.
I knew Dr. Felber was keeping something from me.
Honey, we said we wouldn't get emotional.
Jennifer, it's not you.
See that, it's...
What do you mean by that?
We have carefully tested you for potency, consistency, count and visibility, and the result are not very encouraging.
Wh-What do you mean not very encouraging?
I... I am potent.
He is very potent.
Extremely potent.
There's a mistake down at your lab or a contamination problem.
A contamination problem.
Like the police DNA labs, they do it all the time.
Did you check that little "use by" date?
It was no mistake.
You have what we refer to as "lazy swimmers."
Please... sorry... don't call them that.
You are producing sperm, they are just not making it to the mother's egg.
Well, give me something.
Some... vitamins or steroids.
You can inject me with steroids.
I mean, something to make them better swimmers.
I think it is important that we consider alternative method to get Jennifer pregnant.
I made a decision.
I'm going to give you one of my kids.
Maybe if they weren't fully grown and they looked more like Julie.
Please, look,
I know they're a bit past prime for adoption, but I think this is the only way
I'm ever going to get the little bastards out of my house.
I'll give you the pick of the litter.
It's tempting, but I kind of wanted to start from scratch.
Form one in my own disgusting image, you know?
Well, suit yourself.
But a lot of it's overrated.
Come on, Steve.
People say that the best moments of their lives are, you know, with their children.
Well, those friends should also tell you that children are also responsible for the worst moments of your life.
Would you stop it?
No, I'm telling you.
Wait till you have a daughter, this beautiful little bundle of joy with a ponytail and freckles, a vision who stares into your eyes with love and admiration, who begs you to read her a story before she goes to bed or take her for a walk in the park, a little person whose skin is so soft, you can't believe it's real.
I mean, she's perfect.
And then, one day, when she's about... 15 or 16, she's going to walk through your front door with a pimple-faced little shit with 20 earrings and zero manners and she's going to proceed to tell you how much she loves him because he reminds her so much of you.
Now, this, my friend, will be one of the worst moments of your life.
And boys are worse.
You see, the moment your son is born, it is inevitable that he will be responsible for the most depressing day of your life.
That's the day that that son of yours brings home a girl that you're attracted to.
The whole process is so unnatural.
I mean, there's doctors and nurses and technicians.
Yeah, I've never been comfortable with group sex.
I just got to stop worrying about it and think about the big picture, you know?
I got to pee before I drive across that bridge.
I don't know how I'm going to pay for it.
I mean, the woman says it could be a half dozen times till we're successful.
I can barely cover the first round of fertilization.
After that, we're over at your house borrowing your and Julie's turkey baster.
Just think Seattle.
What about Seattle?
Old building,
Lindsay Hamilton, big payday.
She's been after you for weeks to take that job.
Now, see, there's something very... very dangerous, I think, about Lindsay Hamilton and Seattle.
Oh, don't flatter yourself.
Me and Lindsay Hamilton... that would be dangerous.
You got a little bit on your boot there.
Have you really tried group sex?
Eh, only if you count two hands.
Lazy... fucking...
...swimmers.
Mmm.
Hi.
I'm glad you're home.
Promise me something.
Huh?
Anything.
When we finally have a baby, it'll have a smile like yours.
Love you.
Okay...
Almost there.
Yeah.
Tell me I'm better in bed than this thing.
Oh, there's no comparison, hon.
Oh.
Now you may feel this a little bit.
Oh.
Just relax.
Oh.
Now, relax.
Relax.
Can you feel it cold?
All right, almost done.
Almost done.
All right.
We're finished.
Wasn't so bad, really.
Now what?
Now, we wait and see if the pregnancy hold.
In the meanwhile, don't let this thing run your life.
- No.
- No.
Mm-mm.
Hi, John.
It's Richard.
Listen, I want you to check on that little shop on California that we talked about.
It's busy, yeah.
Okay, listen, you just got to relax a little bit now.
I mean, this is just a very preliminary meeting.
They just want to talk to us about the formula.
Just kind of get to know us a little bit, that sort of thing.
It's no big deal.
Mm-hmm. If it's so casual, why did they call three times to confirm?
All right.
Let me just do a little.
Okay, good.
Okay. Let's just...
Let's just... come on.
All right? All right?
Better.
Just a casual, get-to-know-you chat, huh?
Well, maybe it's not our meeting.
Ladies.
Welcome.
I'm Richard Halstrom.
You must be Ms. Tellen.
Oh, well, that's right.
Hi. And you must be
Mrs. Robertson.
Yes. Hello.
Please, come.
I've asked our executive committee to join us, just in case the conversation gets serious.
Oh, God, this is our meeting.
Everyone, I'd like you to meet Mrs. Robertson, and Ms. Tellen.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Right this way.
Here you are.
Thank you.
Hi.
Please, sit down.
- Us.
- Okay.
I hope it wasn't too much of an inconvenience for you to come on such short notice.
No.
No.
Not at all.
We've been watching your little shop for quite some time.
What you've done down there is very impressive.
We're particularly impressed with that new perfume of yours.
What do you call it?
Seventh Scent.
Ah... that's a wonderful name.
Great for marketing.
Well... the reason we've asked you here today is simple:
We'd like to buy Seventh Scent.
No kidding.
I have taken the liberty of drawing up a term sheet that I think you'll find quite attractive.
Please.
This is a very interesting first offer.
That is quite a bit more than a first offer,
Mrs. Robertson.
Well, then, I guess you won't be needing your executive committee this afternoon.
Thank you.
Come on.
Oh, no, put that away.
We won't be needing that, we're way too far apart to be able to make this deal.
Are you sure?
They're really nice.
Put it down.
Wait a minute, what happened in there?
Did your contract say $100,000?
Because I know that's what my contract said.
Hold on... did you see the people around that table?
Believe me, if they'll pay us $100,000 today, they'll pay us
$200,000 next week and give us profit participation.
Crowded.
Sorry.
Floor...?
Are you sure?
Pretty sure.
Oh, God.
You don't exactly inspire confidence as my elevator expert.
Well, they told me you're on five and a half, so.
I was actually looking for you.
Oh, the first good news
I've had all day.
Yeah, I was, uh, thinking
I might be able to squeeze that job in up in Seattle.
But I'll need more money.
Ten percent more.
Done.
We should go up there right away for you to look at the building.
Uh, sooner the better.
Yeah, I actually would like to go up there alone.
It's kind of my style.
I like to see a building by myself the first time.
You know, kind of get a, um, feel for the place, see if I... connect with the building, that sort of thing.
Connect with the building.
Yeah. Uh-huh.
Let me know when you want to go.
I'll have my office make the arrangements.
Sounds great. Thanks.
You're never going to believe what happened.
Hey, I got some great news
- at work today.
- Okay.
- I'm sorry, you go first.
- You go first.
No, you.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
Uh, I... I think I have a way to pay for the, uh...
...clinic bills.
- Really? How?
- Yeah.
The architect on this job offered me a building up in Seattle.
It starts before this one finishes, and I saved them some money so I gave them a rate...
I'd, uh...
...I'd go up in the next uh, you know... week or so, and if everything pans out, our financial problems are solved.
Well, that's great, honey.
Thank you.
Yeah.
It was... what happened to you?
Oh, well, uh, today,
- at the shop...
- Yeah...
...we sold 100 bottles of Seventh Scent.
It was out first hundred-bottle day.
100 bottles, that-that stuff, it's-it's starting to take off.
Yeah, it really is.
Dinner is almost ready.
I know you're anxious, so I'll get right to it.
We did not succeed the first try.
I know you're disappointed.
We should try again right away.
Jennifer, I'm going to prescribe a fertility drug for you.
I thought we were going to concentrate on the in-vitro.
We are, but there's always a chance that you might get pregnant the conventional way.
You're still practicing the conventional method, aren't you?
Uh...
- Yeah. Of course.
- Yes.
Yes, we are.
We're conventional about every night of the week,
I think.
Good.
I'm going to write that prescription, and Danny, I need you to check in with Nurse Wheeler.
We need another sample.
Go, stud.
You might want to check out that new video,
Romancing the Bone,
Danny? Danny, the clinic just called.
They said you're late for your appointment.
Damn it.
I got to go.
If I'm not back in 45 minutes, send help.
You've only got five minutes.
What?
I'm locking up at 6:00 sharp.
You're not the last man I'm seeing tonight.
Should I just meet you down at the nurse's station?
I'll be right here.
30-second warning.
Well, maybe we should take a couple of months off, kind of chill out and then try again.
Remember, this may take a couple of visits.
It doesn't always work the first time.
Now don't say that.
You know important it is for us to think positive.
Yeah. Sure. Whatever.
Yeah, smile.
Now, d-don't-don't do that.
Don't... don't do that.
Billy, I've told you never to talk to strangers.
Unbelievable.
Cute kid, lady.
Well, I, uh, need to get back to the shop.
Yeah, I should, uh, probably get back, too.
So, I'll see you tonight?
Yeah, yeah, I'll-I'll, uh...
Maybe I'll pick up some Chinese, or...
Sure. That'd be great.
Yeah.
So I'll see you then.
All right.
Bye.
Don't run too far ahead.
Okay!
Oh! Finally we can call it a day!
Gosh, success is hard work.
Hey... cheer up.
Everything's going to work out.
I hope so.
I'm just handling things so badly with Danny.
I just want so badly to be a mom.
You will be, and you'll be a great mom.
I hope so.
I'm having trouble being a good wife.
I'm not sure I can handle both.
Well, it's a lot easier handling a two-year-old than it is a husband.
I know because, of course,
I've had neither...
...of them.
Aw...
Thanks for being such a great friend.
Aw...
It's perfect, as usual.
Well...
I want to thank you ladies for accepting my lunch invitation.
I was a little worried you might not be willing to accept, because of our first encounter.
Well, we're always willing to discuss a legitimate business opportunity, Mr. Halstrom.
We just didn't think your first offer was good enough.
You made quite an impression on the room.
None of us had ever been one-upped quite like you did it.
She was pretty great, wasn't she?
I mean, God,
I would have taken the offer.
Well, as I'm sure
Mrs. Robertson already knows, it's a very good thing for you that you didn't.
I have an improved proposal to make.
This one I think you'll find worth reading.
We're prepared to pay each of you $250,000, plus a very fair royalty for every bottle sold in perpetuity.
Define "very fair royalty."
Uh, 17 and a half percent gross sales, plus escalators and success.
And what about spin-off products using the name?
Oh, you'd control the name, but we handle all production under the same terms.
And for products that you do not manufacture?
Well, we'll negotiate that deal together and split the royalty
And if we do not agree on the deal?
Uh, well... we'll concede to your judgment.
What about additional fragrances under the Seven Scent brand?
Uh, we, um... we have to have them.
But I-I would agree that, uh, the royalty will be slightly higher for new fragrances... especially if they have similar side effects.
Well... I think this is something our executive committee would consider.
We'll take it under advisement immediately.
That's good news.
To two very beautiful women.
And to the scent that will make them rich.
Oh!
Oh!
I'm so sorry.
Sorry.
Ms. Hamilton is running a few minutes late.
She'll join you shortly.
This is quite a place.
Thank you, sir.
Do you take those two-for-one dinner coupons?
Don't get up.
They loved you in Seattle.
I might be able to get you a little more than that ten percent raise.
Well, thank you, uh... for this.
This was really, uh...
Dinner was great.
This was really nice.
Oh, no, thank you.
No, you've really been a savior to me.
I'm glad you finally let me take you out to dinner.
So...
Would, uh... would you like some dessert?
Uh... you know, I...
Actually, I think
I'm gonna have to, uh... to-to pass.
It's ge... It's getting late.
Oh, are you sure?
Uh, oh, yeah. I'm sure.
The tiramisu, you know, is so good...
Yeah, I'll tell you what.
I'll send the dessert cart over for you, okay?
They pour the espresso on it...
Yes, yes! I gotta go.
It's really...
Gotta run.
Danny?
A little more this way!
Could be any Danny Robertson, for God's sakes.
Any Danny Robertson?
Any Danny Robertson.
Any Danny Robertson?
All right, look.
There's gotta be an explanation.
Maybe the doctor made a mistake with the bill.
A mistake?
I don't think so.
There was a... graph charting my freezability levels.
Hey, look... it doesn't make sense.
How in the world could she have you analyzed even before you go to the fertility clinic?
And why?
I don't know why.
But I think I figured out how.
And even you don't want to hear this one.
All right, look.
Before you do something you'll regret, talk to her.
You and Jennifer are great together.
You don't want something stupid to happen over a misunderstanding.
You boys gonna come out and play?
They're holding up the meeting for you.
Just coming.
This is a meeting about what?
How the elevator goes up, or how the elevator goes down?
Hey, Steve, can you, uh, can you cover for me?
There's somebody I need to have a little... talk with.
Yeah, sure.
Catch up with you guys a little bit later, huh?
Okay.
Anything I can do to help?
No, I'm okay.
I meant with Danny.
I don't think so.
That's a little sexist, isn't it?
What?
The assumption that a woman can't just be a friend to a man.
Oh, I'm sure if you wanted to, you could just be his friend, but I'm just a little worried that's not all you want.
You know, when it comes to a woman like you... we're all just boys.
My guys told me come back tomorrow morning.
7:00 a.m.
Is Danny meeting us there?
I haven't told him.
I know, I know.
I'm going to tell him soon.
It's just that he's been so down about this business with the clinic, and I think the only thing keeping him going is that he's earning the money to pay for it.
I just don't want to take that away from him.
Good intentions, bad decision.
Come on. We better get going.
Richard will be here any minute.
What are you doing?
Uh, no big deal.
Just going to Seattle for a couple of days.
I could go with you.
Huh.
No.
It would be better if you didn't.
I should have told you about the shop.
Do you realize that in all the time
I've known you,
I've never once thought about the idea of you lying to me?
Ever.
I'm sorry, Danny.
I see.
Truth's a hard thing to hide, isn't it, Jennifer?
I'm sorry, I'm probably confusing you, right?
Did I mention that I found
Dr. Felber's bill for my test that you never even told me about?
I didn't mention that, did I?
First my potency, now my memory.
You didn't have to lie to me,
Jennifer.
I love you enough to handle the truth... whatever it is.
When will you be back?
When you're ready.
We are now boarding.
TWA flight 514 to San Diego.
Is everything okay?
You seem a little distracted.
No, I'm fine.
Okay. Do you mind holding my boarding pass?
I'm just going to run to the ladies' room.
Sure.
Hi.
I'm glad
I caught you before you left.
Jennifer, what are you doing here?
Well, I wanted to say good-bye.
I wanted to wish you luck.
Thank you.
I've done a lot of thinking since you left.
You're right.
You can handle the truth.
And I've missed you.
I missed you, too.
I'm back.
Jennifer, this is, uh, Lindsay Hamilton, the... the architect.
Lindsay, this is...
- Jennifer.
- The wife.
Oh, nice to meet you.
Uh, Danny's told me so much about you.
Really?
He's told me nothing about you.
May I have your attention, please?
TWA's flight 611 to Seattle is now ready for passenger boarding.
Please have your boarding pass out and ready for the flight attendant as you enter the aircraft.
I'm going to go ahead and board.
Um... take your time saying good-bye.
It was very nice to meet you.
You son of a bitch.
What?
Is there really even a building in Seattle?
Oh, God, are you...
Are you suggesting
I made all this up?
To get on an airplane with some leggy architect... yeah, that's what I'm suggesting.
Oh, just because you've been such a wonderful liar doesn't mean it comes so naturally to everyone, all right?
This is the final boarding call for TWA flight 611 to Seattle.
Everyone must be on board now.
Have a good flight.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
So the outside still out there?
You've been staring out there like you're lost.
You ever been to Washington before?
So I'm going to head out to the job site this afternoon.
You sure you don't want to come?
Oh, no, I have a few things
I need to do here first.
I'll check you in and leave your key in an envelope at the front desk, okay? See you in a while.
Hello?
Oh, hi.
I didn't hear you come in.
I went ahead and ordered something for us.
It always seems to take room service so long to get here, even in a hotel like this.
I thought you might be hungry after a long day.
So what... how long were they... were they there?
Um, they were there for a little while.
Said hello, shook my hand and, uh...
Surprised to see you, though.
Almost as surprised as maybe you were.
I think.
I'm a little uncomfortable with this.
Well, I've decided that we shouldn't be nervous anymore.
I'm married.
Doesn't look like things have been going that well.
Is it still sore?
You're not going to leave before dessert again, are you?
I don't think anybody's going anywhere in this weather.
Would it surprise you to learn that I actually planned this storm so we'd get stranded here?
You're used to getting your way, aren't you?
My way is usually the best way.
Seattle information, please.
Hello?
Hello, is-is Danny Robertson there?
Um... yes, uh, but he's in the shower right now.
Can I take a message for him?
Is this Lindsay, the, uh, architect?
Yes, it is.
Uh, who is this?
This is Jennifer, the... the wife and-and that would be great if you could take a message for me.
Why don't you tell Danny that he can come home anytime because I'll be out of the house this afternoon.
- Thank you.
- Jennifer, listen...
Did I hear the phone?
Yes.
You didn't answer it, did you?
I'm sorry. I was asleep.
I wasn't thinking.
How much?
That'll be $47.50.
Aren't you guys regulated?
Hey, I told you not to come out here in the first place.
Only an idiot would fly on a day like today.
That's $50.
Can you help me with my bag?
Sure.
Attention, all passengers, flight 472 to Sacramento has been canceled due to bad weather.
Haven't quite seen a storm like this before, have you?
You wouldn't have any flights to San Francisco, would you?
Welcome to Econo Air.
I'm Kathi... with an "I."
And of course we do.
We have a flight leaving for San Francisco in 30 minutes.
Great.
In fact, we have flights between Seattle and the City by the Bay every hour on the hour, seven days a week.
At Econo Air, we pledge to make your San Francisco experience something you'll never forget.
That... that's terrific.
Here you go.
We only accept cash.
Okay.
How much?
That'll be $103.11.
A hundred... and three.
And, uh... can I... owe you a penny?
There. Keep it.
I need to check one bag.
Oh, you'll load that yourself, on the plane.
Excuse me, you want to take my ticket?
Welcome to Econo Air.
I'm Kathi...
With an "I."
How did you know that?
Do I know you?
Ma'am, I need to get through.
I could give a rat's ass.
Jennifer?
Honey, are you there?
Jennifer?
Jennifer?
Jennifer... if you're there, pick it up.
Aha.
Hello, Martha.
Hello, Daniel.
No, she's not here.
I know.
Well, I've been expecting you.
Come on in.
There's coffee in the living room.
I'll go get us a treat.
Play that funky music, white boy.
If that wasn't a photo op, there was never one.
Well...
All right.
I'm ready.
Ready for what?
For your confession.
I'm sorry, what is it that I'm confessing?
Oh, to your tawdry affair.
My tawdry affair?
Come on, Daniel.
If I'm going to be at all helpful in straightening out this mess,
I have to know everything.
Every... sordid little detail.
Okay?
We should talk.
Now, what could we possibly have to talk about?
The truth, for starters.
Okay, yes, I did go up to Seattle with Lindsay Hamilton.
But it was business.
She's an architect.
Mm-hmm.
And a very beautiful one,
I understand.
So lucky for you.
Must have made going back to the drawing board much less of a chore, huh?
Martha, we were working on a building.
But what were you building in the hotel suite?
I didn't say I wasn't trying to seduce him.
Listen... I pulled out all the stops.
Champagne, strawberries, candlelight dinner.
Didn't work.
It was a... very humbling experience.
And I don't do humble very well.
Why didn't Danny tell me this?
It's your daughter who's having an affair with some cosmetics guru.
My daughter is not having an affair.
My God.
Why would she do that when sex with you is so fantastic?
She talks to you about our sex life?
Constantly.
Who do you think suggested
Candlestick Park?
Her father and I scored there many times.
Martha, I don't think
I want to hear about this.
Yes, you do.
You should call her, you know.
She told me not to.
Since when has that stopped you from anything?
I'm just not sure I'm ready.
What's the problem?
Transformer blew up on 20 and I got the electrician up there.
Did you call the, uh, contractor?
Oh, he's on his way.
He's mad as hell.
All right, I'm going to head down to the basement, check out the transformer.
I'll see you on 28.
No. I don't want anything to do with sparks.
Sparks?!
Where's the fire?
It hasn't started yet.
I thought maybe you'd like something to eat before taking on that loose connection.
Well, I think we'd better get right to that connection.
I'm so sorry, Danny.
I'll never lie to you again.
Not even a little white one.
You won't have to.
I promise.
Listen, I want to be a dad, Jennifer.
I'll back to that... clinic.
Is Nurse Wheeler still working there?
Well, I was thinking maybe we'd forget about the clinic for awhile.
Maybe we just concentrate on... conventional.
Lazy swimmers...
I plan on taking over their coaching personally.
Well, I like the sound of that.
There's just one more thing.
Anything.
The smile, it has to be yours.
I don't know.
I was thinking after we figure all of this out, maybe we'll just have one of each.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God with liberty and justice for all?
My name is Jimmy Carter, and I'm running for president.
1976 will not be a year of politics as usual.
Yes!
It can be a year of inspiration and hope.
And it will be a year of concern...
Hey, Jimmy, check this out, man.
And sober reassessment of our nation's character and purpose, a year when voters have already confounded the experts.
And I guarantee you that it will be the year when we give the government of this country back to the people of this country.
Honey, is that for me?
What is it?
For you.
Honey, you didn't wrap this yourself.
You know I did.
Gary!
It's beautiful.
I mean, it's too much.
No. McMillan's leaving.
So it's definite.
It's my case now.
Oh!
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
And I want you to handle it.
Are you sure?
Because I can be difficult.
Hey, thanks a lot.
Drive safe.
Make a left up on Sheldon.
That'll take you right back to where you're going.
Got everything?
All right, be safe.
Be safe, all right?
? Oh, Jesus, please?
? Accept my prayer?
? Oh, without your guidance?
? I can't find peace anywhere?
? The love I have for you?
? Is like no other love
I've ever known?
I didn't think you'd show up.
This is Asheema.
A'salaam alaikum, sister.
This is Marcus.
My brother.
Come on, boy!
Iris!
Do you want to make a dollar?
- Two.
So listen...
I got a new contract out in Pottstown.
Try to get me at least
10 pounds more next time.
I'll see what I can do.
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, Harrison!
Where's the rest?
Rates keep dropping, Jim.
Guys like us are taking the hit.
You, bastard.
Guy pop hired doing a shitty job.
Everybody's heading over to the funeral home.
You coming?
How much is he charging you?
Why?
I could do it for you.
For free.
Put a little money back in your pocket.
Already got a buyer.
But, um, if you want to clean up around here, you could stay a few days.
He left you the house.
Well, no one's heard from you for four years, so, yeah, he left me the house.
We ain't even got him in the ground yet, and you got a buyer?
It's just the way things worked out.
And I changed it back.
The? ible verse?
I put it back the way it was.
Surprised you still care.
Genesis 42:21 is what he wanted.
It's your world, Bos.
Can I get through?
What's that say?
I know the owners.
It says I can take what I want when I want it.
Leave the cart, kid, and take off before you get yourself in trouble.
I got business to run, man.
You don't listen too good, do you, kid?
I said get outta here.
Asshole.
What did you call me?
Hey!
What did you call me?!
Come over here!
Come here.
Come on, Frank. It's lunch.
Kid's got a mouth.
I got a right to know my charges.
And he's still talking.
So I talked to Judge Thomas about my cousin Jimmy's case.
They want to hold him till he pays the full fine.
The court charged him with what?
Verbal assault.
And awarded the city... mm-hmm.
Thank you, Bean.
So I want to try to get him out tonight.
And you know I wouldn't ask unless I had to.
Well, you know, a couple days in county might not be so bad.
I mean, it might straighten him out.
Or he might not survive it.
Thank you.
Thank you, Bean.
I can't, Patricia.
Not this time.
I don't know how much more of this I have in me, Jimmy.
I can't keep doing this for you, you know?
I can't just bail you out.
It's not like I have it in me to keep showing up, making it okay when you screw up!
This is stupid shit, Jimmy!
It's really stupid shit!
- Ma?
- Hmm?
Who's this?
Our people are searching for new voices and new ideas...
Were you in my office?
No.
What's his name?
Marcus.
Daddy's friend?
Go brush your teeth.
How come we never can talk about dad?
We just talked about him.
- No, we didn't.
- Iris.
He was here, you know.
- Who?
- Guy in the picture.
You know,
I don't like when you lie.
Not lying.
He was out there in the street.
I know it was him.
Was he a Panther?
Yeah.
...realists who still know the old dreams of justice and liberty of country and our community.
Was wondering when you'd show up.
Here I am, baby.
What can I do for you, Dwayne?
Oh, that's how it's gonna be?
That's your name, ain't it?
I got a message from the brothers.
They sent you?
Things done changed, Snitch.
I'm in charge now.
Same old Dwayne.
Got everybody fooled, huh?
Look, I'm only here for a week.
Then I'll be gone.
Oh, you think that changes things?
Go home... Dwayne.
Call me that again.
Go ahead, say it again.
See what happens.
You're not even gonna see it coming, Snitch.
One day the light just gonna go out.
Pop.
Nobody's forgotten what you did to Neal.
Hey.
Wasn't expecting anybody.
I'm sorry about the Reverend.
Things are good?
Yes.
You know.
You?
She's a curious one, isn't she?
What, 8? 9?
No, no.
You might offend her.
She almost 10.
She looks just like him, Pattie.
Nobody calls me Pattie anymore.
I don't know you as anything else.
Iris?
It's time to say good-bye.
Find anything interesting?
No.
I have this box of comics
I was gonna throw away.
But if you want it...
- Say thank you.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
FBI director
J. Edgar Hoover today asserted the hostile black extremist group the Black Panthers represent the greatest internal threat to the nation....
Are you listening, people, to what I'm saying?
'Cause it sure looks to me like them niggers ain't playing.
Them niggers ain't playing.
America taught the black people to be violent.
We will use that violence...
Hello?
It's Patricia.
So we're having a potluck tomorrow.
If you don't have plans, you should come by.
It's a fundraiser for one of my cases that can't make bail.
I will. Thanks.
A-and it was good seeing you, Pattie.
Take care.
Where you off to?
Haven't decided if I'm gonna leave yet.
I can talk to them if you want me to.
They listen to me.
I can take care of myself.
Let me, uh...
Motherfucker.
Where's DoRight?
He ain't here.
If I was you, I'd get outta here.
I'm right here, T.
You don't know who that is?
We are in the presence of royalty.
You know, Neal was the pretty one, but this nigger, this nigger was the workhorse.
Stay away.
I'm asking you nice.
What?
You want to start some shit?
Wanna start some shit...
We can get it on.
My daddy loved that car.
Come here.
What the fuck is going on here?
Nothing, I got 'em lined up.
What the fuck you talking about, they lined up?
You got 'em on the curb without their fucking shirts and shit?
Undressed? Strip-searched?
What the fuck are you doing?
I'm doing my job.
Don't you fucking walk away from me.
Step here.
You better step back, motherfucker.
You cannot do this shit.
We got some constitutional issues here, motherfucker.
God damn it, let 'em go.
Get up! You heard him! Up!
All of 'em.
Come on, fellas.
You can go.
Come on, man.
I can't make it on this!
What, you think I can?
I'm paying you a quarter above market rate, Jim.
Aw!
What are you doing?
Today's the last day you're gonna cheat me.
Cheat you?
What do you mean cheat you?
I can take my shit over to Freddie up on Wayne Avenue!
Guy's a thief.
He'll pay you half what I pay you.
From now on, I only do business with the brothers.
Why y'all just standing there?!
He's one stupid-ass nigger.
You look thin.
How long you been back?
Come on, Marcus.
I'm not the enemy.
In fact, I came here to tell you you still got a friend.
Can I go?
If I was you,
I'd stay away from that bar.
DoRight's a criminal.
He's putting guns in the hands of children.
And Pattie?
You two used to be tight, right?
Well, now...
She's getting DoRight and his crew off on technicalities.
They have lost their way.
You finished?
I asked you to clean up.
That's it.
This is not your house.
You don't get to come in here and do what you want.
Put it back the way it was.
You're out of your mind.
- Hey, what the hell is wrong with you?!
- This is not your house!
You don't come in here and make decisions!
You don't get a say!
Run.
It's all you ever been good at anyway.
I now it was hard for you when I left, Bos.
But it wasn't my fault.
I had to go.
You understand that?
I didn't have a choice.
And now?
Whose fault is it now?
Stop asking me questions.
Sit down.
- Hello, my sister--
- Where is he?
Where's the boss?
DoRight?! Where you at?
You know why I'm here, right?
Are you serious?
Yeah, I mean it.
Stay away from him.
Motherfucker comes into my place, you come laying this shit on me?
You went after him.
I know you, Dwayne.
You've never liked him.
Why you taking up for this guy?
'Cause that's what I do.
For all of you.
Are you with him?
I'm just asking.
Look, you know he always had something for you.
Do you have something for him?
It's always the same shit with you.
You're paranoid.
The feds own him.
He's their inside man, their boy.
So you bought the same bullshit story everybody else did.
No, I know! I know!
Tell me what you think you know.
I know that he sold Neal to the feds.
I know they pumped
16 bullets into my best friend in your living room on his information, I know that.
It wasn't Marcus.
Okay, so, then, who was it, then, huh?
Maybe it was you.
You know what?
No one is gonna lay a hand on that brother's head.
You satisfied?
But let's be clear, do not come back in here asking for any favors.
She didn't say anything about my case, did she?
- T.T., are you serious?
- Just checking.
What are you doing here?
Did Bostic kick you out?
We have an extra room.
No, thanks.
So you're just gonna continue sleeping in your car?
- I've done it before.
- Then why would you do it again?
I'm fine, Pattie. Thanks.
There's too many pigs, man.
There's too many pigs.
Jimmy, right?
Peace, brother.
Right on.
Come on, Colin.
All right, guys, see you later.
All right, see you later.
You again.
Iris.
That work?
Sometimes.
Ma's in the kitchen feeding the whole neighborhood.
Amy, you need to slow down while you eat.
You don't need to stuff your face like that.
A lion!
A tiger!
That was my--
I like--I like tigers.
And a jaguar.
And monkeys.
And chimpanzees.
I like a ferret.
Okay, all right, celery and carrots, and who wants some fruit?
- Me!
- I do.
Well, come on and get a bowl, then.
Didn't I tell you to finish your milk before you have any more sweets?
What are you doing?
There's something very f-f-fishy about this ship.
I won't tell if you won't.
How you learn to do that?
Been on the road awhile.
Learn a few things.
It's what you do for a living?
This and that.
- Odds and ends?
- Yeah, odds and ends.
That means you do nothing.
Yeah? Is that what it means?
It true you were in prison?
Yes, it is.
What'd you do?
I sold guns.
I got caught.
My father sell guns, too?
Sometimes, yes.
- You're lying.
- I don't lie.
- Did he get caught?
- No, he was smarter than I was.
What was he like?
Well...
You look just like him, but you act like your mom.
I want to know how he died.
What did your mama tell you?
She won't talk about it.
She probably has good reason.
She keeps secrets, you know.
That's what mom-mom and pop-pop used to say.
One time, I heard them call her a communist like it was a dirty word.
Then they started following us.
Who's they?
The F?I.
They follow us home sometimes.
Then they started tapping our phones.
Still do.
See? Hear that?
If you listen for a long time, you can hear it goes like, click... click... pop.
Can't you hear it?
He was killed here, you know.
Ma thinks I don't know.
It was in here in the living room.
Jimmy says he shot 50 cops before they got him.
- He has nowhere to go.
- Could you put us first for once?
That's not fair.
No, what's not fair are those grubby kids who steal my change when I'm not looking.
Gary!
Or your cousin Jimmy who lived on the third floor for over a year so we can never have sex.
Is that what you want now?
- No, that's not what I want.
- Then, prove it.
You could, uh, you could always move in with me.
No.
No, I live here.
This is my home.
I have roots here.
You're living in the past, Patricia.
This house... this neighborhood...
You're all fighting imaginary enemies.
He loves you, Iris, and that's not gonna change.
No, he doesn't, and I'm glad he's gone.
You're the one who's upset.
I'm upset because I care about him, and I think you do, too.
No, I don't.
You're lying. You always lie.
Hey. Look at me.
Look at me!
Have a little respect.
Now how are we supposed to pay the electric bill?
Go get ready for bed.
What you doing?
Marcus...
Somebody's watching the house.
Feds aren't interested in us anymore, Pattie.
It's Gordon.
He's out there because of me.
But if you wanted to get me alone in the dark...
...all you had to do was ask.
I don't have to ask you anything.
Hm.
Ma!
Did you brush?
I brushed, and I'm ready for bed.
I'll be up in a minute.
What are you looking at?
Well, we don't have a lot of rules around here.
But we don't talk about the past.
It's too painful.
For her or for you?
For both of us.
Thank you, comrade.
Good night, Marcus.
Come on, man, leave him alone, man.
Come on, man, leave him alone, man.
- He ain't do nothing wrong.
- Just gimme my bicycle.
- He ain't do nothing wrong.
- Just gimme my bicycle.
You don't think I didn't see you yesterday?
You don't think I didn't see you yesterday?
- That was my cousin's bike.
- Whose bike is this?
- That was my cousin's bike.
- Whose bike is this?
My bike.
I just told you it's my bike.
My bike.
I just told you it's my bike.
Can I just have my bike back?
Can I just have my bike back?
I'm not lying to you.
That's my bike.
I'm not lying to you.
That's my bike.
- Got any drugs on you?
- No. Why would I have drugs?
- Got any drugs on you?
- No. Why would I have drugs?
I got a little girl crying, saying it's her bike and you stole it.
I got a little girl crying, saying it's her bike and you stole it.
- What little girl?
- Little girl up the street.
- What little girl?
- Little girl up the street.
- Whose bike did you have yesterday?
- That was my cousin's bike.
- Whose bike did you have yesterday?
- That was my cousin's bike.
You hear that, pig?!
Don't come back to our neighborhood!
The vanguard has declared all-out war on your ass!
Get down!
Let's go! Come on! Let's go!
? The revolution has come?
? Stop the pigs!?
? It's time to pick up a gun?
? Stop the pigs!?
? It's time to pick up a gun...?
I let her go to the corner store with me today and...
Jimmy got into it with a few cops.
Some cats drove by and shot out their back window.
She's fine.
Everybody was fine.
I just wanted to tell you.
I didn't think it'd be right if I didn't tell you.
Thank you.
Jimmy...
...is crazy, Pattie.
He's got a brick between his ears.
And that's putting it nicely.
Kid's walking around talking about the vanguard, calling cops pigs like he knows what he's talking about.
I don't think you should let
Iris work with him anymore.
She could really benefit from having you around.
She's never had that before, you know? A man.
I, uh...
I work night court on Wednesdays, but, otherwise, I'm home by 6:00, and I could pay you--
I can't take your money.
What about Jimmy?
I'll take care of it.
How are you gonna do that?
Don't worry about it.
Look at that. Wow.
Man, the Panthers, they were like my family, man.
I mean, our family, you know?
They defended us against the pigs.
They didn't want us to have nothing, didn't want us to live.
Pigs ruin everything.
How old are you now, Jim?
- It's just you and your brother, right?
- Yeah. So?
Your old man, what happened to him?
Wayne?
That was his name, right?
Used to run the body shop down on Germantown Avenue?
Go on outside.
I'll meet you out there.
Go outside.
Don't talk to him.
He'll be out when we done.
So you knew the old drunk.
Are we supposed to be friends now?
We ain't friends, Jim.
Don't come back here.
And stay away from Iris.
- You don't scare me, Marcus.
- I ain't trying to scare you.
I don't give a damn who you used to be.
I don't give a damn about any of you.
Got my own plans.
- Plans.
- Big plans.
That comic, where'd you get it?
I took it. So what?
Give it back.
This ain't your house, man.
You know why I loved Neal?
'Cause he killed some cops.
He went out like a man.
And what'd you do?
I survived.
Surviving ain't worth much if it's in another man's blood.
You don't know shit!
I know you a snitch.
I know you a chump.
I'm a chump?
The feds printed these comics for people just like you.
Now you call me a snitch again.
You don't know shit.
Where do you get off threatening him?
I talked to him.
I told you
I would handle that, right?
You think you can make him act nice when you want to?
A kid like that with so much to prove?
Iris is all you have.
Nothing else should matter.
Stop trying to tell me how to raise my kid!
Then stop acting like Mother Theresa every time an orphan walks through the door!
You, of all people, lecturing me on commitment.
Where you been, Marcus?
All this time.
Where did you go?
It must be nice... to just...
...come in and out...
Pack only what you can take in that little black bag of yours.
If you want to have a say about how things go around here, that's available, but you have to stay.
Are you ready for that?!
- I'm done waiting.
- Pattie--
Stop calling me "Pattie"!
That is not my name!
What should I call you, then?
Hm?
I'm sorry.
Oh, God!
Aah!
Jimmy can't come here anymore, Patricia.
Pattie.
- Ma?
- Hmm?
How come we never move?
What do you mean?
Ever since dad died, how come we stayed here?
It's complicated.
A lot of reasons, I guess.
It's strange, though.
I mean, it's not normal.
Ma?
Okay, Iris, I just-- give me a second.
I need to finish this, okay?
The year you were born...
...two Panthers were killed by the police.
And your father... was outraged.
So he and some other
Panther members, they decided they were gonna kill a police officer.
And I tried to convince him not to.
We all did, Marcus and uncle DoRight.
But he wouldn't listen.
Did he do it?
But that's not who we were.
That's not what we did.
Your father became angry.
Disillusioned maybe.
You were 8 months old, and nobody was safe.
I didn't know how I was gonna keep this family together.
The night they caught me, we were taking you to my parents.
We?
Me and Marcus.
I loved your father so much.
They were going to send me to prison, baby.
And you would have been put in the system, and I couldn't lose you, so I--
So I gave him up.
I told the cops... he was the one.
That was the deal.
Neal...
...for you and your mom.
I didn't know they were gonna kill him, Iris.
Iris.
They're all around us.
Ghosts.
They're everywhere.
Down on the ground.
Okay, all right.
Aw, fuck.
Hello, Marcus.
Get the fuck off me!
Fuck.
Now, this is what we gonna do.
DoRight and his crew shot up a patrol car.
They going after cops now.
I'm gonna bust 'em, and you gonna help me.
Plant this piece behind the bar.
Fuck you.
You plant it yourself.
Okay, now, who do you think you're talking to, boy?
I own you.
So do what you're told, or I'm gonna make sure everybody knows that she's the real snitch.
Huh?
Yeah.
She and the kid are gonna be run out of town.
There's gonna be a big bull's-eye on her back.
And maybe just one of these young bucks with a lot to prove is gonna put a bullet in her head one night.
You gonna place this piece behind the bar.
And we gonna keep our little secrets.
Ah, that's right. Wipe it down.
Now, you took the blame for something you didn't do.
Now, what kind of man does that for a woman who's carrying a torch for somebody else?
Fuck you.
You plant that piece, boy.
You know what I think, T.T.?
I think he just misses me.
Are you here to set me up?
Son of a bitch!
T.T.!
Come here!
- Are you wearing a wire?
- No!
I threw it in the gutter before I came in here.
- The wire?
- A gun.
They wanted me to bring it in here so they could set you up.
I knew it.
I knew it!
Get out of here.
What?
Go, go. Go on.
Why didn't you go through with it?
Oh, shit!
We need everybody to clear out of this area.
Iris!
What did mama tell you to do right now?
When face to face with a policeman,
I should keep my mouth shut, say nothing unless asked, answer questions with "yes, sir, no, sir," unless they violate my civil rights.
Then put my hands on my hand where they can clearly see them and ask for a lawyer and never make sudden moves and never get angry.
What were you doing in the kitchen?
What were you doing in the kitchen?!
Marcus! Move!
What are you doing here?
What did you do? What did you do?
You gotta get out.
You gotta go out the back door, go.
- Mom, please--
- No, shh!
- Where am I supposed to go?
- I don't know!
You're supposed to help me!
- Please, Ma!
- No! Stop! Shit!
Wait, wait! Wait, wait!
Shit!
Pattie?
Okay, after this,
I do not ever want to see you again.
Go.
Pattie!
I need to search your house, Pattie.
It's just me and Iris.
Look, I want to find out who's responsible for this.
Responsible for what?
A cop is dead!
This is fucking critical!
I'm very sorry about your police officer, but I don't know anything about it.
So unless we're under martial law, you're gonna need a warrant to get in here.
What the fuck you looking at?
Fuck you!
I ain't gotta answer to you!
Fuck you!
Hey,?en! Gordon!
We need you over here now!
I'll be back.
Harassing us again.
Get out of our neighborhood!
I want you to go out that back door and don't come back.
Iris, Iris, come here.
- Police! Police! Open the door!
- It's gonna be okay.
- Let's get this over with.
- Police!
Police, open up!
Open up!
Stand back!
You stay close to me, you don't say a word.
Police! Open up!
Get down, baby, shh.
Get down! Get down!
Get your hands in the air, now!
Shh, shh, it's okay.
Get down on the ground now!
Ohh! Aah! Agh!
- Job came up.
- Hmm.
It's a good job.
I was gonna tell you.
I told the guy if it came through,
I'd come back.
It came through.
Probably should have told you before, but I'd like it if you and Iris could come with me.
We're never gonna be happy here, are we?
I can't go with you.
I can't stay.
'Cause this is not the life you want to live.
Because I want more.
For both of us.
But all you have to do is call me, Pattie.
Whenever you're ready.
See you later.
What about your TV?
Keep it. It's yours.
You sure?
Why not?
Good-bye, Marcus.
Now, what about food?
Normal intake has continued for over a week now.
Good. Good.
Any new signs of rejection?
Absolutely none.
The patch of pneumonia has completely cleared up.
What about his blood pressure?
It was a little off yesterday, but today it seems to be completely level.
Oh, excellent. Excellent.
- Any adverse or abnormal symptoms?
- Couldn't be better.
The transplant is a complete success.
Excellent.
Donald, you were right.
He does look fantastic.
We complete the balance of the tests now.
Tomorrow, we'll remove the original head.
You see? He loves me.
Doctor, I wouldn't get too close if I were you.
Don't be absurd, Donald.
He trusts me... and he needs me.
After all, we understand one another
I am the genius that has given him a new life and he, in return, will help me keep mine.
Arterial clamp, please.
Ahh, little more perfusion.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is one of our 3 operating facilities.
The Kirshner transplant foundation is the only place in the world where such a massive operation can take place.
Dr. Smith, in such a massive transplant, why don't we see more blood?
That's because at this moment, both the patient and the donor organs are hooked up to individual heart-lung machines.
They control the blood flow through those plastic tubes.
Is that Dr. Kirshner on the platform?
Yes, Dr. Kirshner supervises the major transplant operations.
Does he ever operate himself?
No, uh... not anymore.
He developed a severe arthritic condition a year or so ago, and well, it makes surgery quite difficult for him.
Dr. Thomas, x-ray please
Philip, walk me to the door, will you?
Sure, Max.
I'm leaving early today.
Now, the only thing left on the schedule.
Is a kidney transplant, right?
I see no problems there, do you?
I don't.
Well, you and Hersch take care of it, and I'll see you in the morning.
OK.
By the way, that was a pretty good job in there today, you and the team.
Thank you. I didn't think you'd noticed.
I said good. I didn't say excellent.
Are you all right now, doctor?
They're getting worse.
And more frequent.
There must be something we can do.
You know damn well I can't take any drugs.
I must keep my mind alert.
I'm sorry Thomas, but it's difficult.
Come on, boy.
Yes...
Come on.
Gently.
No sudden moves.
Just gently.
Now, Thomas, move easily.
Give him the injection.
Quiet boy.
Attaboy. Easy boy. Easy.
Come on.
All right, Thomas, now, move easy and stay calm.
Behave normally and slowly and just... just as if you're dealing with a child.
I didn't get him! I didn't get him!
Be quiet! Don't run around.
Keep that cage steady!
Damn it, donald! Don't just stand there!
Try him again, get him from the other end!
Watch him, now!
Hold that cage down!
Hold it!
Donald, hold the cage down!
Hold it down!
I can't!
Get around him!
Don't let him get away!
Here, boy! Look out!
He's coming for you!
Oh, no! I'll get him.
Get away from him! Get away from him!
The tranquilizer gun, quickly!
Doctor, are you all right?
Forget about me!
Get him back.
And get him back alive.
I haven't got much time.
Move!
He can't have gotten too far, could he?
Look at that.
This monitor will discard organs that are malfunctioning beyond what the human eye can detect.
Young man, you realize we operate here on a success average of 92%?
Can your machine improve on that?
I'm sorry to interrupt, Dr. Kirshner.
Dr. Williams has arrived.
You asked me to let you know as soon as he got here.
Show him in here, will you?
Dr. Williams?
I instructed the board to hire him without an interview.
He's done some interesting work on rejection prevention.
Well, of course. I've read about him.
He's excellent.
This is Dr. Williams.
Dr. Desmond.
Pleasure meeting you.
Phil Desmond, head of surgery this is Jim Franklyn.
- Hi. How are you?
- Fine.
And this is Dr. Kirshner.
Dr. Kirshner,
I've been looking forward for meeting you, sir, and I'm very happy to be on your staff.
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
Dr. Williams...
Yes, sir?
How was the trip from minneapolis?
Very pleasant, thank you.
Uh... doctor... since originally hiring you, uh... certain situations which we were depending upon haven't arisen.
Due to budgetary setbacks, we find that we are unable to use your services.
But we signed a contract, and I've already given up my position in Minneapolis.
Miss Davis... check the terms of his contract.
It's for a 6-month trial period at 500 per week.
The board was most generous.
I've been a physician for over 5 years.
I was making much more than that, in Minneapolis.
Oh come now, Dr. Williams.
I didn't mean that at all.
What I meant was, it's just that here we pay our lab men much less.
I'm much more than a lab man, sir.
I'm a doctor.
Let's not bargain, doctor.
What is it you want?
What I wanted was to work with Maxwell Kirshner, one of the foremost transplant specialists in the world.
Why is it you people always put yourself in a position where you... where you don't fit?
But Max, that's not necessary.
Why is it all of a sudden that, uh...
I don't fit?
I'll get some coffee, and we'll... look at this thing some other time.
Yes, why don't you do that?
Yes, uh, I'll do that.
Why don't we stop playing around, doctor?
Things might be different if I were white, right?
Let's put it this way... this is my hospital.
I run it my way.
I hire whom I please... and I don't wish to hire you.
Oh, no.
Let's put it this way... we have a legal and binding contract, and I intend to see you follow it to the letter.
All right, doctor, you'll have your 6 months.
But that will be it!
Report to Dr. Hersch for scheduling.
Thank you.
6 months will be long enough.
I'll watch you, and I'll learn.
That's what I came here for.
And when I've learned what you know,
I'll fit myself in somewhere else.
Max, that wasn't necessary.
What is or what is not necessary in this hospital is my affair.
As you know,
I never allow colored people on my personal staff.
I just got carried away by superficial accomplishments before interviewing the man.
Whether he's black or not, he's an excellent doctor.
Philip, do me a favor, will you?
Cover for me today.
I have some important things to do at home.
I don't believe it.
Yeah, I know.
Call Dr. Desmond.
Tell him it's urgent.
I want to see him here immediately.
Max, what is it?
Hello, Philip.
What's the problem?
My condition is terminal chest cancer.
Prognosis...
I have 2 or 3 weeks to live, at the most.
Why didn't you tell me this?
There was no point in telling you.
You couldn't do anything about it, anyway.
Well, in your own case,
I doubt if you're the best judge.
Let's get you to the hospital and start working.
Donald... show him the x-rays.
That was taken over 3 months ago.
As you can see, the condition was inoperable at that time.
Progression has gone past the lungs and into the pleural cavity and the rib cage.
Organ transplanting would be futile.
Afraid I'll have to agree with you.
Is there anything I can do to make it easier?
Yes, there is.
Donald, show him.
That is not the gorilla's original head.
He's heavily sedated now.
But we have achieved 100% total spinal alignment on the newly transplanted head.
It's impossible.
Is it?
Heart, lungs, kidneys, arms, legs... everything is functioning properly.
Look at this.
Top one.
I kept the original body and the transplanted head alive on 2 separate heart-lung machines.
Well, what do you think?
Absolutely amazing.
Exactly.
Total spinal alignment achieved by using matching electric currents attached to the nerve endings.
I left the 2 heads together for 28 days, until the new one was strong enough to take over.
The removal operation was really quite simple.
I did it myself.
Alone... in 35 minutes.
This could revolutionize the whole profession.
I'll get a paper on it right away.
No, no, no, no.
We've got to go much further.
That's why I need your help.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about science, about genius.
Genius must be prolonged.
Philip, I want to transplant my head on a healthy body.
Well?
Well?
I don't know.
What don't you know?
It hasn't been proven.
Then we'll prove it now.
My genius must be allowed to continue.
Philip, I have nothing, absolutely nothing to lose.
There's no other way for me to live.
I guess there isn't.
Of course, we'll need a donor, perhaps someone with an inoperable brain condition, with a body that cannot be saved, but it's healthy enough to withstand the operation until we can remove the other head.
That won't be easy, Max.
Such a patient only comes along once in a great while.
Perform the operation here, in secret.
The fewer people who know about this, the less our chance of trouble with public opinion.
Philip, you've gotto help me.
Well, as you said, Max, you have absolutely nothing to lose.
No, no. His brain must be totally inoperable.
A cancer patient is out of the question.
Kirshner institute the patient must be able to sustain life for at least 30 to 40 days.
No. I'm sorry.
Now, what does the patient have?
Kirshner institute.
No good, Patricia..
We've had 2 possibilities in the last 4 weeks, and neither matched up.
Oh, I'm sorry, but a cancer patient is out of the question.
Kirshner institute. May I help you?
Yes?
Oh, fine. Bring him in.
Hey Phil, it's been a long time.
Mitch. Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
- Anytime.
- Grab a chair.
Thank you.
Since I talked to you yesterday,
I've come up with a few answers.
Oh? Can you help us?
You said it was urgent, so I pulled a few strings for you, and I talked to the governor, and I talked to the attorney general, and, uh... here's the deal.
First, we can't let any of this leak to the press.
We're already having enough trouble with these executions without adding fuel to the fire.
You've got it.
Next, the convict must be under total police security at all times,
And proof of his subsequent death must be certified by a state physician.
Of course, we're assuming some things.
We're assuming that someone on death row will decide to donate his body to science rather than go to the chair.
Well, we can only hope.
Tell me something... just off the record... what's this experiment about?
Transplant, Mitch.
Just another transplant.
Men, listen up
We have a message from the warden.
This is an offer from the office of the lieutenant governor.
"To all men presently on death row.
"We are hereby offering one of you the opportunity "of donating your body to science
"rather than undergo your present sentence
"of death by electrocution
"while the resulting scientific experiment will,
"after a period of 30 days, also result in your death,
"you will at least have the personal satisfaction
"that your life has aided humanity and the scientific world."
Only 60 millimeters of mercury.
What do you think?
Well, if it weren't for our life support systems, he'd be dead now.
As it is I don't know uh...
One day, 4 at the most.
I don't think he'll regain consciousness, which means... that we're going to have to find our donor immediately.
Here am I take my hand if I trip, if I fall won't you help me stand?
All right, Jack.
It's time.
Who might be... don't go easy, Jack.
Jack, let 'em have it.
Jack, give 'em hell!
Jack, you fight 'em all the way!
Just take 'em and bite 'em and gouge 'em dead.
Jack, make 'em drag you in there!
Jack, make 'em work!
Jack, listen, when they kill ya... when they kill ya, they'll know they killed a real man!
Jack!
Bye, Jack.
I wanna try to understand to live right, to give light to my fellow man so long sometimes it's been a crime for the children that are hungry problem is... and I will dwell in the house of the lord forever. Amen.
More power to you, brother.
Jack moss...
It's my duty to carry out the sentence of the court and the law of our state.
Is there anything that you wish to say before sentence is carried out?
Yeah... the Same thing I've been tellin' you guys all the time and you didn't believe me
I'm innocent, and my girl and some friends are close to proving it.
So I've been thinkin', warden.
I think I'd like to donate my body to science after all.
Dr. Desmond?
Sergeant Hacker.
Sergeant. This is Dr. Smith.
How do you do?
This is your volunteer.
There's no way out of here.
Ok, boys, let's go.
Hey, doc, is this gonna hurt?
I beg your pardon?
You're gonna operate, right?
Is this gonna hurt?
No, no, no. You won't feel a thing.
That's good.
'Cause I got what is called a low pain level.
I don't like to get hurt.
We're gonna sedate you right now.
You won't feel any pain.
Oh, that's good.
What are you guys gonna do to me, anyway?
We're conducting a transplant experiment, mr. Moss.
They did explain to you that you won't survive this operation?
They did explain?
Oh, yeah.
Yes, sir.
Big Jack got himself 30 more days.
Then the man's gonna try to pull the switch again.
30 more days... maybe all I need.
Then everybody gonna know big Jack is innocent.
Yes, sir... tried to tell 'em.
Innocent...

- Captain?
- Thornton, sir.
Christie's my name.
Colonel Wiley, major Williams.
Hello, sir.
I'm very sorry colonel Langston isn't here to greet you, sir.
He was called away to a civil defense meeting, sir.
Excellent job.
I congratulate all of you.
Just remember, complete secrecy.
Ok, Larry, you're on.
What are you watching?
Uh, nothing special.
I was just switching around trying to find something else.
How about making us some coffee?
Yeah, sure, sarge. Anything you say.
Philip.
Max.
Max, I'm here.
Max, listen to me.
We did it.
We transplanted your head.
We did it, Max.
And everything is checking out properly.
Max, it's going to work.
I knew it would.
By god, I knew it would.
I can feel it.
I can breathe with it.
I can feel my hand.
I... I think I'm moving it.
Am I moving it?
Yes, it's moving, Max.
It feels so strong... so magnificent.
Fantastically, beautifully strong.
I think I'm lifting my left arm.
I am lifting it.
I know I am.
Max, we had to make a last-minute decision.
We had no choice.
Is this some kind of a joke?
You were in a terminal coma.
We had nowhere else to turn.
It was our only chance.
If it wasn't for him, you wouldn't have made it.
Let me see him.
There was nothing else we could do.
Is that a fact?
You wouldn't have lived on the life support systems for more than one more day.
Is that a fact?
Breakfast will be along in a few minutes.
Mm, thank you, honey.
Hey, Sam, wake up.
It's breakfast time.
Take your hands off me!
What happened?
What have you guys done to me?
I'm talkin' to you, man.
What have you guys done?
Shut up.
Where's the rest of you?
We are joined together temporarily.
What do you mean?
They've transplanted my head onto your body.
Now will you shut up and get some rest?
We need our rest.
We?
What do you mean, we?
I told you guys I was innocent.
I just needed a little time.
Why'd you guys do this to me?
Why'd you do this to me?!
Easy, easy! Take it easy, moss.
Let me go! Let me go!
Help! Help!
Hold it. I'll take care of this.
Help!
Let me go!
Oh, my god!
Let me go!
Let me go!
I told you I was innocent, man!
Let me go...
I couldn't stop him.
That black bastard, I couldn't stop him.
It's all right doc, just relax.
No harm done.
The incision is fine.
Just take it easy.
I couldn't move the left arm.
He was controlling it.
I couldn't move it.
Takes time, Max. You know that.
Your head won't begin to take control of that body... for 10 to 14 days.
How am I going to... ever control him?
He might do it again.
He could... he could kill me.
No, no. No. He won't.
We'll keep his head locally sedated until then.
When he was out, you only had minor control.
Do you understand that?
Yes.
Now, I'm gonna give you something to make you relax.
Uh! Philip.
Philip, I can feel that.
I can feel it.
I can feel it.
It's all right, Max.
We're gonna make it.
Dr. Williams, I've been looking for you.
Dr. Desmond has asked that you meet with him, at Dr. Kirshner's as soon as possible.
And here's the address.
Are you sure he asked for me?
Specifically.
Thank you.
Dr. Desmond. Over there.
Thank you.
Oh, Dr. Williams.
Uh, we'll talk about this later.
Right.
Doctor, I'm sorry I haven't had a chance to talk to you since you started at the hospital.
It's really not necessary.
Well, yes, it is.
I want to apologize.
I mean, for Dr. Kirshner.
See, he's not had an easy life.
Even his childhood was... well, I can certainly sympathize with people who have had a difficult childhood.
Let me put it another way.
It's possible we may be making medical history right here.
We'll know in a week or so.
We've performed a massive transplant.
We're expecting severe rejection problems.
Quite honestly, I could use your help.
Why me?
Because of your anti-rejection techniques.
They could come in handy.
Could mean the difference between success and failure.
You've got the best people from the hospital here.
Now, why me?
And especially here.
Doctor, I understand your problem.
But did you ever stop to think that my views may not be the Same as Dr. Kirshner's?
Now, we're testing 24 hours a day.
You're a good doctor and an excellent lab man.
I need your help.
Will you help me?
Yes, doctor I'll do everything I can to help.
Thank you.
Now, I can't divulge the full nature of the operation as yet.
You'll have enough information to do your job.
I want you to go home, get some things.
The entire staff is living here.
Dr. Hersch will assign you a room.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We have a patch of pneumonia.
That extra decadron is giving us one hell of a problem.
The body just can't fight infection with it.
Cut down the dosage of barbital to the black head.
He's too far under.
We need all the help we can get from him.
Right, doctor. Right away.
You've been working for 16 hours.
Would you like me to get you a relief?
Oh, no, thank you, nurse.
I'll be all right. Thanks anyway.
How's the lymph count?
It's better, much better.
In fact, it's falling slowly.
Good.
We're gonna make it.
Ok. So, uh... when do us here on the outside really get to know what's going on in there?
It won't be long now.
How are we doing?
Well, the pneumonia's finally stable.
No improvement but at least, he's no worse.
Philip, I think we may have a chance.
You're late for the injection, nurse.
I was about to look for you.
Now get going.
Sorry, doctor. I'll get right to it.
Oh!
What the hell is the matter with you, moss?
Get back to bed.
You jive.
Holy shit!
Aagh!
Uhh!
Are you crazy?
You'll never get outta here.
That's what you think.
Just take it easy, lady.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Run, you idiot! Get help!
Help!
Help! Shut up.
Hold it, everybody!
Hold it right there.
Will somebody do something!
Now, I don't wanna hurt nobody, but I will if I have to.
You, soul brother, you got a car?
Yeah. Why?
You're now the chauffeur.
Let's go.
But my keys are in my coat in the closet.
Well, let's get 'em.
Let's go! Let's go!
And the rest of you folks, you just stay inside till we're gone and nobody's gonna get hurt.
Get in the car! You drive.
Jack, come with me. Call the police.
We'll keep track of them.
Come on, Jack!
Williams, stop this car immediately!
By helping him you're making yourself an accomplice.
Why don't you shut up!
Hey, that's telling him, man.
I should have known your kind stick together.
You a doctor? Yeah.
How good a doctor are you?
What do you mean by that?
You done an operation before on a patient that lived?
So far, so good.
Then how about you talking ol' happy face off me here?
Williams, turn this car around immediately. Now!
If you don't do it, then I get rid of him my way.
Williams.
That'd be about as smart as you jumping out of this car.
How is that?
I mean that if you kill him, you'll kill yourself.
The only way to eliminate his head and live is through surgery.
Ok.
We'll just have to figure out a way to do it right, then.
There they are.
Thank god you're slowing down.
Well, we don't want to catch them.
We just want to keep them in sight.
If we get into traffic, there may be a police car around somewhere.
There's a car following us.
Step on the gas.
I'm doing the best I can on this road.
You're gonna get us all killed.
There's a police car up ahead of us.
There's the police.
Hey!
You looking for Jack moss?
You just passed him in a 1969 yellow ford, about 10 seconds away.
They're gonna be coming back soon.
Hit the brakes.
Oh, my god!
Move over!
You're a passenger now.
I'm driving.
It's them. They turned around.
They turned around.
I think we'll let the police handle this.
Man, this car's a real dud.
I don't often use it to escape from the police.
Police are gaining on us... but they're not gonna get us, man.
I'm gonna lose 'em.
They're shooting at us!
Stop this car, you black bastard!
Stop it!
Whatever you say, baby.
Ha! No way they gonna get me, man.
This is 22 charlie to headquarters. Over.
Roger, 22. This is headquarters.
We are inoperative.
Lost suspects vicinity ridge route 4 and compton place.
Request assistance.
What kind of assistance do you require, 22?
Well, a tow truck would be nice.
Well, are you gonna help me or not?
I told you, I haven't decided yet.
Listen man I know the jury the d.a. and the papers all say I'm guilty, but big Jack knows the truth.
Well, big Jack better stop this insanity and give himself up before we're all killed.
What's this "we" stuff?
They're not after you. They're after me.
So I'll do the thinking.
You said back there that you were innocent.
I am.
They all say that.
Sure they do, but, in my case it happens to be true.
Heck, I didn't know you guys were gonna do this to me.
I figured I was gonna die anyway, so what the hell.
They transplant something from my body makes a kid live, that's good.
But I had no idea you was gonna do this.
Anyway, I'm innocent, and I'm gonna prove it.
So, how about it?
I told you, I haven't decided yet.
You mean you're actually considering helping this escaped murderer?
Murderer?
You're the murderer, trying to cut off my head.
That's different.
Funny how it becomes different when you're talking about your own head.
What is it?
We obviously have a flat.
You gonna stay with me, doc?
Do I have a choice?
Nope.
At least not right now.
Let's go.
This is 2-19 to headquarters.
We'll rest here till dark.
Then we'll make it over to my girl's house.
The police may be looking for you there.
It's cool,
'cause they don't know where she live.
May I have your attention, please, ground control.
We're going to move out across ridge 4.
Please spread out.
Follow us in a line, and we'll see if we can help you spot him.
Let's go.
So how did it happened.
What?
How'd you wind up on death row?
Oh, a cop got killed with a gun
I used to own a few years back.
If you didn't do it, didn't you have an alibi?
Willie thompson.
Well, who's that?
Crazy guy I used to know.
Came knocking on my door a few days before I got picked up.
He'd pulled a job and the police had gotten a make on him.
So... he needed a place to hide out.
It's interesting, how criminals always seek out other criminals.
Man, I ain't no criminal.
Of course you're not.
Wait, hold on, doctor.
Go ahead. Now, what happened then?
Well, the night the cop got killed, willie and I stayed at my place.
The next morning I went to the store to get some food, they arrested me.
When willie heard I'd been picked up, he disappeared like a ghost, man.
And neither you nor the police have been able to find him since, have you?
Nope.
But we will.
It's just a matter of time.
Psst!
Williams,
I got a proposition for you.
This transplant has made medical history.
Now, we should work together.
Just you and me.
You and me?
Look, you work with me on this, and I'll make it up to you.
Just you and me.
We'll take all the credit for what we've done here.
What about Dr. Desmond?
Philip?
Oh, he's an excellent surgeon, but I see a more promising future with you.
You actually feel that I could take credit for something with which
I had very little to do?
I don't understand you.
The reason you don't understand, doctor, is because you're a bigot.
A bigot of the highest caliber.
And because of that, you have underestimated me and my intelligence.
Maybe I said it badly.
I appreciate your intelligence.
But we're expanding the operational facilities, with a much larger lab contingency, and I need a man like you to head that department.
And in order to win all that great acclaim and prestige, all I have to do is help you cut off his head.
This is chopper 2-9er-2 to ground control.
Have lost suspect in the vicinity of hill 14.
Recommend you proceed immediately to this area.
We got to get out of here fast!
Let's go.
Hey, w-w-wait a minute, man uh... look, before I get killed,
I'll make a deal with you.
You put that thing away, and I'll stick with you, OK?
Deal. Let's go.
Ready?
You're gonna get us all killed!
All right, let's go!
Are you out of your mind?
I'm the one that'll get us out of here.
Not this way you won't!
You idiot!
I hope you know what you're doing!
Hold on! We're gonna get fancy!
Yahoo!
This is chopper 2-9er-2 to car 7-4.
Suspect Jack moss, is now on the saddleback race course approximately 1 1/2 miles due south of your present roadblock position.
We are returning to base and will advise unit control to surround the area.
Will you please stop this infernal machine!
Oh, just shut up!
Harry, Sam, check the back of the house.
Come on, will.
I know, I know, Mitch.
But it's not as bad as it sounds.
Look, Mitch, the police are here.
Can I call you back when I find out some more information?
Yeah, my god, Phil.
Do you have any conception of what this means?
We talked about secrecy and... and public opinion.
This is incredible!
Mitch, I understand, but we're doing everything possible.
It's not as bad as it sounds.
Phil, a murderer is on the loose because of my decision.
The press is saying that you've turned him into a two-headed monster.
I've committed political suicide!
And you say it's not as bad as it sounds.
Mitch, I'll... I'll have to get back to you.
It's not as bad as it sounds.
I'll get you.
We'll never get through this alive!
This is Baker 22.
Head him off at the south end of the field.
You black bastard.
Oh, my god!
You OK, Harry?
I think I broke my arm.
I told you to keep that seat belt fastened.
Harry... stick your head out the window and see if any more is coming.
Car 88 car 88.
I got him coming around circle pass.
You come in from the other direction.
10-4. we've got him now.
Aah!
Aah!
Who is it?
Who is it?
It's me, baby, big Jack.
It's all right, honey.
I'm not going to hurt you.
You get into more shit.
They were talking about this on the television, but I had no idea...
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
How about a kiss?
Honey... um...
I... I know you don't like to answer a lot of questions, but... but how did that happen?
Oh, I'll tell you about that later.
This is Max, he's a doctor.
Nice to meet you.
Well, does he talk?
Sure he does.
Don't touch me!
See? Works every time.
This is fred.
He's a doctor, too.
Hello.
Honey, I was wondering, um... do you have two of anything else?
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, this is Dick Whittington.
At the top of the news tonight is certainly one of the most bizarre stories this reporter has ever heard.
But it has been reported by several confirmed eyewitnesses that a two-headed monster has been seen.
Police have issued an all-points bulletin.
Police and state officials are also investigating the mysterious disappearance of condemned murderer Jack moss, who last month donated his body to medical science.
How this situation came about is still not known.
Earlier at his home this morning, we interviewed, or should I say, we attempted to interview.
Dr. philip Desmond, the acting chief of the
Kirshner transplant foundation.
And here is that interview.
Dr. Desmond, what kind of an experiment was performed on Jack moss?
It was not an experiment, it was an operation.
What can you tell us about the two-headed man?
No further comments.
It was a transplant operation, wasn't it, doctor?
Look, gentlemen, the foundation in a few days will issue a formal statement.
Now, excuse me.
Level with us, doctor.
Have you created a monster?
Aw, come on, doc, give us a break.
What are you trying to hide, anyway?
And as you can see, still no answers.
But, this is known... a two-headed man has been seen, and it is suspected that condemned murderer Jack moss is one of those two heads.
Police have reported that their switchboards are jammed with calls from an alarmed and panicked public.
And we'll be right back after this important commercial message.
You get some sleep, baby.
I'll wake you when dinner's ready.
Why don't you stay here for a little while?
Oh, come on, honey,
I got to start dinner.
You don't have to start now.
Why don't you do it later?
Come on, Jack, uh... is he bothering you?
I'll cover his head with a pillow case.
You must be joking.
Is that all you people ever think about?
It's no use, honey.
Maybe when I get used to it.
Now you know, you got to go.
So what's gonna happen to Jack?
What about that other head?
I don't know yet.
Um...
Jack tells me that you're trying to help him locate his witness.
That's right.
His name is willie thompson.
We tracked him down once in Nashville, but... he took off before we could talk to him.
You say "we." does that mean you have a detective agency on it?
Mm-hmm.
Then you really believe that he's innocent.
Well, if I didn't, would I spend all this time and money?
I don't know.
Look,
Jack was railroaded because the cops didn't have any other leads.
The only crime Jack ever committed was letting willie hide out at his place.
The only problem is, that's Jack's story, too.
Listen, it's also willie thompson's story.
I talked to willie before he took off, once he heard the cops had picked up Jack.
He thought the cops were getting too close, so he said he was sorry he got Jack into trouble and took off.
And when I told them that in court, they said it was hearsay.
So what about you?
Why are you here?
Jack wants me to help him.
Well, are you?
Well... the more I hear, the more I think I will.
That's good.
Because he certainly doesn't deserve what he's getting.
Come on. You can help me clean these greens.
Anyway...
I didn't uh, I didn't kill nobody, and now I got a second chance to prove it.
And you're gonna get us both killed trying it.
That's great logic.
Here, man, have some pork chop... oh, take it away.
I can't stand that garbage.
What's the matter, baby, don't you dig soul food?
What have you got for dessert, watermelon?
What do y'all think about having fried possum and chitterlings for supper, tonight?
Yes, sir. ha!
Anyway doctor, you don't have to worry about eatin',
'cause I'm gonna take care of that.
After all, it's my stomach.
And after supper, we can all sit around and sing spirituals.
Could I have a cigarette?
Oh, sure, honey.
Jack.
Lila was telling me about willie thompson.
Same think I told you, right?
Right. Seems like the court did give you a raw deal.
Hey man, don't be smokin' while I'm eatin'.
Doc.
How difficult would it be to remove mr. Personality from of Jack's back?
Without the team of surgeons and the proper facilities, absolutely impossible.
Oh, come on now, doctor.
We both know better than that.
What do you mean?
I mean that placing your head on Jack's body must have been quite a task, but the removal process is quite different, isn't it, doc?
In fact, one might consider it merely a basic amputation.
You mean... you mean you could cut him off of Jack's back by yourself?
Yes, that's right.
If there's someplace where we can find the right drugs and... surgical equipment... we could do it right here.
And you're gonna help me?
Yes.
I think I will.
Williams, if you cut off my head, that will be murder.
But it's OK for you to cut off my head, is that right?
Williams, I'm warning you...
Listen Kirshner,
I've heard enough to convince me that this man is innocent... and that you have no right to his body.
Then you're gonna help me?
Yes.
Honey, can we borrow your car?
Why, you idiot, you do this, you'll be the same as he is, a murderer.
Boys, boys, boys, don't argue.
It's all settled.
Dr. Max has got to go.
Hold it. Hold it.
Do you think there are any guards in here?
How am I supposed to know?
Did you bring your gun with you?
Tsk. I left it at lila's.
Are you sure you've ever done anything like this before?
Not even in your apprenticeship?
Let's go.
This is it.
Hey!
What's goin' on here?
Hey, what's happenin'?
Jack.
He's taking control of your body.
Cut it out, man!
Doctor help me, doctor! Help me!
Uhh!
Now... now it's your turn.
Oh, this is Dr. Kirshner.
May I speak to Dr. Desmond, please?
Max, where are you?
Philip, can you talk?
Yes, Max, I can talk.
Well, listen carefully.
I haven't got much time.
I want you, Smith, and Patricia.
To prepare for the removal of the other head.
Max, no, no, no.
The place is crawling with police.
They want moss dead.
Now, you don't stand a chance of getting in here.
I see.
All right.
I'll have to handle it myself.
Max, listen to me!
All I've done is listen.
Now, this is basically a very simple operation.
And I think I can do it myself.
I'll contact you when I'm able.
...abrasions, several broken arms, one broken leg, and numerous bruises and broken ribs.
All of the officers involved appear to be in good health.
The chase, which took place in a deserted field near the city of ackersfield, resulted in the total demolition of 14 police vehicles.
We were able to interview lieutenant J.J. Hinesacker who led the chase.
- I'll get him!
- I'll get the...
Thank you for those words of encouragement, lieutenant Hinesacker.
And now to our sports desk.
Lila?
This is Dr. Williams.
Kirshner has taken control of the body and has gotten away.
There are only 2 places he could have gone and I don't think he'll try the hospital.
Can you borrow a car?
Ok, pick me up on the corner of Washington and J as soon as possible.
Ok?
All right.
Philip, what is it?
I just talked to Max.
I don't know what's going on but,
I want to be able to operate within a moment's notice.
But we can't work here.
The police.
I know. I know.
Maybe they'll catch him alive.
In that case, we'll be ready.
Tell Dr. Smith to uh, stand by.
Now, you don't want to do that, doctor.
You'd be killing an innocent man.
Hello.
Doctor?
You had better get over to Dr.
Kirshner's house as soon as possible.
He needs your help.
Who is this?
Hello?
Philip...
Philip... get me another body.
Please.
Oh, happy day when Jesus whore my sense away oh, happy day he taught me how to walk and prai he taught me how to pray oh, happy day it was every day oh, happy day this god of mine he taught me how to prai oh.
Oh, every day oh, happy day my god showed me the way oh, happy day...
You got him! You got him!
Sit down. Get down.
We ain't never going to find that damn little redskin.
When I do, I'm going to scalp him.
Go.
The little Injun's somewhere.
Get down.
There's the Reid place.
Come on, we're missing it.
The ranch.
The ranch!
Dad!
Ma! Dad!
Dad!
Ma!
No!
Ma! Ma!
Ma!
Ma!
Ma! Ma!
Ma!
Ma! Ma!
Ma.
Ma.
Ma.
Oh, Ma. Why did you...
Why did you have to die?
Though we cannot see those that are dear to us does not mean that they are no longer with us.
Keep your parents alive within you, and their spirits will never die.
While you are here, do not stand apart.
Follow the Indian way.
Be one of us.
Tonto will teach you.
The legend started simply,
just a boy without a home.
Taken in by Indians,
but still pretty much alone.
He had to struggle with strange customs
and his own fears from within.
He learned the wisdom of the forest.
He learned the ways of the wind.
I recognize my familiar voice as a truth bearer that tells me what to do and what is just and which trail to follow... the trail of justice.
Dan? Dan!
Hey, John. Johnny.
Oh, I knew you'd come.
Anyway, Johnny, it's all arranged.
You're gonna go stay with Aunt Martha in Detroit.
Please, Dan, let me stay with you, please.
I belong here.
From this moment, wherever you go, whatever you do, you will always be kemo sabe.
Trusted friend.
Whoa!
Damn dust.
10 to 1 we don't make Del Rio tonight.
Where you want these at?
Wait for what?
That's worth waiting for, all right.
Are you going to Del Rio?
Sure going to try, ma'am.
Need help?
Thank you. I'll manage.
Get on up the road! Come on, boys!
You manage very well.
Would one of you gentlemen please change places with me?
I can't read riding backwards.
I've been in this seat for three days now, lady.
It's warm and lucky.
I beg your pardon.
Here.
Thank you.
John. John Reid.
Thank you, Mr. Reid.
She's a wonderful writer, isn't she?
Are you familiar with her?
Well, actually,
I prefer Century of Dishonor.
I haven't read it.
Well, you should.
You don't ever go blind. Never.
Dark eyeglasses.
Solar spectacles!
This is why I came out west.
To manufacture, you know?
You're a man of vision, sir.
Vision?
Very good.
So how about you, young man?
I'm an attorney. I'm starting my practice.
A lawyer.
If we didn't have lawyers, we wouldn't have crooks.
You know, I think you're gonna sell a pair of these to everybody in Texas.
Jal I will. I will.
American opportunity, Mr. Reid.
Take advantage.
What the hell was that?
Indians?
Road agents!
Here's what we're getting paid for, kid!
Get the horse!
Get up in there!
- I can't!
- Get their goddamn horse!
Indians! Indiana!
Get on up the road!
What the hell is he doing?
- He can't outrun them.
- But he's gonna try.
He could get us killed.
Get up!
Up!
Giddyup!
Get on, boy!
Do any of you gentlemen have a gun?
Yes, ma'am. I do.
Well, use it, then!
It's not my fight, lady.
But it's mine. Give it to me!
I'm not a coward.
So much for American opportunity.
Jump on it and stop it!
Get up in there!
Whoa!
Whoa.
Whoa! Whoa.
Let's have the pouch.
We ain't got no gold.
We ain't got no cash box.
The pouch!
Hell, all I got is letters and packages.
They ain't worth it.
Them's government papers.
- Let's go.
- What? Just leave them here?
- Them's our orders.
- Who's going to tell?
- Well, make it fast.
- All right.
- Come on!
- I'm hurrying.
What the hell are you doing in there?
Nothing, nothing! Nothing.
Nothing don't take that long.
But she might.
Kill him! Kill the bandit!
- No!
- Do it!
No!
I would like to thank you.
Well, you can thank me by telling me your name.
Amy. Amy Striker.
They held up the Overland!
They held up the Overland!
They held up the Overland!
Everybody's been killed! They're all dead!
Del Rio was a town in trouble,
a town with a gun in its back,
plagued by crimes
that just wouldn't stop
and cursed with a sheriff
who wore black.
So you'd think they'd be suspicious,
but simple folks rarely are.
They're willing to trust their law
to just about any man who wears a star.
Whoa.
Here's the sheriff.
They killed Shotgun and one of the passengers.
Amy! Amy!
There was five of 'em.
This is what's left.
Oh, Amy. Thank God.
Two of them, huh?
Well, they'll each hang twice.
They wore the gray hoods, Sheriff.
Cavendish gang.
They's after these land grants.
Come on.
What's going to happen to those two outlaws?
They're gonna take them to San Anton'
Do you need a deposition?
I don't know.
You got one you want to get rid of?
Oh, Mr. Reid. I'm Lucas Striker.
My uncle.
Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
Amy told me what you did.
I just can't thank you enough.
Why, if anything happened to her...
Well, uh, you know, your niece was very courageous, sir.
She never compromised an inch.
Perhaps you might join us for supper tonight?
Thank you. I'd like to, but I can't.
I have to be at the ranger post before dark.
Oh, are you joining the rangers?
No, sir. My brother.
I see.
You shouldn't have come.
You've got an education.
You're a lawyer, for Christ's sakes!
You got a chance to make something out of your life, but this is not the place.
Dan, what's happened?
I mean, what's wrong?
You just don't understand.
These are tough times.
John, I got enough hurt in my life without having to worry about you, too.
When I was 10 years old, you sent me away to learn, and I learned.
But the most important thing I learned was that I belong here.
You don't understand.
It's still a frontier.
It forces you to make sacrifices, to make choices.
Your heart can't tell you what to do.
Your gut tells you.
Dan... we're the last of the Reids.
You're my brother.
Can't you understand that you don't belong here?
Dan, I've come home, and my gut tells me that I'm going to stay.
John.
One day she just packed up, took Danny back to Richmond.
Well, maybe she'll change her mind.
No.
Not till we make it safe out here.
Safe so a man can raise a family and provide for them.
But I don't know.
This territory is endless.
That just may be impossible.
Bastards come out of nowhere, strike... and just disappear.
I don't even know where they hole up.
Who's that?
The Cavendish gang.
Cavendish?
They're the ones who robbed the stage.
Cavendish don't rob stages.
Cavendish robs ranches.
They've been grabbing land, driving the owners off, robbing, killing, burning.
Who is this Cavendish?
Butch Cavendish.
Butch for butcher.
Major in the Union Army, dishonorably discharged.
Grant court-martialed him right after the Battle of Chattanooga.
Now he's heading an outlaw army in Texas.
Well... you know you'll get him.
You going to see him when he comes out here?
Cavendish?
Grant.
Grant's coming out here.
He's going to hunt buffalo, make speeches.
Everybody in the whole town's going to turn out there and wave little flags at him.
Me?
I'd like to piss on him.
He's the President of the United States.
He's a liar and a drunk.
Piss on the President.
Piss on the Cabinet.
They ain't going to help us out here, you know.
In Texas, robbers are outlaws.
In Washington... robbers are elected.
Ain't that right?
Huh, little brother?
John?
Well, it is.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Butch Cavendish lived undisturbed,
waging his private war,
and men who made mistakes
were simply men he could not afford.
Some say he was a monster,
and others called him mad.
Let's just say Butch Cavendish
was everything that's bad.
About-face!
Dale Wesley Stillwell and Robert Edward Gattlin, it is the finding of this military tribunal that you are in violation of the articles of war, and your undisciplinary conduct resulted in the failure of a military objective.
Therefore, it is the pronouncement of this tribunal that you be executed by firing squad forthwith.
- Mr. Perlmutter.
- Sir?
Carry out the orders of the tribunal.
Yes, sir.
Lock.
And load.
Major Cavendish, sir.
What is it?
Well, sir, it seems to me, sir, that they just did what most men would've done.
I have no room for ordinary men, Mr. Wiatt.
We are on a course that will alter the history of this country.
Men who do not obey orders for the sake of their own personal gains... are a clear and present danger to my plan.
Do I make myself understood?
Yes, sir, you do.
Proceed, Mr. Perlmutter.
Yes, sir.
Stevens.
Assume the firing position!
Ready.
Aim.
Fire!
¡Mira, miral
It's really exciting, isn't it?
Dan, there's somebody
I'd like you to meet.
Come on.
- Lucas.
- Hello, Captain.
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.
Good evening, Mr. Reid.
Captain, this is my niece Amy.
She's on her way to San Francisco.
How do you do?
Well, John's told me a lot about you.
I read your article in the paper this morning.
Oh, did you like it?
Well, it made me sound like a hero.
I enjoyed your editorial about Cavendish, Mr. Striker.
Thank you.
If more folks laid it on the table like you, we could put an end to him.
We'll stop him, Captain.
Which reminds me, I've got to get tomorrow's edition out.
So if you'll excuse me?
Do you need me to help?
Oh, no, Amy. Stay here and have a good time.
Gentlemen, good night.
Nice party.
Yes.
Isn't it?
Uh, yeah... yes, ma'am.
All this talking makes me dry.
It was very nice to have met you, Miss Amy.
Oh, it was my pleasure, Captain.
Nice party.
You said that already.
I did, didn't I?
I have a feeling you're going to be a very important lawyer.
I just want to make sure the West has an honest system of justice.
Oh, you sound just like my uncle.
Here.
Oh, you remembered.
A Century of Dishonor.
Thank you.
I'd like you to keep it.
I will.
Will you write me and tell me how you like San Francisco?
Yes, of course.
Maybe you could... send some articles or stories that you've written.
Of course.
So I guess this is good-bye.
For now.
Maybe we should go back.
Amy, l...
I think we should go back.
Captain Reid! Captain Reid!
Captain Reid!
Hidalgo!
What happened?
El periodico.
The Dispatch.
Get the horses.
¡Ai, carambal
Amy, wait here.
Uncle Lucas.
Uncle Lucas!
No. No.
- Please, no.
- Amy, Amy.
Uncle Lucas.
All he lived for was his newspaper.
- Collins!
- There's tracks, sir!
Six riders, heading north.
Mount up.
I wish I had an answer for you, Amy.
John, where the hell are you going?
With you.
Well, let's get 'em.
Please come back.
Well, this is about right.
I got my best party shirt on for something like this?
Look at Lopez. Don't hear him griping.
He had every swirling
chiquita in the place wanting to marry him.
Now he's out here riding with us for glory and God and Texas.
Hey, Stephenson, why don't you swallow that damn stinking cigar?
Yeah, I could, but it sure keeps my nose warm.
I'm beginning to strongly dislike this Cavendish fellow.
Yeah. I wonder if he knows the rangers are riding right up his ass.
A great place for a picnic.
Where the hell are we?
Bryant's Gap.
Captain, you want
I should ride up ahead, take a look?
Yeah, okay, Collins, but you watch yourself.
Always do, Captain.
Get over there, Tex.
Good boy.
Wait till you meet my kid.
You're going to love him.
Not if he's anything like you.
Well, he is.
Spitting damn image.
Jerky?
No, thanks.
You don't know what you're missing.
His mother's gonna let him come out and visit for Christmas.
You really miss him, don't you?
Yeah.
Look, uh... if anything was ever to happen to me...
I want you to check on him for me.
Nothing's going to happen to you.
If it was gonna happen, it would have happened a long time ago.
Yeah.
Yeah, I suppose.
But just the same, you know, would you? In case?
Sure.
You know how a boy needs a father.
Here.
What's this for?
It's for you.
You can't be shooting outlaws without it.
You should know that.
There's Collins.
Mount up.
Where is he now?
Let's get the hell out of here.
Ain't no pass here now!
Go back!
We got to get out the other way!
The other way!
Come on!
John!
Hi, kid.
How do you like being a ranger?
More than anything.
Yeah, great life, ain't it?
Homer!
Homer!
I've been a ranger longer than you've been alive.
Been in San Anton' with big Sam Houston.
Fought alongside McCullough in the Mexican War.
Rode with Kit Carson and John Coffee Hays.
All those years, kid, I learned one thing.
What was that?
It ain't the bullet that gets you.
It's the fall.
John! John!
Dan!
- Dan!
- Stay down, John!
Dan.
Dan.
Dan.
Dan.
Oh. Oh, Dan.
At least this time we were together.
No.
Weren't we?
Dan.
Weren't we, little brother?
No, Dan.
No!
No!
Pick up the hymn books, boys.
It's all over.
Collins.
Yes, sir.
Go down and check the bodies.
Sir, couldn't you send somebody else, sir?
You rode with them.
Well, yes, sir, I did, but...
Sir.
One thing about that Cavendish,
he knew how to set a trap.
And he finished off the rangers
that day in Bryant's Gap.
And Collins had to check them all
till Butch was satisfied.
Dead men lying everywhere,
and bloody brothers side by side.
It'd seem too coincidental if the only survivor wasn't wounded.
Yes, sir, Major.
Maybe they'll give you a medal.
Dan. Dan!
Rest.
Kemo sabe.
What?
Kemo sabe.
Tonto?
Yes.
And Tonto recognized John Reid
by the amulet he wore.
But John had once saved Tonto's life,
so this evened up the score.
Tonto had to hide his friend
and keep him out of town
'cause if Butch had known
that one ranger lived,
he was sure to hunt him down.
The white man has made many promises to us, yet they keep only one.
They promised to take our land from us, and they took it.
You see the suffering and the misery they bring to your people, yet you bring one to us to nurse back to health.
Tonto, why?
Nobody has reason to fill their hearts with hatred for the white man more than I.
He's taken from me my wife and my child, but the man I brought here is my brother.
And I will protect his life with my own if I have to.
And if I'm wrong and he proves to be an enemy, then I, Tonto, will decorate my lance with his white man's hair.
But until that day comes, let him not be judged by his color, but by his heart as a man and a friend.
What is it that brings
two friends together
or sends the waves to the sand?
And what is it that drives
a creature of nature
to reach out to the world of man?
Just such a creature was
this great white horse,
as wise and as wild as a runaway,
and the moment John
first laid eyes on him,
he swore he'd ride him someday.
Maybe you need a bigger target, like a sleeping buffalo.
Try this.
A silver bullet.
It's more accurate.
Tribal chiefs first used silver on their arrows.
It makes them fly longer and straighter.
Silver is pure.
It's been a symbol of justice and purity since the year of the sun.
Well, good morning.
Look at him.
He shines like the moon.
Like silver.
Silver.
Easy, boy.
Silver.
Whoa.
Easy, boy.
That's a boy.
Easy, Silver.
Whoa.
Easy.
Easy, boy.
Whoa!
Good boy.
Whoa!
When I found you,
I was searching for the men that raided my village.
I seek right.
I will not be herded like soldier's sheep from pen to pen or issued my food and clothing by government agents.
I am man and am free to die for what I feel.
And the day might not be many winter counts away when all men will be brothers.
A new Indian nation will come out of this time of change, strong and proud and united.
Well, then, let brother ride with brother.
If I am to find Cavendish,
I can no longer appear as John Reid.
Cavendish and his men must think that all the rangers were killed in the massacre, and only then will I be free to avenge my brother's death.
We will go back to Bryant's Gap and dig one more grave.
John Reid will... be buried with his brother and the rangers forever.
I swear to you, Dan, no matter how long it takes, no matter where they are,
I will find them.
What Cavendish and men like him owe you, they will pay in full.
There will be justice in the West.
To this, my brother, I pledge my life.
Hi-yo, Silver!
Now John Reid was just a memory.
The masked man
had taken his place.
But that doesn't mean
his heart wasn't touched
when he saw Amy Striker's face.
Amy had stayed to do her uncle's work
and to keep his dreams alive,
but unless the masked man
could find Cavendish,
true justice would never survive.
You're too late, mister.
Some old bar dog got all of my money.
The brave survivor of Bryant's Gap.
That's right.
What was it like?
It was like hell.
Cavendish?
I don't know who it was.
Why are you wearing a mask?
Because I'm in hiding... like you are.
What are you getting at, mister?
I want you to take me to Cavendish.
How would I know Cavendish?
You led the rangers to him.
And now you're going to lead me to him.
No, see, you got it all wrong.
I'm a big hero around here.
Isn't that right?
What did they promise you?
Was it money? Land?
What was worth having your friends slaughtered?
You're crazy.
And I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
You know what I'm talking about.
Where is he?
I don't know Cavendish.
Why did he set up the rangers?
I know what happened there.
For Christ's sake, mister.
L... I can't.
You can, and you will.
Collins, tell me.
The train.
What train?
The train. He wants the train.
The masked man.
Looks like you're going to hang alone.
Coal tender... soldier's car, club car, presidential car.
Are we clear, gentlemen?
Yes, sir.
Whitloff and Richardson.
Yes, sir.
Westlake.
Eastman and Neeley.
Yes, sir.
Gentlemen, the President.
- String him up!
- He was a hero!
That's no way for him to die after what he went through!
Well, he's civilized for an Indian!
What kind of law do they understand?
Swift, short, and certain!
Let's string him up!
Wald's bringing them here.
Just like he said.
Hey, Crazy Horse, you're on your way to the Happy Hunting Grounds.
They look like a herd of buffalo.
They're going to be tough to control.
Order! Order!
Don't get in the way, Wiatt.
We're taking the Indian.
- Now just step aside.
- Now, you listen to me.
Two or three of you want to go in there and get him, that's all right.
I don't want the rest of you dirtying up the place.
You, you, and you, go get him.
There's only one kind of good Indian.
I don't guess anyone stopped to ask
what Tonto was guilty of.
That didn't stop them
from wanting to see him
swinging high above.
But Tonto showed no sign of fear,
and he held onto a fervent hope
that the masked man
wouldn't let his blood brother hang
from the end of a rope.
This is for Eddie Collins.
Those Cavendish boys
had been working real hard
going over each step of their plan.
Meanwhile, old Butch
was mighty disturbed
by reports of a strange masked man.
But he wouldn't let rumors
mess up his scheme.
So he set out on his final campaign.
He and his boys
rode to the rendezvous
with President Grant's private train.
Miss Striker!
Miss Striker!
Yes, Manuel?
There's a padre wants to see you in the church right away.
Father Monteleone?
No! Another padre.
He said it was very important, and I promised that I would bring you.
Well... in that case, I'd best go see what he wants.
You must have done something real bad, Miss Striker.
More coffee, sir?
Thank you. Thank you.
You're welcome.
Oh! General. Come in, come in!
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
I'd like you to meet our new guest,
General Aurelio Rodriguez.
He's joining us for the hunt.
- Mr. President.
- General.
I'd like to introduce the legendary Wild Bill Hickok!
Oh, Señor Hickok.
How do you do, sir?
Right there is the famous
Buffalo Bill Cody.
Howdy, General.
Señor Buffalo.
And you know, of course,
Brigadier George Armstrong Custer.
Brigadier.
General.
Sit down, General.
Armstrong, move over there.
Let the general sit, or I'll send you up to Montana.
You sent for me, Father?
Yes, my child.
Your writings, they are very brave but dangerous.
What do you mean, Father?
In my travels, I have met a man who wears a mask but is dedicated to law and order.
He wants you to know that he will not stop until he has brought Cavendish and his men to justice.
Well, until he finds Cavendish,
I shall simply continue with my writings.
No, you must not.
You will be hurt.
In here, quickly. Please.
You see, Father,
I cannot stop my writing.
It is my only weapon.
It is all I have.
I understand.
Thank you, Father.
I am most grateful for your concern.
Now, with respect, you must excuse me.
I'm on my way to a meeting for President Grant's arrival.
The President?
Yes. He's arriving here on the afternoon train.
Today?
Yes.
Although I suspect the children are more eager to see Buffalo Bill than they are to see the President.
My God!
What is the matter, Father?
You should have gone to San Francisco.
What did you say?
I must go.
Wait!
The masked man?
Trust him.
Father!
Father.
Father.
The Del Rio is the next stop, Mr. President.
I want to be there and gone in three minutes, not a breath more.
Yes, Mr. President.
Where the hell is Del Rio?
Gentlemen, look what I have to put up with.
Well, I'll leave you on your own.
I have to rewrite that speech for whatever the name of that town is.
Whoa.
Right turnabout.
Which way?
Through the gorge. We'll save hours.
Let's go, Silver.
Come on, Scout.
The next time we play poker in Mexico, yes?
No, I don't think so.
Ah, gentlemen. Come in, come in.
Sit down, gentlemen. Sit down.
Now listen to this, see how you like it.
"And I, as your president,
"am ready to defend the lives of American citizens at any cost."
How do you like it?
Sounds damn good, sir.
Look, when I was out here three years ago, these hills were black with buffalo.
I've been here three days,
I haven't seen a single one.
Cody, what happened to them?
I shot 'em.
Now, here, here, gentlemen.
The plight of the buffalo and the American Indian, in these times, is no laughing matter.
Now, with that, you'll excuse me.
I think I'll take a short nap.
- Mr. President.
- Mr. President.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Major.
Whoa.
The train.
Let's go, Silver.
Switch it.
I am Major Bartholomew Cavendish, and you, Mr. President, are my prisoner.
So Cavendish had pulled it off
and vanished without firing a shot.
The masked man and Tonto
had to move fast
and ride while his trail was still hot.
They didn't know what he intended to do,
but the life at stake
was President Grant's.
Perhaps Butch would hold him.
Perhaps Butch would kill him.
They just couldn't take that chance.
Tell me one thing.
Are you here to rescue Grant or to get Cavendish?
I signed your court-martial?
I don't remember.
What happened wasn't my fault.
Never is.
I got that at Shiloh.
Cavalry Major's.
It was his last glorious charge.
Poor bastard.
Look around you, sir.
Do you see chaos, discontent?
Or do you see respect and order?
I hadn't really noticed.
You and the United States will notice my country, the Republic of New Texas.
The manifest destiny of the United States will be impaired only slightly.
Major Cavendish, you are a diseased son of a bitch.
I'd like your opinion.
Yes.
No, thank you.
"To Mr. Hamilton Fish,
Secretary of State.
"Dear sir,
"Whereas the government of the United States
"has failed to provide proper protection
"for American citizens,
"and whereas it has failed to provide honest leadership and moral courage..."
"Therefore,
"let it be known that I,
Major Bartholomew Cavendish,
"firmly resolve to hold the President
"of the United States as my prisoner
"until I am deeded sovereign right of ownership
"to the lands of Texas specified in this document.
"Furthermore, I demand that these lands be granted to me
"by an irrevocable act of the Congress of the United States
"no later than 30 days after the date set above, or the life of Ulysses S. Grant shall be forfeit."
Sign as witness, please.
Very good.
You think so?
Yes, marvelous.
But 30 days is too long to give 'em.
I'd change that.
They'll dicker and debate and scratch their indecisive asses, and by the time they sober up,
I'll be dead.
You may be right.
Well... it'll be interesting to see.
Wake up, Sheriff.
Where's the President?
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
He's in the next room.
I don't know how in the hell you got in here, but you...
Mr. President.
- Yes?
- Excuse me, sir.
Eh, Christ! Now what?
We're here to help.
You don't look like someone who could help me, and neither does he.
Here's a gun.
Trust us, sir.
We're going to get you out of here.
Follow me, sir.
This way.
Light the fuses.
Damn me! The horses!
The horses are loose!
The horses!
Soak up lead, you sons of bitches!
The horses! The horses!
- Jesus, what was that?
- What's going on?
Let me get my pants on. We'll see.
Come on! Let's go see!
- How'd they get in here?
- Where's my horse?
Hey, where the hell you going and leaving me?
You're safer here, Mr. President.
Yeah, but I can help ya!
I've been in a few battles myself, son!
Now you're President, so keep your head down.
Charge!
Come on, boys! Go get them!
Come on!
Get 'em all! Every one!
Let's get the hell out of here.
Come on, boys!
Do it!
Your sins will be paid for in the fires of hell.
- Take him away.
- Yes, sir.
May I know, sir, to whom am I so indebted?
Mr. President, please allow me to remain anonymous.
I hope you'll understand.
Well, I respect your dedication, and I will honor your request.
Tonto, I thank you and I salute you.
Thank me by honoring your treaties with my people.
Yes. We will try. You have my word.
Mr. President.
May God ride with you.
Who is that masked man?
Hi-yo, Silver!
Away!
Hi-yo, Silver!
Away!
With his friend Tonto,
the daring and resourceful
masked rider of the plains
led the fight for law and order
in the early Western United States.
Nowhere in the pages of history
can one find a greater
champion of justice.
The Lone Ranger rides againl

Vraciu!
Get your ass here.
Get rid of them. Now.
I was certain God came to me.
He said: have a better purpose in life.
God didn't talk to you.
It was just a bad reaction about that shit in your body.
- What did God tell you.
- He told me to kill.
- To kill who ?
- All  who sin against him.
God told you to start going around killing people?
Shit.
You must have been tripping badly..
Because ... I gave you the good stuff.
He wanted me to go away.
To purify my mind only with his words.
Only then could I be prepared to do his vengeance
Forget it.
For you.
If you're going to be doing the Lord's work.. you'll need the god's tools.
Carefull, hey, they are loaded.
What else did God tell you ?
He told me He was going to test me.
To see if I was worthy to take on his mission.
- What kind of test?
- I w'ld have to show no mercy. even to someone who show mercy on me.
Prigo?
Take care of my drugs.
- Thank you, Father.
- Bon voyage, my son.
Goodbye, Carlitos.
Bueno Suerte.
Carlitos!
You have a customer over here.
Carlitos?
Let God, who has enlightened every heart teach you to know your sins and trust in his mercy.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's been one day since my last confession.
What sins troubles you so much that you must return after one day?
Just business as usual at our monastery.
The nuns carried the dope.
Our cousin priests were counting the money.
I just did not know that death was about to make an appeareance in this house of God.
Stranger killed the priest?
Patience, padre, I'm getting to the good part.
The stranger leaned in and whispered into his ear.
This must have put the fear of God into him, because all he could say was,
Carlitos.
And that's all the stranger needed to hear.
The stranger pushed the priest into his chair..
..turned and walked away.
But the priest had one more hail near the officery
He reached for a gun... Bang ! Bang, Bang !
- Priest  killed the stranger?
- No.
Stranger killed the priest?
What happened to the priest?
Four shots.
Forehead ... sternum ... shoulder ... shoulder.
Sign of the Cross.
What happened to the stranger?
He came in as a vilain and managed like an angel.
Bullshit. I've heard nothing of this.
How do I know it's even true?
Who the fuck are you?
Who sent you? Talk to me!
Who the hell ...
A fucking liar yelper.
So Natcha is running around wacking priests left in, right ?
Why the hell am I paying protection every month for you people care to protect the one damned thing?
Stop your worrying.
You are still alive, aren't you?
Don't give me that. I fucked used my men, for Christ's sake.
- How do I know I'm not next on his list?
- I said  we take care of it.
Hello? Hello?
Bullshit! Ther's a goddamned vigilante running around wacking priests...
...and all they can tell me is they'll take care of it?
Take care of it how? like they took care of Father Bernardo?
Where is the world coming to when a man of the clerck can't even do God's work?
It's a God dammned shame.
Bernardo was a good earner.
May God have mercy on his soul.
- Hello. How are you?
- There's something wrong. You can look at it, please?
- What a shit hole!
- Penny, watch your mouth !.
- But it is.
- Come here.
What?
- That's for the attitude, young missy.
- Dad!
I can fit my finger in your radiator.
It's rusted.
Hey man, let's take a little bit of this.
They won't miss it.
That's how people get killed.
Just kidding, anyway.
I'm going to see what guys doin.
You do that.
Just miss my friends, you know.
I could be on the beach, at the ocean ...
- Look at all you ...
- Dude!
What?
Come check this shit out.
- Do not look at them.
- Where's Dad?
- Ladies!
- Get your hands off her!
Stanley!
- What happened?
- I was just fucking around with my buddy.
Your buddy?
Why are you crying?
It's okay. Come.
Come, come.
- We do not want any trouble
- Trouble? Do we look like trouble?
- So you are a bunch of nice guys.
- Yes, yes. We are very very nice guys.
But ... we do have a problem when people come to our establishment and they dont want to pay respect.
I do pay respect.
Do I look a puta?
- No!
- You called me puta, no?
Are you trying to pay me with puta money?
Want to see the puta?
Here she is.
Show him a puta guys.
You good, took it... with courage.
Be a man.
Go ahead and save her from the bankin.
I'll stop. I promise.
Come on, you can do it. Go!
Be a man.
Go! Save her!
Hello.
I'm sorry about your daddy.
I think I'll have to be play the role of Papa.
You're cute.
- Chavo on the phone.
- Who?
- It's him.
- Damn! What does he want?
He wants to talk to you.
- How does he sound?
- He sounds serious.
I come back for you, Momy.
Chavez's repair.
You're welcome, we don't give a shit.
Father Bernardo is dead.
And so are Lobo and Chinaco.
It was a godamned massacre.
They took nothing. No money, no drugs.
It was strictly personal.
Fucking.
Round up your men and get the word out.
Ole Cheffe, we have a surprise for you.
Isn't she sweet?You check.
Isn't that right Kick Stand?
Sure No.
- Do you like to pop her cherry?
- Yes.
But I can't.
We have work to do.
Muchachos ... We are in the middle of a holy war.
In fact, my maman did say to me:
"If you want a sweet  nice ripe peach, you have to wait a while, fallin under the tree. "
I like it ripe and nice and juicy this way.
Here Ramon.
My papa said:
"Acre or sweet, we need to chew."
That's what he said. Hey.
Chavo? Where are you going?
You're talking about my mamma to say and how much about your dirty stinking fucking father?
I said nothing.
If we talk of mother gonna fly eggs.
- Chavo!
- Let's not talk about my mother.
If anybody else wants to talk about my mama, be prepared to get a few punches.
- Rigo!
- Yes.
- Do you like this one?
- Yes.
Do you want me to give her to you?
- Yes.
- Okay.
Give her to him.
Not now. Go away. Leave me alone.
Shit!
Hello, Chavo.
You done a great job taking care of my place.
I am I made you a lot of money.
Listen up.
There's a vigilante on the streets. going around and  killing the bad guys.
In case you guys forgot, we are the bad guys. alright.
Anybody comes through that door,I want to know about it.
Understand?
Go! Go! alright alright, I'm on it !
My hat.
In witness pleasuring one another in God's house.
That kind of blasphemy will not be tolerated in my church.
- Fr Carlitos there. And he is scared.
- Okay.
Why don't we just call the police and let's them take care of it?
Jews have called for help.
When Moses came down from the mountain, did not ask who is on their side.
They responded by taking arms the name of the Lord slay all who oppose the Lord.
Spared noone.
Are you ready for this?
Are you ready going with   xxx bleeding and  shooting of a short and killing more priests?
I am not ready for this.
You know what they did to us? you know they will continue to do to all like us.
They must be punished, Angelina. be punished on behalf of true believers.
Look at me.
How am i supposed to be the hand of God,
If i can't even hold my own hands still?
All I can think is going back at the monastery, in my filthy cell,
Where they can stick  needles in my arm and I can forget.
Mother Magda told me to die. deep die.
I was there.
When I was in his arms
Lord spoke to me. giving me his calling.
One, I was agreeing for .
One I'll have to prepare for.
- What did the Lord say?
- It wasn't words.
It was intense emotion of being alive one that spoke to me.
How did you escape them?
Lord sent an angel to guide me back to his kingdom to protect me.
- like doing your protecting me now?
- Yes.
Now that we found each other,
We will  be whole again.
Ther is no easy road to become a nun.
It is not a life of refuge from the outside world,
It is a life of sacrifice.
When times become unbearable, we take comfort in knowing...
...that the sacrifice that we make is the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ.
When you pass through those doors, you will be born into a new life.
You'll enter with nothing and you will be absolved of sins without questions.
We do not ask nor do we speak of our past lifes upon entry.
To make a closer union with the crucified Lord,
You will be submitted to...
...  exercises in tasks and humility.
If you question this trial, you do not belong with us.
To be obedient in all things until death with the love of God.
Is to be perfect nun.
You want me to take care of it?
No.
I am in the mood for a good jerk-off story.
- I'm on it.
- It Could be the priests's killer.
The Good Book is all the protection I need.
May God who has enlightened every soul..
..teach you to know your sins and trust in his mercy.
Forgive me, Lord, for I'm about to sin.
I'm not the Lord, he only works through me.
Now tell me what is so heavy on your heart..
..you must come to confession at this unearthy hour?
I'm not here to confess any sins.
I'm here to commit them.
You must have Balls in steel to come to my house.
Do you know who your dealing with?
How much money comes through this church?
Kiilling a couple of thugs and a priest is not going to stop anything.
- You have no idea what you're out against fuck.
- Just tell me who you work for. and you won't have to suffer the same fate as your brothers.
I work for the Lord.
He is my sheperd.
Make yourself comfortable.
Fuck.
Is always the same.
Fuck. Passing.
There is nothing sacred any more.
Dont coverup. It's alright.
Its a minute.
- I need a room.
- By the hour or by the  night?
- By the night.
- That will be 30 dollars, cash.
Lucky Room number seven.
Halfbreed.
These guys, they're yours.
- You good?
- Yah.
How can you get to count everybody's money, including your own?
What's your problem?
You want to count my money?
- I'd like to see them.
- Count me.
- Count me.
- No, that's alright. It's good.
Rigo.
Go ahead to your business, man.
- Chavo's workshop, Rigo.
- Get me Chavo on the phone. Now!
OK. Ok.
- Carlitos, who?
- The one bastards killed him in his own church.
- He should have prayed harder.
- You need to put an end to this, right now.
OK.
You want us to track down this little eraser its going to be double the regular price.
- I don't have that kind of money.
- Hey , Padre, don't fuck with me.
We've already lost two men in your holy war.
In fact, I know Jesus has deep pockets for this kind of shit.
If you won't double the pay,
Then I won't all this done in half the time.
Meet Mother Magda at Carlitos his church.
She is expecting you.
Carlitos ...
It sounds good.
This way.
You guys stay here and make sure we don't have any unwanted visitors.
- What do you think?
- I'm dead alright.
You can stop them. Make them pay.
You know, you're not exactly the forgiving type, Magda.
You know, turn the other cheek, love thy enemy ...
..and All the bullshit you preach.
Listen, They called me up from my monastery to fix this.
And I expect it to be resolved as soon as possible.
I heard you the first time,OK ?
I know, Iknow you want it fast.
You want a miracle.
That's your business.
But by the looks of things,
Your businesss not doing very well.
Now. Are here any witnesses?
Sister Mary was the first one to alert us of the situation.
- Then get her ass in here.
- This won't do any good.
Sister Marytook a vow of silence 20 years ago.
I keep her around just because she knows how to keep a big mouth shut.
We'll see about that . Bring her.
Who did this?
Who killed these men?
OK.
I am going to ask you one more time nicely.
If you do not want to talk, I'm going to let
Kick Stand take over the questioning.
Who killed these men?
OK. It's your choice.
I'll be right back.
Mary, tell me what you saw now.
Mary what did you see?
It's alright. You can talk.
I won't tell anyone.
Just between us.
Mary, they are going to come back here..
.. then I can not stop them.
What did you see?
Kick Stand, get your dick over here.
Now!
Who killed them, Mary?
You know who it was, don't you?
You've seen them before,Haven't you?
What did they look like?
Kick Stand, go to work.
I'll nail your arse as they nailed Jesus to the cross.
Kick Stand, enough.
It was a nun.
- It was God's hands.
- A nun?
It's like one of your penguins is to recoup , Magda.
- What kind of gun did she have?
- Big guns.
I looked into her eyes and saw the devil in them.
- What to do now, boss?
- First, w're going to handle the troops and then ... we are going nun-hunting
Halfbreed quit fucking around, get up here.
We're looking for a nun.
A nun with big guns.
You mean, "big guns" like in "Big Tits"?
I said guns.
I'm surrounded by idiots.
Pull yourself together, or you'll end up here in a pine box.
Spread the rumor on the streets.
Fix that. Go check that out.
What about her?
She is a nun.
Yes she is.
Are you a killer?
No, no, no. Not this one, hey. Ouhh.
I don't think she can even hold a gun much less shoot one.
Let's go. back for you later.
S back errant daughter.
When they didn't find your body in Valambrosa
I thought even it was you causing all this trouble.
And now that you sit before me
I know Iknow my words are true.
The only thing worse is resting in your arms.
I know you would not last a week outside of here.
Are you looking for someone?
Well, take a good look at him.
God punishes those
Why I serve Satan.
Let me go.
- A delivery from Magda.
- What should I do with her?
I thought w're done with this nun bullshit.
Magda said to give her to Chavo and when he is finished with her just  throw out the rest of the trash.
- Put it in that booth.
- Alright.
Nice rack.
- Hi, Chavo.
- Hello, love.
Go Tell  Beverly to bring me some beer, please.
Come with me.
Just like I remember heyy.
- Dance for me, Mamasicu?
- Of course.
Come on, come here.
Thanks, Beverly.
Listen, if you see a crazy chick like that youshoot first and ask questions later
That's Chavo's orders.
- Halfbreed, would you like a beer?
- What the fuck you think, bitch? Yeah.
I think God is trying to tell me something. everywhere I go, I see nuns.
What the fuck you said earlier, honey?
The girl in the picture. I saw one checking in at the Palms Hotel, last night.
Really dirty looking one too.
She mihgt have, don't know,.. a drinking problem.
You saw this chick, a nun checking in a piece-of-shit motel last night?
I was with Butch.
Ask her, sh'll tell you the same thing.
If you're wrong about this, Beverly,
God fucking help you.
- What do you want? I'm in the middle of something.
- I need you to wake the fuck up and pay attention.
Yes, now you got my undivided attention.
What the fuck is so important you need to wake me up in the middle of the morning?
It's four o'clock in the afternoon, you stupid bitch.
- Did you checked in a nun, last night?
- No.
Beverly, you fucking cunt, I'll rip your fuckin' ass when I get off the phone.
Leave her the fuck alone, Jesus.
It didn't checked her in  last night.
I checked her in this morning at 2AM.
 Butch,no is not the time to fuck with me. </ i>
Room seven.
I checked her in myself.
Don't let that fuckin' bitch leave.
We are on our way.
We got irresponsible heterosexuality . </ i>
We  lesbianism, homosexuality transsexuality </ i>
 multi sexuality. All sexuality. </ I>
 it's just sin.
We got lesbians ...</ i>
Is she dead?
No, but Beverly saw a nun checkin'in to the motel last night.
I want to see this little heroine.
Kick Stand, you get over there.
Put it on back to me, alive
Go.
Let me leave now.
I'll have to kill you.
If you have not noticed,
I'm the one with the gun.
You do not have to go through this.
I know that God forgives sins.
- You just do ask for his forgiveness.
- What do you know about sin?
Are you even some real nun or just some poor plain dressed-up?
I've taken my vows at my church, in the name of the Lord.
You think you're so High mighty.
Who are you to preach?
What do you know about half the sins you condemn?
- I too am a sinner.
- What are your sins, my precious sister?
- I am a fornicator
- Big fucking deal.
Half of you pinguins are being poached
By the preachers
That may be true.
My sins of the flesh. are that of the fair sex.
Get back on the bed, bitch.
We sin today.
And ask forgiveness tomorrow.
Such is the beauty of devine.
- Who the hell are you?
- You thought, you thought, you thought wrong.
- You said I can be forgiven.
- Want to be forgiven? Ask for it. Come on..
Please ... please.
Please ...
I absolve you.
I absolve you.. of all your sins.
But there isno penance for the hell bounds.
Where the fuck have you been all day?
At Tity Fucker?
They got this new girl over there.
Man, I'm telling you: She-is-it!
She is dressed up in nun put down yur pants.
You've  seen a nun at the Tita club?
- How long has she been there, asshole?
- Papa said she just stopped there.
Get th efuck out of my face.
- What now?
- Butch is dead.
That nun worked over real good.
 Chavo i sgoing to be pissed. </ i>
Sorry, boss. But I have bad news.
Butch is dead.
- Bloody messover there, man.
- Mutt, this is crazy.
Prospect said there's a nun over the Tity Fucker right now.
Come on.
- Tity Fucker's.
- Hey, man, it's Halfbreed.
- I bet that you're looking for that nun.
- Tell  Pope that Chavo is on his way.
 Yes, I get that bitch cleaned up. </ i>
- Now what?
- Chavo is on his way.
Ann, Get that bitch out of the boot and clean her up before he gets here.
What happens Halfbreed?
Not now, bitch.
Wake up!
And put your clothes back on.
 my heart will not allow me to wait any longer. </ i>
 I pray to the Lord. he will save me and reunite us. </ i>
 If not in this world then in heaven above. </ i>
Take your stuffy hands off me.
Where's Angelina?
She is just playing at the Tity Fucker theater with some old friends of yours.
Going mean is not going to make things right.
Kick Stand, tell Pope to bring in a nun.
Hi again, killer.
I know you are not the man I'm looking for.
I do believe you have something to do.
- Pope, leave us alone for a while.
- to get dumped anyway.
I'll also give.
Nun.
Put the gun down, nuts and small.
Who the hell are you?
Fucking bitch!
Who the hell are you?
No, no, no, calm down.
Yes, yes.
Do not touch anything. It's okay.
Come, go.
Are you okay?
- I will.
- No, no, no ...
No, no.
No! No, no, no.
Everyone?
No. I'll take care of it myself.
Father ... are you ready to take on this new mission in the name of our Lord?
::UniVerseHub Addicted:: www.universehub.net]
Sheriff.
Hi, little buddy.
Hey, what's happening?
Oh, nothin' much.
I thought I'd stop by and see if you had a scoop for the paper
Well, things are pretty quiet around here, Davy.
Oh?
Well, you know I always have things under control.
Well, I guess there's nothin' goin' on in this neck of the woods except the revival over in Gleason Town Hall
- You goin'?
- No. Are you?
No. I got me a date with Terry.
Well, I'm surprised that
Dan Kester would let you anywhere near her.
He's her brother-in-law, not her father.
Well, don't get on the wrong side of him, young fella.
He's a strange man and he's workin' up a big head of steam.
Dan?
Where the hell are you goin"?
In to town.
What the hell for?
Well, I'm goin' to a revival.
Well, you need it.
Git!
Sometimes, the only way
I know you're still alive is when I hear you flush the toilet.
- Hallelujah!
(in unison) Hallelujah!
The joy that you're feelin' right now is just the beginning.
Our revival is gonna grow and grow for the next four days.
Days that are gonna change your lives.
HI, Terry ready yet?
No, not quite.
You want a little drink?
Oh, no thanks, Mrs. Kester.
I'll just wait right here.
Well, you can call me
Ev, Dave.
Okay, Ev.
Sure you don't want one?
- No, uh, I'm sure.
Terry might be quite a while yet.
You know, you and Terry don't look much alike for sisters.
But I gotta say that good looks run in your family.
Well, thank you, Dave.
You know, it's too bad that there's this little age difference between us.
If you were five years older,
I'd jump ya.
Terry!
Hey, you look great.
Doesn't she, Mrs. Kester?
Yeah.
Come on, Terry.
Hello, Sheriff's Office.
I see. Uh, huh.
Disturbing the peace?
Yes, ma'am, that's an arrestable of fence.
No, the law does not apply to preaching.
Hellfire and brimstone, that is what is in store for you!
It's right here, Psalms 11.6,
"Upon the wicked, He shall reign fire and brimstone. "
Dutch? Dutch, this is Ev.
Listen, there's not a drop of booze left in this house.
I, I just can't stand it,
I'm really desperate.
Would you bring me something?
Oh, thanks, Dutch. Listen... listen, you'll find me very appreciative when you get here.
Okay, bye-bye-
Well, here we are.
You've got to be kidding!
You said park.
Come here.
Can you come again tomorrow night?
Well, I certainly hope so.
The revival will be still here.
Gimme that old time religion.
Boy, I can hardly wait to get saved again tomorrow night.
- Oh, Dan, wait.
- Huh?
You forgot your back braces.
Whoa, damn, it's good you remembered that.
Ooh, boy, if I went home without that on, there would be hell to pay.
"I saw a star fall from heaven onto the earth and there arose such a smoke out of the pit as a smoke from a great furnace.
And out of the smoke there came locusts upon the earth and unto them was given power. "
How was it?
Grr... eat.
What did the preacher... talk about?
Sin.
Yeah, what did he have to say about it?
He, uh, was against it.
Listen, damn it, you better tell me what that preacher said because I don't for a minute believe this rotten, stupid story of yours.
Look at that! Oh!
Aagh! Aah!
What the hell was that?
Weird.
Geez, would you listen to that wind.
Lights are dead.
What's wrong?
Car won't start either.
- Oh, great!
- Wait here, Terry.
Terry, come on!
Come on.
Oh!
What the goddamn hell was that?
It was a shooting star, maybe, huh?
Well, there's... there's nothin' there now.
No fire, no... no smoke, no smell, no sound, nothin.
Well, you saw it too. It wasn't just me, you saw it.
There must be somethin' out there.
Well, whatever it is, it can keep til mornin'.
You mean to say that all hell just busted loose in our field and you're goin' on in to bed?
I'm tired.
Well, you're always tired.
Well, that revival really took it out of me.
Now, if you want to, you can stay out here all night lookin' at nothing.
Our radar's on the fritz.
We are off our vector.
Hey, you know there's something screwy going on up here.
We're only 35 knots above our stalling speed, you better take a quick dive.
Still dropping.
Hello, Sheriff's Office.
Huh? I see.
You say your radio won't work.
Well, all I call tell you is call Joe's Radio Shop.
He opens at 9 a.m. sharp.
Your car won't start? Well, all I can tell you is call Ernie's Auto Repair, he opens at 8:00.
No, ma'am, I don't have the number.
All I can tell you is use the
Yellow Pages.
Let your fingers do the walking, ha,ha,ha“.
That's funny, I wonder why she hung up on me?
Don't move or I'll shoot.
Jesus, 'bout scared the death outta me.
Put the gun away.
- What the hell are ya doin' sneakin' in here at this hour?
I had to walk home.
I warned ya, that little Perkins snot is rotten.
It wasn't Dave's fault, h is car broke down.
Ha, you fell for that dumb old trick?
Ha, ha, that had whiskers on it when I was a kid. Ha!
It really did break down.
- Yeah, where?
- In the junkyard.
Hmm, that's just exactly where a horny little punk like that would park, in a junkyard.
I hate to burst your bubble, but it was my idea.
I oughta put you over my knee, and pull down your britches and spank the hell out of ya.
Oh! I always wondered why you used to spank me so much, so you could get your jollies.
Why you...
Man can't even have any peace in his own house.
Yes, this is Dr. Langer from
Montclair Observatory again.
I've got a gamma ray shower and the barometer's dropped an inch in less than 20 minutes.
That's unprecedented, right, fight
And none of the other phenomena
I'm reporting correlate with any previously observed date in this area.
Did I ever tell you you're gorgeous?
Not recently.
Paul, how many times do I have to tell you, you talk to plants to make them grow.
- Talk to plants?
- Right.
Not you, Vance. You haven't fallen for that metaphysical nonsense.
- Well, my M.O. says that I am half metaphysics and half astrophysics.
Now, what made you take the long walk down the hall?
More freaky stuff from northern
Wisconsin.
Freaky.
- We just got a report in that's right out of Ripley.
And what's the source?
Montclair Observatory and
Dr. J. Langer.
Langer?
For openers, "We have a heavy gamma ray shower, an incredibly fast drop in barometric pressure, an aurora with no sun activity and an amazingly potent unknown ground level x-ray source nearby. "
Paul, didn't we receive a SAC report on a fouled-up B52?
Yeah.
Was it in the same quadrant?
Oh, you're right.
It was... right here, then it disappeared off the radar scope.
Any report of a crash in that area?
No.
- What's the closest town?
Horton. You better pack your suitcase.
I'm wearin' it, old buddy.
Good, cause I've all ready arranged your transportation.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Seven o'clock already?
No, it's, uh, 6:02.
Well, what... oh, not you again.
Okay, what's up, Rider?
Well, we just got a report an oil freighter in the middle of Lake Superior.
Oh, that's beautiful. Did you check on the car fairies on Lake Michigan?
No, no, Vance, this is serious.
A couple of the seamen upon board the ship, saw a plane crash...
Oh?
- and it just might be ours.
Any sign of survivors?
- We don't know.
Okay, Dave, keep in touch.
Oh, uh, Rider... uh, what time am I supposed to meet this uh, uh... Langer at the observatory?
You're expected at 9:00 sharp.
Nine I can make, but if I don't get some shut-eye,
I ain't gonna be very sharp.
Bye,
Good-bye.
It's way past 7:00 already.
- So.
So, when the hell are you gonna get off your big, fat ass and go see what happened in our pasture last night?
Let me eat my breakfast in peace.
I gotta keep up my strength.
What for?
The more usual kinds of stars are what we astronomers call the "main sequence" stars and they run the gamut from the blue giants to the red dwarfs.
And then the more fascinating stars we call "abnormal" stars.
Then we have the white dwarfs and they have a radius of less that 1/100th of our sun's and a density so great that even a teaspoon of this matter would weigh tons and it could only be lifted by a giant crane.
Then there are the quasars, neutron stars and black holes or collapsed stars. Now, let me show you my conception of the creation of this universe.
Out of this primordial fireball, the galaxies, planets and stars of our universe were created.
As you can see, our sun is but one small star in a galaxy such as this.
Now, a galaxy consists of not only the stars that we talked about, but also great swirling masses of dust and gas out of which the stars were formed and to which they ultimately return. But now, let's go back to the collapsed stars or the neutron stars, quasars or black holes as we continue with this series, you'll learn many things about these various stars...
Hi.
- Hello.
I'm Dr. J. R. Vance from NASA.
Oh, I'm so glad you're here,
Doctor. I'm Jenny Langer.
Nice to meet you. I have an appointment with your father.
Oh, no, no, he passed away in 1952.
Oh, I'm so sorry, then the appointment must be with your husband.
- Not married.
- I'm not sorry.
- Ha.
Uh, then it's probably with your brother.
No, my brother's an interior decorator in Oshkosh.
You see, Dr. Vance, I'm afraid your appointment is with me.
I'm Dr. Jenny Langer.
Oh?
- And we have some very important business to discuss.
Yes, we do.
Ever been here before?
- No, but it's beautiful, the trees, the green foliage.
- Mm-hmm.
You know, I'm very fond of plants.
Oh?
- You know what we have at NASA?
- No, what?
Green tile and chrome.
- Ha ha ha.
You don't look the type.
Well, Doctor, you want to clue me in?
I'd certainly like to. You see, it was after the lecture last night, Mr. Vance, that I,
I suddenly discovered there were many peculiar things happening.
Yeah, like the gamma ray shower,
- Uh-huh.
The aurora and the barometer dropping like Wall Street.
Exactly and that's when I made those urgent calls to NASA.
Frankly speaking, I'm very concerned.
Well, frankly speaking,
Doctor, so is the
United States Government.
I'm still measuring an x-ray shower from the ground level at a magnitude never before measured on earth except in nuclear explosions.
Well, Doctor, it could be an abortive strike from a... unfriendly power.
Oh, come on! You don't think a missile landed here.
Well, that's one possibility, yes.
It could have been a falling object like a meteorite, not a missile.
Doctor, a meteorite would have made a tremendous explosion.
- Uh-huh.
Well, maybe it was an explosion.
Hello, Doctor.
- Anything new?
Nothing.
- Uh, Mary, this is Mr. Vance from NASA, Mary Johnson.
- Hello, Mary.
Doctor, your water's, uh, boiling.
Mary must have forgotten it.
Would you like some tea?
Tea? Heh, that's not my brand.
Oh, here are the reports from last night.
Now, let's see what happens today.
Mm-hmm.
- And over here.
Oh... look at this.
- Wow!
Radiation level's still high.
- Um-hmm.
Whatever landed hasn't gone away.
You know, Doctor, I think I will have that tea.
Ha ha, okay.
I told you there was nothin' out here. See, there's nothin'.
Yeah. So, why are you carrying your, your gun?
Aw, shut up!
My father always said tryin' to teach you to run a farm was like tryin' to teach an ox to use a typewriter.
Ever since you've been runnin' the place, everything's gone wrong.
Umph, I...
Now, watch.
See.
I just don't understand it.
Those radiation levels are far too lethal.
Anyone anywhere near the initial impact point would be in great danger.
What would be the safest way to find the exact point of impact?
Maybe we could use a helicopter.
No, no, be too dangerous.
- But...
Doctor, we have already lost one airplane crew.
I didn't know that.
Well, back to the tea.
- Back to the tea.
There's another one.
I can't tell what kinda critter coulda done that.
Eight dead cows and a calf.
You realize what this is gonna cost us?
It ain't gonna cost us nothin'.
Nine dead animals ain't gonna cost us nothin'?
You're so dumb, you wouldn't know rabbit turds from Rice Krispies.
I'll butcher up the meat like I always do and I'll sell it to Dutch's Cafe.
You don't even know what killed those cows.
There might be somethin' horrible wrong with the meat.
Well, that's Dutch's lookout, not mine.
I've never seen so much fouled up data in my life.
It's against every known law of physics.
Well, we've tried to brainstorm it.
And it just won't brainstorm.
- Right.
What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.
Doctor.
- Hmm?
Do you have a Geiger counter?
- Yeah, in the other office.
Good, let's see if your local sheriff will support us.
Sheriff Jones, ha ha ha, our jolly red giant?
I know just where he is.
Let's go.
You're going to love him.
You know he believes in Velikovsky's Theory, that the moon came out of the
Pacific Ocean.
So do I.
Hey, there's another one.
That's thirteen head, Dutch isn't gonna want that much meat.
So, I'll freeze some of it up and then sell it to him later.
Hey, look at this.
I've never seen a rock like that around here.
There's another one.
It's really weird.
Wow, look at that.
I told you something landed here last night.
Wonder what they are?
You know you can't tell from the outside.
We better bust one open.
And good morning to you all.
(in unison) Morning.
Hey, Helga, you're lookin' bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.
You must've had some kind of a heavy date last night, huh?
You better believe it.
- One of the loggers?
That's my secret.
- Ha ha ha...
Well, Dutch, you got that limburger cheese smile on your face again this morning.
Have trouble last night?
Yeah.
- One of the loggers?
What does that mean?
- I don't know,
I've got trouble myself. Seemed like everyone was calling up with some cockamamie little thing, a car wouldn't start, the radio wouldn't work. And the preacher man, he kept everybody awake last night.
When does that gospel monger go on?
I don't know, but I'll tell ya, he may work for God, but he sure hollers like the devil. Ha ha ha...
Helga, ha ha ha.
Breakfast is ready.
- Oh, well, thank you.
Ooh, prunes. Ha ha.
Nope, it's not gonna work.
Go get me a hammer.
Not that one, the big one.
And a chisel.
Oh.
Git it yourself.
You never were any good with a tool.
Hey, look!
It split.
They look like diamonds.
I don know.
May not be hard enough to be a diamond.
Don't hit it, no, no! Diamonds are supposed to cut glass.
That's right.
Look at that!
- Damn!
Hello.
Oh, hi, Dr. Langer.
How are you this morning?
- Fine.
Won't you join me, please?
- Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
This your brother from Oshkosh?
No, this is Dr. Vance from NASA.
Hello, Sheriff.
- NASA, the National Aeronautics
Space Administration?
That Nassau?
- Um, yes, but it's NASA,
Houston, Texas.
- Sheriff, we have to talk to you about last night's disturbances.
Say no more, I'll get that preacher man to tone it down tonight.
- No, no, I don't mean that disturbance.
- Oh, no?
Pardon me, Doctor.
One of our local spiders, ha ha ha.
Uh, hey, what's that gizmo?
Uh, it's a Geiger counter.
A Geiger counter! We don't have any geigers around here, never did have in these parts.
- Uh, no, Sheriff, you misunderstand me. See, Dr.
Geiger invented this to count the nuclear...
- Oh, Vance, Vance,
I have a feeling the Sheriff's putting you on.
I'm sure he's taken physics.
- Oh, I used to take physics, but now I find that prunes do the better job for me.
We'll be rich to heaven, ha ha ha. We're gonna be rich.
What do you mean "we?"
This farm is mine and everything that's on it is mine.
You know, nobody ever found diamonds around here before.
Bet think they came out of that weird fireball thing last night.
I'll take these into cousin
Billy at the rock shop.
He can tell me just exactly what they're worth.
But don't, don't you tell cousin
Billy where you found 'em.
That'll be our secret.
Oh, don't look at me like that, Dan.
You and are going to be rich.
Hey, listen, I never meant any of those nasty things
I used to say to you,
I was, I was just teasing.
Honest. Everything can be wonderful again, just like it was before the baby died.
Knock it off, Ev. We don't even know if the diamonds are real.
Hi, Dr, Langer. Morning,
Sheriff.
Morning.
- Hello, dear.
May I join you?
- Please.
Thank you.
- This is Dave Perkins, his father runs the local newspaper.
Hello, Dave, nice to see you.
- Nice to meet you.
Dr. Vance from NASA.
Nassau,huh?
- NASA, Houston.
Oh. What brings you here?
Anything I can publish in the paper?
- Oh, well...
That's classified.
Well, I'll put it in the classified section.
Ha ha ha. Well, that's safe enough, nobody reads your ads anyway.
Ha ha ha...
Oh, Dave, uh, could I speak to you for a moment?
Sure, Dr. Vance. Excuse us.
Excuse us for a moment.
Is he always that serious?
- Well, he has something to be serious about at this time.
You know, I wonder if what happened to Terry and I last night had something to do with what you're talking about?
What?
- What happened to you and Terry?
- Well, we were parked by the junkyard, the lights went... they went dead, the radio wouldn't work and the engine wouldn't start.
A wind came up and started...
I don't know, everything just went wrong.
You're hittin' the booze again, huh?
Leave me alone, I feel terrible.
This place is full of spiders.
Yeah, I know, little pink ones.
- No, no, big, big, black, hairy ones with furry legs
- Aha. Lay off the booze, Ev, and they'll go away.
Hello, Sheriff's Office.
Oh, yes, Mrs. Cooper.
How are you?
Missing?
When'd you see him last?
You haven't seen him since last night?
Well, I'll be glad to... drive out and take a look for him.
What color is his motorcycle?
Come on, dear, please stop worrying. I'm sure he'll turn up safe and sound.
Yes, I'll get in touch with you.
Right, bye.
What's the matter with you?
You look like you could use a drink.
I found another body.
Another cow?
- No, a human body.
A Person?
But it was chewed up worse than them cattle.
We have to call the Sheriff.
Are you out of your mind?
Now, I buried that body and I hid the motorcycle.
No one will ever know.
You hid it?
- We can't let that sheriff come nosin' around here. What if he finds the diamonds?
And... and all that grass we're growing.
Well, you sound like you've been smokin' the stuff yourself.
Ew, oh!
And every creeping thing, that creepeth upon the earth, shall be an abomination.
Only the pure of heart shall be spared.
Oh, it's you.
- I told you I could come again tonight.
- How'd you swing it, honey?
Well, I told the lush that I had to come in and see my cousin about some hot rocks.
- Ha ha ha...
Oh, oh!
Hey, you forgot something.
No, I, I got it on.
- Your hot rocks.
Oh, thank you.
I always give you a big tip.
Oh, thank you, darling.
Ah, cousin Dan.
- Cousin Billy.
What brings you to town?
Hey, how's that hot little tomato you're raisin' out there, huh? Yeah, Terry's way overripe for pickin', you know?
- Oh, Terry's turnin' bad,
I can't control her anymore.
Oh well, she needs a gentle hand, like mine.
Never mind about that now.
Here, I got somethin' I want to show you. Wha-what is that?
That, that's a geode... that's not from around here.
You must've found that down south some place, huh?
Uh, take a look at these.
Just how good are these diamonds here?
Now, just between you and me...
- Yeah, yeah.
Ha ha ha...
Sorry. They're... industrial quality... yeah.
And the carbon content isn't nearly as high as a... a real diamond... a ring-type diamond.
Come on, how, how much are they worth?
Well, let's just say if you had a bucket full of these, a barrel full of these, yeah, you might be rich.
Where'd you find these?
Let's, uh, just say they, uh, fell outta the sky.
Ha ha...
What's going on now?
Those satellite reports you asked Paul Rider to send.
Great.
Here.
Huh, latitude 45 degrees, 21 minutes west.
Correction, north.
Longitude 88 degrees, 42 minutes west. That's more than a couple of square miles.
- I know, yeah.
Can't we pinpoint it closer than that?
Not from Telcom. I'm afraid you're going to have to use a helicopter.
- Okay.
Get Paul Rider, please.
Oh, Where the hell is Ev?
I don't know.
Damn, Ev is messy. Doesn't even clean.
Look at this here, cobwebs all over everywhere.
Whole goddamn house is filthy dirty.
Yeah well, Ev never was known for her cleanliness.
Least my room is nice and tidy.
Maybe I should of married you instead of her.
I was eleven years old.
Well, you're, uh, not any eleven now.
Yeah, now I'm 35-24-35.
Ah, listen Terry, uh, I could, uh, do things for you, if you know what I mean.
You never did anything for Ev, except drive her to drink.
Why don't you face it, you're just a big, fat failure.
Not anymore.
- Bull.
So, that, uh, rich Perkins punk, has he ever given you a diamond?
- You know he hasn't.
This diamond... is yours, if you treat me... nice.
You think you're gonna fool me with that phony rhinestone?
That is real enough. All you have to do is ask cousin Billy at the rock shop.
Where would you get a real diamond?
Oh, I... dug it up somewhere.
Hello.
Hi, Sheriff.
- Hi, Terry. ls Dan to home?
Dan.
Hi, Dan.
I'm checking out a missing person's report, cause
Mrs. Cooper asked me to find her husband and his motorcycle.
Now, she says he goes by here a lot and he's been missing for a day and a half. Have you seen a motorcycle around here?
Nope.
Terry, you and Dave seen or heard a motorcycle?
Uh-uh.
How about Ev?
- Drunk as a skunk.
Where is she?
- I don't know... and I don't care.
Well, if either of you two see or remember anything, give me a jingle, will ya?
Ha ha ha... Boy, that chopper makes nearly as much noise as that preacher man. Ha ha ha.
I've located a radioactive source, extremely high intensity
Can you pinpoint it?
- I'm over Bundy Road and Copper Place.
That's near the Kester place.
What does it look like?
- The whole pasture down there is distorted. Do you read me?
It's like I'm looking through on the bottom of a pop bottle.
I mean it's blurred and twisted.
Get a picture of it.
- Uh, get a picture of it and rush it to the lab, huh?
- Okay, will do.
It fits.
Space warp all right.
This must be the only energy photogram of it's kind.
Well, what's a space warp?
Well, Dave, a space warp is a gravitational pull, so intense, that it makes a black hole in space.
There's only one thing I know of that could cause a warp like this.
- A miniature black hole.
Uh huh.
- Could it happen?
Well, with a billion black holes in our galaxy, it's a wonder it hasn't happened before.
Well, Dr. Vance, Dr. Langer,
I've got to be going. Thank you.
Bye, Dave.
Well, everything fits.
Einstein's general theory of relativity.
- Mm hmm.
If a dead star collapsed all it's masses, the star would gradually shrink to a point and... disappear into another universe.
- Right, a parallel universe with a door back and forth.
- That sucks everything up.
And throws everything out.
This may be our problem. Where is this, uh-uh, Kester farm?
Oh, it's, uh, it's somewhere in the Harrison Hills area, right in here.
If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, then they had swallowed us up quick.
Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah! (in unison)
Can I get off early tonight?
- Not before 9:00. Why?
I have an aunt coming in from Barbasota.
Well, it's the same aunt as last night.
Tell her she left a hickey on your neck.
Hey, Dutch, what're we going to do about those damn spiders?
I'm going to try to get the preacher to exorcise them.
They're getting enough exercise already.
Oh, boy.
Hi, Terry.
- What are you doing here?
Where's, uh, cousin Dan?
- He's not here and neither is Ev.
- Pickup truck's still outside.
Well, maybe, but they're both gone.
Oh, well, that's all right,
I guess. You can probably help me out, hmm?
- Yeah and, uh, maybe, you can, uh, help me.
Is this a real diamond?
Naw, it's a fake. Ah, I'll give you five bucks for it.
I can always sell it to some dumb tourist.
I don't believe you.
You didn't even look at it.
Ok... I'll give ya... $20, hmm?
And only because you're my cousin.
You're Dan's cousin. You're no relation of mine.
Then we can, uh, have relations, hmm?
Billy, cut it out.
- Well, if we're not blood kin, then let's be, uh, kissing cousins, huh?
Billy, why don't you do what
I just did?
Yeah?
- Go home and take a cold shower
Uh, $40.
Did you hear the news?
Billy Kester's car just blew up.
He's dead?
- Yeah, he sure is, deader than a doornail. You know
Dave, a lot of strange things are happening around here.
- Yeah, I know, Dutch.
Can I use your phone?
Sure, use my private one in back.
Thanks, Dutch.
- Okay.
This should be the area, Vance.
I don't see anything.
No count here.
Well, there has to be something.
- Well, it's a normal count.
Nothing dangerous.
The Kester phone is dead.
Listen, I think I'm going to go on out there.
Okay.
- Bye.
Bob, Carl, Jack, Peter, listen!
Vance, what was that?
I didn't hear anything.
That sounded like a high-powered rifle.
This isn't hunting season.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Oh... oh!
Oh, God!
Hurry, Vance.
It's all right.
Here, Doctor.
- Thank you.
Yeah, well, all hell's broken loose. It's going to be hard to keep the lid on now.
- Yeah, we know all about it,
Sheriff. May I have another one, please?
Yeah, sure. My stomach is doing flip-flops.
We just brought back what was left of Joe Cooper.
Uh, Sheriff, if your stomach can handle it... we've got a 50 foot spider out there on the loose.
Fifty foot spider!
- Fifty feet.
You mean that's what got
Joe Cooper?
Looks like our black hole has turned into an open doorway from hell.
And we're gonna have to find a way to close it.
God knows how many monsters may come through.
And how many have already come through.
Doctor, please... what are these gizmos. I found them near the corpse.
You found them where?
- Near the corpse.
Uh, Sheriff, do you mind if we take these and, uh, run some tests of them.
- No, please do.
Oh, thank you. Do you have a flare gun we could use?
Yes, you can pick one up at the desk sergeant. He's got a couple of flares out there.
- Thank you.
Thank you, Sheriff.
- Right.
We'll keep in touch.
- Thank you.
Hello.
Yes, this is the sheriff.
Oh, Davey, I... didn't recognize your voice. What is it?
Is Terry all right?
Well, have Doc Oliphant check her, will you?
And keep me filled in on everything, please.
Thanks, Davey.
Fifty foot spider?!
Vance, I'm sorry to take so long, but the lab said it will a full two hours to get a report on these.
The only thing they said was they'd never seen anything like them.
Could sure crack 'em open.
We don't have time for that.
First things first.
We've gotta find someway to get out there and kill that monster.
- Oh, how you gonna kill a monster like this, an alien energy pattern?
We haven't even found even found the impact area of the black hole.
- Mm hmm, and that's undoubtedly where the spider's coming from.
- Right. The energy pattern has to feed off of the gravitational field of the black hole.
Vance, could we soak up the energy?
We could feed it so much extra mass we could choke it.
We can shower it with neutrons.
Neutron initiator.
It just might work.
What's up?
- I want you to fly me a Caltech Neutron Initiator right away.
Well, that's a pretty stiff order.
And I mean right away, buddy!
I think there's one in Madison.
- Tell them to load it with a six hundred gram charge and set the pattern at 360 degrees.
My chopper will pick it up at the airport.
All right.
- If it doesn't work, then, old buddy, we got company for dinner.
Three hours. Good-bye.
Well, it sounds like just the ticket.
Um, tell me, how does one of those gizmos work?
Yeah, sure.
Um, all right. Thanks, Vance.
I don't have to tell ya, you know what happened to the Kesters. Now, the spider's nest is somewhere on the Kester's ranch. We all have guns. When we leave here, we're gonna pick up all the relatives, friends, neighbors, anybody we can find.
And we're going to go out to the
Kester's farm and we're going to destroy that spider!
So, come on, let's go.
Hey. Hey, fellas, wait a minute.
Fellas, get around me.
Now, like I said inside, I want each of you to go in different directions and I want you to get your friends, relatives, anybody you can.
Dutch, what's goin' on?
All right, everybody just hold it. Listen to me.
Listen, Dutch, you're a troublemaker. I'm trying to tell you to knock it off.
Now, everybody go home.
We're not going to get it like this. Just knock it off!
Aw, you knock it off.
All right, let's go. Come on.
Let's go! Get in.
What's goin' on here?
Get outta here, go on home.
All right, everybody just... everybody just...
Hello. Yeah, this is the sheriff.
What?
In Gleason.
Are you sure they're headed this way?
Okay!
Hello, operator, give me the National Guard
Headquarters in Madison.
All right, now that we found it, now that we found it, once you seal off the hole, what's going to happen to the spiders?
- That's their energy pattern.
That's their lifeline and once we seal that off, they're gone.
But, what if the initiator doesn't work? There's going to be an army of those spiders crawling around, growing and multiplying.
Well, Jenny, it's already happening.
Vance!
Come here.
Lord knows how many of those things are around here.
Just take it easy.
Oh, look at this stuff.
Ugh! Agh! Oh!
What's the matter, what'd you do?
Ooooh!
- Oh, my God!
God, another one.
- Let's get out of here.
Let's get back to the jeep.
- Yes!
How will I ever...
Patch me through to the Sheriff.
Hello.
Yeah, Vance.
The spiders are all over at Gleason, just a few miles away.
Yes, I've called for the
National Guard, but the mobs are beginning to gather and they're getting out of hand.
Look, get somebody out here,
I just found another body or what's left of one.
And for God's sake, keep that mob away from here!
All right, you know why we're all here, you're gonna know we're gonna destroy that spider!
And you've all got your guns, they're all loaded.
Right, right.
- Now, no women!
No, no!
- Boo!
Come on now, Dutch, I want ya to get out of here, all of you.
I got a man from NASA and he knows what he's doing.
Gleason's a disaster area.
The same thing'll happen to this town. We'll handle it ourselves.
Come on!
The town got hit by the monster.
The crowd's getting out of hand,
I can't control 'em.
They're hellbent on destroying that beast.
Vance, did you ever see the movie "Jaws?"
Well, it makes that shark look like a goldfish.
I know, I know. But, try to keep them there as long as you can.
We're setting up the lights around here and the bomb's on it's way. And try to keep the spider there.
We can't do anything with the spider. Bullets don't hurt it.
The only thing I've got to stop it here with is a traffic light.
Sheriff, at least try.
This is the sheriff, get on the emergency unit.
I'm down here all by myself.
Call the National Guard back, tell them we need some heavy equipment, guns, ammo, anything.
And by one sign, you can know that the end of the world is near, Luke Chapter 21, Verse 10 and 11.
Nations shall rise up against nations and kingdom against kingdom.
And great earthquakes shall be in diverse places and famines and pestilences.
And fearful sights and great signs shall there be from Heaven
The spider is retreating, heading out of town.
We've got a lot of people hurt here.
Clear the street, the spider's gone, spider's gone.
Get out of here.
You know that, that big one is like mother queen bee.
Yes, and she's activated all the spiders in this whole area.
Yeah, you think the smaller ones will grow to be giants?
Well, it could be, unless that neutron gadget works.
I wish that chopper'd get here.
Here comes somebody now.
Now what?
Vance!
- Clyde.
That big one, I just saw it up on the highway.
It's cuttin' through the woods and it's headin' this direction.
There goes the chopper now.
Can you patch me through?
- Sure, Vance, this way.
Caine, this is Vance. Caine this is Vance. Use your spotlight as a target and drop the gadget.
Want me to land and give you the trigger?
Hell, no! Now look, I'm gonna fire a flare and you pull the trigger.
- Okay.
Follow us, come on.
Jenny,
- Yes
I forgot the flares.
They're in the briefcase, would you get 'em?
I'll get them.
We've got company.
We've gotta keep her outta that black hole til we make the drop.
Okay, I'm gonna try.
- Good boy.
Ahhh! Ohhh! Oh!
Jenny, hurry with the flare gun, they're coming back.
Ooh!
Get back, you...
Believe it, it's as big as a house.
Vance! Vance!
- What happened?
Spiders came out of the briefcase. They're coming from the geodes.
- The what?
Geodes!
- Gimme this, come on.
Get over there and take cover.
All right.
Hey, come on. Everyone of you get out of there.
Hurry up, come on.
Get down!
Is it sealed? Is it sealed?
- Yeah, it's sealed.
Oh, God. This is... can it happen again?
I don't know.
Oh!
- I don't know.
When pharaoh refused the children of Israel their right to exist, the heavens opened up and deluged the land with flies, frogs, lice and locusts.
It happened before and it will happen again.
Yes, Mowgli grew up in this jungle.
Cobwebs and moontalk, you may say.
How could a little boy survive?
It couldn't have been easy.
Born of man, raised by animals, he grew up with a wolf pack...
...and learned the meaning of every rustle in the grass, every change in the wind.
There were many tongues in the jungle, and Mowgli had mastered them all.
So, keep silent, and I will tell you a great tale.
A tale as old as the jungle.
You see,
Mowgli had his share of adventures.
Two large monkeys had been sent to kidnap Mowgli.
For it was only he who could teach them the ways of man.
Grey Wolf was his brother.
Bagheera, the black panther, showed him how to hunt.
And Baloo, the bear, was his best friend and teacher.
Baloo told Mowgli that the monkey people were outcasts in the jungle.
"Liars and cheats, " he said.
"They have no law and are not to be trusted. "
It was the start of another hot day, and Mowgli was about ten summers old.
He and his brother, Grey Wolf, were hungry.
The two friends left the cave that had been Mowgli's home...
...for as long as he could remember.
Like good hunters, they set off on a trail under the watchful eyes of Akela...
...the pack leader.
The panther had often warned Mowgli not to stray too far on his own.
For in the jungle, a hunter can quickly become the hunted.
Of all the beasts in the jungle, Shere Kahn, the tiger, was the most ferocious.
He and Mowgli were old enemies...
...for it was Shere Kahn who had killed Mowgli's father.
And the tiger longed for the day when he would kill the man-cub, as well.
I wish they'd get these fans working.
It's so dreadfully hot.
-This is India, darling.
-Where are we now?
In some goodness-knows-what jungle with a probably unpronounceable name.
Seonee.
I say, old chap, do you think we'II find good sport round here?
We're Iooking for adventure. You a hunter?
I Iook Iike a born fool to you, sir?
-No.
-Well, then.
What business is it exactly that brings you to these parts?
I collect things.
Doesn't much matter what as Iong as I get paid.
But sporting, sir, is for an amateur.
It's a waste of a man's time.
And hunting?
Well, that's just the waste of an animal.
Molly, perhaps we could organise a tiger shoot.
That would be awfully daring.
But isn't the jungle teeming with dangerous animals?
Come on, Emily!
You'II be sitting on top of an elephant's head.
There are your man-eaters out there.
Just remember, a tiger hunt can go both ways.
If I may be expressing, Sahib, it is man that is more dangerous than the tiger!
I am pleased to be introducing to you my friend, Timo. Timo?
For your amusement! Timo?
While you are kindly contributing to this bowl, here.
No, shoo, shoo!
Take the filthy Iittle beast off the food!
No! He is not filthy!
I am picking off his fleas every day.
That's disgusting!
Take this wild thing off the table immediately.
Timo is not violent. Timo.
He is a trained monkey.
Watch.
He's taking all the food!
What a scallywag!
Oh, my goodness!
-What the devil is it?
-There's a boy on the tracks!
-Boy?
-I'm afraid we have crushed him!
PIease! Everybody stay on the train.
PIease, get back. PIease.
There he is! I see him! He's alive.
-He sounds Iike a dog.
-The boy's insane.
I don't think so. I do believe he's wild.
Boy, go on, shoo!
You're holding up the train!
It's all right. Stand back.
Stay calm. No sudden moves.
My name's Harrison.
I work for Mr. P.T. Barnum.
I know how to handle this.
AII right, some of you, that way.
Gently, gently.
Some of you, that way.
Get ready to grab him.
AII right, boy. It's okay.
We're not going to hurt you.
We just want to have a Iook at you.
Just want you to come out.
Grab him! He's gone! Quick!
We've got him! Got it! FIip him!
I said hold on there!
Stop! Take him to the baggage car!
CIear the way!
-Get back into your carriages.
-AII right. Up here! Up here!
We have it under control, sir!
Release the boy to the district commissioner.
-Thank you.
-Take him to the baggage car!
-The poor child. Be careful, Henry!
-Don't be silly, Emily.
Hey, there!
He's up!
Where did he come from?
There's nothing for miles around.
There have been rumours, Mem-sahib, of a violent boy Iiving in the jungle.
Soon Mowgli was to learn about things from beyond his jungle world.
For his friends had arrived too late to save him...
...from those mysterious apes that are called men.
Chap needs a thorough scrub.
-We can hose him down at the fort.
-Let's tie him up.
Okay.
After you.
AII right, chaps.
This should be easy as punch.
AII right! Everything's under control!
He's off! He's gone!
-I can handle him.
-PIease calm down! Everything is all right!
-Mr. Harrison, are you all right?
-He's helping the boy escape! Timo!
Oh, no. Timo! Come back!
You are quite beautiful.
Perhaps we'II dance again.
-Molly!
-Emily!
-Harrison!
-Boys.
Timo! The boy has stolen my monkey!
Be careful, old chap.
Timo!
Get back here!
Look here, Harrison!
Get down from there, you bloody fool!
Harrison. I told you. The boy's insane!
Get down!
This simply isn't the done thing.
We'II report you to the authorities.
Come on, old boy.
You'II get yourself killed!
Timo! Timo, come back!
You naughty monkey!
-You come down. Have a cup of tea.
-Yes, Iet's talk about it sensibly!
Timo, please come back, Timo!
Kid's a regular jungle-jimmy!
I'm greatly forlorn, Sahib.
Timo's never been alone in the jungle!
Help!
My goodness! I thought I was a goner.
Timo, come back! Where are you going?
Timo! PIease don't follow the boy!
It can only Iead to trouble!
The jungle is full of dangerous things, monkey-eating dangerous things!
Sahib, I must warn you, this is not a civilised place.
It's a goldarn English colony, isn't it?
-Where are you going, Sahib?
-I need a hotel room. And a jungle guide.
You haven't got a chance in hell of catching that wild boy.
-Not a chance.
-I'II take that bet.
Good Iuck, Mr. Harrison.
-Where can I find this jungle guide?
-Buldeo, Sahib.
This Buldeo knows his way around the jungle?
No. But he is a rich man. He will help you.
So, this Mr. Barnum that you represent...
...you think he would want this wild boy for the circus?
You bet he will, sir.
Mr. Barnum's a showman.
"The Jungle Boy"!
It is a fine plantation you have here,
Mr. Buldeo.
Thank you.
Will you have some tea, Mr. Harrison?
Thank you, sir. Yes, I will.
You know, my brother Iost his wife in childbirth.
Then he was tragically killed by a tiger.
His only son, Mowgli, was Iost in the jungle.
Never recovered.
We presume taken by the tiger.
You know, Mr. Harrison, that jungle boy could be my nephew.
And all this rightfully his?
Mr. Buldeo, this boy...
...he could be the discovery of the decade.
He'd be famous.
And you, as his only Iiving relative, you'd be as famous as he would.
Of course, we'd have to find him first.
I know a tracker.
Nothing can escape Kaa once she has found her prey.
She will coil around the body.
With each twist, she will tighten her grip.
With each wrapping, each coiling in a bone-crunching hug...
-...she will crush the Iife from the boy.
-As Iong as it does what you say.
Mr. Buldeo!
This is Mr. Harrison.
Thought I was getting a tracker, not a snake charmer.
What do you take me for, Mr. Harrison?
A circus side-show?
This boy moves through the jungle as fast as a monkey.
I am a professional tracker!
He is the best in India.
Do you have something with the scent of this jungle boy on it?
A shirt? A sock? Anything?
No.
Hell with it.
I'II take you to where we Iast saw him.
The train and its chattering people who stared and taunted...
...shouted and pointed all at once, caused Mowgli to wonder.
If he learned their talk, would he be as silly and dumb?
Coming across this abandoned campsite brought back memories of his past.
There's a tiger loose in the camp!
Get my rifle!
Mowgli!
Harrison, Sahib!
Well, I'II be darned.
Thanking my Iucky stars.
Returning to his lair was a very different homecoming.
Mowgli no longer looked and talked like a wolf.
Confused and angry, his family looked upon him like an outsider.
A man-cub.
Mowgli had broken the law, the law of the jungle.
He had brought back an outcast...
...a cousin to the dirty, shameless Bandar-log.
But the monkey had helped him.
Mowgli did not understand why they could not be friends.
Timo?
Mowgli was no longer part of the wolf family.
Sad and alone, he went in search of his lost friend, Timo.
Good old Baloo decided to go with him.
Timo!
Timo!
It is done! Kaa owns his scent.
Sooner or Iater, some breeze will bring his spoor to her.
He belongs to her now. He cannot escape.
-Who cannot escape? My Timo?
-The jungle boy, you fool!
Jungle boy?
Come on, Chuchundra. Bring those bags!
Come this way.
Wait for me! Wait!
-What absolute nonsense!
-No nonsensical matter, Sahib.
Now, you're telling us there's a Iost city in the jungle ruled by apes?
Overrun by them. Yes.
They were exiled from the trees and are now Iiving in chaos.
There are rumours that they are holding a crazed, old soldier captive.
Quickly! The boy is nearby.
Mowgli had travelled far from home...
...and his heart was sad, for the monkey people had captured his friend.
It's amazing what secrets Iie behind these green walls.
What was that?
Sounded Iike cannon fire.
Impossible. Thunder.
A distant storm, maybe.
So this strange city was where the monkey people lived.
A city abandoned many years ago by man.
Mowgli sensed that his friend was somewhere within its walls.
Listen!
Monkeys.
Many monkeys, Sahib.
The Bandar-Iog.
The jungle boy!
Jungle boy.
You're not going to get my wolf boy.
-Let me do it. I'm a crack shot.
-Better than me? You'd better be.
I'm not very fond of monkeys.
You're not to be shooting the monkeys, Sahib!
He's coming our way.
AII right, follow me. And keep Iow.
Quick! The snake!
I don't believe this.
Just watch.
"Keep peace with the jungle law,"
Baloo had told Mowgli, time and again.
And now look what Mowgli had got his friend into.
-The boy's going to sleep.
-Good.
Don't Iet the snake crush him!
I think we've got him!
Quick! Spread the net!
Come on, now. Let's go!
-Pull it!
-Spread it out! Pull tight!
-That's good. Come on!
-There he is!
Careful with the boy!
He knows where my monkey is!
Now, Mr. Harrison...
...do you believe my python is no circus side-show?
Just do it.
He's the spitting image of my brother.
I'II teach the brat the proper respect for his uncle!
AII right, all right!
We're here to capture the boy, not kill him.
We have to sedate the boy.
He's going to hurt himself.
Whisky, Sahib.
Not for you! The boy!
Okay. Here you go, kid. Drink it up!
We should have thrown him in the stream first.
You don't think he's diseased, do you?
I wouldn't worry about it.
He Iooks healthy enough to me.
A Iittle worse for the wear, scrambling through the jungle Iike he does.
Look, the monocle!
Oh, no!
My Timo has been through some calamity.
What's this? CIaw marks.
Tiger, Sahib.
It Iooks Iike the boy has a natural enemy.
He won't have any enemies where I'm taking him.
I wonder how he survived out here.
If I may be adding, to be so strong the boy surely must be eating raw meat.
How could he have hunted on his own?
Maybe he didn't.
Imagine this raw flesh-eating beast in my house.
This isn't coming off till we get back to America.
Not in the entire history of circus arts...
...has there ever been an act quite Iike this one.
Will people pay to be bitten?
It's all right, kid.
Take it easy now. It's all right.
We're going to take care of you.
We're going to take care of you, kid.
You're going to be in the circus.
Imagine this:
You take the Ieap off the high trapeze.
A thrilling fall. 100 feet.
Straight into a pool of water.
You hear the screams of the spectators...
...and then the crowd grows still as you clamber into the Iion's pen.
Lion's pen.
No. You don't speak.
You're the wolf boy. You understand?
You make animal noises.
That's good.
We'II teach you how to speak Iater.
Much Iater.
You are going to tame him and make him a fine American gentlemen?
Can he be taught?
I don't know.
To tame a tiger and have him walk by your side is a fine thing indeed, but....
But what?
You will have a fine pet for the circus, Sahib.
But a poor tiger for the jungle.
Watch your python, Karait!
Like you, your snake has no Ioyalties?
Just remember. If we find your monkey, it is Kaa's great delicacy.
What was that?
Tiger!
Tiger!
That doesn't sound good.
Sounds Iike a bear.
Oh, no!
No, Mr. Tiger!
Karait, you sneaky snake!
Help the boy. He's tied up!
Sahib!
Harrison, Sahib!
-What happened?
-Tiger, Sahib, tiger!
Where's the boy?
The boy was chasing the tiger, Sahib!
What do you mean,
"the boy was chasing the tiger"?
No, Sahib!
It is much safer to be staying in here!
No, no, please!
They went that way! That way!
No one ever believed that you would be alive.
Make it alone in the jungle.
Impossible, they all said.
Do you think after all these years...
...you can appear and reclaim your inheritance?
So, Mowgli? Say goodbye to your uncle.
Buldeo! We've Iost the boy.
The boy's escaped.
It's okay!
I have him!
That is capital news.
You're saved. For the moment.
We've been most unprofessional about this.
I need this boy safe.
Let's get him back to camp and in that cage.
-It's for your own good, boy.
-He's right. You'II be safe in there.
We'd all be safe in there.
I see you slithering over to the American side.
Have you forgotten your snake has a job to do?
If you Iet me down...
...I will drag you out of your hole and shoot you.
Shut up!
I would not be wishing anybody to be Iocked in that cage.
I'm on fire!
Chuchundra, what in tarnation?
Now get that big, fat, grimy thing off of me!
There's a bear out there!
The boy! The boy!
Let's get him!
Where's my wolf boy?
-Karait!
-Chuchundra, get off my rifle!
You're not supposed to do that.
You're supposed to guard the boy.
Look out!
That should put your fire out!
After him, after him!
He's headed toward the ruined city!
We have to save our Iittle nephew!
PIease, Iet's go.
Timo?
Timo?
At Iast. You are here.
Don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid, young fella.
I see you found your Iittle friend?
Nuts! And papayas! Those two nitwits.
They brought him to me instead of you.
I can't get them to do anything.
They won't Iisten to their king no more.
Now I am forgetting my manners.
Bring some food for my guest.
Fire! Cannons!
That's the only thing that controls you Iot.
Now, go get us some food.
Hey, where are you? Hello?
Listen. Help me down.
I tell you, it's exasperating dealing with this Iot.
Now, you Iisten here, young fellow, my Iad.
When you are prince, no, when you become king...
...your subjects must fear you.
Fear breeds respect, you see.
It's probably the queen's messenger.
There is a bear at the door.
He's probably come to fix the roof.
It's been Ieaking all summer.
Any more pestering from you...
...and you shall be hibernating in a dungeon for the winter!
Back!
Now, young fellow, me Iad.
AII of this could be yours.
Palaces! Parades!
Banquets!
AII the other monkeys, they're out feeding, but they'II be back soon.
Nuts and papayas!
I am too old for this.
I'm past my prime.
What they need is a new king and that's going to be you.
I worked my way up from the ranks until I reached my rightful position.
King! King!
I know I have so much to teach you, young fella.
AII the power and the glory...
...that comes with royalty is within these walls.
As I said, what they need is a new king.
And that's you. They need to be Ied.
Charge! Rule!
Rule!
He's getting away!
If you fail, I'II strip you of your rank!
I'II feed you to the crocodiles!
I'II scramble your brains!
AII right, Iet's get this guy.
We need your snake to catch the boy. Move.
-I know the boy's in here somewhere.
-I'm sure I can hear my Timo.
We should split up. Split up. Do your job.
Sahib?
Monkey, shoo, shoo!
Mowgli?
Come out.
Uncle Buldeo's here.
-I'II wear your sarong, Iittle rat.
-Who are you?
Come fair or foul?
Are you the queen's messenger?
What brings you into my presence unannounced?
-Who are you?
-I am King Murphy.
You probably think I am a deserter!
You think I'm a renegade, don't you?
I know your mission!
Call them off.
I said, call them off.
Mowgli!
Boy, stay still. Stay perfectly still.
Don't move a muscle.
I found the boy!
AII right, here we go.
AII right, now.
Take the rope.
You got your Iittle friend.
Now, come on up.
Come on. Up the rope.
No, not the blasted monkey!
Mowgli, take the rope. Up.
Come on, kid!
Hey, my hat!
Thank you. Come on, boy.
Here you go. Come on.
Here we go! Come on.
Need some help, Harrison?
Hey, watch out for the cobras.
The poison takes hold after about five minutes.
Then you die.
Oh, Harrison.
You're a bad, bad, bad....
You don't know how bad!
I'II kill you!
You're still alive?
I can't wait all day.
Say hello to your mother and father, please.
Watch out!
I'II be a monkey's uncle!
These animals are co-operating with each other.
Oh, my precious.
You! Be still.
The cobra senses your movement.
I thought the wolves wanted my Kaa.
But it's you they want rescued.
Yes. Good.
Yes.
AII right, boy, come on!
Come on!
We almost Iost you there, boy.
Listen, you don't belong in the circus, son.
I know that now.
Come with me, Mowgli.
I'II give you a home.
-Have you seen my Timo?
-Timo?
Timo! My Iittle Timo!
I've been dreaming the most horrible adventures.
Naughty Iittle monkey!
We won't be needing this.
Timo?
Thank you, Sahib.
Don't you mention it.
This is no place for Kaa.
So many monkeys and beasts could tear my precious to pieces.
He's a mighty strange fella, isn't he?
My friend...
...I think it would be appropriate to honour our young prince with a cannon salute.
Go on.
Jungle boy, now I'II get you!
I'm alive!
Monkey! Shoo, shoo!
It can't get worse than this.
Shere Kahn! No, no, no!
Watch out! Help!
It's not easy to tame the jungle!
Young fellow, me Iad,
I suspect you're Ieaving.
Why don't you stay here now?
AII the power and the glory that comes to royalty...
...can be found within these walls.
Oh, well, I suppose I must go it alone.
One day, you'II find your own purpose...
...young wild boy.
Ta-ta.
Ta-ta.
And so Mowgli chose to run with the wolves.
For he knew his strength was with the pack.
So listen carefully to the jungle call...
...and good rest to all that keep the jungle law.
He belongs here, Sahib.
Goodbye, Mowgli.

- Hello, I'm at Ludlow, the whole town's destroyed.
Everybody's gone!
You gotta do something!
You won't believe this!
Send help, lot's of help, quick!
Alright, lady. Just follow the arrows.
Any chance of getting through?
- Nope.
- What happened?
- Look, lady, just stick to it, will you please?
- Tell them to take that detail out of there.
The old man is sending a replacement.
-Alright.
- I'm sorry, soldier, I should have explained.
I'm Audrey Aimes, National Wire Service.
- Yes, ma'am.
- How do I get there?
- Sorry, my orders are to let no one through.
- That surely doesn't include the press.
-I'm sorry, ma'am.
No one is what the old man said.
-Was it very bad?
Many get hurt?
- Look, lady, you're not gonna fish any information out of me.
Now, why don't you go back on the main road?
 it's about a mile south.
- I'll take the camera, ma'am.
- Oh!
No pictures allowed.
Look, you have no right to do that.
-Sorry, ma'am.
- I'd like to see your commanding officer, please.
Where could I find him?
- You'll find him in Paxton.
He headquarters there.
I'll leave your camera at the roadblock.
-Until further notice,
all traffic will continue to be
rooted around the Ludlow area
according to special orders.
- Good morning.
- I'd like to see your commanding officer, please.
-Oh, I'm sorry, but the Colonel's busy.
Perhaps Capt. Barton can help you.
- Send her in.
- OK...
- This will cover the whole situation you asked for, sir.
-Thanks, Lieutenant.
Sit down, please.
Are you the Audrey
Aimes that covered
Korea for that picture magazine?
-That's right.
- I read the book you wrote after the war.
Liked it very much.
- Well, thank you.
-You're with National Wire Service now?
- I was on my way to Chennault field to do a picture story on a new jet plane they're unavailing, and...
I ran into a roadblock.
- So?
- Well, captain, there was a town beyond that roadblock.
A town that isn't there anymore.
- Until we find out exactly what happened, we'd like to avoid publicity.
- Do you have any idea of what happened?
-I'm sorry, miss.
- Captain, you can't suppress a story like this.
- We're not trying to, Ms.
Aimes, but until we have more facts... if... would you give us your word not to release the story until we give the go ahead?
-You have my word.
- Some time during the night, the town of Ludlow was completely demolished.
The town's population, about
150 people, vanished.
- Vanished?
- No bodies, nothing.
-Well, there must be some trace.
- I know it's hard to believe, Ms. Aimes, but a special detail's gone through the wreckage for two solid hours and couldn't find a thing.
- Was it an explosion?
- We don't know.
- A hundred and fifty people just don't vanish into thin air.
- We're still trying to find out what happened.
If you'd like to sit in.
- Yes, thank you, I would.
- Dave, what time did you leave Ludlow last night?
-Roughly at night after eleven o'clock.
- My son-in-law was watching television news at 10:30, so I sat down and watched that.
And my daughter wanted me to sit there and talk about it.
And then I got to thinking that I had to get up early.
So I took off.
- Did you notice anything strange or unusual about the house or about the way the family acted?
-No. Same as always.
- When you were driving out of town, nothing out of the way in the street, the building or the sky?
No unusual light, some sound or movement?
- Well, I heard something that sounded like thunder.
And about midnight a plane went over it.
-Alright, Dave.
I can call you again if I need you?
- Oh, yeah, sure.
-Edna?
Is that the telephone company's official transcript?
- I put through the last call to Ludlow at 11:59 PM.
- And when did you first notice anything wrong with the Ludlow connection?
-4:45 this morning.
I phoned the company lines' men to go out there right away.
- So, the telephone lines could have gone down anywhere between
Alright, Edna, thanks.
You've been very helpful.
-Oh, Colonel Sturgeon,
Ms. Aimes, National Wire Service.
- How do you do?
- Audrey Aimes,
I've read a lot of your stuff, seen a lot of your photographs.
Yes?
- Set to go, sir, whenever you're ready.
-I'll be right there.
I hope you understand our problem, our need to keep this quiet.
-Yes, the Captain's briefed me.
- If anyone wants me, I can be reached in Ludlow by radio.
- Yes, sir.
- How's chances of me going along?
-Not this trip. Maybe later.
In any case, not until we know what's out there.
- Oh, by the way, Colonel, my camera was taken from me at the road block by one of your men.
-I'll give orders to have it released.
- Oh, there has to be a logical explanation for this.
A town of 150 people just doesn't disappear.
-This one did.
-Chicago mobile service operator.
I'd like to place a person-to-person call, please, to Mr.
Norman Taggart,
Editor-in-chief of National Wire Service.
The number is Murray Hill 44836.
- In what city, please?
- New York.
- Aud, you wind up that jet plane story already?
- I'm not on the jet story.
Norm, listen, I'm on to something I think can be real big.
-Uh-huh.
Where?
Oh.
Brother...
Huh?
What do you mean we can't print it?
- I've given my word to hold off for a while.
Now, listen, Norm.
A plane flew over Ludlow last night about midnight.
Just about the time the lid blew out.
Check on it. And... check Washington.
See if they had an atomic installation
 in the Ludlow area.
-Okay.
- Call me back as soon as you have anything, alright?
Goodbye.
- Sorry, miss, you can't... oh, it's you again.
-I know I can't.
But I'd like to have my camera back, please.
Col. Sturgeon said he was going to speak to somebody.
-Hey Corporal!
Mathias!
She wants her camera back.
-Hello, Norm?
What's the score?
-Wrong track, baby.
The airlines confirmed a commercial liner over Ludlow at
And there are no atomic installations, secret or otherwise, within 75 miles of Ludlow.
-Well, it was a possibility.
- The only people who've been playing around with the radioactive materials in your vicinity is the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.
-Department of Agriculture?
- Yeah, they've got an experimental project just outside Paxton.
- U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Illinois Experimental Station.
OK, I've got that.
I'll... I'll keep in touch.
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE
ILLINOIS EXPERIMENTAL STATION
Excuse me.
I beg your pardon.
I beg your pardon!
Oh!
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.
I... I spoke to him, but I guess he didn't hear me.
-Oh, he's a deaf mute.
Working with radiation can be dangerous.
An accident last year caused him his speech and his hearing.
-Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm looking for the project director.
- I am the project director.
My name is Ed Wainwright.
What can I do for you?
Oh, excuse me a minute.
-I'm sorry, Frank.
Nothing to worry about.
Just a slight catastrophe.
- Do you have these catastrophes very often?
-All the time.
It's hard to keep these little things from getting in.
These are snails.
Last summer it was caterpillars.
And after that it was grasshoppers by the droves, and, just last week it was beetles.
Now, what can I do for ya?
- Oh, Mr. Wainwright,
I'm Audrey Aimes,
I'm with the National
Wire Service.
I suppose you heard what happened at Ludlow.
-Yes.
- I'm trying to find out what was responsible, and it occurred to me that radiation of some sort might have caused the destruction out there.
-No, I don't think so. Here.
We're the only people around here using radioactive materials.
An isotope is nonexplosive.
So, I'm afraid your answer isn't here.
-Oh, I see.
Now, tell me, is this thing really a strawberry?
-Yes.
And these are tomatoes.
This, we hope, is the future of the American farmer.
And, for that matter, all farmers everywhere.
- Can you eat them?
- No, not yet.
But we hope to develop one day a hybrid that can be eaten.
- How is it there hasn't been any publicity on this?
- Oh, there have been a few stories in farm journals, but to the laws, to the public, these giants are just freaks of nature.
No practical value.
-Well, how do they get so big?
- Well, radiation causes photosynthesis, that is the... the growing process to continue night and day,
Radio isotopes act as a... sort of artificial sun, a sun that never sets.
- That's fascinating. But, tell me, what's he doing?
- Well, that's plant food.
Essential minerals.
Keeps the plants from burning themselves out.
They have to be fed constantly.
Actually, the fruit would grow much larger if we didn't limit the stimulation.
Maybe you'd like to do a story on us.
I'd be glad to tell you more about the work.
- Thank you very much. I'd be very interested, but, well, right now I'm working on this Ludlow story.
Thanks again.
- Right.
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Colonel!
- You here?
- Well, he wouldn't let me inside, so...
-Colonel!
Springfield is on the line.
-Colonel, you just got back from Ludlow.
You said after you got back, I could go.
- I said maybe.
Well, how about it?
Tomorrow it will be open to the press.
- Oh, Colonel, be fair.
I've played ball with you.
You'll give me the jump on the other reporters that will be in here.
At the least let me take some pictures at Ludlow.
I promise I won't put on the wire until tomorrow.
-Well, I guess you rate that.
For effort, anyway.
Capitain, take Miss Aimes to Ludlow.
And I hope you have a strong stomach.
- We're gonna take some pictures in Ludlow.
If... uh... we're not back in fifteen minutes, better come in after us.
-Yes, sir. Let 'em through.
-I've got enough.
Some people use calendars to tell age.
I could use ruins to count mine.
I was twenty-five when I went through soul left after Brussels.
I was 20 when I took my camera into
Cologne and Berlin after World War II.
-Must be used to it by now.
- Captain, there are some things you never get used to.
- How about a drink to wipe away some memories?
Good way to get rid of the jitters.
I know a little place...
- How do 150 people vanish into thin air?
- Well, around this part of the country things seem to have a way of vanishing.
Only a couple of months ago it was a warehouse.
Kind of fell apart overnight, just like Ludlow.
-Hello, Frank.
- Hi! Did you decide to come back and do a story on us?
- Oh, no. As a matter of fact,
I came back for some help.
I'd like you to do me a favor.
-Anything I can.
- Remember the warehouse that was destroyed about three months ago?
- Uh-huh.
- I want you to take me to see it.
-Oh, I, uh...
I'd like to, but I've got too much work on my hands right now.
How about tomorrow?
- Three months ago a warehouse was destroyed.
And the one person it vanished.
This morning, Ludlow was destroyed.
All the people in it vanished.
Don't you see a possible tie-up?
- It's possible, I suppose.
What do you want me to do?
- Just ride out there with me and take a look at it.
- I don't understand how good it will do.
The authorities investigated it thoroughly.
- The sheriff thinks in terms of crime and publicity.
You're a scientist.
You think in terms of cause and effect.
Maybe you will see something that the sheriff missed.
-That shouldn't be too difficult.
Still, I... I don't know.
-What's he saying?
- He says that... that your lips are easy to read, that your theory makes you a very bright girl in his book and that he'd like to go along with us.
-Good.
- When you barge into peoples' lives and drag them off to places they don't really want to go, aren't you... sort of in danger of becoming unpopular?
-That's an occupational hazard.
-How do you pick such an occupation?
-I think it sort of picked me.
I guess I was just born inquisitive.
Ever since I can remember I've wanted to know the why and where for just about everything I saw.
I inherited my knack with the camera from dad.
My curiosity supplied the nose for news and the camera supplied the memory.
So there you have it.
What about you?
Have you always been interested in science?
- Oh, I guess I have always been, one way or another.
I used to fool around with radios and anything electrical when I was a kid.
I was a radar officer during the war and then I got into this when I got out.
Ah, yes, I remember now, that every time I read one of your articles
it was dateline from some are of flood or famine or war...
Made me realize what a sheltered life we scientists really lead.
-Sheltered?
Look what happened to Frank.
- Looks to me as some force had to push these walls out from the inside.
-You think it was an explosion?
-No. it couldn't have been.
Any explosion big enough to destroy this warehouse
would certainly be heard at Ludlow.
-What was it they kept stored here?
-Wheat. Almost a million bushels.
-That's a lot of wheat.
- It was a surplus to keep the market from being oversupplied.
- Does it strike you as a little strange that out of all that wheat there's not a grain left anywhere?
- No, that's nature's way, Audrey. Birds probably cleaned up the leavings.
I see what you mean, Frank.
- What is it, Ed?
-You see how barren this ground is?
- I don't know. I've seen horses leave it like this.
- No, this is deeper than the horses go and much more thorough.
Pratically down to the roots. The horses pick and choose, they leave patches.
- Hmm...
- But this is completely barren.
Well, leave it to Old Frank. He'll make a botanist out of me yet.
- You're head of a government lab and you need lessons in botany?
- Well, I try to teach him what
I can about my field of study and he tries to teach me what he can about his.
- Aren't you a botanist?
- No, no, I'm an entomologist.
The study of insects.
- Well, then how come you're working with plants?
- Well, the... the existence and development of plants and insects are very closely related.
They're highly dependent on one another.
As a plain matter of fact one couldn't live without the other.
And that's what I can't understand.
Ground like this is usually teeming with insects.
This area is completely devoid of it.
- I think I'd like to get some shots of this.
I'm going back to the car for my camera.
-Alright.
Here, let me help you.
-What was that?
-I don't know.
-Oh, my god!
No, Frank's gone. You can't save him.
-Get in the car!
- The Geiger counter showed no radioactivity to speak of, sir.
Only background. There's got to be an explanation somewhere.
- I got your explanation for you, Tom.
- Ed!
-Now, listen.
You've known me ever since I came to Paxton. You know I'm not given to hysteria, and you've got to listen to me with an open mind.
- Take it easy, Ed.
- Locusts.
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about giant locusts.
Giant locusts are responsible for all of this.
Are you nuts?
No evidence of any explosion, Colonel.
Gullies look more like they're reeled with a battering ram.
We found these guns at the scene.
The kind people keep in their homes.
They've been fired.
-Okay. Lieutenant!
- Now, listen, Tom. These are eight feet tall, some are even bigger.
They're vicious, merciless killers.
- Now, Ed...
Lieutenant!
Lieutenant, phone Springfield again.
Tell him I'm still waiting for those specialists.
- Yes, sir.
- Frank Johnson is dead.
He was killed not half an hour ago.
- It was horrible.
- Obviously you are both under a strain...
- Won't you listen?
You've got to get more soldiers out there before more people are killed.
-Miss Aimes!
The governor asked me to exercise discretion when dealing with you.
Please don't make it any harder for me than it is.
-You have to believe us!
Listen, you've seen the giant plants out at the lab.
- Are you trying to tell me you breed these things?
-In a sense I did, yes.
Some locust must have gotten into the lab and they ate some of the plants or some of the radioactive plant food.
Well, their cell division accelerated immediately.
That is, they started to grow abnormally fast.
Well, they had to have a constant food supply to sustain this growth.
So, a couple of months ago, they wandered into the grain elevator outside of town.
When they grew to this giant size, they pushed their way out.
- Or we'll just push the building down.
- Yes!
Each one of them has the strength of ten men.
There are probably two or three hundred of them.
- So, last night not satisfied of eating grain, they came to Ludlow?
-Yes.
Even if I went for your story about the size, it would be hard to believe that it attacked people.
Sargent!
That report come in from the chemists?
- No, not yet, sir.
- Why won't you listen?
- I am listening.
- We saw Frank Johnson
Killed by a giant locust.
- Sure, and there have been reliable people who've also seen flying saucers and weird little men from Mars.
- I'll take another look at that town out there.
Or have you found the answer?
- Lieutenant?
- Yes sir?
- I'm taking the detail out for a look around.
You're to keep radio contact.
I want ten men.
Get 'em on the truck.
- Yes, sir.
-Alright, Ed, you can show me the exact spot where you saw... well, whatever it was you saw.
- No...
- Well, after all, let's see this grasshopper.
- Alright.
- Alright, grasshopper, he is allright.
- Man, we're gonna dig up some crazy grasshoppers.
- Why didn't they give us nets instead of rifles?
- Alright, I can't do much without them.
-Alright, men, clear out!
-Here's the spot, Tom.
-Where's the body?
-There isn't any body.
Just like Ludlow.
-Alright, men, into the woods.
Hey, Frank!
Maybe we could train one of these giant locusts to pull a plow, huh?
Struck?
- Yeah?
- I don't like this thing.
- Ah, take it easy.
- You know, grasshoppers are good eating,
-Yeah, Mustard and ketchup.
No, no kidding. I had once on Mexico.
- Well, you better watch your step.
The lava will get even.
They must have seen something.
Mr Wainwright assing it.
Stay up to see things right.
- Well, these days they blame atom for everything.
Bad health, bad crops, bad weather...
Now it's grasshoppers.
- They couldn't have just dreamed up this guy Frank being knocked off.
-Ah!
-Oh!
-Oh, my God!
-Get back in the truck!
-And every available man.
Also get some air support. We'll pummel out of that forest!
- What are you gonna do?
- Go in there and wive out every last one.
- They'll slaughter you.
- Not this time.
I want light artillery brought up with company eight.
-You don't have enough men.
- There will be three regiments out there tomorrow by 0300.
- You don't understand; you still don't have enough men.
- Not enough men for a couple hundred locusts?
- There are more than a couple hundred.
- But you said before...
- That was before I heard them screech.
The noise they made convinces me there are more.
-How many are there?
- I don't know. There could be countless numbers.
I think you better call in a regular army, Tom.
- What would I get off for a regular army to handle some oversized grasshoppers?
Why, they'd sectionate me right out of the service.
- Lieutenant, take charge of the east sector.
- Yes sir.
- You're making a mistake, Tom.
I'm afraid he doesn't understand how serious this is.
- After all, he knows what the military is capable of.
- Well, that's just it.
He has faith in regimental fire power because he's seen it work.
But he's never come up against an enemy like this before.
-Now, you've done all you can.
-No, no I haven't.
In a way I feel responsible, Audrey.
The country is in deadly danger if these locusts break out in the forest.
-What are you gonna do?
- I'm going to Washington. Maybe the army people will listen to me.
- I'll go with you. Maybe I can help.
I saw them, too.
-Alright.
I've got to convince them, Audrey.
We may be witnessing the beginning of an era that will mean the complete annihilation of man.
-Annihilation?
-Annihilation.
The beginning of the end.
-This, gentlemen, is the enemy.
This locust, more commonly known as the grasshopper, is almost identical to the giant locust of Ludlow except for its size and the fact that the giant's wings failed to develop. They cannot fly.
The Locust is intelligent.
It's strong.
Locusts follow a leader.
Like the bee and the ant they are able to communicate with each other.
This communication or call is produced by the hind legs.
This is the 1956
Australian locust plague.
Covered an area of 400 square miles.
We've been plagued by locusts since biblical times.
We've tried various forms of combating them.
As a matter of fact, in our own country, the early settlers of the
Massachusetts Bay Colony armed themselves with bundles of brush and drove millions of locusts into the sea.
Now, today, despite the fact that we've developed powerful insecticides, the locust still inflicts damages to the tune of $25,000,000 in the
United States alone.
California...
Colorado, Texas.
Even this small locust will attack a man.
It has two powerful jaws with a very sharp teeth,
It will kill other insects and devour them.
If no other insects are available, it becomes a cannibal.
Turning on its own kind.
Now, you've seen what a locust can do in its normal size, smaller than your thumb.
Imagine if you will, a locust that's grown bigger than a man, and is continuing to grow. x de 1956 than others, but each one a deadly killer.
I hope you realize we haven't much time.
- You are a scientist, Mr. Wainwright.
You know what locusts can do.
I'm a soldier. I know what guns can do.
I feel secure the Illinois National
Guard can handle this situation.
Did you want to say something, General Hanson?
-No, sir.
- I was greatly impressed with your presentation, Wainwright.
I'm sure all of us were.
Thank you very much for coming.
- I'm afraid my presentation didn't impress you quite enough, General.
-I don't understand you.
- I mean that when the locusts start to move out of that forest, I'm not sure that you'll be able to stop them.
- What are you suggesting we do,
Mr. Wainwright?
- Get them with everything you've got. Now!
You need more men, a lot more men.
You need tanks and heavy artillery...
- As of now, the full strength of the Illinois National Guard is in alarm, surrounding the
Ludlow Illinois Forests.
As I said before, Mr. Wainwright, you are a scientist.
Why not leave the fighting to the military?
-Urgent call from Paxton, Illinois, sir.
-General Short here.
Yes.
Yes, I see.
Thank you.
Matt will fly to Paxton with Mr. Wainwright.
He'll take charge of operations.
Mr. Wainwright?
I owe you an apology.
The locusts have broken through our defense lines.
Thousands of pastures.
Our troops are reorganizing to prevent
Paxton itself from being overrun.
- The hill position in the suburbs of Paxton must be held.
Otherwise, the 100 miles between
Paxton and Chicago will lie open.
-General? We can't land in Paxton, sir.
-Why not?
-It just came over the radio, sir.
Giant locusts have overrun Paxton at 1400.
- Head for Chicago.
- Yes, sir.
- Captain, I want these positions held and I want them all held at all costs if humanly possible.
- Captain, have your map people immediately turn out two overlays.
Showing the Chicago defense lines as tendered reset.
Yes?
General Hanson, Army H.Q. Chicago Ill.
GIANT LOCUST MOVING NORTH.
ILLINOIS TOWNS OF PEORIA,
PONTIAC, AND JULIET DESTROYED.
DEFEND CHICAGO AT ALL COSTS.
GEN. JOHN T. SHORT, CHIEF OF STAFF,
U.S. ARMED FORCES, WASHINGTON D..C.
Major Everett
- What about squadron 12?
- They haven't reported yet, General.
- Well, then let me know once you hear.
- Yes, sir.
I'll be with you in a moment.
Hale.
You'll proceed at once to temporary GHQ of central sector and assume command.
Norm.
You will order the 81st army division to proceed without delay to Chicago. Have the CG report to me upon arrival.
Request the Defense Department to alert the following divisions, Dave.
First armory, Deportia.
The first airborne.
The 92nd, and the 76th.
Now, what's your problem?
- Food. At the rate refugees are pouring into Chicago, General, our emergency stocks won't last long.
- Thyroxine is one we haven't tried.
- How good is it?
- Almost as powerful as Chlorine.
- Alright. Ship 2,000 gallons out to the base.
-Excuse me.
Hello?
He's speaking.
-Squadron 12 just reported.
They say they came down in a day.
And pratically drowned the enemy in insecticide.
The Chlordane didn't even slow them down.
You'll have to come up with something stronger.
-I'll do my best, General.
Goodbye.
The stuff's no good. Forget it.
-Looks pretty bad, doesn't it?
-I thought you went back to New York.
-Well, the big story's here.
- Look, your editor called you back because it was too dangerous.
-I wanted to be here.
-Nothing we've done so far, insecticides, fire bombs, nothing has done any good, in so little time.
-Well, you're doing everything you can.
- Well, everybody is, but it's not good enough.
The time will come when the beasts will inherit the earth.
- No, there's no sign of the locust yet, General.
Out.
- and with a lark of five divisions to the west and south of Chicago.
General Hansen is confident that he can keep the menace at bay.
Units of the air force and marines are moving into position
to back up those forces already deployed by the army.
But the one advantage our forces hold over the enemy
is that they always reveal their intention to attack.
Before every attack, the locust sent forth this
warning in the form of a high pitched screech.
Now, this screech increases in intensity
until it reaches ear-shattering proportions.
And it's when this screech reaches its full intensity
that the locusts attack.
- You got every available men in line, major, and
I think there's no question at what it will do.
-Hold your fire, men!
Fire!
- They keep coming, General!
 They seem to be gathering in a formation.
They're hammering in a single point in our line.
They keep coming, general.
Inch by inch they're moving closer.
Still they come, wave after wave.
They're going through a breech in their line.
Turn around.
Repeat, turn around.
- We interrupt this program for an important announcement.
The giant locust have reached the
Chicago south side and nearby suburbs.
I repeat, the giant locust have reached the
Chicago south side and nearby suburbs.
Keep calm.
Take shelter in the basement.
Take shelter in the basement.
Do not panic!
Attention, please.
Attention, please.
Keep moving. Do not block the highway.
Push stowed cars off the road at once.
Keep all traffic moving.
Do not panic.
Do not panic.
- General.
- Ed, Miss Aimes, grab a chair and sit down.
I sent for you because of a new development that may be favorable to us.
The locusts have stopped their advance.
They're huddled in the alleys and buildings just outside the loop.
-The locust got cold.
When the temperature drops below
68 degrees, they just stop moving.
- Well, maybe now is the time we can move in and destroy them.
-Well, they aren't in hibernation, sir.
They'll move if they're provoked and they're as deadly as ever.
When the sun comes out tomorrow, they'll be active again.
-The air force is standing by with a B-52 loaded with an atom bomb.
- You can't drop an atom bomb on Chicago!
- Washington has given me authority to do just that.
As a last contingency.
If the bomb is dropped early tomorrow, there'll be no loss of life.
The city will be evacuated by then.
-But what about the property?
We'll get billion dollars of damage in a site that's too contaminated to build on.
-I realize that.
But if we don't drop the bomb,
Chicago will most certainly fall.
The bomber crew is alerted.
We'll drop at dawn.
If we don't come up with something by then,
I'll make a final check with Washington and relay their okay.
Isn't there a chance the... locust could die in the night?
Of the cold?
- No.
Not at this time of year.
It takes 24 hours of exposure at 14 degrees.
-Isn't there some way you could... drive them into the lake?
In Washington you said the settlers did that.
-Settlers?
-Hmm?
Oh. Oh, the early settlers in Massachusetts, they did literally drive them into the sea.
But they weren't dealing with giants.
Wait a minute.
We can't drive them.
Not drive.
We could attract them.
Attract.
If we could reproduce their call, General, it just might work.
It just might work.
-A call for insects?
-Have you ever been duck hunting, General?
- The duck call?
- Yes.
There's one for bees, too.
They use it in apiaries.
It might work.
-What do you need?
Well, let me see.
I need a... I need a oscil oscillator,
I need an audio tube, two audio amplifiers, the most powerful you can get. I need an oscilloscope,
I need some high frequency radio equipment.
And a boat.
A fast boat.
-Whatever you need, we'll get.
- Well, there's one thing
I have to get myself.
Something that will tell me when I've succeeded.
-What's that?
-A live, giant grasshopper.
- Now, they gotta be around here somewhere.
Alright, men, off the truck.
- Major, I'd suggest you send some of them that way and some down there and you and I try the alley.
-O.K. You four men go that way, you men that way.
-Let's go.
- Come on, men. We found one in here!
Come on!
It's lucky we got one of the smaller grasshoppers.
Not too close, major.
We put that cage up in a hurry,
We don't know how strong it is.
A month ago I was teaching my engineering class at the university.
It was safe and secure.
Look at me now.
You know, I'm 37 years old.
And all of a sudden I realized for the first time how much I've taken life for granted.
I guess that's something you can't take for granted, Major.
- Ed, how will you know when you've got the right sound?
- He will tell us.
- How?
- He'll react to it. And this polygraph will record his reactions.
-How long will it take?
-It's a matter of trial and error.
It could take ten minutes or ten hours.
-We don't have ten hours.
We're dropping that bob at dawn.
-How does this work?
- Attach these wires to the polygraph to the two copper strips at the base of the cage.
Now, the locust, like the other living thing has galvanic reflexes or electrical charges in direct ratio to its activity or emotional stimulation.
-I don't understand.
- Well, in other words, when we hit the correct sound or signal, the grasshopper will react to it and the polygraph will record the change.
Now, you notice how steady and regular the movement of the needle is now?
When we reproduce the grasshopper's call, the lines will become longer and highly irregular.
- It's like a lie detector test, isn't it?
- Uh-huh.
That is the first time a grasshopper ever got one.
Now, if you'll keep your eye on the needle for any unusual jumps or dips, we'll get to work.
- Wainwright, you've had your chance.
Now it's the air force's turn.
Operator.
Operator, this is a top priority call.
Get the general Wagner at the base.
-Look, general, the locusts outside will stay put until the temperature reaches 68 degrees.
That's about an hour and a half from now.
-Wagner.
Chicago has been evacuated.
Unless you receive instructions on the contrary by 0616, that is...
- That's 90 minutes from now.
You allow the B-52 crew to look at the bottom of the designated target.
Repeat the instructions back to me.
Correct.
There's no time to fool with that now.
Major, get detail of men to move that stuff.
And bring some extra grenades.
There's some in my staff car.
There's a new lab set up for you at my new HQ outside the city.
-I can't move now.
- Well, you can't stay here. Not with an atom bomb hanging over your head.
-I don't have any choice!
Look, up till now, we have been using a filtered signal and it hasn't worked.
But it's just possible that the hearing apparatus of the locust can detect harmonic frequencies above the human range.
Well, to test these frequencies,
I need every minute that's left.
If you'll just give me one man to replace Miss Aimes.
-I'm staying.
- Well, look, this is no time to be worrying about a big story.
-I'm not worried about a story.
- Will you please leave before it's too late?
-No.
- Major, you and a detail of two men will remain here with Mr. Wainwright.
I will station men at three observation posts.
One in the suburbs, one near the art institute, and one on top of the downtown hotel.
Also, a helicopter will spot from above.
There will be a getaway car parked downstairs at the main entrance.
I suggest you use it by... by 5:45 at the very latest.
If you are successful, contact me at once, so I can stop the bomb.
-Ed. Ed, look at this.
-I think you've got it!
-That's good, Audrey. We've got it!
-The cage is yielding.
Cover him up.
And get that thing out of here.
Emergency lab at Chicago to GHQ.
Emergency lab at Chicago GHQ.
Come in General, are you there?
Now, listen to me, Wainwright.
-We found it, General.
We've found the frequency.
- Good.
Now stand by.
I've got to stop that A-bomb.
I'll get right back to you.
Chicago GHQ to double B.
Chicago GHQ to double B.
Chicago GHQ to double B.
Over.
- This is double B.
Come in, Chicago GHQ.
Over.
- Hanson here.
Your mission is canceled.
Return to your base.
Repeat the the message.
Over.
-Mission canceled. Return to base. Over.
-Chicago GHQ to Emergency Lab.
-Right here.
-The show is yours, Wainwright.
- Alright. Get that equipment on the lake in a boat.
And I'll be your Pied Piper.
-I still don't understand.
Why didn't you put the oscillator in the boat in the first place to send out the call?
Why attract them here?
- Because we'd never get them all.
Here, look.
Here we are in Downtown
Chicago near the lake.
Now, the locusts have scattered all through the suburbs on the south side.
And we'll send out the call from here.
- Yes, but that's going to attract them to us, not into the water.
-Well, first of all, it's imperative that every last one of the locusts hear the call.
Now, in order to do that, we've got to get our amplifier speaker at the highest possible point to get the maximum range.
Now, we've got ours on the roof of this building, which is one of the tallest in Chicago.
Now, once we get them here...
-Well, I say then boat will take over.
-Exactly.
Once we have them at the heart of the loop near our location, they'll be within range of the amplifier on the boat.
I will then radio our oscillator signal out to the boat, and they in turn will rebroadcast it over their amplifier directing the locusts to them and... into the lake.
-We hope.
-We hope.
Now, will you check and see about the temperature?
-How can we be sure, sir?
-Hmm? What to you mean?
-How can you know that we'll get them all?
-Well, that's where our observation posts and the helicopter come in.
From air reports, we'll know the exact location of the locusts at all times.
And if it's working.
-It's 70 degrees out. they're probably starting to move.
-Emergency Lab to all
Observation Posts.
Emergency Lab to all
Observation Posts.
Report in. Over.
-Observation Post number Two to Emergency Lab. Over.
-What is your location? Over.
-I'm situated in a store across from the
Art Institute on Michigan Boulevard.
The street is empty.
Nothing in sight. Out.
-Observation Post number three to Emergency Lab.
I'm on the roof of the Drayton Hotel.
Don't see any grasshoppers in this area, but the south side is getting some action.
Out.
-Emergency Lab to Observation Post One.
Emergency Lab to Observation Post One.
You did not report in.
What's your location, Post One? Over.
-This is Observation Post number One.
I'm right in the middle of them.
I'm just south of 73rd and
South shore drive. Hot.
-Emergency Lab to Helicopter. Over.
-Helicopter to Emergency Lab.
The locusts are active in the south side of Chicago.
There's yet another in the downtown area. Out.
-Can you read me, Emergency Lab? Over.
-Yes, we can read you fine, General.
Are you all set? Over.
Oh, we're not quite ready, yet.
I think you'd better hold off a few more minutes.
Over.
-I think we'd better start now, General.
If they should change their direction and start moving away from Chicago, we may not get them all. Over.
-I don't like you starting until we're completely ready.
This boat has to draw them away from you at a split second's notice.
Over.
-I'd like to start, sir.
-Then go ahead.
-Sargent?
-Yes, sir?
Is that the wire that leads to the speaker on the roof?
-Yes, sir.
-Well, plug it into the amplifier, will you?
-Yes, sir!
-Post Number One to Emergency Lab. The locusts are leaving this section.
They're heading towards Chicago's Downtown.
-Helicopter to Emergency Lab.
The locust are moving on the downtown area.
-Observation Post Number
Three to Emergency Lab.
The locust are everywhere!
They're moving toward your location.
I repeat: The locusts are moving toward the Emergency Lab.
-They're everywhere!
-Emergency Lab to Boat,
Emergency Lab to Boat.
It's working, General, it's working.
-I heard the reports.
- Ah, Help! Help!
-Here they come!
They're coming down the street.
-Oh, they're climbing the building!
-Wainwright to boat, Wainwright to boat, come in, please, come in.
-Come in, Wainwright.
-How soon are you ready?
-We're ready as soon as we get clearance from observation posts.
Now, check them immediately.
Out.
Boat to helicopter.
-They're still going in, sir, but it will be a while before they all reach the downtown sector.
-Wainwright.
You'll have to hold out a bit longer.
All the locust haven't reached the downtown sector yet.
-Alright, we'll try.
-We can't hold out much longer!
-Boat to Observation Posts.
Report.
Go on.
-Post number One.
All clear, sir.
-Post number two. All clear, sir.
-Helicopter reporting.
All clear, sir.
-Whenever you're ready, general!
-Then let's have it.
-Okay, go ahead, Audrey.
-Throw the switch.
-Fire!
Helicopter to boat.
General, they're responding.
They're responding!
They're swarming toward the water.
They're climbing all over each other!
Going into the water!
-Head for shore.
THE END
